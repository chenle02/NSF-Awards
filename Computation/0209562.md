This work investigates the numerical and analytic solution of inverse spectral
problems in one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the appearance of an
eigenparameter in the boundary condition of a Sturm-Liouville problem causes a
loss of self-adjointness. Although uniqueness of the inverse problem has been
established, there are no constructive schemes available that lend themselves to
numerical computation. This work (with William Rundell) develops and analyzes
two constructive schemes involving to recover the potential in this type of
problem. In two dimensions, the eigenvalues of particular membranes are used to
find an approximation to a function representing the nonhomogeneity in the
boundary value problem governing the elastic membrane. Projection of the
boundary value problem and its coefficients onto appropriate vector spaces leads
to a matrix inverse problem, which is solved using optimization techniques. This
work will consider various domains and investigate the recovery of multiple
coefficients. Theoretical questions regarding circular domains will also be
investigated. In particular, the recovery of a radial density using techniques
from differential geometry and the properties of the radial spectrum of a
vibrating circular membrane will be investigated.

There are many situations in which it is not practical to measure an object's
properties directly. Doctors do not perform surgery to determine the size of a
brain tumor prior to a patient's treatment. An engineer does not dismantle an
airplane to determine the level of corrosion in its wing. Instead external
measurements of an object are made and used to determine the internal properties
of the object. This research focuses on the use of vibrational information to
determine physical parameters of an object. If these parameters are known, the
vibration is modeled mathematically by a boundary value problem. If the
parameters are not known, but the vibration is known, then the problem to be
solved is an inverse boundary value problem - also known as an inverse spectral
problem. This project develops several constructive algorithms for the solution
of this type of problem. It is important to realize that while mathematical
inverse problems often have multiple solutions, their physical counterpart may
not. Choosing the "correct" solution is also addressed in this work.
