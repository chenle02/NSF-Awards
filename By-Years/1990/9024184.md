This proposed research, a precursor to the SunRISE Program, plans to reduce and
analyze Mt. Wilson Observatory CaK spectroheliograms obtained on a daily basis
between 1915-1988. These images provide by far the longest reliable record of
solar photospheric faculae and chromospheric plages. The plan is to analyze the
behavior of these structures in active regions and in the network over the past
seven solar cycles, for information on the sun's magnetic fields and activity
levels that is complimentary to data obtained from the sunspot index, and from
other much shorter data bases such as solar magnetograms. The obtained results
should assist upper atmospheric physicists and climatologists in ongoing efforts
to improve prediction and dynamical understanding of solar activity cycles.
