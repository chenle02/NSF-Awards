This project will use two new and promising techniques to address the important
question of accumulation of organic matter in regions of the ocean where
traditional methods of calculating accumulation cannot be used. Those methods
depend on the presence of calcite, of which geochemical analyses can
simultaneously provide age control and inferred production and carbon flux to
the sediments. Regions with sporadic or absent calcite are among the most
productive in the world (high northern and southern latitudes, continental
margins), where the changes in accumulation are likely to have the greatest
effect upon global carbon budgets. If the proposed work is successful, it opens
the door to addressing questions of carbon accumulation in the present-
understudied parts of the world ocean.
