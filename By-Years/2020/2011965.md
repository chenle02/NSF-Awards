There is a strong need to develop the knowledge base that will enable rational
design of improved crop species. To attain this goal, researchers must learn how
plant cells integrate metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, and vesicle
trafficking during growth and in response to environmental challenges. The first
Plant Cell Biology International (PCBI) meeting capitalizes on the interaction
between two well-established plant cell biology communities across the Atlantic,
the Midwest Plant Cell Dynamics (PCD) and the European Network for Plant
Endomembrane Research (ENPER) groups and provides a framework to meet these
goals. The focus of this meeting is unique, and features workshops centered on
designing an image acquisition and processing pipeline for multi-scale analysis
of cellular systems and international collaborations. Keynote speakers for the
2020 meeting are recognized world experts in organelle dynamics and endomembrane
trafficking. All participants will network, have the opportunity to present
posters, and many early career scientists will have opportunities for oral
presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing core of plant cell
biologists who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of organelle
and cell dynamics, and share similar technical challenges to meet their research
goals. Itâ€™s important to find the most effective ways to employ combinations of
quantitative imaging techniques, biochemical techniques, and computational tools
to gain a mechanistic understanding of plant cellular systems. Meeting these
goals will require data sharing and the development and training of faculty,
post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art
quantitative cell biology methods. The first Plant Cell Biology International
(PCBI) meeting will 1) advance intellectual exchange and longer term
collaborations between US- and Europe-based laboratories, 2) enhance the
cultural understanding of next generation of innovators in both continents, 3)
provide the opportunity for plant cell biologist to discuss their latest
research, develop collaborations, and 4) promote the development of new tools
that will accelerate mechanistic analyses of cell
dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
