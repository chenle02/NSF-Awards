Dr. Arthur L. Utz of Tufts University is funded for his research on state-
resolved dynamics of gas-surface reactions by the Physical Chemistry Program of
the Chemistry Division. The gas-surface reaction dynamics of model reaction
systems will be studied to test theoretical predictions and establish
mechanistic insights into hetergeneous chemistry. Four specific areas will be
examined: (1) Vibrational mode specificity in gas-surface reactivity will be
examined because statistical models are inadequate. Molecular dissociation on
Ni(100) (e.g., of methane) will be examined to find mode-specific dissociation
probabliities in reagents and to establish predictively-useful trends. (2)
Orientation, reorientation and stereochemical effects will be studied by using
polarized laser light to anisotropically excite the reagent molecules. (3)
Trapping-mediated reaction channels for internally excited molecules will be
used to examine how internally excited molecules reactively encounter surfaces
in molecular beam reflectivity experiments. (4) Bond-selective chemistry will
focus on the examination of methane, trideutero-methane, and HOD dissociation on
Ni(100) and the influence of vibrational mode excitation on the reaction
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterogeneous chemistry has a tremendous economic
and technological impact in the chemical industry. The gas-surface reaction
studies at Tufts University will provide means for improving our understanding
of the mechanistic role of internal vibrations and internal energy on gas-
surface reactions. Such reactions are commonly encountered in bulk chemical
production, in pollution control devices, etc. Lasers will be used to
selectively excite such internal vibrations, and their utility in controlling
reaction chemistries will be extended.
