The electrical engineering curriculum at UMR is experiencing a major
restructuring that requires additional control system laboratory experiments.
For undergraduate EE students specializing in control, we need to provide a
well-rounded education in the theory and practice of control system design in
the areas of: 1. Workstation-based integrated control system design 2.
Manufacturing automation 3. Process control In addition, we need to provide
manufacturing automation courses for non-EE students and for EE students not
specializing in control. The current laboratory equipment is woefully inadequate
to meet these goals. The equipment requested in this proposal represents the
first step toward meeting these goals. The equipment laboratory experiments
supported by this equipment are scaled- down versions of the types of problems
our graduates encounter in industry. The innovative features of this proposal
are: 1. Introduction of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) concepts to
undergraduate control student. 2. Introduction of manufacturing automation in
the undergraduate curriculum. 3. Use of commercial process control equipment and
a scale process plant teach control.
