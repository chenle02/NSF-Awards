This RAPID proposal builds on prior work to re-design the frameworks for AP
science courses and proposes to capitalize on new sources of data that will be
available from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) September 2009-August 2010.
ETS is now piloting new assessments based on the re-design process. This project
tests the quality of the assessment development processes that have been set in
motion for creating new AP science exams. The new assessments follow a new
evidence centered design approach (ECD) that is characterized by the alignment
of the test items and tasks with the content domain models. The domain models
for each course include: (1) a cognitive model of science practices, (2) a
content outline, (3) achievement level descriptions, and (4) claims and evidence
statements. The research will test how faithfully an ECD process can be executed
with respect to the final phases of task and item
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will conduct a review of the item
specifications, review the draft biology and chemistry items, examine empirical
data from the pilot tests, conduct interviews with the ETS and College Board
staff members, and conduct cognitive laboratory protocols on the test items with
students.&lt;br/&gt;
