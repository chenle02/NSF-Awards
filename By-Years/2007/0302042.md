The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S. scientists and
engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Elizabeth
A. Hillard to work with Dr. Gerard Jaouen at L'Universite Pierre @ Marie Curie,
Laboratoire de Chimie Organometallique, in Paris, France. Support is provided by
the Math and Physical Sciences Directorate's Office of Multi-disciplinary
Activities.

This project will involve the chemical synthesis of new organometallic hormones
and the determination of their biochemical properties, such as relative binding
affinity and lipophilicity. This work should permit the elucidation of the
mechanism of action of this new family of molecules, and to distinguish between
antihormonal, cytotoxic, or combined antihormonal/cytotoxic effects, which have
never been observed for any previously known molecule and thus may open the way
towards a new family of therapeutic agents in the treatment of breast cancer.
