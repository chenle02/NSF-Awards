This Career Advancement Award will allow Dr. Wells to acquire new skills in the
analytical separations area of field flow fractionation. Field flow
fractionation is capable of resolving and characterizing a broad range of
macromolecular, colloidal, and particulate materials. This project focuses on
the separation of large molecules of environmental importance by these methods.
Field flow fractionation will be used to determine the molecular weight and
polydispersity of dissolved organic macromolecules and will be useful in studies
of the interactions between fractionated macromolecules and anthropogenic
environmental contaminants. This is of substantial environmental significance.
The objectives of this activity are to establish greater competence in the
theory and application of field flow fractionation. This technique will be used
in experiments aimed at understanding the chemistry of naturally-occurring
macromolecules such as humic and fulvic acids and their constituents.
Determinations of molecular weight and polydispersity, and semi-preparative
recovery of these macromolecules will be emphasized. %%% This Career Advancement
Award will support activities that will expand Dr. Wells' research career
potential. The award will provide for the acquisiton of new skills in areas that
will enrich her research activities. This activity will complement her previous
professional activities in government and industry.
