This goal of this project is to build research support capacity across the five-
state Northern Plains region (Dakotas, Nebraska, Montana, and Wyoming) by
bringing together research support professionals for an in-person convening
focused on enhancing the practices, processes, and workforce of the regionâ€™s
research enterprise. Like the project leadership team, project participants will
represent diverse roles and types of institutions of higher education, including
research-intensive, emerging research, primarily undergraduate, and tribal
colleges and universities. The institutions and research support personnel who
will participate in this project are committed to catalyzing regional
transformation to overcome the challenges of staff recruitment, heavy workloads,
and access to professional development opportunities. The Northern Plains
convening will create space for participants to develop a shared vision,
consider possible strategies to address common challenges, identify how
strengths can be emulated or shared, and will provide the opportunity to chart a
course for future collaboration that includes shifting mindsets away from
serving individual institutional needs to supporting the regional research
enterprise. The impact of the project will be realized through increased
cooperation and resource sharing that will foster connection and mentorship
between Northern Plains research support professionals. This will, in turn,
promote relationship building between institutions and faculty and increase
collaborative research activity across the region.
