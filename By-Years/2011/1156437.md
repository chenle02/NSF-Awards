Carthage College and the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) have partnered to
deliver hands-on astronomy programs to the public, train mentors and docents,
and provide experiential learning opportunities for undergraduate astronomy
students. The AMC operates trails, outreach centers, and high-mountain huts and
delivers experiences in nature and the environment. Through this project we will
add astronomy to AMC programming to provide a holistic, integrative picture of
the universe to the lay public. Engaging a large, diverse audience with
astronomy in a context combining geology, meteorology, biology, and
environmental science as part of AMC's ongoing, successful, and well-attended
programs, will significantly improve understanding of the science being
presented and drive home the close connections that exist between people and the
universe. This program is unique because it will be conducted by professional
astronomers, will reach large audiences, and will engage undergraduate students
as educators and mentors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will impact a large
target audience and better prepare a significant body of future scientists. The
AMC hosts over 500,000 visitors annually, over half of whom are lower-to-middle-
class in income, and approximately 20% are non-white. Special youth-oriented AMC
programs are conducted for an annual audience of more than 40,000. The proposed
projects will significantly impact the communications and outreach abilities of
Carthage physics and astronomy students, who are approximately 60% female and
are consistently placed in graduate programs or into technical positions.
