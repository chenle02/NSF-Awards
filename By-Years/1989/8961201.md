Electrically conducting polymers may be synthesized using photochemical rather
than chemical electrochemical means. A new process involves illumination of an
aqueous solution containing pyrrole and a electron acceptor with ultraviolet
light. Absorption of the light induces electron transfer from the pyrrole to the
electron acceptor, thereby promoting polymerization of the oxidized pyrrole
monomer. The resultant polymer is a highly conducting film which adheres
strongly to the substrate. The process is fast and simple and lends itself to
the deposition of conducting polymer films onto non-conducting substrates. It
may be useful in the manufacture of electrochromic displays, rechargeable
batteries, electrochemical sensors, and electromagnetic shielding.
Photopolymerization may have an advantage over current methods of conducting
polymer synthesis in being more suitable for industrial-scale manufacture. The
research will investigate synthesis by photopolymerization and characterize the
properties of photo-deposited conducting polymers with respect to their
conductivity, adherence to the substrate, and their stability.
