*** 9725478 McPhee This study is concerned with the analysis of an extensive
data set obtained by the principal investigator in the context of two
interdisciplinary field projects in the Weddell Sea: the Joint U.S.-Russian Ice
Camp in 1992 and Anzflux in 1994. The data set consists of direct measurements
of Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat fluxes in the uppermost 100 meters of
the ocean under a continuous sea ice cover, and was the first such observations
made in the Southern Ocean. The objective of the analysis is continued
development of a turbulence closure technique in the numerical modelling of the
upper ocean, and to describe the structure of boundary layer turbulence under
exceptionally wide ranges of surface stress and buoyancy flux. A frequent
criticism of current upper ocean models is that their representations of
turbulent exchange processes are arbitrarily adjusted to reproduce the few
available observed time series of upper ocean structure. This work will provide
the basis for a significantly improved modelling of upper ocean turbulence by
requiring the model algorithms to reproduce a wide range of turbulence
intensities, and will include a novel approach to specifying the eddy properties
of the upper ocean. These analyses, in conjunction with concurrent analyses of
other experiments carried out in the two field projects, will produce a
framework for quantifying the energy brought to the underside of the ice, and
will form the basis of a regional study of the processes responsible for the
relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin ice cover. It is believed that the
sea ice cover is only marginally stable in the face of the high upward heat
flux, and if this were interrupted, could lead to deep vertical convection and a
significant change in the ocean climate. ***
