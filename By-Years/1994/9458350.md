9458350 Geller This NYI award is to support Jonathan Geller's research on Marine
Biodiversity. His unique background combines traditional marine evolutionary
ecology with modern molecular biology. He will use both in his research on
sibling species (two or more species that cannot be or have not been
morphologically separated), and marine invertebrate neoextinction and the
effects of biological invasion on diversity. His training puts him at the
forefront of this emerging cross-disciplinary field, and the problems he is
addressing are important socially and scientifically. He started teaching in
graduate school, and has continued successfully ever since. His plans during the
NYI include undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching and directed research, in
which he will stress exposure to research methods and current literature.
