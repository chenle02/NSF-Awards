A REU site is renewed in electrical engineering. Undergraduate students are
selected from the host institution and schools where research activities are
limited. The student discusses a possible research project with a participating
faculty member prior to the onset of the program. The research project is chosen
to match the student's interest and educational level. At the end of the program
a written report and an oral seminar are required. Research areas include: (1)
microwave acoustic materials and devices, (2) robotics and computer vision, (3)
semiconductor material and device properties and measurements, (4) motion
control, (5) application specific computer architectures, and (6) environmental
microwave noise measurements. Students will also have access to facilities at
various nearby industries.
