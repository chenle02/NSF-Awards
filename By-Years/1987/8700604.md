The questions which are raised in this project represent three topics of
research interest: (1) The solution by parallel iterative algorithms of large
scale linear, singular and nonsingular, systems of linear equations. (2)
Characterizations of trajectories of linear differential systems which are
constrained to reach a cone, their application to control systems, and their
approximation by difference equations. (3) Perturbation of the Perron eigenvalue
and eigenvector of essentially nonegative matrices and their relationship to
generalized inverses of M-matrices. The linkage between these topics is that the
investigator's interest in them has evolved from his main line of research to
date which is iterative methods for solving linear equations. For example, an
important concept which underlies (2) is the comparative rate of growth of the
powers of a matrix on its different eigenspaces. With regard to (3), nonegative
matrices play an important role in the study of sufficient conditions for the
convergence of iterative techniques, as can be evidenced from some of the
problems posed in (1).
