In an attempt to address the paucity of young women going into technical
careers, this Model Project seeks to encourage enrollment and performance in
science and math for middle school girls; to improve the quality of instruction
in middle school science; and, by establishing a support network of students,
teachers and parents, to encourage girls to pursue technical careers. Half of
the participants will come from urban schools, while the other half will be from
rural ones. Classroom teachers from the students schools, as well as university
faculty, will work with the girls. They will be assisted by students who had
participated in previous institutional programs. There will be special resources
and assistance available to the teachers to enable them to enhance their own
classroom instruction. This project will build upon and significantly expand a
prior program. The Young Women s Technical Institute will be comprised of a
three week summer program combined with activities during the school year
involving students, teachers and parents . These include student research
project presentations, career discussions with professionals, special seminars
and field trips. Year round mentoring is planned. The New York State Framework
for Mathematics, Science and Technology will be utilized in the project s
curriculum planning. Activities will be in the areas of physics, chemistry,
mechanical and electrical engineering, astronomy, space science, geology, and
computer science. The approach will be to help students to understand the basic
science behind the projects with which they are having fun through a hands- on
learning experience.
