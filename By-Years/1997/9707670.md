Henning Meyer of the University of Georgia is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities to
investigate the structure and dynamics of van der Waals complexes using high
resolution near infrared spectroscopy in combination with counterpropagating
pulsed molecular beam scattering. The van der Waals complexes to be studied
contain an infrared chromophore and a monomer amenable to state-specific
multiphoton ionization. Thus vibrational excitation of the monomer can result in
predissociation of the complex, and by detecting the fragments, Meyer will
measure fundamental and overtone cluster bands with rotational resolution. From
these measurements, he will gain information on the fragment velocity and
angular momentum anisotropies as well as the state correlation, the dissociation
energy of the complex, and state-specific cross sections for the monomers.
Ultimately, from these experiments he will derive the multidimensional potential
energy surface. The PI will carry out a parallel theoretical effort: ab-initio
electronic structure calculations and quantum mechanical solutions to the bound
state and scattering problems. The interest in molecular clusters has been
motivated largely by the prospect of developing a more detailed understanding of
bulk matter through the access to direct quantum specific information on finite
sized cluster systems. Dimers are of particular importance as the first step
towards describing bulk material at a molecular level. Their structure and
dynamics can be described in terms of a multidimensional potential energy
surface which is crucial to a variety of very active research areas like the
molecular modeling of solvent effects and biomolecules. The concept of a
potential energy surface is also the basis for the theoretical description of
bimolecular reactions and vibrational energy transfer, and therefore it plays a
key role in the modeling of such diverse gas phase processes as combustion,
atmospheric warming and pollution due to the release of man-made substances.
