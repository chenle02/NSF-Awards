The North Carolina State University at Raleigh will initiate a four- week,
residential, Young Scholars project in Physics for 24 students in grades 11-12.
The residential component of this project consists of: 1) two weeks of
structured lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on experiments on the
fundamentals of nuclear physics, nuclear radiation, fission and fusion, nuclear
energy, and the use of nuclear techniques in science and technology; and 2) two
weeks of participation in research as an apprentice to a researcher in
tomography, nuclear spectrometry using a Van de Graaff accelerator, power
reactor control, plasma physics, neutron activation analysis, or health physics.
The goal: to provide a stimulating experience that will motivate the
participants toward a career in science or engineering.
