In July 2014, the National Telecommunication Information Administration (NTIA)
and the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Office of Engineering and
Technology (OET) issued a Joint Public Notice (PN) to seek public comment on the
creation of an urban test city to support rapid experimentation and development
of policies, underlying technologies, and system capabilities for advanced,
dynamic spectrum sharing by wireless devices. Based on the responses received
from this comments process, the FCC and NTIA are seeking inputs to support the
development of a framework for the model test city. The framework for the Model
City would include consideration of several aspects including, technical,
collaborative, funding and governance aspects. The FCC is sponsoring a workshop
on April 15-16, 2015, to facilitate this process. The workshop aims to bring
together a group of 100 experts in the field from a variety of sectors and
backgrounds, including from government, industry and academia, at the local,
state, national and even international levels. This project will support the
travel of 20 attendees from academia and 10 from the public safety sector who
would otherwise be unable to attend. Travel support will be used to promote
participation of attendees who can contribute to the sharing of ideas between
academia and industry and federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected
that this workshop will develop a strategic plan for new approaches that will
allow commercial interests to share currently underutilized bandwidth without
jeopardizing functionality and safety in emergency situations. The workshop will
also contribute valuable insights to the growing acceptance that wireless
spectrum is becoming an integral part of so-called "Critical Infrastructure" and
therefore requiring of Critical Infrastructure Protection.
