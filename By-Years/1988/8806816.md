This is a project for mathematical research in the theory of operator algebras,
with collateral impact in several other areas of mathematics. Algebras of
operators on Hilbert space have long been used to represent a diversity of
mathematical structures, including some that arise in theoretical physics. The
principal investigator will pursue consequences of an extremely fruitful idea of
his about how to measure the size of an operator algebra relative to a larger
algebra that contains it. He will investigate and exploit connections between
subfactors of factors, conformal field theory, knot theory, statistical
mechanics, completely integrable systems, and quantum groups. In particular an
attempt will be made to give an explicit three-dimensional definition of certain
knot invariants hitherto only defined via braids or two-dimensional projections.
