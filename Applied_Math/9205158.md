This project will focus on the analysis of transport properties and
constitutive relations of composite materials and their application to problems
of optimal structural design. Improved bounds and self consistent estimates will
be developed for composite systems. The types of composites considered are two
phase elastic composites with symmetry, partially debonded two phase elastic
composites, two phase thermal conducting media with surface resistance between
phases, and random emulsions of two Stokes fluids incorporating surface tension
effects. New mathematical techniques involving new applications of null
lagrangians, weakly lower semicontinuous functionals, and dual variational
principles will be employed. These anticipated results as well as the existing
theory will be applied to the numerical solution of optimal structural design
problems. The optimal design problem considered here is the previously untreated
problem of maximum strength design of composite systems subject to an ensemble
of random static loads. Many modern optimal structural designs incorporate the
use of composite materials. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize the
most recent advances in the characterization of composite systems to facilitate
solution of problems of optimal structural design. Anticipated applications
include design of offshore oil platforms, large structures subjected to wind
loads, and large space structures.
