Object-oriented systems exhibit a very high rate of object creation, but most of
the objects are short-lived. As a result, memory- management overhead is
significant. This project is concerned with an application-specific coprocessor
architecture to speed up object creation and memory reclamation in object-
oriented systems. The architecture supports a bit-vector approach to dynamic
storage allocation and liberation. Newly created objects reside in a cache which
is reference counted. It is expected that most objects will die before they age
out of the cache, drastically reducing the number of references to main memory.
Many existing computer architectures would require only minor compiler
modification to incorporate and benefit from this coprocessor.
