The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Information Technology (SURF-IT)
program provides an intensive and personalized summer program for 12
underrepresented (women and minority) and disadvantaged undergraduates. The
students are drawn primarily from institutions that do not have strong,
personalized research opportunities. SURF-IT is a 10-week summer program that
includes research directly supervised by a faculty member in computer
engineering, computer science, or electrical engineering. Students also have
weekly meetings on graduate school preparation, research ethics, and research
presentation, as well as field trips to local neighboring Silicon Valley
research laboratories. The summer program concludes with a research poster
presentation by the SURF-IT students, coordinated with other undergraduate
summer programs within the institution.

The goal of the program is to promote diversity in engineering by assisting
motivated students in obtaining graduate degrees to then become positive role
models for future generations of college students throughout the nation. Thus
after the summer program, the faculty maintains continuing contact with SURF-IT
alumni to assist them in applying to and succeeding in graduate school, as well
as in their eventual careers.
