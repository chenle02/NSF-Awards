Abstract &lt;br/&gt;NACLO is a high school Olympiad contest in linguistics and
language technologies. Formulating contest problems is not straightforward
because the contest does not have pre-requisites. Because students are not
expected to know linguistics, specific languages, advanced math, or computer
programming, the problems must be self-contained, and yet must still test the
skills such as algorithmic thinking, abstractly representing a solution space,
reducing a solution space, and evaluating a solution. These skills represent
computational thinking, the part of computer science that does not involve
computers. Some problems also introduce tools of linguistics and language
technologies such as finite state machines and context free grammars. So more
generally, this Small Grant for Exploratory research tackles the new problem of
designing a curriculum of training sessions and contest problems that introduce
high school students to computational thinking as it applies to the processng of
human languages. The importance of the project is to inspire students to study
linguistics and computer science and to increase participation and diversity in
those fields. &lt;br/&gt;
