The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement proposal is to examine the
relationship between body size, locomotion and structural properties of the fore
and hindlimb bones in several species of small to mid-sized primates. The
relationships will be calculated in modern specimens for which full skeletons
are available. Subsequently, a variety of Eocene primates will be studied in
order to clarify knowledge of their locomotor modes as well as body mass. This
approach is necessary as most Eocene primates are poorly represented in the
fossil record and as inference as to behavior is always difficult when working
with fossil remains.
