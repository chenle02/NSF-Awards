Organic electronic materials use brilliant dye-like molecules and polymers in
special applications such as high performance cellphone displays and flexible
solar cells. The development and application of new and improved organic
electronic materials occupies the attention of a large community of
international researchers. This community also seeks to adapt their insights to
hybrid lead halide perovskite materials and future applications like
bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing. They come together once every two
years to share their accomplishments at the International Symposium on
Functional Pi Electron Systems. The 15th incarnation of this symposium series
(FPi15) will be held in the summer of 2023 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The venue
is an excellent opportunity for graduate student researchers to network within
the international community. This funding provides travel support for diverse
graduate student participation in the FPi15 symposium and thus promotes a
vibrant and inclusive future for the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
