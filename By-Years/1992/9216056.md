This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
Columbia University in Japan. The project is to test a theory of gender
relations in white collar organizations: to assess the strength of cultural
factors vs. organizational factors i explaining the discrimination against
female workers in Japanese offices. The student wil do participant observation
in two Japanese business firms, one with substantial numbersof women in
professional positions and another with few women in high level jobs. By
comparing behaviors, attitudes, life histories and professional aspirations of
women in the two case studies the student will attempt to assess the importance
of internal values against external organizational barriers to advancement. This
project is important because Japanese business seems monolithically efficient
and production oriented as seen from the US. This sort of case study will
provide valuable information on local variation and on barriers to participation
by women, which will be useful in dealing with Japanese public and private
organizations.
