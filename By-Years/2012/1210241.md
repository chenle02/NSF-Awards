This action funds Richard Henrikson of University of California, Berkeley to
conduct a research project, entitled "Structural colorimetric sensors for rapid
and robust molecular diagnostics," during the summer of 2012 at Seoul National
University in Seoul, Korea. The host scientist is Sunghoon Kwon.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes both fundamental
scientific exploration, as well as applied technology development for grand
challenges in global healthcare. This project explores exciting physical and
biological phenomena at the nanoscale in order to produce a novel analytical
assay for a range of molecular diagnostic applications.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
