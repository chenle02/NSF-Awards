9412476 Riemer This grant will support a study by the Commission on Physical
Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications' (CPSMA) Board on Physics and Astronomy
(BPA) Committee to assess the present status of optical and infrared astronomy
and recommend strategies to optimize progress in this field within constrained
support. The study will be carried out by a panel under the Committee on
Astronomy and Astrophysics. As part of this study, the panel will consider the
role of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in meeting the goals
of this field. Broad input from the astronomy community will be solicited, and
site visits will be held. The report will be completed by approximately January
1, 1995.
