The PI will continue the work of generalizing classical geometric variational
problems in Riemannian geometry to include singular geometry. The main focus is
the harmonic map theory from singular domains to non-positively curved metric
spaces. Harmonic maps are important as analytical objects which can be used to
represent geometric, topological and algebraic objects associated to a space and
have numerous actual and potential applications in geometry, topology, and
algebra, as well as other fields in mathematics. In a joint work with G.
Daskalopoulos, we investigate existence and regularity properties of harmonic
maps from polyhedral domains. The main applications are in geometric
superrigidity, geometric group theory, character varieties and Hodge theory. In
a project with S. Yamada, we study minimal surfaces with prescribed singularity
complimenting the existing theory in geometric measure theory. This work
includes the singular version of the classical Plateau problem as well as the
equivariant minimal surface problem.

The primary object of study in the proposed projects is a harmonic map. A map is
a geometric representation of one space into another. There is a natural notion
of energy of a map which measures the total stretch. A harmonic map achieves
equilibrium position with respect to this energy. For example, a configuration
of a rubber sheet spread out over a bumpy surface of a rock can be understood as
a map. The energy is the total tension of the rubber and the configuration of
least tension is a harmonic map. A rubber sheet, without any outside forces
acting on it, will naturally arrange itself into a position given by a harmonic
map. Thus, a harmonic map is a natural and canonical choice in a given set of
maps. The understanding of the properties of this map is mathematically
interesting in itself but also essential as it represents many important
phenomena in the natural sciences.
