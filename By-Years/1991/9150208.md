This one-year project is developing an upper division course in numerical
methods that incorporates the methodology of advanced scientific computing.
Until now the availability of these high performance computational tools has
been almost exclusively limited to advanced research and development projects.
This project is demonstrating the viability of exposing undergraduates to modern
scientific computing. The hallmark of the project is the development of a
library of interdisciplinary case studies, so that students can study basic
numerical methods in the context of a significantly sized scientific or
engineering problem using real data. These form the basis of group project work
by students organized into interdisciplinary teams.This NSF-funded project is
the first step in a larger curriculum development effort designed to extend a
theme of computation throughout the typical undergraduate science and
engineering program, and in particular to bring experience in advanced
scientific computation to undergraduates.NSF grant funds for equipment are being
matched with funds from non-federal sources.
