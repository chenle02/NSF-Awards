This action funds Anna Michelle Wright of Wayne State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Are people from different cultures more willing to
replace their memories with technology?" during the summer of 2012 at Seoul
National University in Seoul, South Korea. The host scientist is Dr. Incheol
Choi.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is multifaceted. This research
project is the first laboratory examination of the effect of video camera
presence on later recall of events. Specifically, this research project examines
whether individuals who are confident they can refer back to a video recording
of an event distribute that information into the environment (i.e., recall less
information than individuals who believe the video recording to be unreliable or
unavailable). Completion of this research project in South Korea allows the
researchers to examine a memory "off-loading" effect in a cross-cultural
setting. As such, the study provides information about the generality of
mechanisms of human memory and human cognition.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
