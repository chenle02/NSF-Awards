The researchers will plan and conduct a physical experiment specifically to
verify numerical predictions of the coalescence of turbulent vorticity
fluctuations into a single, large, strongly stable, coherent vortex structure.
Laboratory verification of the formation of such a structure, and associated
efforts to understand and predict conditions for its occurrence, are of
importance to atmospheric and oceanographic long-lived eddy structures embedded
in an otherwise turbulent flow.
