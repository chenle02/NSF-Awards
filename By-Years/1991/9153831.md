This 2.5 year project will provide enhancement opportunities in mathematics
education for all teachers of grades K through two in Columbiana County, Ohio,
an economically depressed, rural Appalachian area. The purposes are four-fold:
to enhance teachers' knowledge of mathematics and developmentally appropriate
pedagogical practices; to increase the use of manipulative materials in
mathematics instruction; to foster awareness of cultural and gender equity
issues pertinent to a rural setting; and to develop a cadre of teacher leaders
who can help sustain the ideas of the project following funding. School
principals will be involved in central ways. The project builds on an earlier
effort supported with Eisenhower funds; 32 teachers from that early effort will
serve as peer coaches and mentors in the current project. During the 91*-92
academic year and summer, and then in the 92-93 academic year and summer, all
174 primary teachers in the county will participate in school-based inservice
activities and summer institutes. The peer coaches will receive additional
preparation and will work with the participants in their schools throughout the
project. A strong qualitative evaluation process will support dissemination of
the project's successes and strategies. Cost sharing is provided by Kent State
University and Columbiana County as 28% of the NSF award.
