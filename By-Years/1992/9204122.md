This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Albert Tung, San
Jose State University and Professor Weiling Chiang, National Central University,
supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This
project plans to develop a non-parametric earthquake intensity forecast model
for prediction of spatial distribution of seismic intensity. This model can be
used for seismic risk and damage assessment and represents an improvement over
currently used risk/damage assessment procedures. Taiwan is one of the major
earthquake areas. The additional data from Taiwan will provide information on
seismic conditions not available in the U.S. The result is an improvement in
scope and accuracy of the earthquake intensity forecast.
