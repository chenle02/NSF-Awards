This award provides funding for the 5th Annual NSF Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (NSE) Grantees Conference, a program review and research networking
workshop that will highlight the ongoing research and educational activities of
the NSF NSE grant programs. The proposed conference will be held at the Westin
Arlington Gateway Hotel, Arlington, VA on 5-7 December 2011. The lead academic
chair of the meeting will be John R. Regalbuto of the University of South
Carolina. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals for this proposed 3-day
conference are to promote dissemination of innovative research progress, to
facilitate research partnerships, and to identify future research directions.
Oral presentations with question periods, panel discussions, and a poster
session are planned as platforms to promote inter-university and
academic/industry/government/national-laboratory interactions. These
interactions represent a vital step toward the advancement of the goals of the
U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) (www.nano.gov) which are to:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) conduct research and development to realize the full
potential of nanoscale science and engineering; &lt;br/&gt;2) develop the
skilled workforce and supporting infrastructure needed to advance research and
development; &lt;br/&gt;3) better understand the social, ethical, health, and
environmental implications of the technology; and, &lt;br/&gt;4) facilitate
transfer of the new technologies into commercial products.
