The objective of this research is to employ a new, generic approach to
improving the ductility of intermetallic compounds of the AB3-type. The
technique uses Pettifor maps and ALCHEMI and X-ray diffraction to determine the
relationship of new compounds (created by selective alloying) relative to their
crystal structure and near proximity to ductile alloys. If this idea works, it
will provide a more systematic approach to intermetallic alloy design. This
research is timely because of current interest in intermetallic alloys for their
high temperature applications and associated problems with low temperature
ductility and toughness.
