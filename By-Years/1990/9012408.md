Precise theoretical values for the amplitudes of parity non-conserving
transitions in heavy atoms induced by exchange of neutral Z particles between
the nucleus and electrons will be studied. This will permit a determination of
the Weinberg angle from atomic physics experiments. The amplitudes are
calculated using a relativistic version of many-body perturbation theory. The
multiple sum over states needed in evaluating higher order effects are performed
using finite basis set techniques often in conjunction with the solution of
partial differential equations. With energies, transition amplitudes and
hyperfine constants accurate to 1% the parity non-conserving amplitudes can also
be obtained with errors at the 1% level.
