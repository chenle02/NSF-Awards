Research is being performed on solidification of binary and ternary alloys to
examine segregation patterns and obtain theoretical predictions on interfacial
morphology. Modification of microstructure by addition of ternary elements to
induce twinning in phases having the diamond cubic structure is under
investigation. Development of channel segregation is explored to determine the
generality of the effect beyond metal alloys to other materials such as alkali
halides or transparent organic materials.
