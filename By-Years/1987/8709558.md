The research includes a new approach to develop more accurate and efficient
techniques for solution of three dimensional problems with discontinuities and
local nonlinearities. The finite element method owes its significance to its
potentiality for the treatment of rather arbitrary geometry, and different
material properties. One may build a special finite element that contains the
discontinuity in the element formulation, and couple the special element to the
mesh that models the rest of the system. The special element formulation, unlike
others, will incorporate already existing classical solutions into the element
formulations. The displacement function, for structural problems for example,
used in approximations will exactly satisfy the analytical results wherever
available. This will be achieved by invoking the classical solutions as
constraints in the derivation of element stiffness coefficients. This research
will bring about a new technique to handle discontinuities, local geometric-
material nonlinearities at local level without requiring mesh refinements. For
numerical comparison purposes a computer program will be developed.
