Datacenter applications -- be it cloud storage, big data processing, or desktop
virtualization -- need high bandwidth (40 Gigabits/second or more) to meet
rising demand in support of national needs. Traditional Internet Protocol stacks
don't scale at such speeds, since they have very high processing demands. This
project will analyze new protocols being deployed in the field from the point of
view of control theory. The topic is of great interest to industry and standards
bodies; the investigator is collaborating with industry and will be leveraging
their resources for implementation and testbed evaluations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet
technology is being deployed in datacenters to provide ultra-low latency and
high throughput to applications, with very low CPU overhead. However, initial
designs lack any formal control theoretic analysis. The mechanisms are prone to
oscillations in the queue size and fluctuating flow rates. It is not immediately
obvious how to choose the various parameters for the algorithms, and how the
parameter choices change with the number of flows or link capacities. While
existing deployments operate with 40 Gigabit/second Ethernet links, simulations
on 100Gigabit/second Ethernet links show instability of the queue, oscillations
and loss of utilization. This project aims to provide a formal control theoretic
analysis of congestion control in RDMA protocols over converged ethernet in the
datacenter. The main intellectual merit of the proposal is to develop formal,
control theoretic models of Congestion Control Protocols to transport RDMA over
Converged Ethernet. &lt;br/&gt; The investigator will leverage the research
efforts to deliver entrepreneurship training to Columbia University students,
and is developing a pilot program to extend entrepreneurship training to high
school students.
