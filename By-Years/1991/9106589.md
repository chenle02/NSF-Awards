The objective of this research is to examine, both experimentally and
theoretically, the phenomenon of multilayered microstructuring or stratification
in sub-micron thin liquid films produced by the use of surface active agents;
further to explore its use as a probe for investigating long-range structural or
interaction forces in colloidal dispersions. A unique feature of this continuing
study lies in the development of a surface force balance for films with fluid
interfaces for investigating the influence of microstructures on thin film
stability. Using this new technique, both film thickness and capillary pressure
are recorded simultaneously. The surface force balance in conjunction with the
differential interference microscopy will be used to study films with curvature
such as those existing between approaching small droplets or bubbles associated
with emulsion and foam systems. Experiments using differential and common
microinterferometic methods will be performed to obtain the contact angle and
film tension and, thereby, the film interaction energy and the disjoining
pressure attributable to the presence of micellar structure inside the film.
Systems to be investigated will include both spherical and non- spherical
micelles, mixed micelles (such as in mixtures of anionic and nonionic micellar
solutions) and differently charged colloidal particles such as silica and
latexes. This study will provide insights into the origin of structural
disjoining pressure related to interfacial structuring in thin films which gives
rise to an increased stability in colloidal dispersions.
