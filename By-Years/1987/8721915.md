Previous work done on this program under NSF grant DMR-8418097 dealt with the
analysis of rolling contact deformation and fracture in steels and other
materials. The investigation combined elasto-plastic finite element and cyclic
plasticity analyses using a fracture mechanics approach. The studies provided,
for the first time, two-dimensional and three- dimensional analyses based on
cyclic constitutive relationships for pure rolling and rolling/sliding friction
contact. The ongoing work seeks to more completely integrate the mechanics and
materials elements of the contact problem. Two aspects of this problem will be
emphasized: one is the analysis of the idealized macrocontact; the other is the
"near surface" effects produced by microasperities, lubrication pressure spikes
and frictional heating. This approach can accommodate realistic descriptions of
material behavior and should lead to meaningful estimates of the contact
distortions, cyclic plastic flow and residual stresses.
