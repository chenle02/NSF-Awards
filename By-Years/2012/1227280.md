Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Understanding macro risks Project
Summary&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: SES-1227280&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:
Harald Uhlig&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macroeconomic risks have an important impact
on macroeconomic movements. These are in turn central issues for macroeconomic
policy, as the 2008 financial crisis as well as the ongoing European sovereign
debt crisis has shown. Understanding these relationships is therefore of first-
order importance. The proposed research seeks to make a contribution to that
end, pursuing three projects in particular. The first project provides a new
method for estimating macroeconomic models, when their asset pricing properties
are the center of attention. As a particular application, a model with habit
formation is investigated, thereby deepening our understanding for the scope as
well as the role of particular features of this important class of model to
replicate asset pricing and macroeconomic facts in an uncertain environment.
This project will deepen our understanding about how economies react to risks at
the macro level. The second project investigates Epstein-Zin preferences, a
second important approach in macroeconomic models to explain asset pricing and
business cycle facts. The project will provide a clarification of key features
of these models and to provide a useful benchmark for models with more elaborate
features or solution methods. The third project is motivated by the current
sovereign debt crisis in the European monetary union. It should prove useful for
thinking about the underlying dynamics as well as for analyzing various policy
options and their consequences.
