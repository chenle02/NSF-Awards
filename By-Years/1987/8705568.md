This proposal for studying the reconstruction of surfaces by combining
electronic structure and computer simulation techniques is from an undergraduate
institution. The principal investigator, Professor L. Roelofs is a leader in the
field of statistical mechanics of surfaces and is eminently qualified to do the
work. The problems proposed can add to our fundamental understanding of surface
phenomena and may impact on technology. A 30-month award is recommended with
highest priority.
