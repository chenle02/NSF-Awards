Study will be made of dimethyl sulfide distribution in seawater and overlying
air masses with de novo production of reduced sulfur compounds from sulfate.
Incorporation of radioactive sulfate into reduced (protein and metabolites) and
non-reduced (sulfolipids and sulfate esters) components of microplankton will be
measured as a function of light field and depth over the naturally occurring
day/night cycle. Additional measurements of radioactive bicarbonate
incorporation into cellular constituents will be made in a similar manner to
determine (a) the proportion of reductive sulfate assimilation attributable to
phytoplankton and (b) the applicability of carbon-based productivity
measurements to phytoplankton sulfate reduction and hence potential volatile
sulfur compound release. Estimates will be made of areal production for
comparison with dimethyl sulfide flux estimates.
