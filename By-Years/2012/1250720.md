This award is to support development and test the accelerated, efficient
reconstruction and beam-forming algorithms for radio astronomical detectors.
When possible, computations will be ported out to the Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU) clusters that provide massively parallel floating-point capabilities. This
approach is ideally suited to the data generated by digital radio astronomy
arrays, and especially well suited when the respective hardware is deployment at
remote observation sites - because of the proposed algorithms show excellent
performance-to-power efficiency when compared to general-purpose supercomputers.
Additionally, the real-time (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) FPGA-based
algorithms will be developed for radio transient data reduction. They will help
developing accelerated radio simulation methods to support and validate the
proposed methodology. These algorithms and methodology will be tested at the
Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an array of in-ice antennae deployed in the U.S.
Antarctic South Pole Station to detect highest-energy neutrinos coming from the
deep Universe sources. The award's broader impacts are in the use of high-
performance parallel computing and efficient real-time data reduction in the
fields of radio astronomy, cosmology, and particle astrophysics. Expansion of
the use of GPUs will provide the necessary computing power for next-generation
experiments in a sustainable, efficient way. The post-doctoral researcher and
graduate student will be part of the overall development and testing. In
addition, undergraduate students will also be involved in the research. An on-
line public research component will be developed to engage "citizen scientists"
in the analysis of radio astronomy data on home computers.
