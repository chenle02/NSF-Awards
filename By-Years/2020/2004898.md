The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) workforce for the nation through their efforts at
significantly increasing the competitiveness and numbers of students from
historically underrepresented minority (URM) populations to successfully
complete high quality degree programs in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
University of Arkansas (UA), partner institution with the Arkansas Louis Stokes
Alliance for Minority Participation (ARK-LSAMP) will support stipends and cost
of education allowances for a cohort of 12 STEM postbaccalaureate students over
a two year period to pursue STEM doctoral degree completion in several of NSF's
Ten Big Idea priority areas, such as Harnessing the Data Revolution, at the
institution. In addition to a program of STEM research, professional development
and outreach activities that students will engage in during the project period,
activities include intercultural training for faculty to address institutional
culture and incorporates a suite of "champions" to support the participants in
retention to the STEM doctoral degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The full alliance,
consisting of 8 institutions in the state will support the cohort in activities
such as the ARK-LSAMP annual research symposium and other graduate seminars that
emphasize preparation and competitiveness for other graduate student support,
including NSF’s graduate fellowship. The institution has provided a plan to
support and track this cohort through completion of the terminal STEM
degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be evaluated formatively and
summatively during the two-year period using a mixed methods approach.
Dissemination of project findings will occur through the institution’s website,
STEM conferences, and professional societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arkansas
LSAMP BD program will be implemented in a NSF designated Established Program to
Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction thereby increasing research
and education capability in the region. The project is jointly supported by the
Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation and NSF
EPSCoR.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
