This project addresses a current and increasing need to better understand the
structural stiffness characteristics of complex multi body mechanical systems.
Robots, articulated spacecraft and many other configurations fall in this class
of systems. Currently, it is generally assumed that the structural stiffnesses
of system components are nearly constant over a wide range of rotational motion.
The trend toward lighter weight components invalidates this assumption and
demands a reexamination of the issue of structural stiffness for flexible
multibody systems. This research develops new strategies and techniques for
understanding this issue and for the simulation of large displacement, small
deformation behavior of complicated multibody systems.
