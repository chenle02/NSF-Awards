Forest ecologists attempt to understand forest dynamics through the development
of spatially-explicit simulation models that describe individual-level
interactions. One such model is known as SORTIE. The SORTIE model is relatively
recent and fairly highly regarded by community ecologists, despite limited
validation. This proposed investigation will use a long-term data set on tree
demography to parameterize and validate a forest dynamics simulation model known
as SORTIE. One strength of this project is the application of the model to a
forest community quite different from that for which it was developed. The
investigation will combine field studies, analysis of long-term plot data and
simulations. An important focus of the project is to assess the sufficiency of
shade tolerance to the theory of forest dynamics by evaluating the performance
of SORTIE in predicting several elements of forest structure and dynamics.
