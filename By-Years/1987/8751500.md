Algebra is the core of secondary school mathematics. It provides concepts,
language, and reasoning methods that are essential tools for problem solving in
science, technology, and every other branch of mathematics. Computer graphic,
numerical, and symbol manipulation tools that are now widely available offer
powerful new approaches to algebraic problem solving and to learning algebraic
concepts, principles, and skills. Thus computing offers promise of an impressive
advance in the scope and effectiveness of secondary school algebra. This joint
University of Maryland and Pennsylvania State University Project will complete
development, field testing, and evaluation of prototype instructional materials
for an elementary algebra strand in secondary school mathematics that reflects
appropriate integration of computer tools for problem solving, teaching, and
learning. The primary responsibility for curriculum development will rest with
the University of Maryland and the teacher preparation and evaluation of the
field tests will be done by Pennsylvania State University. The final products
will include model student text materials and computer software guidelines for
teacher preparation, analyses of student learning, and guidelines for evaluation
of achievement in the coming computer-intensive environments for school algebra.
