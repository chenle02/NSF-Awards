The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of modified dental mirrors. These mirrors are a critical tool used
in the dental industry and are used for a range of purposes from routine
cleaning to diagnosis to surgical preparation. Maintaining good visibility
within the mouth is critical for these purposes. The temperature difference
between the mouth and the mirror surface leads to fogging. This technology
improves the visibility of tooth decay in patients to improve oral health
through an anti-fogging dental mirror. This project has the potential to enhance
student clinical research skills by exposing them to a wide variety of patient-
oriented research. This project could offer a variety of didactic learning
opportunities and in-house case presentations that are relevant to patient-
oriented research.

This I-Corps project is based on the development of a dental mirror design with
a heating element to heat the surface of the dental mirror and a device to
maintain operability after autoclave sterilization, critical for an intraoral
application. The heating element consists of a mirror with the nichrome heating
element, and a thermistor. The air flow cleansing mechanism uses an air
regulator and air compressor to create controlled air flow and pressure to blow
moisture away from the mirror surface. Rotation-induced cleansing uses a high-
speed rotating mechanism to push condensation towards the edges of the mirror.
