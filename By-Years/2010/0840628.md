CBET-0840628&lt;br/&gt;Santiago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2009 Gordon Research
Conference will address topics that represent the latest advances in the field
of microfluidics and nanofluidics over the past year. Topics that will be
discussed in invited oral and poster sessions include nanobiotechnology, systems
integration, nanofluidics, and single molecule manipulation and measurement with
emphasis on biomedical applications of microfluidics. Young scientists,
including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and young faculty, are invited
to present their latest work during several poster sessions at the conference.
At previous conferences in this series, the poster sessions have been dynamic
and interactive and are an integral part of the research presentations. Oral and
poster presentations at this conference are encouraged to be forward thinking or
controversial on subjects that are not yet published. Funding will support
conference fees and/or travel costs for participants with emphasis on graduate
students, post-docs, and young academic researchers.
