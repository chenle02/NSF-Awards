The goal of this proposal is to understand the dynamical behavior of biological
polyelectrolytes, especially DNA, in strongly interacting solutions. the
interactions may be electrostatic, excluded volume, entanglement, or some
combination. Such conditions are the norms inside cells. The work uses
quasielastic light scattering (QLS), forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS), and
small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to shed light on how interactions influence
the diffusional and binding behavior of biopolymers. Such influence can have
major effects under physiologically relevant conditions.
