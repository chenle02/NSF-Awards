Climate fluctuations may pose a considerable risk to municipal water supply and
distribution systems (WSD) in areas with high rates of water demand. The project
will examine the risks to such systems associated with two types of drought-
induced failure modes: a) aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply; and b)
demand rate exceeding system capacity. Three classes of WSD systems will be
studied: systems constrained by availability of supplies only; systems
constrained by treatment and distribution capacity only; and systems constrained
by both capacity and supplies. Techniques will be developed for numerically
estimating the risks to WSD systems under recurring drought conditions. Results
will provide water conservation strategies to decrease the impact of drought on
urban communities.
