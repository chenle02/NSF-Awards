Abstract for DMS-0401399&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) The PI will study
the prime ideals in a Hopf Galois extension; such&lt;br/&gt;extensions include
crossed products of Hopf algebras, as well as certain&lt;br/&gt;extensions of
quantum groups obtained from quotients. She will also
consider&lt;br/&gt;representations of finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf
algebras, with&lt;br/&gt;particular interest in the Frobenius-Schur indicator of
an irreducible&lt;br/&gt;representation. Progress on such problems might be of
help in the&lt;br/&gt;classification program. The PI will also study the
possible actions of the&lt;br/&gt;Taft Hopf algebras on quantum polynomial
rings. Finally the PI will study&lt;br/&gt;what happens to a Hopf algebra and an
algebra on which it acts when the Hopf&lt;br/&gt;algebra is twisted by a
cocycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Hopf algebras are algebraic objects
which have arisen in other subjects,&lt;br/&gt;both in mathmatics itself (such
as in knot theory and geometry) and in&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics (such in
statistical mechanics and conformal field&lt;br/&gt;theory). If one could
classify certain Hopf algebras, it would help in&lt;br/&gt;describing these
other structures. Moreover Hopf algebras provide a&lt;br/&gt;unifying framework
for groups, Lie algebras, and their recent quantum&lt;br/&gt;analogs. Thus
studying Hopf algebras themselves as well as their actions&lt;br/&gt;on other
structures is an important problem.&lt;br/&gt;
