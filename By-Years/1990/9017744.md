Global scale measurements are required to obtain sufficient understanding of
the ocean circulation to enable models to be constructed for climate related
issues. This effort will provide for the construction, deployment, and
subsequent tracking of Autonomous LAgrangian Circulation Explorer (ALACE) floats
which drift with the ocean circulation at mid-ocean depths and bob to the
surface periodically to report their location and ocean data via satellite.
These data, coupled with hydrographic and tracer information will be used for
ocean circulation models.
