The area of novelty filtering (detecting changes in a pattern) is of importance
to investigators working with optical and electronic neural systems for at least
two reasons. Firstly, for transmission of information, much less capacity is
required when only changes in spatial or temporal pattern are used (unless the
pattern or scene changes totally and abruptly). Secondly, in pattern
recognition, detecting changes or motion is of obvious importance. The purpose
of the research is the development of optical neural systems which have the
potential of sensing changes in a three-dimensional scene.
