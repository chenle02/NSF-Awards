This award supports a study, both theoretical and observational, of the
dynamics which produce warps in galactic planes. Galaxies with polar rings will
also be studied to place additional constraints on the distribution of dark
matter in these systems. The principal investigator is one of the world leaders
in this field, and the combination of new observations with her analytical
skills should lead to new insights in how galaxies operate.
