DMS-9970577 ABSTRACT

M. Feldman will work on three main topics. (1) Study of Monge-Kantorovich mass
transfer problem in nonhomogeneous media, which include transport on manifolds
with obstacles, and in anisotropic and nonsmooth spaces. Also, related evolution
problems will be studied. Recently a progress was made by many authors in
studying mass transport in the Euclidean space. Nonhomogeneous media is a
natural next step. (2) Study of existence of convex viscosity solutions of
geometric evolution equations, including nonlocal curvature motion, in the
spatial dimensions three and higher. Such geometric evolutions are related to
Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer. (3) Free boundary problems: existence and
stability of solutions, and regularity of free boundaries.

Methods of mass transfer theory were used recently in several applications
including mathematical models in economics, meteorology, fluid dynamics,
sandpiles growth and collapse, non-Newtonian fluids, plasticity. Free boundaries
and moving interfaces arise naturally in many models. Mathematical analysis of
such problems improves our understanding of qualitative properties of models,
and is a necessary ingredient in developing of fast and reliable numerical
algorithms. In addition, mathematical study sometimes discovers unexpected
connections between different models (for example, partial differential
equations and transport problems), and such interplay is useful in applications.
