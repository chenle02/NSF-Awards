The research objective of this award is to use the structure of natural liver
tissue as a guide for the processing of a new type of bioreactor that will make
both liver cells and liver tissue. The microstructural niche requires that the
structure of the bioreactor core mimic the essential features of the
microenvironment in which stem cells reside and differentiate to form liver
cells and tissue. The research approach involves dividing the microstructural
niche into a series of lengthscales and then recreating these scales using a
unique organ casting process in which a polymer copy of a natural liver vascular
network is created and then ceramic foam is cast around it. When the ceramic is
fired the vascular network of the liver is retained in the open ceramic foam
that will be used to culture liver cells. The deliverables include: an
understanding of the effect of the vascular structure on the processing of the
ceramic foam and its consequent effect on culturing of liver cells, a test of
the microstructural niche concept and engineering student
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of the research will
provide a new generation of bioreactors that can culture cells and tissue from
stem cells at physiologic densities. The liver cells and tissue manufactured in
this way could be used in drug testing or transplant. Also, larger bioreactors
of this type could be used to support liver function in patents that are being
bridged to liver transplant. This award will also demonstrate an
interdisciplinary approach that combines knowledge of cellular processes in
tissue with the structure-property relationships of materials to design and
manufacture bioreactors for other cells and tissue products. The educational
approach will attract both undergraduate and graduate students to major in
materials science and engineering by providing an example of a strong connection
between materials engineering and the requirements of important biomedical
devices for regenerative medicine. &lt;br/&gt;
