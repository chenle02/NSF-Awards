9705808 Stalnaker The Bureau of Reclamation is cost sharing the project. The
Bureau is very interested in the performance of aging concrete as it applies to
dam safety. The focus of the project is durability of concrete. For this reason
the site condition study and the petrographic analysis are the most important.
The laboratory testing will provide standard properties for comparison. The site
condition study will include a detailed study of the in-place conditions,
including photos and drawings. Specimens will be cored for laboratory testing.
The petrographic analysis will look at how the concrete has aged. This research
offers a unique opportunity to collect fundamental information about concrete
material properties which is unavailable by other means. This project is a
special one under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research. ***
