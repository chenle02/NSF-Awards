Surface vibrational spectroscopy, using reflection absorption infrared methods,
is the focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface
Chemistry Program. Professor Trenary and his students at the University of
Illinois at Chicago will determine the identity and structure of adsorbed
species using vibrational spectroscopy. Normal mode analysis will be applied to
the interpretation of this spectroscopic data, enabling assignment of
vibrational bands, and determination of structural parameters for the adsorbed
species. The application of these methods to the methoxy intermediate on copper
surfaces, and to isocyanide and related moieties on platinum surfaces are the
primary systems of interest. The results of this work will see broad application
in the routine use of surface IR to characterize reaction processes. The use of
surface infrared spectroscopy as a routine analytical tool will be enabled by
the development of normal mode analysis methods which are the subject of this
research project. In order to understand reaction processes on surfaces,
adsorbed reactants, products, and intermediates must be identified and
structurally characterized. Normal mode methods will make this characterization
routinely available to the surface chemistry community.
