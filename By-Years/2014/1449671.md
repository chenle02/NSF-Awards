The NSF's Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) embodies a key aspect
of next generation Cyber Infrastructure, heterogenity: it is a diverse set of
resources with differing implementations of common interfaces, owned and
operated by multiple organizations. It is an early example of a federated cloud
computing infrastructure. Federated infrastructure and the on-going adoption of
networking and information technology that touches on almost every aspect of our
society, as activities relating to commerce, government, research, education,
health care, critical infrastructure, etc., means that we need a principled and
well-grounded understanding of the security properties and security architecture
that are deeply integrated with and pervade such infrastructure. Using GENI as
an example, this project is developing a top level sketch of the security issues
of a federated infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two tasks:
the first is to review, analyze and document entities, operations and
relationships among them with security relevance in the GENI Architecture and
GENI Software Prototypes; the second is to analyze the current security
capabilities of GENI vis-a-vis current and future requirements likely to be
levied against the security architecture. The output of these tasks will inform
the development and use of federated infrastructure and guide next steps towards
building a secure federated Cyber Infrastructure.
