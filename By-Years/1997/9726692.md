This conference will discuss the creation of flexible structures of academic
work, the redrawing of organizational boundaries in universities' production of
science and technology and in their education of scientists and engineers. The
conference treats universities as complex organizations, which draws attention
to such matters as resistance to change, reallocation of resources, and the
restructuring of professional work. The conference will also examine the social,
political, and economic environment within which universities must function,
leading to questions about the role of changing revenue streams, federal
involvement in the promotion of interdisciplinary research, and the changing
boundaries between public and private sectors. Finally, the conference will look
specifically at the consequences of organizational change for graduate and
undergraduate education.
