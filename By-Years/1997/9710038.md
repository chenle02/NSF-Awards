9710038 Windham The Garrett Herbarium, an integral part of the Utah Museum of
Natural History (UMNH), is an important national and regional systematics
resource. With nearly 120,000 pressed plant specimens, it is the third largest
herbarium in Utah, and it ranks in the top 15% worldwide. The herbarium is a
major repository for botanical specimens from the diverse and incompletely-
explored Intermountain West, and it includes a series of historic collections
and voucher specimens that contribute greatly to the unique research value of
the collection. However, there are specimens stored on open shelves under
conditions that are considered unacceptable by modern conservation standards.
Funds from Institute of Museum Services, the Utah Museum of Natural History, the
University of Utah, and a private donor have allowed the herbarium staff to
address some of the problems identified by conservators. This NSF project will
take this process another step by providing archival supplies and student
personnel to re-folder many of the specimens.
