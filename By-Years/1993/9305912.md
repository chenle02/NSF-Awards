Koren This research is on design tools which can compensate for manufacturing
yield losses due to the complexity of the logic. Preliminary results have shown
that yield can be enhanced by the technique of reducing the sensitivity of the
chip to point defects. Yield optimization algorithms and techniques which are
applicable to the last two stages of design - topological/symbolic, and physical
layout are being explored. Physical layout strategies for yield enhancement in
the channel routing and compaction phases for standard cell designs are being
investigated. Yield enhancements in topological designs are being illustrated
through PLA-based designs.
