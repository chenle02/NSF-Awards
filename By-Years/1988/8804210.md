This project involves a combined field and laboratory investigation of a mafic
dike adjacent to the Skaergaard Intrusion, East Greenland. This dike is a
composite intrusion including mafic (basaltic) and silicic (granophyre)
components that possibly coexisted as separate liquid phases. Possible genetic
relations between these liquids will be explored to investigate origin of the
silicic magma interms of differentiation and crustal contamination of the mafic
magma. Proposed work will include mapping, petrographic and chemical analyses of
selected samples, Sr and Nd isotopic analyses of same, and experimental melting
studies of crustal xenoliths contained within the dike. This work will help
document processes of magma-wall rock inter- action that influence the evolution
of magma composition.
