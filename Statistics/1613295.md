Multi-view data, or the measuring of several distinct yet interrelated sets of
characteristics pertaining to a single set of subjects and possibly collected
from an array of sources, has become increasingly common in the fields of
engineering and scientific research. This project innovates new methodologies,
statistical theories, and scalable computational tools to tackle a range of
statistical learning problems with multi-view data. An integrated statistical
analysis of the multi-view data generation mechanisms, enabled by this project,
will allow us to gain extraordinary insight of real-world phenomena by utilizing
information obtained from different lenses and from different angles.

The PI will develop several generalizations of the reduced-rank matrix
structure, to enable a spectrum of multivariate statistical methods for multi-
view learning. The general methodology of reduced-rank estimation is one of the
most critical ingredients in modern multivariate analysis. However, for handling
multi-view data, the potential of the reduced-rank methodology is far from being
fully realized or understood. This project presents the following overarching
objectives: (1) develop integrative multivariate regression for joint learning,
which entails the exploitation of multiple sets of features to build an
integrated predictive model of multivariate response; (2) develop integrative
canonical correlation analysis for shared learning, by combining the exploration
of shared low-dimensional association structures between multiple sets of
features and the development of coherent predictive models for multivariate
response; (3) develop integrative dimension reduction for multi-scale learning,
by utilizing both the global and local low-dimensional structures among sub-
matrices of a high-dimensional matrix object; (4) develop diagnostic measures
for robust learning, which would enable reliable multi-view data integration and
data quality assessment.
