This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a new
concept in passive vibration absorbing material. If successful, the resulting
new material will have vastly superior performance over a broader range of
frequencies for sound absorption, vibration isolation, and impact isolation than
currently available materials. Previous work has yielded a new sound and
vibration absorbing material with several valuable properties including
significant attenuation at frequencies as low as 30 Hertz. That work has lead to
an understanding of how to build better materials for noise, vibration, and
shock attenuation. The new material to be developed in this research will be
passive, light, highly reliable, and can be produced at low cost. Another
benefit of the material is that the mechanism by which attenuation occurs is six
degree of freedom. Applications include isolation of delicate equipment from
vibrations of the structure to which they are mounted, vibration isolation for
high precision machine tools, lithography machines, scanning probe microscopes,
and similar equipment. It will also be usable as a new generation of vibration
dampers on equipment such as automotive vehicles and aircraft.
