The Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics will actively engage 60
students entering grades 10-12 and 10 faculty in the creation of a lively and
rigorous environment in which mathematics is created, shared, and enjoyed. For
six weeks faculty and students will live together and work together in small
workshops and problem seminars which meet for 37 hours each week. Challenging
problems from outside the usual secondary and college curricula will be
intensively investigated, but emphasis will be placed on the methods of discover
and proof rather than on the mere accumulation of results.
