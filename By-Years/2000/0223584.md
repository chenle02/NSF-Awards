Sesame Workshop, in collaboration with the Adler Planetarium &amp; Astronomy
Museum and the Beijing Planetarium, is planning a planetarium show and
complementary materials for preschool-age children and their families, teachers
and other caregivers. The planetarium show will be designed for use in the
United States and China and will have the following
goals:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- promoting positive attitudes among young children
towards science;&lt;br/&gt;-- providing age-appropriate information about
astronomy in an engaging, entertaining format; and&lt;br/&gt;-- fostering am
understanding of one another among children in the two
countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the planning phase, there will be three
face-to-face meetings among the principals: at the Beijing Planetarium, at
Sesame Workshop in New York, and at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The
purpose of these meetings will be to determine:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- What is
the appropriate educational content for the show and complementary materials and
what does research with children say about it?&lt;br/&gt;-- How does this type
of project best reach preschool audiences?&lt;br/&gt;-- Is there a need or
opportunity for producing alternative language or dialect versions of either the
English or Mandarin versions of the show and complementary materials?
&lt;br/&gt;-- What issues or problems affect the design of the show and
complementary materials?&lt;br/&gt;-- What are the implementation
issues?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular attention will be given to exploring how
the project might include cross-cultural information in the show and
complementary materials, and how the cross-over characters (Da Naio appearing in
the English version; Big Bird in the Mandarin version) might be included in the
design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
