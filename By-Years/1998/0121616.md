The objective of this research is to develop new computational design tools with
rigorous experimental validation to enable design and development of
distributed, heterogeneous mixed-technology systems. Mixed-technology system
development requires research on two fronts: The first is the component or the
device level and the second is the integration of heterogeneous components at
the system level. At the component or the device level, the research will focus
on four building-blocks: Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), Biological
Microelectromechanical Systems (Bio-MEMS), Nanoelectromechanical Systems (NEMS)
and Biological ion channels integrated with nanoelectronics
(nanobioelectronics). Efficient computational design tools integrated with
experimental validation will be developed for each of these building blocks. At
the system level the research focuses on integration of MEMS and Bio-MEMS with
conventional electronics. &lt;br/&gt;Device level modeling research will focus
on development of new scattered point computational methods for fast, efficient
and flexible analysis of micro and nanoscale devices, development of multiscale
approaches combining continuum and molecular approaches, development of enhanced
continuum models to capture microscopic phenomena, and development of efficient
reduced-order modeling approaches for fast dynamic analysis. System level
modeling research will focus on development of new algorithms and techniques to
integrate various micro-device partial differential equations solvers with the
circuit simulator (SPICE3) and development of efficient time stepping schemes
with different numerical devices for simulation of the complete system. The
experimental effort will focus on development of new fabrication approaches for
realizing nanobioelectronics, NEMS and systems level integration of MEMS and
Bio-MEMS with conventional electronics.&lt;br/&gt;
