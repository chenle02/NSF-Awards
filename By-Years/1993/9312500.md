This conference is held in New Hampshire, July 19-23, 1993, and focusses on
recent advances in the understanding of oxidation of metallic, intermetallic,
ceramic and ceramic composite materials. Individual sessions address impurity
segregation at oxide interfaces and grain boundaries, structure of oxide scales,
growth mechanisms of aluminum oxide scales, oxidation of ceramic structural
materials, mechanisms of oxidation in intermetallic alloys (titanium and nickel
aluminides), and stress-induced cracking of oxide scales. These discussions of
oxidation in advanced materials includes an international group of scientists as
well as students entering the field. %%% The interest in oxidation of high
temperature materials relates to tailoring their chemistry and structure to
prolong their useful life in structural applications such as engines and high
temperature furnaces.
