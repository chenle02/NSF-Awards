Averaging always smooths out, or improves, functions or data. In the continuous
case, this phenomena has been intensively studied for decades. If we average
over objects in a discrete setting like the integers, or some other high
dimensional lattice, the smoothing properties of the average have only recently
started to be studied. A natural object to study is the average over a discrete
sphere in a five dimensional lattice. The proof that the average improves
functions engages a range of deep aspects within number theory and analysis.
However, resolving the natural limits for this question still seem difficult. In
this project, these questions will be explored in a setting that involves both
continuous and discrete phenomena. These questions are also elementary to state,
which makes them amenable for mentoring programs, from undergraduate through
postdoctoral levels.

An improving inequality in the continuous setting has been widely studied since
the 1970's. However, the corresponding questions in the discrete setting have
only just attracted attention. For instance, averages over the discrete sphere
in the d-dimensional integers, with d at least 5, have a rich theory of
improving inequalities, paralleling the much better known continuous case. The
proofs however involve complications arising from multi-frequency analysis, as
well as fine estimates on Kloosterman sums. There is a richer theory, the
outlines of which are appearing, giving a sharp range of inequalities for some
arithmetic varieties. This subject also allows for the proof of certain sparse
bounds. The latter are scale-free versions of the improving inequalities. A
sparse bound immediately implies other weighted and vector valued consequences.
The latter are new in this subject. These questions reveal new aspects of these
averaging operators, and require new modes of investigation, deepening the
connection between harmonic analysis and number theory.
