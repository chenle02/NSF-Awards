In view of the large amount of high-quality data that started to flow from RHIC
recently, and the central role of RHIC for the nuclear physics community, this
proposal is very timely. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Gavin proposes to further develop
and apply tools for the identification and study of what is commonly referred to
as the "quark-gluon plasma". He is suggesting to continue and expand the study
of correlations and fluctuations in collaboration with experimentalists. He also
proposes to apply concepts of non-equilibrium and equilibrium statistical
physics to the QCD phase transition. Finally, Professor Gavin plans to revisit
charmonium production in RHIC collisions, an area where he has made substantial
contributions in the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two of the ratings of the mail
reviewers are "very good", with one "excellent". Some of the reviewers believe
that the PI is well positioned to make a major contribution to the field. The
mail reviewers and the Panel appreciate the solid impact of Prof. Gavin's prior
work, the originality of his ideas, and his ability and willingness to work with
experimentalists. In the opinion of the Panel, it is extremely important to
support young theorists who can interpret the very large amount of data and have
the potential to take full advantage of them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational
activities and broader impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational aspects and
broader impact of the proposal are seen as strong by the Panel. It is natural
for Prof. Gavin to participate in the education of minorities in an urban
setting due to the location of his home institution. By collaborating with Dr.
Ferreira and planning a case-study based course for pre-service teachers, the PI
goes well beyond the call of duty and is building a firm foundation for a
lifetime of integrated contributions to research and education. He should get an
opportunity to try out his ideas.
