Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0805085&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Peter Albers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate
three sets of problems. First,&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator's PhD thesis
laid the foundations of a&lt;br/&gt;novel approach to functoriality for Floer
homology, and the next&lt;br/&gt;steps in this direction are to remove some
restrictive hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;and to confirm the compatibility of this theory
with the&lt;br/&gt;pair-of-pants product on Floer homology. Second,
Frauenfelder&lt;br/&gt;and the PI have recent established Floer homology for
negative&lt;br/&gt;line bundles, that is, for a class of non-compactly
supported&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian functions in non-compact symplectic manifolds,
and&lt;br/&gt;this theory should be made more robust by removing
symplectic&lt;br/&gt;asphericity hypotheses and should also be extended to
a&lt;br/&gt;Morse-Bott situation. Third, the PI will apply the
Fredholm&lt;br/&gt;theory in polyfolds developed by Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder
to&lt;br/&gt;explore newly emerging invariants from the theory of
polyfolds&lt;br/&gt;with operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is
the study of spaces equipped with the&lt;br/&gt;basic structure that underlies
Hamiltonian mechanics, for which&lt;br/&gt;preferred coordinates give both
position and momentum of a moving&lt;br/&gt;object and in which conservation of
energy is natural and&lt;br/&gt;inevitable. The Floer homology theory referred
to in the first&lt;br/&gt;paragraph studies such manifolds through the critical
point&lt;br/&gt;behaviors of certain auxiliary spaces; this kind of analysis
of&lt;br/&gt;critical points goes back to work of Marston Morse circa
the&lt;br/&gt;1930s, but its application in the modern context requires
new&lt;br/&gt;tools such as the polyfold theory cited above.&lt;br/&gt;
