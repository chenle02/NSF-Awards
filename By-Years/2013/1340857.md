Hybridization (mating and cross-fertilization between different species) is a
widespread natural phenomenon, yet its role in evolution is still debated. Is it
a maladaptive force, usually resulting in sterile, dead-end individuals like
mules? Or does it regularly contribute to adaptation and evolutionary
diversification? A novel approach is proposed that compares long-term
evolutionary change in experimental hybrid and non-hybrid control lines in the
field. The hybrid lines, intended to recreate the early stages of an ancient
natural hybridization, are derived by crossing the parents of a well-studied
wild sunflower. Whether hybridization can increase rates of adaptation and
phenotypic change will be examined by tracking fitness, traits, and quantitative
trait loci (QTL) in the hybrid and control populations over 5-10 generations.
Evolutionary change will be distinguished from phenotypic plasticity by
comparing the lines in common gardens. The long-term predictability of change in
hybrid systems will be examined by assessing whether the experimental hybrids
converge phenotypically and genotypically on the natural hybrid upon which they
are modeled.

The proposed research is the first experimental field study to examine the
impact of hybridization on adaptive evolution over multiple generations in a
wild (non-crop) system. The research supported by this grant will impact science
education at the K-12 and university levels, through annual outreach programs
and a sunflower teaching module for elementary school students. The project will
integrate research and education by training ten undergraduate students, three
graduate students, and two technicians. Based on the current population of the
PI's lab, more than half of the students participating in this grant will be
from underrepresented groups in the sciences.
