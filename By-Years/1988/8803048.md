The objectives of this research program are: 1) To apply the effective continuum
method recently developed by the PI to a host of mass and heat transport
processes involving two-phase media, and, thereby, obtain theoretical
expressions for the relevant effective parameters; 2) To place this method,
which is presently only ad hoc, on a firmer theoretical foundation; 3) To
develop a theory for determining the pair probability function in flowing
systems and thereby compute the dependence of these effective parameters on the
strength and structure of the impressed flow; and 4) To derive theoretical
expressions for the shear induced particle diffusion coefficient in flowing
suspensions and for the enhancement of the mass transfer rate in flowing liquids
by the addition of inert solid particles. These two effects, which play an
important role in a wide variety of physical and biological operations, can at
present be modeled only qualitatively. Effective parameters are currently
computed either via variational techniques (which are generally inaccurate),
exact calculations (which are either very time consuming or very specialized),
or approximate ad hoc models containing adjustable factors which are often
unreliable. In contrast, the effective continuum method developed by the PI is
relatively simple and straightforward, is of great generality and versatility,
and, has been successfully tested against experimental results. This method also
extends the applicability of the continuum representation to systems where the
micro and macro length scales are of comparable magnitude.
