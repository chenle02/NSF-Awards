9412442 Imperiali The focus of this research is the assembly of "compact"
supersecondary structural motifs of 20-40 amino acids in length for the de novo
synthesis of proteins. Specific targets include a triple-stranded antiparallel
beta-sheet motif, structurally based on a domain excised from the homologous
family of alpha-neurotoxins, and alpha,beta,beta and beta, alpha,alpha motifs
patterned after the scorpion toxins and zinc finger proteins respectively. The
studies will evaluate the potential for using tailored motifs for the
preparation of templates, useful in turn, for the costruction of catalysts. %%%
With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Barbara Imperiali of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. Professor Imperiali will
focus her work on understanding and manipulating polypeptide architecture. The
work will involve the assembly of structurally defined polypeptide motifs that
can be used as versatile three dimensional templates for the construction of
catalytically active entities.
