The grant known as "Preservation and Cataloging of Siebert Linguistic Materials"
is of great importance to Native American Linguistics. This project is dedicated
to working with the legendary Dr. Frank T. Siebert in the organization,
dissemination and publication of his Native American research. Dr. Siebert's
knowledge of Penobscot and Catawba linguistics and culture is unsurpassed. The
reconstruction, interpretation and editing of Dr. Siebert's notes, recordings
and field work with his supervision are paramount to the success of this
project. The two main priorities of this project are: 1) The Penobscot
Dictionary; retyping the dictionary, adding additional vocabulary from the
Penobscot Legends I and II, proofing of Penobscot and English translations and
publication. 2) The Penobscot Legends Volume II; editing, layout, and
publishing, including accompanying audio compact disc. In addition archiving and
cataloging of linguistic related papers will continue. Translation of Catawba
stories and other Native American field work will take place as time allows.
Collaborations with Dr. Jim Peterson, Dr. Robert Leavitt and Dr. Blair Rudes
will be ongoing. Preservation and dissemination of information remain the
essence of this project.
