Understanding how language works requires a much better understanding of
languages other than English. The vast bulk of research to date has focused on
English and a few closely-related languages. Many of the outstanding questions –
even about English itself - cannot be answered with data only from English and
related languages. This project greatly expands the information available to
scientists about 16 theoretically-important languages, chosen because they
appear to be impossible according to leading theories. Because language is
central to much of human activity, potential Broader Impacts of a better
understanding of language are vast, including impact on second language
education, language technologies such as speech recognition and AI, and
rehabilitation of language-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia. The
Broader Impacts of this project include supporting language preservation and
revival as well as related goals of the communities that speak the 16 languages.

Specifically, this project produces 'mid-scale' corpora on the order of one
million words per language for each language. While much recent focus is on
massive corpora with billions of words, mid-scale corpora played a critical role
in computational, psycholinguistic, and acquisition studies of English and other
high-resource languages. They are also more feasible. This project takes a
'bootstrapping' approach, first compiling, formatting, and redistributing
existing materials for all 16 languages, including both text-only resources and
audio paired with transcriptions. It then uses cutting edge machine learning to
develop Automatic Speech Recognition for two of the languages and assess its
usefulness in speeding up transcription of new corpus materials. These new
materials are then used to refine the Automatic Speech Recognition, building a
'virtuous cycle' that speeds further work. The method can also be expanded to
other languages. All materials and code are distributed for free in order to
stimulate research and industry. This award is made as part of a funding
partnership between the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment
for the Humanities for the NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure – NEH Documenting
Endangered Languages Program.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
