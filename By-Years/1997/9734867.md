The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. Veronica Bierbaum of
the University of Colorado-Boulder in her continuing studies of the kinetics,
mechanisms and thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule reactions. Dr. Bierbaum
will carry out research in the following areas: 1) the study of symmetric SN2
reactions of methyl chloride as a function of pressure, buffer gas and isotope
substitution, and SN2 reactivity at neutral nitrogen in the gas phase; and 2)
experimental and computational studies of ion thermochemistry to systems of
atmospheric relevance. In addition, she will pursue two new projects: 3) the
study of reactions of ions with nitrogen and oxygen atoms; and 4) chemical
ionization detection of biogenic emissions. The PI will employ a tandem flowing
afterglow-selected ion flow-drift tube coupled with a triple quadrupole detector
to carry out the reactions and monitor products. The experimental results from
this research program will contribute to our fundamental understanding of
reaction kinetics, mechanism, and thermochemistry, as well as provide valuable
comparison with theory. Much of the thermochemical data has relevance to
important combustion and atmospheric processes. The characterization of biogenic
emissions addresses a critical problem in atmospheric chemistry: the sources of
high concentrations of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the earth's troposphere are
not currently understood; however, their impact on atmospheric chemistry is
significant.
