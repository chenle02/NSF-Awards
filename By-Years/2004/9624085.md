9624085 Frangos Almost all tissues are subject to physical and environmental
forces. These tissues, in response, adapt and remodel to accommodate these
forces. Two prime examples are blood vessels and bone. The former respond to the
fluid shear and pressure of blood flow by adapting vessel diameter and
undergoing wall remodelling. The latter responds to the stress, pressure and
interstitial fluid flow due to mechanical loading by adapting and remodelling
bone tissues. Using cell culture techniques, the Principal Investigator's (PI)
research efforts have focussed on understanding the nature and the specific
mechanisms of tissue response to physical forces. Having laid down the
foundation in terms of techniques and understanding of the force-cell
interactions, the I proposes to engineer force bearing tissues such as bone and
cartilage. The overall objective is to develop several types of scaffolding
materials (collagen, bioerodable polymers, and hydrogels) as the structural
framework for bone and cartilage induction to be used as implants and grafts.
