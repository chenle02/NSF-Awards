A century ago, there was a movement to put mathematics on a rigorous, unified
foundation. Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in
mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more
complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that
the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete
axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest
themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in
algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop
both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied
to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and
topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central
theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra
of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the
lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.

The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the
following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-
wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary
amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It
is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a
consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of
piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected
to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of
F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup
of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does
not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable
transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further
developing techniques in pure set theory: methods for studying the combinatorics
of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's
diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at
most aleph1.
