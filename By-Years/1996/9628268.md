9628268 Montgomery The Puget Lowland, Washington, is in the fore-arc region of
the Cascadia convergent margin, where the Juanda Fuca plate is obliquely
converging beneath the North American plate. Associated deformation occurs along
the subducting plate boundary or Benioff zone and also in a wide, complex region
of the upper (North American) plate extending across Northern California,
Oregon, Washington and Southwestern British Columbia. Several models have been
proposed to explain Quaternary deformation in the Cascadia margin, but present
field data is inadequate to evaluate these models. This project will examine how
slip on an active fault in the vicinity of Seattle continues to the South. The
work is a pilot project to determine if surface exposures and seismic data will
be adequate to test a model that suggests that the Seattle fault is part of an
integrated, regional thrust system under the entire Puget-Lowland. If
successful, the results will provide a much needed model framework for
understanding this transtensional tectonic environment, which will also provide
a focus for risk assessment.
