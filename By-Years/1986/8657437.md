This is a Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) award. The research project
involves combined experimental, theoretical, and computational studies of the
structure, bonding, and energetics of geological materials at extreme pressures
and temperatures. High-pressure, high-temperature experiments will be conducted
in laser-heated diamond anvil cells; materials will be examined by a variety of
spectroscopic techniques (e.g. Raman, NMR) at both in-situ and ambient
conditions. The results of these experiments will shape and constrain ab initio
quantum mechanical models of the materials and their physical and chemical
properties. In turn, these studies will provide important constraints on
theoretical models of the composition and dynamic state of the earth's interior.
