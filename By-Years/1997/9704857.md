9704857 Turner This award provides partial support for the ninth and tenth
annual SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conferences, October 10-12, 1997, and
October 9-11, 1998, near Albany, New York. The conferences concentrate on
combinatorial group theory and low dimensional topology. The invited speakers in
1997 are David Epstein, Steve Gersten, Misha Kapovich, Ravi Kulkarni, John
Meier, Alexei Miasnikov, and G. A. Swarup. It is axiomatic that algebraic
topology draws heavily upon group theory, but one charm of the subject of these
conferences is that the flow is substantial in the other direction, with
topology repaying its debt in shedding light on the properties and structure of
groups. ***
