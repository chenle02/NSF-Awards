9614879 Tauxe This grant provides $118,555 as partial support of the costs of
acquiring equipment for the Paleomagnetic Laboratory at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography (SIO). Specifically, the equipment to be purchased will include
a system upgrade for their 2-G enterprises Model 760 superconducting rock
magnetometer (SRM) with DC SQUIDS and a rebuilt cryocooler and new compressor,
degaussing system electronics and coils and an ARM magnetizer for alternating
field experiments, and an automatic sample handler. Additional equipment to be
purchased and/or fabricated "in-house" includes a low temperature cryostat for
their Micromag alternating field gradient magnetometer (AFGM), a furnace for
thermal demagnetization studies, a Kappabridge and other ancillary laboratory
equipment. This equipment will allow paleomagnetists at SIO to conduct further
research on the relative paleointensity recorded in very weakly magnetized
marine sediments from the Ontong-Java Plateau and from sections of the
Cretaceous Normal Superchron, Umbria Italy. Additional studies that will be
enhanced by the capabilities of the new equipment will include but are not
limited to, records of the global paleointensity of the Earth's magnetic field
from submarine basaltic glass collected from DSDP/ODP drill sites into basement,
analyses of the physical properties of geologic materials from examination of
hysteresis loop behavior over a wide range of temperatures, thermal
demagnetization studies of lava flows from the Azores and the Canary Islands to
determine paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field since the early
Pliocene and rock magnetic characterization of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB)
from the southern East Pacific Mid-Ocean Ridge (EPR) to aid in explanation of a
widespread occurrence of a short-wavelength high in sea-surface magnetic
anomalies over ridge axes, termed the Central Anomaly Magnetic High (CAMH). ***
