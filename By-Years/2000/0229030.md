The proposed Tenth Engineering Foundation Conference on risk-based decision
making represents the natural growth of the field and the culmination of the
theory, methodology, and applications in risk assessment and management o water
resources and natural and man-made hazards. The most striking observation is
that the objectives and goals set forth for the first conference in September
1980 in Asilomar, CA and the issues raised in the preface of the 1980
proceedings are as relevant and as timely today as they were then. After the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September II, 200 1, and
the subsequent anthrax mailings, the United States can no longer afford to
respond to threats on an ad hoc basis.
