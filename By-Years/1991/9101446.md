This project will consider spiky behavior of the least energy solution of a
semilinear problem in pattern formation, classification of solutions of the
conformal curvature equations, symmetry of positive solutions of semilinear
elliptic equations, and stability of steady states for a class of semilinear
heat equations. The problems to be addressed are state of the art mathematical
questions motivated by problems in a wide range of scientific areas including
differential geometry, developmental biology, and astronomy.
