This grant will fund a Chinese-American workshop on Non-Invasive Diagnostic
Techniques. The workshop will consist of Presentations on various non-invasive
techniques by both the American and the Chinese participants. The presentations
will be followed by extended discussions about the technologies. It is expected
that as a result of this workshop, innovative technologies and novel techniques
to perform non-invasive diagnosis will be identified. Also, areas for scientific
collaborations between the participants could be identified as a result of the
meeting. The results of the workshop will be the subject of a report written by
the principal investigator.
