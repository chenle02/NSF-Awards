With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington will
acquire a Linux computer cluster system. This equipment will enhance research in
a number of areas including a) ab initio and density functional electronic
structure calculations on organic and organometallic compounds and on their
reactions; b) single molecule magnets; c) development and application of methods
for determining the mechanism and rate of transitions in condensed phases; d)
theoretical and computational modeling of molecular excitation energy flow
associated with chemical events in solution; e) the development and
implementation of new and optimal methods for simulation of free energy
differences; and f) computational studies of transient intermediates of chemical
reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations
is vital to serving the computing needs of active research departments. Such a
"computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization
facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
processing. &lt;br/&gt;
