9404035 Krysan This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Plant Biology. The applicant received his Ph.D. from Stanford
University. His Ph.D. research was to investigate the origin of replication in
human chromosomes. He now plans to change his field of research and carry out
his postdoctoral fellowship research in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Sussman at
University of Wisconsin. The proposed research entitled "Homologous
recombination in Arabidopsis" will expand the scientific experience of this
Fellow into plant biology and make use of his background in the mechanisms of
chromosomal replication in Eukaryotic organisms.
