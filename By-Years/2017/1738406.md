The objective of this conference is to bring together researchers and students
working in the field of applied probability, addressing design and operation of
systems that involve random phenomena. The conferences brings together
researchers in engineering, statistics, mathematics, and computer science and
covers a broad range of topics, from methodological (queuing theory, dynamic
programming, Markov decision process, discrete event dynamic systems, point
processes, large deviations, reliability) to applications (energy, healthcare,
online services), This award will support the participation of graduate students
who will become the next generation of leaders in the applied probability
community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be held at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Illinois, from July 10-12, 2017. It is organized by four
leading researchers in applied probability and brings together intellectual
leaders from a variety of fields. The workshop organizers have identified three
plenary talks and 75 invited and contributed sessions. The participants will
present and reflect upon emerging research in these areas and identify important
directions for future research. The conference will be broadly promoted through
major professional societies such as the Institute for Operations Research and
the Management Sciences (INFORMS) and its Applied Probability Society (APS) and
Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Society (MSOM).
