This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in experimental
nuclear physics involves David J. Morrissey, Thomas Glasmacher, and Paul Mantica
at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State
University, Kirby Kemper and Paul Cottle at Florida State University, and Tiina
Suomijarvia and other researchers at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire, Orsay,
France. The objective of the research is to complete experiments on the elastic
and inelastic scattering reactions of very exotic nuclei. The project takes
advantage of unique capabilities at NSCL and at the French national heavy ion
laboratory known as GANIL.
