&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Distributed source coding
(DSC), also known as distributed compression or the Slepian-Wolf problem, refers
to the compression of two or more physically separated but statistically
correlated information sources, where the sources send the (compressed) data to
a common destination without communicating to each other. Having a close
relation to a wealth of network information theory problems, distributed source
coding is particularly appealing to sensor networks due to its ability to
compress out the inter-source redundancy without explicit inter-sensor
communication. Of specific interest to this research is the algorithmic design
of practical and efficient DSC solutions using powerful channel codes. In view
of the fairly mature status of the advanced channel coding technologies in a
theoretical context and the very pervasive scope of their well-proven practical
applications, exploring what cutting-edge channel codes can offer in this new
field is particularly exciting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on
the theoretic and algorithmic study of lossless and lossy DSC for symmetric and
asymmetric memoryless sources. The goal is to exploit the code binning idea in
capacity-approaching linear channel codes, including turbo codes and low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes, to achieve compression rates that are close to the
theoretical limit. Specific attention is paid to sources that have non-uniform
distributions and/or source-dependent correlations, which are common in
practical applications like sensor networks and multimedia streaming. Techniques
including source decomposition, code splitting, rate combining and post-
processing are used to design efficient coding strategies to match to the
sources. In addition to analysis and simulations, practical issues are also
addressed and a hardware sensor testbed is built to verify and demonstrate the
true performance of these DSC prototypes.
