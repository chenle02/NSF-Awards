AST-0123444&lt;br/&gt;Nisenson, Peter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort is to
design, build, integrate and test a camera system to detect and characterize
extra-solar planetary systems using a unique square aperture and dark speckle in
the field. Direct imaging is extremely difficult because of the large dynamic
range required to separate out the scattered light from the parent star and the
weak reflected light from a planetary object. The camera system will be used
with the 900+ element adaptive optics system at the US Air Force Advanced
Electro-Optical System telescope at Haleakela Hawaii for astronomical research.
