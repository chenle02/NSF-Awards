This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
NYU studying the tension between local and national cultural identities in
France. The student will do an intensive case study of a regional volunteer
theater group, which attempts to present artistic works representing national
"culture" while interpreting them in a way to support the local (regional)
culture. The study will focus on the tension between the group's representation
of national and local culture. This research is important because the nature of
national cultural integration in modern nation states is not well understood.
The recent destruction of states like Yugoslavia show that local and regional
cultural interests can remain vital and alive over many years. This sort of
cultural study will show how such ideas and values are instituted in a local
culture in contradiction to the influences from the national center.
