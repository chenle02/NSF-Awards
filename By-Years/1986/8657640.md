Dr. David M. Hillis's research interests concern the analysis of ribosomal
genes of representatives of each of the families of frogs, as well as other
amphibians. Such molecular techniques are extremely powerful as a means of
recovering evolutionary history over the hundreds of millions of years of
amphibian evolution. This work includes sequencing a portion of the 28S
ribosomal RNA gene that contains numerous insertions (added lengths of genetic
code). In addition, two other problems occupy Hillis's attention. First, he is
involved in efforts to isolate and identify specific gene fragments from well-
preserved 10,000 year old human remains found at Little Salt Spring, Florida.
Second, he is studying the genetics of the highly polymorphic tree snail Liguus
fasciatus, which has proven to consist of populations that reproduce with
genetic recombination in some locations but clonally and without genetic
recombination at others. Dr. Hillis's academic institution is the University of
Texas at Austin. Funding is provided through a Presidential Young Investigator
Award for a duration of five years.
