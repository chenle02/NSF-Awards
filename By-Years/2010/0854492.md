0854492&lt;br/&gt;Xing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Onboard CBCT integrated with Linac
is now available for patient set up and therapeutic guidance. For these
volumetric CBCTs to realize their full potential and enjoy broad clinical
acceptance, the scatter must be removed and imaging dose must be significantly
reduced while maintaining the advantages of conventional CT. This study will
enhance understanding of noise and scatter behaviors in CBCT and gain useful
knowledge on how to effectively remove the undesirable signals while reserving
the edge information.&lt;br/&gt;The approach proposed has the potential to
significantly change the way clinical systems are designed today, and could
facilitate the design and translation into the clinic of new, large volume CT
imaging systems. This research should lead to a significant advance in CBCT to
fully realize the technical capacity of volumetric imaging. The methodology and
techniques developed by this study may also be applicable for solving similar
problems in other related bioengineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion
of this project will provide radiation oncology and related fields needed high
quality volumetric imaging with reduced patient radiation dose. The proposed
technique will allow physicians to better see the patient anatomy especially the
low contrast tissues and more accurately define the tumor target volume. The
improved image quality will also make it possible to use CBCT for accurate dose
calculation and dose reconstruction. This will lay the foundation for next
generation of adaptive therapy to optimally compensate for the patient setup
error and inter-fractional anatomy change.&lt;br/&gt;
