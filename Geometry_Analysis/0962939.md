This award provides support for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers
participating in the twenty-fifth meeting in the series of Shanks Conferences
and Lectures, held 17-20 May 2010 at Vanderbilt University. The conference
encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D.
recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.

The conference centers on the structure of interacting systems under various
physical constraints, with particular emphasis on systems of particles
interacting through a pair-wise potential with motion restricted to the unit
sphere of given dimension. The conference focuses on (a) relationships between
geometrical, topological, and combinatorial properties of a manifold that are
reflected in the asymptotics of minimal energy problems; (b) the analysis and
development of statistical mechanical models from first principles; (c) tilings
and Voronoi decompositions; (d) high-dimensional sphere packings; (e) the
geometry of the structure of jammed and near optimal configurations; and (f) the
asymptotics of the zeros of random polynomials.

The meeting features a distinguished lecture by number theorist Noam Elkies,
eight invited plenary speakers, special sessions for talks by other
participants, and a poster session for graduate student research. The conference
highlights significant recent developments and provides a forum for the
participants to meet and jointly explore open problems of common interest in an
informal atmosphere.
