Kieve Science Camp for Girls is a one-week residential experience for 60 fourth,
fifth, and sixth graders from three rural and poor Maine communities. Building
on research and the expertise of Kieve Science Camp instructors and the Kieve
Leadership Decisions Institute, this program is designed to tackle issues known
to stifle the confidence and enthusiasm of girls in science. All activities will
be hands-on. Kieve recognizes the importance of informal education: asking
questions, exploring, designing, testing, trying again, and reaching decisions
based on direct application and evidence will be the daily bread at camp. Group
problem-solving challenges, requiring collaboration, and risk-taking, often a
new skill for girls, will be encouraged throughout the program and on the ropes
and adventure course. An important goal is a positive attitudinal shift: girls
should think science is fun, important in their lives, and that they can be full
participants in the scientific world which they inhabit. The carefully selected
female instructors and staff address the importance of role models. The
inclusion of two teachers from each home school will sustain the successes of
the Kieve experience and further spread the Kieve educational methodology.
Project staff will document and evaluate this program for the purpose of
replication.
