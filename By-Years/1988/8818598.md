This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Yeong E. Kim, Department of Physics,
Purdue University, to pursue with Dr. Il-Tong Cheong, Department of Physics,
Yonsei University, for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative
theoretical research on pion-nucleus reactions. These nuclear reactions will be
investigated on the basis of the quark bag model. The researchers will calculate
the pion photoproduction of light nuclei, the pion photoproduction by the three-
nucleon systems, helium-3 and tritium, and the pion photoproduction by nuclei
heavier than helium-3. This project brings together two very talented nuclear
theorists to work on a topic of current interest using calculational techniques
that hold a good deal of promise for success. Various models to be tested
include those involving quarks and quark-antiquark pairs for processes that also
can be studied experimentally. The collaborators are highly respected workers in
the field of this research. This project is //
