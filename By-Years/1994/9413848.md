9413848 Higgins This award is for the acquisition of semiconductor processing
and testing equipment to make components necessary for efficient
electronic/photonic interfaces. Georgia Institute of Technology has developed
"hybrid integration" techniques that allow rf and optoelectronic functions to be
incorporated on chips with costs comparable to standard chips. The equipment
includes a molecular beam epitaxy unit for optoelectronic materials, a plasma-
enhanced chemical vapor deposition unit for deposition of dielectric films, an
ion etcher, a flip-chip aligner, a very high speed tester and polarization
analyzer, and a workstation cluster for computational work. The equipment
supports the design, fabrication, and testing of communications and network
interface components including serial optoelectronic and wireless hybrid
integrated interfaces, parallel network interfaces, and wave-division multiplex
interfaces. ***
