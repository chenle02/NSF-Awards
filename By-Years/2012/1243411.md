This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
Tenth East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium (ECOAS), to be held at the
University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee, on October 6-7, 2012.

This will be the tenth annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra
Symposium series. The first meeting in the series was held at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003, and since then meetings have been
held each Fall. The focus of the meetings is on operator algebras and
noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from number
theory to quantum physics. In addition to facilitating interaction between
researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in
which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the
Eastern region of the United States can acquaint themselves with current issues
at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior
mathematicians in the field.
