The geographic isolation and severe resource limitations of schools in the
Northeast Tennessee region of Appalachia make the recruitment and retention of
STEM teachers a challenge. The Northeast Tennessee Robert Noyce Scholarship
Program is a three-pronged approach to the lack of opportunity, financial
ability, and support that prevent many from becoming high school mathematics
teachers. The project is recruiting and forming cohorts of future teachers via
summer internships. These undergraduates are "mentored mentors" who are
integrated into existing programs for high school students. Interns are exposed
to the central focus of their possible future career - that of working with high
school students through instruction, projects, and dialogue. While doing so,
they themselves are mentored on how best to interact with these high school
students. The project is providing scholarships to 24 junior and senior
mathematics majors who are preparing to become teachers. Networking of inservice
and cohort teachers is facilitated via enrichment activities especially in the
areas of computational science and instructional technology. An academic year
lecture/workshop/discussion series features modern technologies such as webinars
and remote location participation. Noyce scholar cohorts are designing and
organizing extra-curricular activities, most of which involve in-service
teachers. This introduces the scholars to their future colleagues and exposes
them to the non-instructional aspects of a career as a STEM high school
instructor, giving them a solid view of their future jobs before they graduate
from college.
