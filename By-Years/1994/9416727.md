9416727 Golbeck This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in
a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Dynamic Aspects of Photochemical Reaction Centers, to be
held in Tokyo in January 1995. The seminar is part of the U.S.-Japan
Photosynthesis/Photoconversion Program. The U.S. organizer is Professor John
Golbeck, Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska, and the Japanese
co-organizer is Professor Tetsuo Hiyama, Department of Biochemistry, Saitama
University, Saitama, Japan. The agenda for the meeting is divided into three
parts: Generation of Reducing Power: Dynamic Aspects of Photosystem I;
Generation of Oxidizing Power: Aspects of Photosystem II Structure and Function;
and Dynamic Aspects of Photosystem II: Oxygen Evolution. Participants from both
countries are from universities, national research labs, and industrial research
labs. The purpose of the meeting is to generate interest among in further
collaborative work in molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics of the
higher plant photosynthetic reaction centers in both countries. ***
