This grant provides for the continuing operation and analysis of data from the
high frequency (HF) coherent scatter radar that was installed at Halley Bay
Station, Antarctica under a previous grant. The radar, part of the Polar Anglo-
American Conjugate Experiment (PACE) is magnetically conjugate to a nearly
identical radar operated at Goose Bay, Labrador. Funding is provided for the
Goose Bay radar by the Atmospheric Science Division of NSF. In addition to the
conjugate objective, the radar has a field of view that includes the region
above South Pole Station. HF coherent radars can detect and measure the velocity
of patches of excess ionization in the upper atmosphere, and as a consequence
they are very useful for studying the dynamics of the polar cap region. The PACE
radars are for the first time providing the means to study the simultaneous
behavior of the ionosphere in both the northern and southern polar caps.
