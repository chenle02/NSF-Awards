The focus of Dr. Keshner's work is to determine the relationship between neck
muscle activation patterns and changes at the intervertebral joints. During
performance of slow, sinusoidal tracking movements of the head, muscle
electromyographic recordings will be made simultaneously with fluoroscopic
images of vertebral motion. Recordings from eight neck muscles and fluoroscopic
images of seven cervical vertebrae will be stored on-line for later analysis.
Correlational measures will be performed to explore the force-velocity
relationships between individual neck muscles and the cervical intervertebral
joints. Intra- and inter-subject variability will also be examined to determine
whether variabililty in the motor system produces variations in the joint
displacement patterns. This work will contribute to basic knowledge about how
motor programs are organized with respect to the anatomical constraints of the
motor system.
