Proposal Title: CEOSE Mini-Symposium on Women of Color in STEM: Perspectives on
Experiences, Research, Evaluation, and Policy in Higher Education and
Careers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: OIA ?
0953861&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award to TERC, Inc. of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, provides support for a mini-symposium focused on women of color
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This mini-symposium
is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington,
Virginia, on October 27-28, 2009. Goals of this event are 1) to bring together
scholars, practitioners, program directors, students, and members of the
Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) to focus on
current issues, and understandings in STEM education for women of color, and 2)
to consider potential directions for future actions in research, programs, and
policy to increase this population?s representation in STEM education and
careers. Products include a summary of findings and a book, summarizing
information shared during the mini-symposium, as well as supplemental data. The
results of this mini-symposium will enable CEOSE to make informed
recommendations to NSF on how to better address challenges and barriers that
women of color encounter as they prepare for and enter into STEM fields.
Ultimately, the results of this mini-symposium will be beneficial to the STEM
community. These beneficial results are those that include the identification
and discussion of challenges and barriers and the laying of the foundation for
strategies to negate negative impact on earning degrees by and increasing the
workforce population of women of color in STEM fields. &lt;br/&gt;
