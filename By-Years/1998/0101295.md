This is funding in support of a doctoral research consortium (workshop) of
promising graduate students and distinguished research faculty. The consortium
will be held in conjunction with the ACM 2001 Conference on Human Factors in
Computing Systems (CHI 2001), sponsored by the Association for Computing
Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The
goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who
will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the
work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them
advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend
their research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations
of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty
panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how
their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research,
whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects,
whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their
results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Student participants will also
present their work during the technical program of the CHI 2001 conference.
Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via publication in
the CHI 2001 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic
distribution. Evaluation of the consortium will be conducted by ACM SIGCHI's
conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be available
to the organizers of future consortia.
