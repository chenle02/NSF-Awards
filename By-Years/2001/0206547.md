The dynamics and the stable isotope geochemistry of methane in wet, tropical
forest soils are poorly understood, compromising our ability to predict rates of
methane flux and 13 C exchange with the atmosphere. Quantifying the source/sink
strength and * 13 C signature of methane flux is crucial if we hope to evaluate
the role of the tropics in the global methane budget. In systems where redox
fluctuates, such as wet tropical forest soils, variations in oxygen influence
methane emissions by altering the balance between methanogenesis and methane
oxidation. This study explores the effects of oxygen variations on
methanogenesis, methane oxidation and 13 C exchange with the atmosphere.
Patterns of methane flux and 13 C exchange will be documented across natural
gradients of oxygen in the field. Sources and sinks of methane will be
identified, both in soil and across the landscape, through gas concentrations
and stable isotope analysis. A series of mechanistic laboratory experiments will
be performed to explore the effects of oxygen variation on gross methanogenesis,
methane oxidation and stable isotope fractionation. This study will advance our
knowledge of the factors that regulate methane and 13 C flux from wet tropical
forests to the atmosphere.
