This project facilitates the development and implementation of an upper-
division immunology course (Basic and Applied Immunology). This course fills
several existing gaps in the biology curriculum and may help retain students in
the Biology Department. By applying the newly acquired animal housing materials,
biosafety cabinets, CO2 incubators, pipetting equipment, refrigerated tabletop
centrifuge, X-irradiation cabinet, microplate washer, and data-acquisition
software into the new teaching approach, students are able to learn traditional
immunochemistry, in addition to contemporary humoral, cellular, and molecular
immunology, through an innovative hands-on learning process. The new equipment
is being used in conjunction with on-hand immunology laboratory equipment. After
sufficient instruction and training, students use the equipment to design and
perform experiments. During this process, they learn aseptic technique, gain
familiarity with recent technologies, and apply statistical analyses to their
data. This approach is an improvement to conventional, passive approaches that
require students to perform only limited steps in predesigned experiments.
Furthermore, the instructor for the laboratory functions as an educator rather
than as a technician. This approach empowers students in the classroom, develops
critical thinking and scientific writing skills, teaches students contemporary
immunology techniques and equipment applications using a relevant disease model,
fosters collaboration and interaction among students, promotes communication
skills and dissemination of student work, and facilitates student networking
with other immunologists. Equipment used in this project can also be used in
undergraduate immunology research and by other courses in biology and chemistry.
