Poverty is increasing in America, especially among young people. Teenagers who
are poor earn lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school than
teenagers who are not poor. The amount of schooling that teenagers complete
determines the opportunities they have for work and, as a result, the amount of
money they earn for the rest of their life. Despite the large amount of research
on poverty and schooling, there has yet to be a study about the way that
teenagers who are poor are treated at school. These experiences may make
teenagers feel like that they do not belong at school and, in turn, this may
lead to their academic underperformance. Thus, this study creates a new tool to
measure the experiences teenagers have at school. Interviews are used to find
out how teenagers who are poor are treated by friends, teachers, and staff. This
information is used for a survey that will also include academic outcomes. This
study reveals how teenagers who are poor are treated at school and how this is
related to their schooling. Findings have the potential to inform policies aimed
at reducing the effect of poverty on schooling.

This study develops a new tool to measure the experiences that teenagers who are
poor have at school. A broad definition of poverty is used that includes social
class, such as parental income, education, and occupation. A mixed-methods
research design is used that includes interviews and surveys. Interviews are
conducted with teenagers to understand how they are treated in school because of
their social class. This includes teenagersâ€™ experiences with discrimination by
friends, teachers, and staff. The information from the interviews is used to
inform the development of a new measure, leading to a survey using the new
measure and academic outcomes, such as achievement and school completion. This
study reflects the early stages of a line of research that can dramatically
change our understanding of the effect of poverty on academic outcomes. In
addition to the large amount of knowledge this study will generate, we advance a
new interdiscplinary theoretical model that integrates developmental, social,
counseling, and educational perspectives. The tool created provides a new way to
study how poverty is related to schooling in America.
