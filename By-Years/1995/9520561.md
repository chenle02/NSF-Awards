9520561 Dorsinville The PI plans to fabricate organic light emitting diodes
(LEDs) and study their characteristics. He proposes to take advantage of the
high luminescent quantum efficiency and extremely narrow emission bands of
organo-metallic complexes of lanthanide ions (Ln3+) to fabricate and
characterize efficient and bright electroluminescent devices. The PI also plans
to investigate polymer emitters with a well defined microstructure to study the
role of structural changes on the efficiency of photoluminescence and
electroluminescence. He will carry out FTIR, EPR, Raman, steady state and time
resolved photoluminescence and photoconductivity measurements to gain a good
understanding of the nature of the different physical processes in emitter
materials. Specific issues to be addressed in the framework of this project is
the synthesis of new polymer emitters and the improvement of long term stability
of organic electroluminescent devices. ***
