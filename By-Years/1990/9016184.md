This award will support Professor Lawrence Cerny of Utica College in a research
collaboration with Professor Piero Foscolo of the University of L'Aquila, Italy.
The inves- tigators intend to carry out research in the area of particle and
particle-fluid interactions in solid-liquid suspensions. Fluidization and
sedimentation approaches will be combined using red blood cells as a novel
source of particles. One of the problems encountered in the testing of bed
fluidization theories is the discrepancy occurring as the size of the bed
particle is reduced to the micron level as well as when density differences
between the particle and the fluid approach unity. This has been recently
addressed by the Italian research group. To date they have been limited in these
studies with spherical particles with a diameter of 1 mm and a density of 1.26
gm/ml. By incorporating the U.S. researcher's approach using erythrocytes, from
either human or bovine blood, these investigations can be extended and provide a
new model for particles with little or no interactions between them.
