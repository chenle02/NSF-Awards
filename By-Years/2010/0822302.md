This project anticipates the needs of learners in ten years by developing and
testing two learning simulations that are immersive, interactive and
participatory and use augmented reality in the outdoors. The students (each with
a separate role to play) work in teams to investigate phenomena and solve
problems in a gaming environment using wireless handheld GPS units. This model
leverages devices that students already own and use in their extracurricular
activities and gets students out of the classroom to play the game in their
local environments, allowing for the construction of knowledge that is situated
and tacit. Using a design-based, mixed methods approach, the researchers examine
the relationships among augmented reality, learning in science, socio-emotional
outcomes (engagement and self-efficacy) and the demographic characteristics of
rural, underserved students in a few middle schools in southwest Virginia.
Quantitative instrumentation is developed to clarify the conceptual foundations
and identify contextual factors that could lead to general conditions for
successful educational use of augmented reality. In addition, the researchers
document teachers' and students' descriptions of how participating in a
technology-mediated narrative in the outdoor Augmented reality simulation
enhances or impedes teaching and learning science and mathematics concepts.
