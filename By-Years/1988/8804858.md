This proposal requests funds to obtain a 300 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Spectrometer. The instrument will be used for research in the following areas of
biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. 1. enzyme mechanisms and molecular
bases of enzyme inhibition 2. mechanism of DNA cleavage by neocarzinostatin and
related antitumor proteins 3. mobility of lipid membrane phases and action of
anesthetic molecules 4. conformation of peptides with hormonal activity 5.
metabolism and mechanisms of interconversion of retinoids in visual pigment
biology 6. two-dimensional NMR studies of the conformation of peptide fragments
of parathyroid hormone and humoral hypercalcemia factor The nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometer will be a truly significant addition to the Department's
instrumentation capabilities, enhancing both current and future research
efforts.
