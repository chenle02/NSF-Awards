This award provides travel and logistical support for the first major workshop
on financial engineering to grow out of NSF's recent ventures into engineering
the service sectors. The meeting involves 40-50 participants and takes place
March 5-7, 2003 at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Workshop
participants will discuss all topics on which DMII's Service Engineering Program
is beginning to provide support, including portfolio optimization, risk
management, and modeling of financial derivatives. The workshop will offer both
a mini-symposium on recent developments and an effort to set the agenda for
future research. Beyond NSF, support will also come from the University and from
companies interested in financial engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Financial
institutions are among the most rapidly growing part of the service sector of
the economy. The associated modeling and analysis activity, known collectively
as "financial engineering," is a growing area of research which is highly
mathematical and well suited to the skills and backgrounds of the operations
research community. This workshop has the potential to cement that relationship
by assembling all the interested communities for the first time under NSF
auspices. &lt;br/&gt;
