Finite State Machine (FSM)-based computations have played critical roles in a
variety of important applications, ranging from cyber security and data
analytics to software engineering and hardware design. Due to the growing data
volumes and limitations on computer processing power, nowadays FSM efficiency is
greatly constrained, and a new dimension of efficiency optimization is desired.
This project proposes a novel framework to enhance the computing efficiency of
FSM-based computations on GPUs. The combination of GPU acceleration and
speculative parallelization developed in the proposed framework shows promise
for boosting performance of FSM computations and presents the potential to
optimize even more general non-FSM computations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research investigates how to build up the synergy between highly-parallel GPU
architectures and FSM computations. The key idea is exploring multiple
dimensions of parallelism for increasing compute utilization as well as reducing
data-movement overheads. Additionally, this research designs and integrates
advanced speculative parallelization into FSM computations. The advanced
speculative parallelization not only enables more effective predictors on
different FSMs, it also provides efficient speculative-thread scheduling. All
these optimizations will be built into a framework that further explores the
trade-offs between different objectives and automatically optimizes application
configurations based on the given objectives. Finally, this research seeks to
enlarge the applicability of the envisioned results, and it brings the
preliminary exploration about a new dimension of computing efficiency for
irregular computations as well as applications associated with speculative
parallelization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
