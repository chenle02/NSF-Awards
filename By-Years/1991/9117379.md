This project involves the Caribbean bluehead wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum. It
has two major objectives: Through experimental manipulation, it will investigate
the causal relationship between natural selection and male features that prior
correlation studies have suggested to be important. Other investigations have
assumed that particular features convey fitness, but have not established the
causal connection through experimentation. The experiments in this section
represent the first comprehensive field investigation into the direct fitness
consequences to females for expressing a mating preference. Through a series of
successive removals and replacements of males on a reef, females will be
repeatedly challenged to make choices among males who are highly variable in a
feature shown to be important in mate choice. From this, one can estimate
consistency and variability of mate choice among females, the consequences of
expressing a choice in terms of fecundity, fertilization rate, and growth, and
also identify the source of the benefit (male or female). The results have
important applications in sorting through alternative explanations for the
evolution of mating preferences.
