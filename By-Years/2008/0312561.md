Lebeck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Architectural Support for
Service Level
Agreements&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data
centers comprise an integral part of today's internet-based computing
infrastructure upon which society relies. Applications ranging from e-commerce
and web servers to grid computing for scientific research use the computation
and storage provided by data centers. By consolidating resources, including
hardware and system administration, data center customers can reduce expenses.
However, customers expect a reasonable level of service from data centers, even
with varying demand for the services these systems provide. To maximize service
across all customers, a data center can provide differentiated service levels to
various applications (customers) based on a contracted Service Level Agreement
(SLA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SLAs specify requirements in terms of agreed upon
metrics (e.g., performance, availability, output bandwidth, server load), and
they usually include several price points for different service levels.
Unfortunately, with multithreaded system models (e.g., multiprocessors) simple
extensions to conventional uniprocessor metrics can be misleading. The challenge
is to develop metrics that bridge the gap between low-level hardware behavior
and high-level metrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research addresses
this need by exploring a design space that includes SLA metrics, system models,
hardware-level metrics, and implementations. The project will develop hardware-
level metrics by considering both the system model and the intended use of the
metric. Once the metric is defined, various hardware implementations can be
explored. A case study SLA performance metric and a corresponding hardware
metric called Critical Instructions Per Cycle (CIPC) have been developed.
Preliminary results with full-system simulation and commercial workloads
reinforce the hypothesis that metrics must capture the behavior of low-level
hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
