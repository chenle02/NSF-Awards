A user mode research program will be carried out in nuclear structure studies
of few body systems using radiative capture and pion production. The work will
be carried out at IUCF. Improved understanding of NN potentials, meson exchange
currents, and off-shell effects will be obtained. Of particular importance are
polarization measurements, which will provide new insights into these processes.
Simulations, detector development, data analysis, interpretation, and other
related activities will be carried out at the University of Kentucky.
