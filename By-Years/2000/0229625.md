The Miami Museum of Science, in collaboration with the Science Museum of
Minnesota, will develop a 5000-sq. ft. interactive, bilingual traveling
exhibition titled "Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other&lt;br/&gt;Riches."
The exhibition will immerse visitors in the Amazon's rich diversity through
direct contact with some of its most (ill-deservedly) notorious denizens.
Spotlighting the rarely seen research conducted by renowned North- and South
American scientists, "Amazon Voyage" will present visitors with the scientists'
ongoing work. Visitors will discover that economy and ecology of the Amazon are
intertwined, and explore their own connection to this region through the global
trade in ornamental fish, arriving at a heightened appreciation of how personal
choices can influence environmental outcomes.
