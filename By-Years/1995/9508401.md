9508401 Nurmikko The goal of this research is to initiate the development of a
new generation of blue-green semiconductor lasers, based on vertical cavity and
microresonator devices. The lasers are based on wide bandgap II-VI
semiconductors which have recently seen a brisk pace of development in the
conventional edge emitter geometry. The principal investigator's group has been
a part of these advances and has achieved considerable experience in the physics
and engineering of these quantum well heterostructure devices, expertise that
will be of direct benefit in the proposed research. For example, spectroscopic
characterization of gain, application of bandgap engineering techniques for
electrical contacts, nanostructure fabrication techniques, and low temperature
device processing methods have been accomplished. From applications point of
view, the emergence of compact blue-green lasers has significant potential
impact on optical storage, display, and printing technologies. ***
