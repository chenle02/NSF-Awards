This proposal involves synthesis and characterization of several new families
of materials. Aryl gels are glass-like substances containing rigid-rod organic
spacers inserted at regular intervals in a silicate-like network. The materials
may be considered a hybrid of inorganic silicates and organic network polymers.
Their synthesis is achieved by hydrolytic condensation of bis(trialkoxysilyl)
aryl monomers and related derivatives using sol-gel chemistry. The mild
conditions for their preparation coupled with the structural diversity of the
organic component of the building block provides an opportunity for"engineering"
the morphology of the resulting material. The proposed research will examine the
relationship between monomer or "building block" structure and the morphology of
the resulting material. These materials have potential applications in a
diversity of areas including optical devices, chromatographic supports, and as
molecular sieves. In a related study, new ionomeric materials containing
hypervalent siliconates as the basic building block will be prepared. These
materials have virtually no known analogues in nature. They hold promise as
materials with unusual mechanical and ion conducting properties. This project is
supported jointly by the Division of Materials Research, and the Chemistry
Division.
