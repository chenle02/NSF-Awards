This award funds the research activities of Professor James Unwin at the
University of Illinois, Chicago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for dark matter
to explain astrophysical observations is widely accepted. However, the nature of
dark matter remains one of the central questions in contemporary physics.
Moreover, the existence of dark matter is one of the most compelling indications
that there are likely new fundamental particles and phenomena to be discovered.
Accordingly, research on this topic advances the national interest by promoting
the progress of science by furthering our understanding of the physical universe
and the laws which govern it. Professor Unwinâ€™s research seeks to better
understand the nature of dark matter. As such, his research lies at the
intersection of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Furthermore, this
project will have significant broader impacts including the training of graduate
students, the mentoring of high-school and undergraduate students, and the
promotion of scientific careers to young women through dedicated outreach
events. The results of this research will be disseminated through peer-reviewed
journals, seminars, and public lectures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, in this research Professor Unwin will seek to develop a new class
of dark-matter indirect-detection searches, to obtain new constraints on dark-
matter models in the presence of primordial black holes, and to explore novel
possibilities that link dark matter to other phenomena, such as the emergence of
the observed baryon asymmetry and the process of electroweak symmetry breaking.
Indeed, this work is pertinent in its timing since over the next few years there
will be new relevant data from multiple complementary
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
