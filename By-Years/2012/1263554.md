The primary goal of the project involves linguistic field work on Mehek (nux),
an endangered language in the Tama branch of the Sepik family. It is spoken in
several villages, the primary of which is Nuku, in Sandaun Province in northwest
Papua New Guinea. Adam Hatfield will collect data primarily via direct note-
taking and transcription of recorded stories from consultant speech as well as
making corrections to data which has already been collected. The project goal is
to produce a grammar and dictionary of the language. The latter will, in
particular, be utilized directly by the community members in both teaching
children and as a reference for adults. In addition to providing a dictionary,
community members have requested that many of their traditional stories be
written and translated into both English and Tok Pisin (the national language of
Papua New Guinea).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many linguists estimate that more than
half the languages currently spoken in the world will be extinct by the end of
this century. New Guinea is a unique linguistic area in that one fifth of the
languages of the world (approximately 1200 out of about 6000, a more
conservative estimate than is often cited) are spoken there. But in many areas
of Papua New Guinea, the creole Tok Pisin is rapidly replacing the original
vernacular languages. For Mehek, the youngest children no longer speak the
vernacular language. And since the reasons why Tok Pisin is taking over so
rapidly in this part of Papua New Guinea apply equally well to most areas of the
country, it may well be the case that there are many languages in the country
that are no longer spoken by young children, hence the need to document, at
least to some extent, as many languages of New Guinea as possible as soon as
possible.
