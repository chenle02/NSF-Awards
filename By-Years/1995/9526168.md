This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Colorado in the
purchase of a tunable Femtosecond laser system. This equipment will be used in
the following areas of research: (1) Mechanism of pericyclic photochemical
reactions, (2) structure of gaseous cluster ions, (3) dynamics of photoinduced
bond homolysis and heterolysis. A tunable femtosecond laser can provide
important information about chemical reactivity. Its use may enable
breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and of
nonreactive molecules. f8 Û-ª þ ; + + Ûª▓ ÑOh ª' +'ª▒0 Ý + ] $ H l + ¢ ╗ D h +
