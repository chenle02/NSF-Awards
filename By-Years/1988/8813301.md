Dr. Snell proposes to study a newly described secretory event induced during
sexual signalling in the biflagellate alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When mt+
and mt- Chlamydomonas gametes are mixed together, they adhere to each other via
adhesion molecules located on their flagellar surfaces. This specific
recognition event generates a signal, involving cyclic AMP, leading to
activation of actin-filled, acrosome-like mating structures and release of a
metalloprotease, lysin. Lysin is responsible for the release and degradation of
the cell wall, thus permitting cell fusion and zygote formation. Dr. Snell
recently discovered that lysin is stored as an inactive, higher molecular
weight, active form by a converting enzyme released during mating. In the
studies proposed here he will use standard biochemical methods to isolate and
purify the molecule responsible for conversion. The starting material will be
the medium collected from mating gametes that had previously been de- walled by
the addition of exogenous lysin. Dr. Snell will test the hypothesis that the
converting activity is a protease stored in membrane-bounded, intracellular
granules. Antibodies will be made against the purified molecule for use in
immunolocalization studies at both the light and electron microscopic levels.
This work should provide new information about how signal transduction mediated
by cell-cell contact brings about a regulated secretory event. %%% The process
of fertilization requires that the male and female gamete adhere to each other
and subsequently fuse. This requires the limited, localized breakdown of the
structures surrounding the cells. Dr. Snell is investigating how the interaction
of the gametes triggers the controlled and localized degradation of the
constituents surrounding the cells. This will provide detailed molecular
information about the requirements for successful fertilization in this model
organism.
