This project will support attendance by early-career scientists at the Keystone
Symposia on Plant Epigenetics: From Genotype to Phenotype, to be held in Taos,
NM on February 15-19, 2016. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks
and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal
settings. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results
and for exploring collaborative possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field
of Plant Epigenetics and the emphasis on understanding genotype to phenotype
relationships continues to promise new and insightful mechanistic discoveries.
This conference will provide a forum to discuss new discoveries, as well as the
role of epigenetics in crop improvement and the potential for using epigenetic
approaches for increasing crop productivity in the face of variable climate and
environmental stresses. In addition, the meeting will provide opportunities to
share updates on novel methodologies and methods for analysis that help address
the need for new bioinformatics methods and infrastructure for sharing results.
A primary goal of the conference is to grow the community of researchers
studying or using plant epigenetics, especially those from underrepresented
groups.
