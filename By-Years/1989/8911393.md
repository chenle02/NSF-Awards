Dr. Humphreys is investigating the ways in which computer simulation methods
can and cannot be adequately accommodated within existing philosophical accounts
of scientific method. He is placing particular emphasis on the relationships
between laws and specific conditions, on the role of analogical reasoning in the
construction of simulation models, and the effects that the absence of an
explicit deductive structure in the models has on our understanding of these
models. The research will focus during the first part of the grant period on
models in physics and astronomy, especially those that use Monte Carlo
estimation techniques. During the second half of the grant period, he will focus
on identifiability issues in social science models. While carrying out the
research, he will make various points of connection with current work in
cognitive science that uses simulation methods.
