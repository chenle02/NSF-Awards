Stable carbon isotope ratios represent a newly available technique for
assessing integrated plant responses to environmental stress. These isotope
ratios offer the unique advantage of yielding time-averaged data about long term
conditions and adaptations. The objectives of this study are to delineate the
environmental parameters, such as vapor pressure deficit, temperature,
respiratory fraction and soil nitrogen which exert control over stable carbon
isotope ratios and to assess how different strategies of adaptation to water
stress are expressed on a physiological level. Environmental factors which
influence carbon isotope discrimination will be investigated in a series of
controlled laboratory experiments and field studies. Two study species which
utilize contrasting ecophysiologic strategies for adaptation to environmental
stress will be studied. One of these is the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), a
dominate evergreen shrub throughout the southwestern deserts of the United
States. The second species is the ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha), an
ecologically wide ranging forest tree in the Hawaiian Islands. A model will be
developed to predict water stress responses from 13C values, and tested by
sampling tissues for 13C, and comparing predicted with measured parameters in
plants growing under controlled conditions in the laboratory and in the field
along a gradient of soil water availability. The information gathered in this
study is expected to provide the basis for wide-ranging application of this
isotopic technique and provide new insights into the nature of plant adaptation
to environmental stress.
