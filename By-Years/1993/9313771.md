Larson The research centers on experimental studies of the photodetachment of
negative ions in external fields through the production and detection of
wavepackets using picosecond and subpicosecond laser pulses. Penning traps are
used to contain the negative ions. A second project, the study of two electron
correlations in alkali negative ions will shed light on the threshold laws for
the ejection of two electrons by electromagnetic radiation.
