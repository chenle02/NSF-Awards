0204811&lt;br/&gt;Fetea&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current understanding of both
nuclear structure and nucleo-synthesis is largely based on what is known of the
properties of stable and long-lived near-stable nuclei. An unexplored landscape
containing more than 90% of all expected bound nuclear systems, a region where
many new nuclear phenomena are anticipated still needs to be explored. Early
experiments on unstable nuclei have already revealed surprises. Such phenomena
as halo nuclei suggest that some of the cherished concepts of nuclear structure
may apply only to a set of relatively stable nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will theoretically study, the nuclei in the and 160 mass regions. These
nuclei have shown a number of features that challenge our understanding of
nuclear structure, of particular interest being the signature
splitting/inversion and "chiral twin bands" phenomena. Calculations in various
model frameworks (particle rotor model including both a residual pn interaction
and a deformation, total routhian surface calculations, cranking shell and
tilted axis cranking model) will be performed to elucidate the underlying
physical properties responsible for the signature splitting/inversion and
"chiral twin bands" phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The involvement of
undergraduate students in this research project will enhance students' interest
in physics and provide a training environment for their preparation for
mainstream study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
