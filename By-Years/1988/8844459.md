Dr. Tsuji has been carrying out his research at Scripps for the past ten or so
years and has now officially moved his grant. He, until recently was a part-time
VA employee attached to the University of Southern California, which had been
administering his grant. He is now on official leave at the Osaka Bioscience
Institute. He will be returning at intervals. As it is the bioluminescent work
will continue at both places.
