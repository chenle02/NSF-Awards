This award provides support for student attendance at a cutting edge Symposium
on Mechanobiology and Mechanotransduction during the Biomedical Engineering
Society Fall Meeting 2011. The objectives of this symposium are three-
fold:&lt;br/&gt;(1) To highlight the most recent advances on molecular and
mechanisms and the genetic basis for mechanobiology and
mechanotransduction;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To provide a platform for researchers to
establish new connections and exchange ideas;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To honor Dr. Shu
Chien's contribution to the field and inspire and facilitate students,
especially women and minority students, to perform research in this
area.&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide six travel awards of $500 to graduate and
undergraduate students, based on the submitted abstracts and financial needs,
with at least three of the awards to women and minority students and two awards
to undergraduate students.
