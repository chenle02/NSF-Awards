This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates Site in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The program will provide an intensive summer research
experience for ten undergraduate students in microbiology, molecular biology and
related fields. Extra effort will be made to recruit qualified students who are
women, minority or disabled, and/or who otherwise have limited research
opportunities at their own institution. The main goal of the program is to
attract and stimulate motivated students to pursue careers in research, while
providing them with hands-on experience. The Department of Bacteriology has an
internationally recognized research faculty, committed to both undergraduate and
graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory research projects.
Participating students will work as part of a dynamic research team
investigating basic problems in cellular or molecular biology. Students will
become familiar with the research techniques of microbiology, biochemistry,
genetics and molecular biology using modern equipment and facilities in the
Department of Bacteriology. Students will attend professional seminars and make
written and oral presentations of their own research findings The Department has
an established record of providing research opportunities for its own
undergraduate students and has successfully managed a summer research program
for sixty-one students since 1988.
