This project will introduce the use of digital storage oscilloscopes in
undergraduate laboratories, for the recording, storing, and processing of data.
The new equipment can be used with a variety of experiments. Its use will help
train students in new techniques, and allow the introduction of new experiments.
NSF support is recommended.
