9424556 Boolchand, Punit This award for a dispersive Raman spectrometer system
will be used for basic investigations of network glasses. Constraint theory
predicts the glass forming tendency of a network to be optimized near the
stiffness (or rigidity percolation) threshold, when a number of constraints per
atom exactly equals the degrees of freedom per atom. It is proposed to examine
in detail, the physical nature of this stiffness threshold in chalcogenide
glasses using complementary probes: Raman scattering and Lamb-Mossbauer factors.
These experiments may lead to an understanding of the medium range order of
these glasses, which is presently not understood. This instrument will be shared
by investigators conducting fundamental materials research on technologically
important glasses and semiconductor materials, and by engineers conducting
research in the area of photonic materials and millimeter wave technology.
