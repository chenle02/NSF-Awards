Professor Quinto will pursue problems in the mathematical analysis of Radon
transforms and in tomography with two major objectives. The first objective is
to prove injectivity and support theorems for generalized Radon transforms in
the setting of real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, possibly in
the presence of a group action. Such results for classical Radon transforms have
been extremely useful for group representations, partial differential equations,
and tomography. The second objective is to solve two problems in tomography,
namely the development of a dose plan algorithm for cancer radiation therapy,
and the adaptation of an existing algorithm for the exterior Radon transform to
the non-destructive evaluation of rings and rocket exit cones. The gist of the
mathematics in this project is as follows. Take a manifold (surface, solid, or
higher-dimensional analogue) and a function defined on it. Suppose the manifold
is sliced up in some fashion and the average of the function over each slice is
known. The problem is to reconstruct the original function. A good example is
the function that gives the density at each point of a solid body whose inside
is not directly accessible. X-ray images give average densities along lines in
the direction of the beam. Tomography is the science of deducing densities
inside the object from an economical number of these images.
