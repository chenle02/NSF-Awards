This project represents a joint research program between the Dr. Len Muscatine
of UCLA and Dr. Karl Va. Bil', Head of the Photobiotechnology Department,
Institute of Soil Science and Photosynthesis, Russian Academy of Science. The
research will determine the path of carbon flow produced in photosynthesis of
symbiotic dinoflagellates (known as, zooxanthellae) in sea anemones and corals
and how this pathway is altered by a host factor which induces the algal cells
to release glycerol. Host factor is now obtained in pure form in Muscatine's
laboratory. The path of carbon will initially be determined in zooxanthellae in
vitro using classical C-14 labeling and short-term photosynthesis techniques of
Calvin and Benson. In companion experiments, the researchers will concurrently
introduce cnidarian host factor and attempt to detect changes in the pathway
which it induces. From the data obtained, including analysis of key enzyme
activities, a testable hypothesis on the mechanism of action of host factor on
the reductive pentose phosphate pathway and glycerol synthesis will be
formulated and tested.
