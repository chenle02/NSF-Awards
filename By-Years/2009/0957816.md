This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor
Gregory Hillhouse at the University of Chicago to carry out fundamental studies
on the coordination and organometallic chemistry of two- and three-coordinate
nickel in various oxidation states. The general theme of the research is
centered on the exploration of group-transfer reactions of Ni, particularly
those involving nitrene, carbene, and oxo functional groups, and is focused on
both understanding fundamental mechanistic details of new group-transfer
reactions and in developing catalytic methods for effecting these
transformations. The chemistry of 2-coordinate complexes of Ni will be
developed, including synthetic approaches to 2-coordinate complexes featuring
multiple metal-ligand bonding. Key targets include complexes with open-shell
electronic configurations and non-integer Ni=E bond
orders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a solid, fundamental
understanding of the chemistry of group transfer reactions involving nickel and
will impact applied areas of inorganic chemistry and catalysis, as well as
organic synthesis. This research will also provide basic insight into the
chemistry of Ni(I) and Ni(III), rare oxidation states but of emerging importance
in the catalytic and biological chemistry of nickel. In addition to the
scientific contributions, this project will contribute to human resource
development and the training of the next generation of scientists and teachers,
empowering young coworkers to make seminal contributions to US academic and
industrial chemical research endeavors. The research team will include
scientists at all educational levels: faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and
graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students. Participation of
underrepresented minorities, which in the past have included Hispanic, African-
American, sight-disabled, and women coworkers, will be actively
encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;
