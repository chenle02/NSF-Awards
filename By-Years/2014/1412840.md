Many materials designed for high-tech applications today are engineered at the
micro or nano scale. The physics of how these materials behave in applied
electric fields or boundary treatments is still being worked out through
experiments and simulations. An important challenge in this area is that the
small-scale structure of these materials inevitably contains defects that make
their responses even more complex. Physicists have proposed mathematical models
to explain this behavior. It is important to investigate the nature of solutions
in these models to better understand their structure under outside influences,
to obtain greater predictability of their behavior, and to develop effective
applications for them. That is the goal of this project. The project includes
the training and participation of graduate students.

The investigator and his colleagues study the formation of defects in soft
matter systems, including liquid crystal materials and layered superconductors.
Physicists describe stable states of these materials using vector fields and
scalar or tensor-valued order parameters that minimize a free energy. Pattern
formations under external influences, as well as defects and other topological
characteristics, are studied using the calculus of variations and nonlinear
partial differential equations associated with the free energy. In nematic
liquid crystals, the Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe Q-tensor models form the
basis of the investigation. Of special interest is the nature of configurations
obtained in the limit of vanishing elasticity. Geometric influences, such as
flat or curved, thick or thin liquid crystal materials, are considered. In
layered high-temperature superconductors, the Lawrence-Doniach model is the
basis for this investigation. The nature of defects and behavior of solutions in
applied magnetic fields of various intensities and orientations is investigated.
The above work includes the training and participation of graduate students.
