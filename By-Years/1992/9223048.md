This project is a workshop for faculty women who are structural engineers to
discuss the problems faced by women in the profession of structural engineering.
It is important for NSF and universities to know the concerns of recruiting and
retaining women in the professional ranks of academics. The workshop will
discuss the many problems encountered by women who have selected engineering
careers in academics and publish a report on the proceedings.
