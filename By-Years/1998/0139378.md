The project interacts with and expands PISCES, a district-based, community-
supported elementary improvement program for grade K-6 in 14 districts in San
Diego County, Arctic Alaska, and La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Fellows
and teachers together develop hands on science experiences using standard school
district kits (e.g. FOSS). Educational features include summer and school year
on-site institutes and seminars for the fellows and cooperating teachers and
extensive use of the San Diego County Office of Education's educational
technology resources. GK-12 Fellows benefit from a program to help them develop
good communication and teaching skills. Participating teachers benefit by having
the opportunity to interact with environmental research projects in a wide
variety of climatic, biotic and social/scientific conditions.
