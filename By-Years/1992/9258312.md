This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will pursue physically motivated extremal eigenvalue problems, with the
applications ranging from mathematical modeling to numerical computation. The
research will involve the application and development of tools of weak
convergence and geometric function theory. It will also involve methods of
nonsmooth analysis in order to characterize and compute the extremizers. The
National Science Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding
young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for
continued professional growth as a research mathematician and for significant
development as a teacher and academic leader.
