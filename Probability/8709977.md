This research will extend existing parametric and nonparametric regression
methods. Regression analysis is widely used on data to determine relationship of
two or more variables of interest. New methods need to be invented to take in to
account various characters of the data. The research will study biased
estimators of parameters in a partial spline model. This model can be used to
compare two or more populations. The investigator will also look at test
statistic to compare "mean curves" with or without the help of the covariates.
