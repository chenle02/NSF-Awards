Triton College collaborates with its high school, university and business
partners to create a pathway of study leading to skilled jobs in agricultural
technology and sustainable agricultural practices with emphasis on supporting an
ecological and sustainable balance between production agriculture and urban food
systems. This pathway results in a seamless interdisciplinary curriculum for
high school students to transition to community colleges and to four-year
university programs with the implementation of an Associate of Applied Science
in Sustainable Agricultural Technology. This degree creates a pipeline of
students entering the emerging field of sustainable agricultural technology and
also expands our urban regional sustainable agricultural economy. The degree
also provides students with a strong foundation in STEM career and technical
education focused on transferring knowledge and skills related to
sustainability, food science, horticulture, and related areas in the "green-
collar" segment of the national economy. The project incorporates State of
Illinois' Agriculture Education curriculum for high school workshops showcasing
real-world examples of sustainable agriculture in urban areas. Formative
evaluation provides the assessment of the new career pathway, curricular
content, planning and implementation of the project activities.
