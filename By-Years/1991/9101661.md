A set of undergraduate laboratory experiments which duplicate current ongoing
research activities and techniques in the field of atomic/laser physics will be
developed. These experiments will use tuneable narrowband diode laser systems.
The first experiment is the use of lasers to obtain very high resolution
Doppler-free saturated absorption spectra in alkali vapor cells. The majority of
the work will be the development of an inexpensive apparatus in which
undergraduates can trap neutral atoms and cool them to temperatures on the order
of a microkelvin. These experiments will be a slightly modified version of
state-of-the-art experiments in laser cooling and trapping, and will be tested
in an advanced lab course. The goal of the work will be the development of a
very simple inexpensive apparatus which can be widely duplicated, and which will
allow undergraduates to become involved in a current area of physics research.
