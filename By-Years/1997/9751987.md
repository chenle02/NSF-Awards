This project aims to develop student recruitment and retention techniques,
instructional strategies, educational materials, and laboratory activities that
provide precollege and college students with advanced technological education
related to manufacturing and engineering materials technology. Goals will be
achieved through a dynamic alliance among community colleges, public schools,
and a university coupled with business, industry, government and technical
societies. Building on the vast experience of the project team from Norfolk
State University, Tidewater Community College, and Virginia Beach Public
Schools, the alliance will synthesize a coherent 2+2+2 model program that moves
students into and through the pipeline for careers as advanced
industrial/engineering technicians. The project will draw on an established
national network of educators, and from a wide variety of educational groups
including other NSF projects teams, technical societies, businesses,
corporations, and federal laboratories. The project team will select and develop
appropriate materials for both precollege and college technician programs. At
the precollege level the emphasis is on developing integrated math, science, and
technology concepts through the content of materials science and technology with
an emphasis on interfacing computers with materials testing equipment. Also,
strategies and materials aimed at informing guidance counselors, students, and
parents about the career opportunities for technicians in materials science and
manufacturing will be developed. At the A.A.S. and B.S. technology levels, the
project team will select from available materials and develop multimedia units
related to engineering materials technology and manufacturing. The Annual
National Educators's Workshops on engineering materials technology will provide
technical updating for ten community college faculty members each year of the
project. *
