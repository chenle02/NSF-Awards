9634772 Collier This project is a rapid response to a hydrothermal/volcanic
event on the Gorda Ridge in the northeast Pacific. On 28 Feb. 1996 a major
seismic event was detected by the NOAA VENTS program through monitoring of the
US Navy SOSUS hydrophone arrays. NOAA dispatched the research vessel MacArthur
and they discovered a hydrothermal megaplume in the area of the seismic
activity. The availability of the research vessel Wecoma in early April allows a
more detailed response. The objectives of this cruise are to locate the source
of the magaplume, to determine whether there has been a subsurface bacterial
bloom, to determine geochemical and microbial concentrations in the plume, and,
if possible, to establish patterns of crustal breakage and/or eruption.
