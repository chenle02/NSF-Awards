This project will use an autonomous racing vehicle as a testbed (and educational
tool) for new types of intelligent system design.&lt;br/&gt; The project will
focus on the challenge of blending concepts from computational intelligence
(such as reinforcement learning) and control theory (such as hybrid control) so
as to manage a complex system over multiple time scales, in an integrated way,
adaptively, and with foresight. The goal in the testbed will simply be to
minimize lap time - but it is hoped that the results will be useful to the
development of unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) in general. A primary goal of
the project is to build new partnerships across disciplines, as discussed in the
NSF-supported workshop described at www.eas.asu.edu/~nsfadp, and to create a
crossdisciplinary graduate course supporting these goals.&lt;br/&gt;
