The main objective of this research project is to develop a new generation
numerical geodynamo model based on a domain decomposition technique that divides
the fluid part of the Earth's core into six identical subdomains with the same
metric tensor and nearly uniform grids. The computationally expensive Legendre
transform is no longer needed and many available efficient algorithms can be
used in each subdomain. The pole singularities of spherical coordinates are
removed. The new model will be particularly suitable for efficient
implementation on parallel computers. Preliminary results obtained for a
kinematic dynamo model show that the proposed domain decomposition technique is
both workable and extremely efficient. A convection-driven, nonlinear geodynamo
model will be developed for a rotating spherical shell that will operate at an
Ekman number smaller than 10^{-6}.
