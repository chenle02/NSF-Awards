9506710 Burnley The PI will determine whether or not conditions exist where
complete conversion of olivine to spinel by the martensitic-like mechanism is
possible under earth conditions by conducting transformation experiments at
high-pressure oversteps. The proposal will be a continuation of the
reconnaissance study that the PI has performed using the facilities at CHiPR in
SUNY Stony Brook. ****
