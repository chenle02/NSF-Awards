8815084 Thomason Thomason will develop new methods in stable homotopy theory by
introducing ideas from algebraic geometry. Among other things, this should
clarify the privileged role of the stable homotopy category, give new insight
into the relation between stable and unstable homotopy, and yield a new
encompassing duality theory containing both Spanier-Whitehead and Serre-
Grothendieck duality. Thomason will also build on his previous work in
localization in the algebraic K-theory of schemes in this new context, to attack
localization in the K-theory of non-commutative rings and in the Waldhausen
K-theory of spaces.
