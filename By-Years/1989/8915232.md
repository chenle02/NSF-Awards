It is herein proposed to investigate the nature and origin of an early
Proterozoic crustal boundary zone in western Arizona. The research is a
collaborative project that will involve geological, geochemical and
geochronologic studies with the following objectives: 1) Mapping and structural
analysis of important supracrustal- granitic associations near Kingman, AZ. 2)
Lithologic analysis of representative supracrustal successions. 3)
Characterization of metavolcanic rocks in terms of modes of eruption and
geochemistry. 4) Field, petrographic, and geochemical studies of metasedimentary
rocks. 5) Use of immobile element ratios to constrain the composition of the
mantle sources of mafic igneous rocks. 6) Selected U-Pb zircon dating of felsic
volcanic and granitic rocks (syn-to post-tectonic). Collectively, results from
these studies should provide a valuable data base to constrain the origin and
tectonic setting of early Proterozoic successions in western Arizona, and to
evaluate the existence, location and timing of a possible early Proterozoic
collisional event in this part of the Southwest.
