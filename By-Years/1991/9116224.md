A two year funding is provided for stable isotopic analysis at three ODP Sites
to constrain the history of deep water circulation in the late Pliocene and the
strength of North Atlantic Deep Water formation during the warmer climates. The
study will help resolve the controversy whether North Atlantic Deep Water was
weaker or stronger during warm Pliocene.
