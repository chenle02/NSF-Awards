A novel approach to the design of experiments for the senior Chemical
Engineering laboratory which--by combining computer simulations of real
industrial processes and videotaped facilities tours--will result in a
laboratory experience which is more challenging, interesting, and educationally
effective. Five laboratory modules were completed with the financial support of
five industrial sponsors and NSF Undergraduate Curriculum Development Grant. The
materials (computer programs, videotapes, written problem descriptions and
instructors' manuals) are being distributed, at cost, to all interested Chemical
Engineering departments. Thirty selected faculty are participating in a three
day workshop, where all five modules are being presented and the participants
are being given hands-on experience with the materials.
