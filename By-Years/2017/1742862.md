The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), a national, non-
profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer
internship opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program
(HNIP). Through HNIP, academically prepared students throughout the US and
Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal
government agencies. Participants are exposed to various career options in the
Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career
choices and solidify career objectives. By partnering with the Federal
government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 11,000 students in
internships since NIP commenced in 1992. In an effort to continue its
collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating
government agency, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the
exposure of students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM). Internships create a unique opportunity to strengthen the
human capital infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education, and help
the Nation prepare a competitive, diverse STEM workforce ready to meet future
challenges through discovery and innovation.
