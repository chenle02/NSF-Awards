This project explores how to enrich high-school biology education by bringing
university microbiologists and research-grade microscopy into the classroom via
real-time, high-grade video. Research-grade microscopes have a variety of
technologies not normally available in high-school classroom instruments.
Techniques such as phase contrast, differential interference contrast, and
others make it possible to see details in living organisms that students would
not otherwise be able to see. Professional microbiologists are able to provide
expert commentary about specimens and answer questions in dialogues that can
enrich student's experience and excite their sense of discovery. This project is
using gigabit networks and ultra-high-quality video to bring research
instruments and researchers into the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
links research facilities at the University of Southern California with the STEM
School Chattanooga, a public high school. The project's technology will allow
researchers at USC to place live biological specimens under a USC-developed
microscope and capture ultra-high resolution (4k) movies of the microorganisms
while simultaneously transmitting live, high definition images from the
microscope system to the students. It takes advantage of Chattanooga's
deployment of a city-wide gigabit network. The project provides students there
the unique opportunity to collaborate with scientists a continent away.
