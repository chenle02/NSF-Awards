*** 9709164 LE NOBLE This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the SUNY at
Stony Brook to acquire a fluorescence spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the following: (1) binding and
fluorescence quenching experiments to probe partially folded states of proteins,
(2) the role of protein surface loops in the reaction catalyzed by the
interfacial enzyme cholesterol oxidase, and (3) the mechanism of the enzymes
enoyl-CoA hydratase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The fluorescence spectrometer
counts photons of light in the UV and visible regions and when a sample of
material is illuminated by UV light, filtered to absorb the reflected UV light,
then only visible fluorescence is detected. The spectrometer is used in
fluorescence quenching experiments which occur at fast rates, and will allow
relaxation processes to be used at various temperatures. ***
