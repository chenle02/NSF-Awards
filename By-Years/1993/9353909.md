9353909 Carroll The proposal is to run a molecular biology laboratory workshop
for undergraduate faculty from institutions in the New York Metropolitan area to
provide them with tools needed to implement laboratory techniques in molecular
biology into their courses. Twenty-five faculty members will attend a five-day
residential workshop at St. John's University. Applications of techniques and
current breakthroughs using this technology will also be discussed. Follow-up
activities include an evening Lecture Series during the academic year focusing
on the impact of molecular biological techniques on current knowledge in cell
and molecular biology. SJU faculty and invited speakers from other Metropolitan
area research institutions will present these lectures. Informal discussions
will follow the lecture, facilitating networking among the participants, SJU
faculty and invited speakers. Time will be made available on those evenings for
consultation and discussion with SJU faculty concerning implementation of
laboratory exercises by undergraduate faculty participants. In addition, one
session of the follow-up activities will be devoted to informing participants of
grants opportunities that can help them obtain equipment to use the molecular
techniques in their courses. ***
