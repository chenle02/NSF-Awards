This grant is in support of a workshop on Antarctic paleobotany and its
relationship to reconstruction of the Gondwanaland continent. The workshop will
assess our current understanding of fossil floras from the Antarctic and
surrounding continents and their relationship to paleoecological parameters.
This workshop is in response to recommendations by the National Academy of
Sciences ("Antarctic Solid-Earth Sciences Research; 1986) and will contribute to
the development of a coherent future program of investigation in the area of
Antarctic paleobotany. The workshop is planned for late 1987 or early 1988 at
Ohio State University, Columbus Ohio, and will bring together scientists expert
in all phases of paleobotanic research. This meeting is an important aspect of
the Antarctic geoscience research program and will help to define new direction
for future research in this area. The convenor, Dr. Thomas Taylor, is actively
involved in all phases of geo-botanic research in the Antarctic region and is
well qualified organize this effort.
