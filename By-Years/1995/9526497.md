9526497 Stiglich This U.S.-Mexico Program award will support a planning visit by
Dr. Jacob J. Stiglich of Materials Modification, Inc. (MMI), Fairfax, Virginia,
to go to Mexico to meet with Dr. Lorenzo Martinez at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico in Cuernavaca. They will define an international
cooperative research project between the two organizations involving advanced
wear and corrosion resistant coating technology. There are three areas which are
of interest to both sides. They are: 1. Wear and corrosion resistant coatings by
pulsed electrode deposition; 2. Solid lubricant materials; and 3. Nanoparticles
which can be adapted to photovoltaic uses. MMI has begun prototype coating
activities with emphasis on wear resistance provided by WC and Cr carbides based
coatings. The Mexican institute will significantly extend these testing and
characterization activities. Because petrochemicals and mining are essential
components of Mexico's economic base, the two groups will be able to work on the
wear and corrosion problems which Mexico faces in that environment. MMI can then
take the data and results of this research to U.S. counterpart industries. ***
