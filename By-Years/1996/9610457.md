This project studies the computational complexity of finding approximate
solutions to NP-optimization problems through an investigation of the structure
of complexity classes in the bounded query hierarchy. Many questions about these
complexity classes remain open. For example, it is not known whether a
polynomial time Turing machine using a linear number of oracle queries to an NP-
complete set can recognize more languages than one which uses only log n
queries. Recent works have established close connections between NP-
approximation problems and the bounded query hierarchy. As a result, there is a
direct correspondence between open questions of whether finding an optimum
Traveling Salesman tour can be reduced to finding a 2- approximate tour (one
that has at most twice the length of the optimum tour). If such a reduction were
possible, it would imply that there is no significant difference in the
complexity of finding approximate versus optimum solutions for many NP-complete
problems. This would drastically alter the present understanding of the nature
of NP-completeness. The conjecture motivating this research is that such a
reduction does not exist. However, currently, its existence is not known to
violate any of the common intractability assumptions (e.g. that P NP or that the
Polynomial Hierarchy does not collapse). The goal of this project is to solve
many of the outstanding open questions about the bounded query hierarchy.
