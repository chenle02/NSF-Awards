Countries host many workers who are non-native speakers of the local language.
Students from diverse international backgrounds attend class in a non-native
tongue. Business people commonly use a foreign language as they travel around
the globe, expanding their markets and collaborations. The goal of this research
is to investigate how people understand non-native speakers and to examine the
implications for communication between native and non-native speakers. The
investigators will test whether people use different strategies when trying to
understand a non-native speaker than a native speaker. For example, when people
understand non-native speakers they pay less attention to what is actually said,
and more attention to the situation surrounding the communication. This has
implications for how well people remember what is said, how likely they are to
reach an agreement, and how they perceive the speaker's motives and
intentions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will focus on the
psychological mechanisms that people naturally use when they communicate. It
could lead to discoveries in a wide variety of domains with important
interpersonal and societal implications. For instance, in education it could
help account for difficulties faced by non-native English speakers in school, or
difficulties that non-native teachers encounter; in the legal domain it may
provide insight into how the testimony of non-native witnesses is understood and
misunderstood; in the medical domain it should have implications for effective
communication between physicians and patients, or among physicians, when one of
them is a non-native speaker of the language. In general, insight into how
people understand each other could provide critical contributions to society by
improving communication and reducing conflict between speakers with different
native tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is co-funded by SBE/BCS and the
