The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting three years of
support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to further the professional
development of STEM faculty, staff, and students at Tribal Colleges and
Universities (TCUs) that have received grants from the NSF Tribal Colleges and
Universities Program (TCUP). The project is designed to strengthen the financial
management, assessment, and evaluation of TCUP-funded projects; improve the
capabilities of STEM faculty to better integrate culture into the curriculum as
well as improve their mentoring/advising skills; and provide professional
development opportunities in Washington, DC, for STEM faculty and students at
TCUP grantees. To facilitate achieving these goals, QEM will conduct two
workshops for STEM faculty, two workshops for TCUP Project staff, offer an
annual nine-month fellowship for a STEM faculty who would be based at NSF, and
provide ten-week summer internships for five students each year.
