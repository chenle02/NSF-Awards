A computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) project utilizes hierarchical computer
control in a junior-level laboratory/lecture course environment at the GMI
Engineering and Management Institute. The laboratory allows students the
opportunity to integrate the knowledge taught separately in the design,
manufacturing, and business courses of a CIM environment. Students experiment
while learning and integrating five levels of communication hierarchical
(facility, shop, cell, station, and equipment) control. The project utilizes a
SUN SPARCstation-2 networked to four SUN IPX SPARCstations which in turn are
connected each to a PUMA 260 robot and an DENFORD NC machine. This equipment and
a closed loop conveyor system for material handling and a protective light fence
- for safety - are located in the existing CIM Laboratory. While the laboratory
is central to the GMI CIM course, Robotics and NC Systems lecture and laboratory
courses also benefit from it. Experiences from the project will be reported in
professional and educational journal.
