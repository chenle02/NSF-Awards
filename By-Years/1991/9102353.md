Fundamental research wil be conducted on transport and related phenomena in
disordered media. The influence of different types of disorder on transport
phenomena will include random substitutional (percolation) disorder, spatially
correlated disorder, and macroscopic heterogeneities. Topics of study will
include dispersion and related transport processes; transport in macroscopically
heterogeneous media; and, fast passage and relaxation in hierarchical
structures.
