The University of California at Irvine is being supported to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is
to provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry
for outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced
research chemists. The program will support 10 students for the summer of 1987,
of which almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research
activities will include the following: o Condensed matter photodynamics o
Carbohydrate Polymer Chemistry o Organometallic Lanthanide Chemistry o The
Chemical Physics of Surfaces and thin Films o Dynamics of Molecular Collisions
