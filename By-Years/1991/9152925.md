The purpose of this project is to introduce modern instruments and technology
into the Engineering Technology curriculum and to allow development of new ways
of using modern instruments to provide improved instructional capabilities. The
data- acquisition systems consist of an AT-class computer and associated boards
and software. External assemblies containing conditioning and protection devices
are accessible for student experimentation. The equipment is used in the
computer/electronic labs and the mechanical engineering technology laboratories.
The electronic/computer engineering technology students learn how to select and
install data acquisition systems, how to program them at all levels, how to
reduce and analyze data obtained, and how to interface external devices of all
kinds. The mechanical engineering technology students use the equipment to
perform measurements and for data analysis and reduction, which can be done at a
much higher level of sophistication utilizing the available software.
