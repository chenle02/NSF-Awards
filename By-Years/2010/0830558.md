Power is now widely recognized as a first class architectural design constraint
at all levels of computing, from the level of processor chips to the level of
data centers. There are at least three distinct common goals for power
management: energy conservation, temperature management, and limiting maximum
power. The most commonly used power management technique is speed scaling, which
involves changing the speed of the processor. Essentially all currently produced
general purpose processors may be run at multiple speeds, and all leading
processor manufacturers produce associated software that manages power by
scaling processor speed. However, speed scaling as a power management technique,
has to date mostly been applied in a reactive fashion in that it is usually only
invoked in response to abnormal conditions, and its application is largely
decoupled from the scheduling policies in that they are working independently of
each other. It is widely accepted that integrated proactive power management and
scheduling policies will result in better power management than simple reactive
strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research investigates algorithmic
problems related to integrated power management and and scheduling. The
resulting optimization problems have dual objectives, since one seeks to
optimize both some quality-of-service measure of the schedule, and some power
related criteria. In general these objectives are conflicting in that the more
power that one uses, the better quality of service that can be provided. The
algorithmic solutions to these problem then involve increasing power when the
improvement in the scheduling objective justifies the increased cost in the
power management objective. The goals of the research are threefold. The first
goal is to develop algorithms that could form the basis for future power
management software. The second goal is to build a toolkit of widely applicable
algorithmic methods for power management problems. The third goal is help
increase the computing community's ability to abstractly reason about power,
energy and temperature.&lt;br/&gt;
