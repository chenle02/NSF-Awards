Undergraduate engineering curricula in the U.S. require issues of engineering
ethics to be addressed. Engineers and the engineering profession recognize that
students need to learn how to use and assess available information in making
ethical decisions, and how to test and develop their own perspectives on
professional ethics. They need to develop the thought processes necessary to
integrate information with acceptable professional "norms" of behavior, to make
ethical decisions. Ethics and Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society
is supporting several projects to develop and test new curricula and teaching
methods. This project will convene a panel of experts to develop a plan for
programs and strategies to integrate engineering ethics into engineering
curricula. The panel and associated advisors will review materials, programs and
strategies and develop a set of recommendations and options by which to further
this process. Results will include a final report to NSF discussing next steps,
a number of papers to be presented at technical meetings, and a presentation for
the annual meeting of the American Society of Engineering Educators and for
publication in its journal "Engineering Education". This project addresses an
important issue in a unique way. The research team and collaborators are
interdisciplinary and well qualified to collaborate. Further effort is likely to
continue beyond the duration of this award. The project is designed well;
university support is good. An award in the amount of $32,687 is therefore
recommended.
