Light exerts enormous effects on phototrophic organisms in addition to
providing the energy for their activities; the object of this project is to
elucidate the signal transduction pathway between the initial perception of
light by the cyanobacterium and the resultant changes in gene expression that
have effects on the components of the light-harvesting complexes as well as
morphological traits. Freymella diplosiphon will be examined in terms of global
responses to changes in light quality and specific molecular requirments of the
light-regulated responses, using physiological, biochemical, as well as
molecular genetic approaches.
