Intellectual Merit The PI is requesting funding to develop and build a portable
acoustic source array and handling system for instantaneous continental-shelf-
scale imaging and continuous monitoring of fish and marine life. This technique
has been successfully demonstrated through the use of a two-vessel system that
is no longer in operation. The proposed system can be deployed from a single
fixed or mobile vessel to measure abundance, population distributions, and
dynamics in time and space in open ocean, shelf, and lake environments. The
system will combine an efficient and usable design and the capability for the
simultaneous tow of the low-to-mid frequency active source array and a generic
receiving array from the same vessel. The proposed instrumentation represents a
significant advance over current capabilities; the PIs state that the proposed
system represents the first and only portable and towable active source system
capable of imaging marine life at 50-km ranges.

Broader Impacts Broader impacts include significant collaborations with
fisheries science and management groups nationally (e.g., NMFS) and
internationally (e.g,, Peru, Canada, Australia). The significant advance in
capabilities offered by the proposed instrumentation will benefit both
scientific and management efforts at a time when fisheries stocks are currently
being stressed by ecosystem change and stock depletion.
