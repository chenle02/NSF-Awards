This project will advance research on information technology supported
communications by investigating the role of interface type and interface
asymmetry on supporting social connectedness. Social computing technology may
hold the promise of increasing interpersonal connectedness, but previous work
has found that certain forms of social media may have unintended social
isolation effects. Thus, it is important to explicitly investigate, design for,
and measure social connectedness as an outcome of social computing systems. This
project is investigating social connection in two high-impact contexts:
facilitating peer support in recovery from substance use disorders and
supporting intergenerational connections to reduce elder isolation and provide
one-on-one mentoring for children. The prototypes have the potential to
positively contribute to addressing these significant societal challenges. All
prototypes developed will be open source, with all software, circuit designs,
and fabrication models available for download, and this work will contribute to
innovative educational integration activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigation addresses three research challenges in designing and deploying
technologies for social connectedness: (1) understanding the relative tradeoffs
of social connectedness systems developed as dedicated physical interfaces
versus as commodity device software; (2) exploring the effect of interface
asymmetry in social connectedness systems and relationships, given that previous
work typically assumes that communication partners are using identical
interfaces; and, (3) developing a framework for social connectedness research to
support replication and meta-analyses. These research challenges are addressed
through three research thrusts. The first two thrusts focus on the design and
field deployment of social connectedness systems in two high impact community
connection contexts, comparing interface effects based on validated social
connectedness metrics. The third thrust calls for synthesizing the findings of
these deployments and other relevant investigations in collaboration with
leading social connectedness researchers to develop a replication framework for
future work.
