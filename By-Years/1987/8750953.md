In this project, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is being used by
biology, biochemistry, and chemistry majors at Iona College as a qualitative and
quantitative tool, and as a probe for making fundamental physical and chemical
measurements to enhance understanding of the theoretical and practical
applications of this method to undergraduate instruction. As an exercise in
practical electronics, students interface a personal computer with the NMR
spectrometer using general purpose, commercially available hardware and
software.
