Dr. Michael J. Bronikowski has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Brownikowski's doctoral degree was from Stanford University under
the supervision of Professor Richard Zare. Dr. Brownikowski intends to continue
research at Wisconsin with Professor Robert Hamers. Dr. Brownikowski's long
range goal is to understand an manipulate matter on the atomic and molecular
scale. He has had a strong background in physical chemistry through his thesis
work involving the laser based study of reaction dynamics. In working with
Professor Hamers, he will have the opportunity to learn the techniques of
scanning tunneling microscopy. This will help him to implement his long term
research plans. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.'s and atttract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
