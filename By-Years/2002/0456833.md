NONLINEAR EVOLUTION EQUATIONS Abstract of Proposed Research Gustavo Ponce

This project is devoted to research into various aspects of nonlinear
dispersive equations. It will include work on several nonlinear dispersive
evolution equations of Schroedinger type. These arise as approximate models for
the evolution of vortex filaments, in water waves modeling and as examples of
higher order integrable systems. Also some unique continuation properties of
nonlinear dispersive models will be investigated. The goal is to use these
properties to established uniqueness of solutions to an associated problem from
some incomplete information of the solutions at two different times.

They problems to be investigated are at the intersection of partial differential
equations, classical harmonic analysis and mathematical physics. The unique
continuation issues arise naturally in control theory applications.
