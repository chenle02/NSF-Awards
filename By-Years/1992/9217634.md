This award is for support of a study to reconstruct the spatial and temporal
pattern of pre-late Wisconsin glacial and sea-level fluctuations of the north-
eastern Bristol Bay region of southwestern Alaska. A wide spectrum of
geochronological methods, including aminostratigraphy, tephrostratigraphy,
thermolumi- nescence, and radiocarbon dating will be used to date the
stratigraphic records that are available. An improved chronostratigraphy will
allow the spatial and temporal variability in the response of the glacial and
periglacial systems to be assessed in terms of the changing oceanic and
atmospheric boundary conditions of the last interglacial to late-Wisconsin time.
