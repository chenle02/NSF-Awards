ABSTRACT CTS-9415686 Robert Dibble This proposal is essentially for the
continuation of the PI's NSF supported program on "Mixture Fraction Measurements
by Rayleigh Scattering". The objective of the proposal is to obtain experimental
data that will directly improve the mixing models used in computer simulations
of turbulent combustion. It is proposed to investigate the effects of heat
release on mixing (scalar dissipation) in turbulent diffusion flames and to make
simultaneous measurements of the mixture fraction and nitric oxide
concentrations in methane, and carbon monoxide flames.
