Property Rights, Political Fragmentation and the Endangered Species Act This
project develops a political analysis of local implementation of the U.S.
Endangered Species Act. Specifically, the research investigates the roles of
stakeholders in developing and approving a habitat conservation plan as mandated
by the Act. The research design entails an intensive, quantitative and
qualitative, case study focused on the habitat conservation plan for the
Stephens' kangaroo rat in western Riverside County, California. This case study
includes the circumstances of rapid suburban development and associated
environmental change, and political fragmentation. Political fragmentation is
manifested in the number of general-purpose municipalities and special-purpose
districts that have a role in developing and approving land-use plans and
conservation plans. Archival data of the plan's development will be augmented by
geographic analysis of the affected area to determine land-ownership and land
interests in the affected area, and by participant observation of the public
components of the conservation planning process. The study attempts to evaluate
the sustainability of this kind of local policy formulation in the face of rapid
development, wide variation of interests, and shifts in public discourse on
ecological preservation.
