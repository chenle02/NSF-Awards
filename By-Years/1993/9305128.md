9305128 Zaborszky The proposed research is in the area of dynamic theory
underlying the security analysis of large interconnected electric power systems.
Among the expected contributions of the proposed research are the resolution of
certain modeling issues which arise near singular, and a practical procedure for
finding homoclinic orbits. Another objective is the development of a useful
theory to deal with the common problem of changes in system dimension as various
devices reach hard limits, or in the case of structural changes. ***
