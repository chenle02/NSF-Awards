The Ocean Studies Institute is purchasing a side scan sonar and sub-bottom
profiler for installation on an oceanographic vessel shared by a seven campus
consortium. The equipment is being used in conjunction with a magnetometer and
an automated multi- parameter probe system to enable undergraduates to study the
principles and techniques of characterizing ocean bottom topography, submarine
faults, hydrocarbon seepage, and submerged cultural resources, among others. The
project is contributing to an increased understanding of the environmental and
economic effects of human activities along the South California coast.
