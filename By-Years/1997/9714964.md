ABSTRACT EEC-9714964 GRANT Wireless communication has raised many questions
concerning electrical and human capability with wireless electronic devices. The
public and industry need these questions addressed as wireless technology and
use literally explode. A planning grant (EEC-9526073) was awarded in FY95 to
study the feasibility and inability of establishing an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Wireless Electromagnetic Compatibility
at the University of Oklahoma. As a result of this planning meeting, a Center
meeting the I/UCRC Program requirements has been established with 14 company
members. The Center's research agenda encompasses the following projects: 1.)
Mobile Phone RF Enveloped and Power Measurement, 2.) Study of Pacemaker -
Wireless Phone Planar Separation (Height of Interaction) Study, 3.) Pacemaker
Evaluation using Modified FDA Protocol, 4.) Hearing Aid Phase II-A: Acoustic
Measurement with Phones. The Center has been coordinated with Dr. Deborah
Crawford, Program Director, Physical Foundations of Enabling Technologies
Program, Electrical and Communications Systems Division.
