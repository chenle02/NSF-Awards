This Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is intended to
support an experienced investigator in activities that can expand her research
career potential through developing new research skills and conducting
exploratory and pilot work to determine the feasibility of a contemplated new
line of inquiry. The work is directed at investigating the initiation of
particular democratic institutions, particularly during periods of transition to
democracy. The study begins with the hypothesis that institutional choice
depends primarily on the interests of those charged with writing and voting on
new laws and constitutions, and that these interests center on achieving and
surviving in office. The research methodology involves, first, locating the
constitutions, constitutional amendments, laws, and decrees that initiate
institutional change; second, attributing institutional preferences derived from
their electoral and other political survival needs to the actors involved; and
third, examining the historical record to see if the actors identified acted as
predicted or not. Cases to be examined include nine Latin American countries
with substantial democratic experience during the twentieth century and four
East European countries currently engaged in the transition to democracy. During
the period of the award, the investigator will take courses in math and game
theory to upgrade her analytic skills as well as reading widely on the history
and politics of Eastern Europe. This Career Advancement Award promises to
substantially expand the capabilities and potential of the investigator.
