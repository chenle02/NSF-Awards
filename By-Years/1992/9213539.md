This collaborative project with the General Motors Research Laboratory at Warren
Michigan focuses on controller synthesis and development of analytical and
numerical tools suitable for performance evaluation of semi-active vehicle
suspensions under a variety of road conditions. Particular emphasis in on the
dynamic interaction between the suspension and the body structure whose
compliance is included in the model. Inclusion of body compliance is considered
necessary in view of the high frequency harshness observed in recent studies of
suspension systems with on-off dampers, which has potential for exciting body
structural resonances and may lead to deterioration in ride comfort. Control
laws governing the variation of damping coefficients in semi-active dampers will
be obtained using calculus of variations. In this approach the suspension system
can be optimized with respect to a suitable performance index under specified
constraints. Simplified control laws that may still yield acceptable performance
but are easier to implement will also be considered. Evaluation of system
performance in time and frequency domains will allow prediction of the degree of
improvements resulting from application of more sophisticated control laws and
continuously variable dampers prior to building and testing prototypes***//
