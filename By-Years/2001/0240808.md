This project will develop methods for inferring migration flows from two
successive counts of population stocks. Such data on stocks in the past have
been used to infer mortality and, indeed, of net migration. But a workable
method for using population stock data to infer directional (not net) migration
flows has not been developed. This project will draw on statistical
representations of regularities in the age and spatial structures found in
relatively complete data on migration streams to infer, in settings
characterized by incomplete data, the directional flows that underlie and shape
the population distributions enumerated by censuses and sample
surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new method will benefit a number of different
user groups. Historical demographers will be able to identify changing mobility
patterns hidden in recently released historical population censuses that lack a
question on migration. Migration analysts will be able to study mobility
patterns in data-poor less-developed countries. Furthermore, population
researchers will be able to adapt to the prospective loss of migration data from
the soon-to-be-eliminated "long form" questionnaire of the U.S. decennial
censuses and its replacement by the American Community Survey, which is a
significantly smaller continuous monthly sampling survey.&lt;br/&gt;
