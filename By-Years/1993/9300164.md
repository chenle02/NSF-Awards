Gilbert 9300164 The studies by Dr. Gilbert on the mechanism by which a hormone
from the brain of the insect Manduca sexta acts upon specialized glands
(prothoracic glands) to cause these glands to begin synthesizing a specific
steroid hormone, an ecdysteroid. Ecdysteroids are hormones that cause the insect
to molt. i.e. shed its exoskeleton, so that it can grow. They also elicit
metamorphosis, i.e. the means by which a caterpillar is transformed into a pupa
and then into an adult moth or butterfly. The brain neurohormone is synthesized
and released as a result of environmental cues such as photoperiod and the
synthesis and release of Ecdysteroids by the prothoracic glands must be
extremely precise if the insect is to survive and be successful. He is studying
the means by which this peptide hormone interacts with the glands, i.e. to
stimulate the synthesis of a compound, a second messenger, which in turn
indirectly mediates the phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group) of
specific proteins that control ecdysteroidogenesis. By utilizing the prothoracic
glands which are composed of a single layer of homogeneous cells, he should
ultimately gain insights into the mechanism of peptide hormone induced
steroidogenesis that would not be possible with the more heterogeneous adrenal
gland. ***
