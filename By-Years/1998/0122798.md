This project seeks to continue and extends investigations involving the
energetics, dynamics, and variability of the low latitude atmosphere and
ionosphere. The very general goals are to test, evaluate, and improve the NCAR
upper atmosphere models; to use the models to investigate the effects of lower
atmosphere waves on the thermosphere and ionosphere; to (attempt to) resolve
some discrepancies between the observed and modeled upper atmosphere/ionosphere
temperatures; and to investigate several selected topics such as the midnight
temperature maximum, the behavior of the ion drifts, and the development of
large neutral winds in the lower thermosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will continue the important task of validating the NCAR models, which are
community resources with wide-ranging applications. The region of interest, the
tropical ionosphere, plays an important role in global communications and
navigation and is a major focus for space weather research. The project will
support the research of a female space scientist/physics faculty member along
with a graduate student.
