This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, is directed toward achieving a fundamental understanding of
catalytic reactions at solid surfaces. Solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy used in situ is the principal instrumentation involved. Among
the catalytic materials to be investigated are zeolites, metal halides and metal
oxides. Theoretical modeling via computer will provide guidance and confirmation
in the interpretation of experimental NMR results. Transient approaches will be
used to determine the identity and structure of short-lived reaction
intermediates. In addition, photodissociation processes in confining media are
to be studied. This research will increase our understanding of how chemical
reactions promoted by catalysts take place. Catalytic materials play a very
important role in the production of chemical products in such technologically
significant areas as the petroleum, lubricants, and pharmaceutical industries.
Catalysts are used for many reasons and significant among them are energy
efficiency and a more positive environmental impact. The type of spectroscopy
(NMR) employed in this work is well suited to study the way catalytic reactions
occur at solid materials such as zeolites and metal oxides.
