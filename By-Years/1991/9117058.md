This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative
Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between Professor
Anastasios Melis, Department of Plant Biology, University of California
Berkeley, and Professor Yoshihiko Fujita, Department of Cell Biology, National
Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan. The project will focus on the
mechanism by which plants and algae are capable of adjusting both the size of
their photosynthetic units in photosystem-II (PSII) and photosystem- I (PSI), as
well as the ratio of PSII/PSI in response to differences in the quality of
illumination. Such ajustments constantly optimize the photosynthetic capability
of whole plants or plant parts and even whole ecosystems. This is a very
important question. The collaboration will help combine the use of resources in
elucidating the molecular mechanism that regulates photosystem stoichiometry
adjustments in chloroplasts. In particular, the research will address the
processes of signal perception and signal transduction in the chloroplasts
leading to photosystem stoichiometry adjustments, and on different aspects of
the regulation of gene expression by light-quality and nutrient availability in
photosynthetic prokaryotes and higher plants.
