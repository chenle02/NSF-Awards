*** 9709014 KOPPANG This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University
of South Dakota upgrade their computer and network multi-user spectroscopic
instrumentation. This equipment will enhance research in which the primary
applications will center in the following areas (1) imaging surface-bound
fluorescent tags within microscopic domains, (2) a complementary experimental
and theoretical study of energy transfer mechanisms for isolated
lanthanide(III)-ion pairs in CsM(II)X3 hosts, (3) studies of the enolization of
carbonyl compounds, partucularly structural effects and electrophilic catalysis,
and (4) spectroscopy and characterization of novel self-assembled isocyanide
monolayers on gold. A network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way
to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a "computer
network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and
algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization facilities, and
supports research in applications of parallel processing. ***
