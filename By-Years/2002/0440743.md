The power of the national information infrastructure has
expanded&lt;br/&gt;enormously over the last decade. Commercial Internet service
and&lt;br/&gt;government-sponsored advanced networks for research and
education&lt;br/&gt;support a range of national priorities. Unfortunately,
rapid&lt;br/&gt;development and deployment of robust, adaptive network software
is&lt;br/&gt;hampered by a fundamental obstacle: prototype systems are difficult
to&lt;br/&gt;evaluate due to scale and complexity of their host environment---
the&lt;br/&gt;Internet.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to remove this
obstacle by constructing a software&lt;br/&gt;environment for evaluating
prototype network software systems under&lt;br/&gt;realistic, controlled,
repeatable conditions through scalable Internet&lt;br/&gt;emulation. The
proposed system, ModelNet, emulates a wide-area&lt;br/&gt;network on a high-
speed cluster, enabling researchers to deploy&lt;br/&gt;unmodified software
prototypes in a configurable Internet-like&lt;br/&gt;environment and subject
them to faults and varying network conditions.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This
research will first investigate techniques for scaling
network&lt;br/&gt;emulation to thousands of unmodified applications with
aggregate&lt;br/&gt;communication bandwidth of over 10 Gb/s. Second, it will
enable the&lt;br/&gt;community to leverage large-scale network emulation as a
primary&lt;br/&gt;technique for rapidly developing and evaluating next-
generation&lt;br/&gt;Internet services and applications. Finally, the research
will seek&lt;br/&gt;fundamental improvements in network service robustness and
performance&lt;br/&gt;by providing a controlled environment for subjecting
network services&lt;br/&gt;to a range of realistic deployment
scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;
