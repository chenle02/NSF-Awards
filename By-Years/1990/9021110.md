This award is to the National Academy of Science/National Research Council
Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB) to convene a study committee that
brings together technology developers and users to develop the specific research
agenda necessary to support a national collaboratory. Collaboratory, is the term
for a complete computer and communications support environment for remote and in
situ scientific investigation. This includes access to distributed data bases,
remote control of instrumentation, and other features to enable scientific work
by teams of scientists not collocated with each other or their scientific
instruments. The CSTB will identify major scientific efforts that would
significantly benefit from an enhanced collaboration ability; it will assess the
needs and requirements of these projects through a series of workshops involving
both developers and potential users. A report summarizing the workshop findings
and their implications for a national collaboratory research agenda will be
prepared. It is estimated that the report will be available early in 1992.
