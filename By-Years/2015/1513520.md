The proposal requests travel funds enabling students to attend Career Workshop
for Women and Minorities in Computer Architecture (CWWMCA-2014). The workshop
will be held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, in conjunction with the 47th Annual
IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO). The CWWMCA
workshop focuses on the technical and career development of women and other
minorities in the research field of computer architecture. The main workshop
will be sponsored by ACM SIGMICRO as well as other industrial
companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support will go a long way towards including
participation of women and minority students in a leading computer architecture
workshop/conference and thereby enhancing the potential for their joining
university faculty and/or the information technology workforce in the near
future. Special funding will be provided for companion travel grants to support
attendees with either disabilities, or a parent of an infant less than one year
old, who cannot travel without the infant and a care provider for the infant.
These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the workshop and
the main conference and, subsequently, the research field.
