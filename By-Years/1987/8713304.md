This MRI Planning Grant for one year is to clarify the origin of an electrical
potential waveform that occurs very early in response to an auditory stimulus.
In a whole range of vertebrates, there is a characteristic set of electrical
potentials that characterize the response of the auditory system to a sound. A
waveform is present just before the wave representing the volley in the auditory
nerve, and this early wave may reflect the activity at the nerve terminals where
they receive input from the receptor cells. The junction between a receptor cell
and a nerve terminal is a synapse, and this early wave may represent an
excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP), which would be the signal that
excites the nerve. This planning grant will support collaboration and training
for the PI in a laboratory where significant expertise is available in this area
of auditory physiology. A brief comparative study will be done to try to clarify
the nature of this early waveform in three different species. Pharmacological
blockage studies should reveal information about the origins of the EPSP in the
peripheral auditory system. The study is important to provide a basis for a
future project to clarify the nature and function of the similar waveform found
in humans. The comparative studies here will allow access to peripheral
processes not available for study in humans.
