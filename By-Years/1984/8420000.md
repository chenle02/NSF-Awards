Partial support will be provided for a symposium to be held at the California
Institute of Technology, January 10-12, 1985. The symposium will be
international in scope and will be titled 'Fifty Years of Fluid Mechanics.'
Speakers will include representatives from physics, geophysics, theoretical
physics as well as the engineering disciplines. The symposium will offer a
unique opportunity to look into the future and assess the next 50 years of fluid
mechanics.
