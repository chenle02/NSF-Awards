The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is increasing road safety by making effective
visual street markings more affordable and accessible. This will be achieved
through the design of an intelligent mobile robotic system using advanced
localization and machine vision to automate the process of producing road
markings that are precisely created and accurately placed. The project will push
the limits of accuracy of geolocation of robotic material dispensing via a
mobile platform. The resulting system will dramatically improve efficiency of
road painting, offering greater precision, speed, and flexibility while reducing
risk to operators, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting greater road
safety through enhanced markings. Success in this effort will have applications
beyond road painting, including automated material dispensing more broadly, and
intelligent mobile manipulation for manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
challenges of automating creation of specific road markings at desired
locations. The research will include: design optimization of the mobile robot
for large-area, precision painting; sensor fusion for precision localization of
the mobile robot; precision hand/eye calibration; and development of adaptive
coverage algorithms capable of executing complex fill patterns adjusted
spatially based on localization, machine vision and 3-D surface
scanning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
