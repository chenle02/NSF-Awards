In the repair and maintenance of highway pavements and bridges, the work zone
has become a hazard resulting in many fatalities. One of the principal reasons
for the accidents is the absence of system performance standards for these
locations. This project will investigate and develop performance standards which
can be used to improve the mitigation of the hazard presented by construction
and maintenance personnel. Results will be useful to the construction industry.
