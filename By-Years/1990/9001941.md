(1) The trace formula of J. Arthur and A. Selberg (for the trace of the action
of a Hecke correspondence on the L2 cohomology of a Hermitian locally symmetric
space) will be reproved and interpreted in terms of the Lefschetz fixed point
theorem. This will involve a new evaluation of the local contribution to the
Lefschetz number at a fixed point and the construction of a new cohomology
theory ("weighted cohomology") on the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of
X. Applications will be made to the computation of characters of discrete series
representations, the cohomology of discrete groups, and the Hodge (p,q)
decomposition of the L2 cohomology. (2) Chern numbers of singular complex
algebraic varieties will be defined by lifting Chern classes to intersection
cohomology. The invariance properties of these new Chern numbers will be
investigated.
