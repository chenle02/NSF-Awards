This project investigates how human learners form generalizations from examples,
focusing on how conceptual complexity influences learning. When inducing
concepts, as when a learner forms an abstraction of the concept "chair" after
viewing only a few individual chairs, human learners have a bias towards
simplicity; i.e., they tend to induce the simplest generalizations consistent
with the examples. The exact meaning of the term "simple," however, is
notoriously difficult to capture in a rigorous theory. This project draws on
recent progress in quantifying conceptual simplicity and complexity in ways that
are both mathematically sound and psychologically accurate. The project seeks to
generalize this progress to apply to a wider range of human conceptual types
than has previously been possible, including "fuzzy" probabilistic concepts and
concepts defined over continuous features. The project involves both
mathematical modeling and extensive experiments on human subjects learning a
wide variety of concepts. By extending our understanding of complexity-
minimization in human learning, the project aims to build a more complete
account of the mechanisms underlying human learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project has many potential scientific benefits, including a greater
understanding of human learning and the possibility of more effective automated
learning mechanisms. More broadly, this project has the potential to help
quantify what makes some concepts inherently easier for humans to learn than
others, which could have direct applications to education practices and to
treatment understanding of learning disorders.
