We propose to develop and distribute a 40- to -50 page manual describing the
expedition, and providing specific examples of suitable interdisciplinary
activities. These activities will be consistent with the trend towards providing
educational experiences which are: --active, hands-on --high-interest --real
life --interdisciplinary --cooperative --community-based. We will use canoeing
as our primary example. However, we will include general information to enable
the teacher to adapt the approach for other outdoor recreational activities. We
will encourage schools and canoe liveries to work together to improve the
quality of local science programs and to create a generation of students with a
greater appreciation of, and concern for, our waterways. Our distribution plan
includes approximately 2200 livery owners with additional information on how to
approach the schools with this program.
