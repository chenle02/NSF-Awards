The advanced Computing Laboratory in the Computer Science Department at the
University of Tennessee has access to a number of new architecture high
performance computers. This award is to upgrade the facility by the addition of
a mixed mode Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)/Multiple Instruction
Multiple Data (MIMD) computer, increasing the number of processors in a shared
memory MIMD computer, and providing partial support for a technician. The
research supported by these computers include the design and development of
portable, efficient numerical linear algebra algorithms; the development of non-
numeric algorithms for parallel architectures; the development of parallel
algorithms for genome sequencing; and the development of parallel discrete
optimization algorithms using the genetic algorithm method.
