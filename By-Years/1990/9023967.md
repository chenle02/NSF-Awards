This proposal focusses on the traditional travel culture of the Inupiat Eskimo
of northern Alaska and the effects of recent cultural changes on travel behavior
and spatial skills. Included in the study will be an analysis of how travel
skills are passed on to the younger generation who do not have the same
subsistence pressures as earlier generations. Special attention will be given to
disorientation experiences. Extensive interviews will be carried out in the
communities of Barrow, Wainwright and Anaktuvuk Pass. The significance of the
study rests partly in the urgency of recording traditional knowledge which is
rapidly disappearing, and partly in analyzing how modern technology and culture
have altered travel culture in the Arctic. Travel and orientation knowledge was
a key element of survival in the past. Today, modern technology has enabled
rapid transportation but the loss of survival skills has drastically increased
the incidence of accidental death among the Eskimo.
