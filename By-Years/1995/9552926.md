9552926 Houston This two year project will provide a research experience of
eight weeks duration at UTMB for 20 students each year. The students will all be
from those who are entering either the 11th or 12th grade and are interested in
science. Five of these would be fully supported by the YS program while an
additional fifteen would be supported from other sources. The students would be
engaged in active research in the laboratories of their mentors. In addition
they would be strongly encouraged to participate in academic year follow-up
activities including a science fair project. The cost share is 265 % of the
request to the Foundation.
