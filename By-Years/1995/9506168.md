This proposal is for support of students and young scientists to travel to the
XIXth International Conference on the Physics of Electronic and Atomic
Collisions (ICPEAC) in Whistler, Canada, July 26 - August 1, 1995. Support is
limited to those U.S. scientists who are students or hold junior research
positions in an academic, governmental, or industrial institution. This series
of conferences was initiated in 1958, soon achieved international standing, and
later was recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. The
conference is a prime vehicle for international communication among scientists
working in the field of atomic, ionic and electronic collisions. This conference
offers opportunities for students and young scientists to interact with senior
scientists from around the world.
