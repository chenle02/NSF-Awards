This project will integrate a new laboratory technique for identifying organic
constituents, applying newly found kinetic parameters for these constituents,
developing a new organic maturation model on the basis of the kinetic
parameters, and finally integrating the maturation model to develop a predictive
tool for modeling basin evolution and hydrocarbon generation. The ability to
transfer the understanding of coal maturation to the maturation of kerogen,
which is the most common source for oil and gas, will be especially useful. Both
researchers have extensive research backgrounds and experience in the chemistry
and kinetics of coal reactions. They have significant publication records,
funding support, and instrumentation and should be able to complete this project
successfully.
