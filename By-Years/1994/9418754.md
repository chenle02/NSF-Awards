9418754 Abercrombie This research is to investigate both the depth and frequency
dependence of both scattering and intrinsic seismic attenuation using seismic
data recorded at the Cajon Pass borehole. Most of the previous studies
separating scattering from intrinsic attenuation assumed that they are constant
throughout the half space. However, recent work indicates that at least Qs is
about 100 times higher at 2.5 km depth than surface studies have predicted.
Effects on coda waves of a low Q layer at the surface and also depth variations
of attenuation associated with the brittle-ductile transition will be
investigated. The results will apply to studies of variations of Q before
earthquakes and to path corrections used in earthquake source studies. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
