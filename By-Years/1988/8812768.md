One of the major issues in neuroscience is tying what we know about chemical
messengers in the nervous system to actual behaviors. This project combines the
expertise of investigators in the chemical and biological sciences to address
the problem of the relationship of neurotransmitter release and behavior. The
most studied neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is dopamine.
Although the role that dopamine plays in behavior has been the subject of
intensive investigation, its specific role in a number of behaviors is still not
understood. Part of the reason for the slow progress has been the absence of
methods which allow observation of dopamine release during behavior. Drs. Joseph
Justice and Darryl Neill have developed new techniques which will be utilized to
monitor neurotransmitter release in behaving animals. In particular the
relationship of dopamine release and reward will be investigated, using
intracranial self-stimulation, drug self-stimulation and food reward. Behavioral
studies have indicated a role of dopamine in the reward of these three different
stimuli. Direct observation of the neurochemical substrate thought to mediate
these behaviors will significantly enhance our understanding of dopamine release
and behavior.
