9529771 Molinari This project involves the study of the influence of three
aspects of large-scale atmospheric flow on tropical cyclogenesis. Previous
observational studies have suggested that interactions between the negative
vorticity anomalies associated with upper tropospheric outflow from anticyclones
and environmental positive vorticity anomalies are related to the strength of
those anomalies. A shallow water model will be used to conduct numerical
experiments to try to better understand the nature of these interactions in
subsequent tropical cyclone development. The second part of the project involves
an observational study of the role the direction of vertical wind shear in
tropical cyclone development, particularly relative to the opposing influence of
upper level vorticity. This will be accomplished using ECMWF gridded analyses.
The third part will consist of an examination of the role of the time-averaged
potential vorticity field on the genesis and movement of tropical cyclones in
the Atlantic and eastern Pacific through analysis of the ECMWF gridded fields
and numerical modeling work. ***
