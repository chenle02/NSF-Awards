This ITR proposal supports a focused and coordinated effort over five years
directed toward creating a 32 qubit quantum processor using individually
addressable neutral Rb atoms trapped by laser beams on a two-dimensional
lattice. It builds on recent very promising, but experimentally undemonstrated,
theoretical concepts about manipulating the quantum coupling between atoms using
lasers and highly excited atomic states. The team will use a reconfigurable
atomic lattice defined by the beams from holographic optical elements. With a
site to site spacing of 7 microns each qubit is individually addressable. Qubits
are represented by hyperfine ground state levels and arbitrary state vector
rotations are performed using laser pulses. The conditional two-qubit
interaction that is needed for a complete set of logical primitives is achieved
by exciting to a high lying atomic Rydberg level. A novel aspect of the
implementation of these concepts is the exploitation of the dipole-blockade to
allow massively sub-Poissonian loading of the qubit sites. The project is a
collaboration between the Physics and Computer Sciences departments at The
University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Electrical Engineering department at The
University of Colorado Boulder.
