The objective of this research program is to develop through genetic
engineering technology a family of "affinity bioadhesives" for specific
eukaryotic cell attachment applications. In an ongoing research program, Genex
has produced a series of recombinant adhesive proteins based on the polyphenolic
protein of the blue mussel. In Phase I of the program proposed herein Dr. Link
plans to extend this technology to the area of cell culture attachment by
developing novel fusion proteins which she terms "affinity bioadhesives". To
accomplish this she will assemble hybrid genes that encode fusion proteins
carrying the cell attachment region of human fibronectin fused with the
engineered mussel adhesive. These fusion proteins will be expressed in yeast,
purified and evaluated for their adhesive and cell attachment properties. These
first engineered affinity bioadhesives will test the feasibility of the
approach. %%% Affinity bioadhesives have potential application in cell culture
research and large scale culture of mammalian cells.
