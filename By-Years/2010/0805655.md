This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY
2008. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Resolving
regulatory networks underlying developmental fate of maize inflorescence
meristems" for Andrea L. Eveland. The host institution for this research is Cold
Spring Harbor and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. David Jackson and Dr. Doreen
Ware.

In maize reproductive growth, the shape of clusters of flowers on a stem
(inflorescence morphology) and their branching structures are determined by
highly organized stem cell populations in the plant tissues giving rise to
flowers, floral meristems. Genetic studies of mutants in meristem determinacy
have identified key genes that regulate flower cluster (inflorescence) branching
and their basic molecular mechanisms. However, global interactions linking these
genes to important metabolic and regulatory pathways have not been resolved.
This research utilizes a series of large datasets based on these mutant analyses
to construct regulatory networks regulating the developmental fate of maize
inflorescence meristems. Datasets will be organized into a framework that can be
continuously referenced and updated as additional datasets become available.

Training objectives of this research include techniques in programming,
computational genomics skills, and undergraduate mentorship. The broader impacts
of this research include the developing an infrastructure for understanding
molecular and genetic interactions and answering key biological questions
regarding developmental and metabolic processes through bioinformatics.
Additionally, the research has agricultural significance as results may shed
light on grain yield.
