Understanding Credit Crises&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have
spent the best part of their careers understanding financial institutions, and
the role they play in the economy. In recent years, they have built up from
financial institutions. They have studied the role of aggregate real liquidity
(as well as the role of aggregate fiat money) on bank behavior. Particularly
interesting has been the two-way interactions between banks' asset and liability
structures and aggregate variables like liquidity. In their proposed work, they
want to examine banker incentives - to set bank leverage, to choose between
assets of varying liquidity, and to sell, liquidate, or keep assets - based both
on aggregate variables such as liquidity as well as the actions of the
government authorities/central bank. They hope thereby to understand the kind of
actions banks might take that increase the risk of crises, as well as their
behavior in the midst of a crisis. This then allows us to think more carefully
about policy, both monetary (the links between monetary policy and risk taking
behavior will be one of the important contributions of their work) and
regulatory. As the PIs develop these ideas, they will also focus on testing some
of the empirical implications of their theories, given the rich data from across
the world that will be available from this crisis.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Rajan used some of the ideas the PIs had developed in their
earlier work in providing an early warning to central bankers about the
potential for a crisis of the kind we have witnessed. The PIs' joint,
accessible, paper in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings
(Diamond and Rajan (2009)), summarizing the causes of the crisis, has been
widely downloaded, reprinted, and read. Both PIs have been very active, both in
proposing actions to resolve the crisis, as well as in making suggestions for
change. Both PIs are members of the Squam Lake Group, a non-partisan group of
academics that has put together a set of memos on a number of aspects of
regulatory reform. They have interacted with members of the Treasury, the Fed,
and Congress, explaining the implications of different reforms in light of their
theories. Their current proposal will help us understand better the kinds of
incentives that led to the crisis, as well as to the kind of behavior observed
in the crisis. Clearly, this will help guide policy formulation for the future.
The PIs also hope to train a number of students, both through their teaching
(they teach both MBA as well as specialized Ph.D. courses), their Ph.D. advisory
role, as well as through their employment of research assistants.
