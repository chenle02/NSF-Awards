ABSTRACT Richards Richards will continue his program of research on
hypergeometric functions defined on matrix spaces and on symmetric cones.
Special attention will be paid to the theory of operator-valued hypergeometric
functions on the symmetric cones. In the second part of the project the
principal investigator will continue his research on applications of these
special functions, and general techniques in harmonic analysis and
representation theory, to the areas of multivariate statistics, total
positivity, probability inequalities, and related combinatorial problems.
Richards is interested in research problems Modern Analysis, a subfield of
mathematics, for two reasons. First, Modern Analysis is an important branch of
mathematics with fundamental links to astronomy, chemistry, physics, statistics,
as well as to other areas of mathematics. Richards primary expertise in Modern
Analysis is in the study of new classes of hypergeometric functions which
generalize the classical theory developed by Euler, Gauss, Bessel, Ramanujan and
many other famous scientists. Second, the principal investigator is interested
in these new types of hypergeometric functions because of their fundamental
importance in multivariate statistics. The research program will study these new
hypergeometric functions and their properties with the aim of finding solutions
to unsolved statistical problems which are of importance to applied researchers
in medical and environmental fields.
