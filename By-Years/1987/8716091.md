The thin filaments of vertebrate muscle are composed primarily of the globular
protein complex troponin, the super-coiled protein tropomyosin and the helical
homo-polymer F-actin. Tropomyosin lies approximately along the main helical
groove of the F-actin. The regulation of muscle is effected by the binding and
unbinding of calcium to troponin molecules which reside on the thin filament.
This binding changes the thin-filament structure thus modulating the acto-
myosin interaction and the subsequent production of tension. It is this change
that Dr. Mendelson plans to study. He hopes ultimately to understand how the
change that occurs at the acto-myosin site causes regulation. Neutron scattering
and diffraction techniques will be used to study filamentous samples in vitro.
Recent advances by him in the deuteration of muscle proteins make the
application of this technique to the study of problems of muscle control
technically feasible.***//
