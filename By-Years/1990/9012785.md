This project is devoted to surface x-ray scattering studies of epitaxial growth
onto perfect crystal substrates. Part of the effort will be devoted to an
extension of exact results of dynamical diffraction theory to surface
diffraction, to complement current descriptions based on kinematical theory.
Measurements will be made on clean silicon and germanium surfaces in ultra-high
vacuum using the triple crystal diffraction (TCD) method. Experiments will then
proceed with monolayer coverages of lattice- matched alkali halides epitaxially
grown onto Ge surfaces, with both TCD and x-ray standing wave (XSW) measurements
being used to solve the "phase problem." The studies will also be extended to
thicker layers of alkali halides, in part to monitor the interference between
the substrate and overlayer diffraction in the XSW and TCD spectra. This x-ray
analog of reflection high energy electron diffraction oscillations will be
analyzed theoretically using appropriate computational models.
