The 10th Brauer Group Meeting is a conference that will be held Monday - Friday,
August 6 - August 10, 2012 at the Pingree Park campus of Colorado State
University. This location is approximately one hour outside of Ft. Collins, CO,
USA. The Brauer group is an abstract algebraic group studied by mathematicians
with a wide variety of interests. Algebraists often study the Brauer group in
its role as a directory of division algebras over a field, ultimately with the
goal of understanding arithmetic complexity in fields. Open questions relate to
simplicity of description, expression in terms of cyclic classes, and the search
for a reasonable definition of dimension for fields and for algebraic groups
such as PGL(n). Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important
invariant of a scheme arising from etale cohomology. This point of view goes
back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still
actively being investigated. Recently deep connections have arisen between
Brauer groups of schemes and stack theory, and these are being used not only to
attack some longstanding open problems, but to serve as inspiration for new
problems and approaches.

The primary goal of this conference is to bring together established and
beginning researchers from all of these perspectives to collaborate and share
insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms.
The conference will serve to both unify viewpoints and diversify methods, and
will yield not only progress on problems and increased levels of collaboration,
but the initiation of new researchers into the Brauer groups community. Formal
talks will be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers,
including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty. Time will also be
allotted for informal collaboration and open problem sessions in hopes of
encouraging new research questions and collaborations. Information about the
conference and titles and abstracts for the talks will be posted at
