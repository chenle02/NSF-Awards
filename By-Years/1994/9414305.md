9414305 Beske-Diehl The PIs will perform an exploratory investigation into the
viability of using ESR spectroscopy signatures of volcanic ash and ejecta to
determine synchroneity of distributed ash deposits. In this investigation they
will first determine whether magnetic properties are uniform throughout distal
portions of at least two volcanic tephra units. Next they will determine whether
magnetic properties can identify tephra deposits from different eruptions of the
sam volcano and from eruptions of different volcanoes by investigating magnetic
properties of such tephra units. ****
