Technology mediated social participation is now a way of life for millions of
people as they text family and friends via cell phones, track leaders and
celebrities on Twitter, update their Facebook page to tell others about their
activities, and interact with numerous web portals. Use of these technologies
spans a broad range of users, from kids under ten years old to
retirees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will develop an intellectual
framework and research agenda for studying and facilitating social participation
for national priorities, such as health care, education, energy, disaster
response, community safety, and environmental protection. Two workshops will
cover six topics that will spur research challenges: (a) theoretical integration
(b) social capital, social intelligence, and effective action, (c) sharable
infrastructure, ethics, and protections, (d) design to motivate, (e) graduate
training and (f) the unique challenges for government use of social media. The
primary output of the workshops will be a report that specifies challenges and
outcomes for each of the topic areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
