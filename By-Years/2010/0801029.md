DMS-0801029 Eisenstein Series, Operators and L-Functions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Dr. Lagarias proposes to investigate various analytic problems related to
Eisenstein series and L-functions in number theory. There are three topics. The
first topic concerns the Lerch zeta function and its relation to Eisenstein
series. The second topic concerns properties of certain de Branges spaces and
associated operators attached to automorphic L-functions. A third topic is to
investigate Fourier coefficients of various nonholomorphic Eisenstein
series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is in the area of number theory.
Number theory has in recent years has provided many useful applications in
communications, coding theory and cryptography. Recent developments have
observed parallels between problems in number theory, including the distribution
of prime numbers, and various topics in mathematical physics. This proposal
investigates possible connections of this kind. The problems considered may
stimulate interactions between researchers in these fields. The proposer is
training graduate students in related areas.&lt;br/&gt;
