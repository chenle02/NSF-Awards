Through selection and characterization of nitrate reductase deficient mutants it
has been demonstrated that barley has two nitrate reductase isozymes, one NADH
specific and the other NAD(P)H bispecific. Little is known about the importance
or regulation of NAD(P)H nitrate reductases in barley or other cereal species.
This research will 1) develop techniques for specifically quantifying NADH and
NAD(P)H nitrate reductase proteins and mRNAs, and 2) determine the effects of
nitrate, light and reduced nitrogen on nitrate reductase proteins and mRNA using
newly developed quantification techniques. Nitrate reductase mRNAs will be
determined by using cDNA clones of each nitrate reductase as specific probes.
Monoclonal and/or monospecific polyclonal antisera will be used to quantify
nitrate reductase proteins.%%% Many higher plants, especially cereals, obtain
nitrogen from the soil as nitrate. Nitrate reductase, a highly regulated enzyme,
is often considered to be a key limiting step in the nitrate assimilation
process in plants. This research will identify translational and transcriptional
mechanisms which regulate specific nitrate reductase in barley. By developing a
thorough understanding of the genetic and biochemical processes regulating
nitrate reduction this research will contribute to improved nitrogen use
efficiency in crop plants.***//
