NSF Postdoctoral Fellowships in Biology combine research and training components
to prepare young scientists for careers in biology and require a plan to broaden
participation of groups under-represented in science and engineering. The
fellowships advance NSF efforts to diversify the STEM workforce now and in the
future. This fellowship to M. Joey Pakes supports a research and training plan
in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of
groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan is "Extreme
Cave Systems: Ciphers into the Evolution of Chemosynthetic Symbiosis." The host
institution is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Colleen
Cavanaugh. Training objectives include transcriptomics, genomics, and
microscopy. The knowledge gained about fragile cave ecosystems that are highly
sensitive to pollution and other human impacts may inform conservation
management decisions. Educational outreach includes involving undergraduates in
laboratory and computational techniques and developing inquiry based lessons
focused on cave and field biology in primary schools.

Underwater caves provide unique locations to study how animals and microbes in
extreme environments evolved, thus providing insight into life's origins. A
diversity of mutualisms between microbes and invertebrates form the basis of
foodwebs in lightless habitats, for example, hydrothermal vents. Recently
discovered intracellular symbioses with chemosynthetic microbes in the shrimp
Typhlatya pearsei and similar extracellular symbioses of other cave crustaceans
provide an opportunity to study crustacean symbioses and their evolution in
extreme underwater ecosystems. The research uses field collected specimens and
environmental data, as well as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to
investigate symbiont identity and host-symbiont function.
