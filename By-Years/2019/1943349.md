Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bringing significant benefits to human society
with outstanding potential to address essential human concerns in the future.
Deep neural networks have shown significant improvements in many AI
applications. However, the benefit comes at the high cost of computational
resources and engineer resources. For mobile devices with a tight power budget,
such high demands for computation become prohibitive. On the other side, there
is a shortage of experts who can design neural networks, which are notoriously
hard to tune. This project systematically investigates efficient neural network
architectures and their hardware accelerators to make them run fast at low
power. It also aims to accelerate the design cycle by AI-based design automation
(AI-designed AI). Such design methodology can support machine learning research
and education,, while significantly improving the productivity of machine
learning models. People no longer have to hand-tune the model, but it is
automated, enabling non-experts to build efficient machine learning models. It
will democratize AI to a more diverse community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project aims to auto-generate both efficient neural networks and their hardware
implementations that can generalize to high-dimensional representations, through
automatic machine learning (AutoML) techniques. It will design a hardware
accelerator to provide more computation per unit cost. The algorithm hardware
co-design approach unveils a larger design space that conventional wisdom has
been limited to. It is expected to shorten the design cycle of neural
architecture search by two orders of magnitude over existing work. With AutoML,
powerful hardware, and the co-designed efficient algorithms, it is possible to
solve more challenging AI tasks on high-dimensional data that are previously
difficult or impossible, hindered by the computation resource, such as videos
and 3D point clouds. These techniques give rise to a deeper understanding of the
high dimensional representations and produce state-of-the-art neural network
architectures that can efficiently run on mobile devices as well as protect user
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
