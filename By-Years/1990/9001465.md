This research includes studies of: nuclear structure primarily oriented toward
exploration of collective multi- photon level-multiplets, such as quadrupole-
quadrupole, quadrupole-octupole, and octupole-octupole multiplets; mixed
symmetry states called into notice by the Interacting Boson Model in which
protons and neutrons are in different boson bases, with different energies and
different residual interaction strengths, neutron scattering as a probe of the
strong, specific differences in electric quadrupole excitations seen by neutrons
as opposed to other hadrons or leptons; and astrophysics-related reactions
important to an eventual Bromine solar neutrino detector, and the Iodine
reactions leading to Xenon, relevant to another and potentially more powerful
neutrino detector.
