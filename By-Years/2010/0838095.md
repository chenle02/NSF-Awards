Lipids are a fundamental requirement for all cellular life. Lipids form the
basis for cellular compartmentation, provide for the organization of energy
transduction machinery, serve as storage reserves to support normal growth and
development, and act as signals in cellular communication networks. Plant-
derived oils provide a major source of calories for humans and include essential
dietary components required by all mammals. Furthermore, there are growing
numbers of examples of plant-derived lipids that have important therapeutic
applications. Despite their involvement in virtually all aspects of biology and
importance to society, lipids are by far the least well understood of the major
cellular components and tend to be an underrepresented topic at larger plant
biology meetings. As such, plant lipids deserve to be at the focus of a
detailed, coordinated research effort by a diverse group of scientists. In
response, in 2007, the Gordon Research Conference Board of Directors approved a
new conference for February 2009 entitled Plant Lipids: Structure, Metabolism
and Function - a major step forward for the plant lipid community. This
conference should accelerate research, facilitate wide dissemination of research
breakthroughs, support recruitment of young scientists to the field of plant
lipid biology and encourage broad participation of the plant lipid community in
guiding future directions for research. The topics and participants in the
program have been brought together from two groups and concepts that have been
treated separately in national and international venues, one group with a focus
on biochemistry and molecular biology and one group with a focus on signaling
functions. The conference will bring together senior- and junior-level
scientists involved in plant lipid metabolism and function and thus facilitate
the sharing of a broad range of insights. Applications from underrepresented
minority participants will be encouraged and a dedicated committee will help to
identify and support diverse participation in the conference.
