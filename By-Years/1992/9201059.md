The NSFNET, a nationwide computer network sponsored by the National Science
Foundation for use by the academic research and education community, has used
the Defense Data Network (DDN) system for assigning and registering electronic
addresses for authorized host computers. These unique addresses were assigned by
SRI International, Inc. as part of long term contract that DCA had with SRI and
through an Interagency Agreement the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) had with NSF. The National Science Foundation's mounting responsibility
to provide the communications infrastructure, including information services for
the scientific community and for the pending High Performance Computing and
Communications initiative (HPCC), has made it necessary for NSF to assume
responsibilty for provision of its own registration services for the user
community. As a result of a recompetition for services, GSI has replaced SRI as
the contractor to DCA for provision of registration services and network and
host machine address assignment. Accordingly, the DCA agrees to provide address
registration services for the NSF community of users on an interim basis while
the NSF implements its own soliciation for long term registration and
information services. This will insure continuity of this critical operation for
the entire Internet community.
