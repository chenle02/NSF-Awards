15260-0001 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Mathematics Title: A Mathematica Lab
for Calculus and Beyond A Mathematica laboratory is being developed to support
expanded curricular reform in calculus and to initiate reform of subsequent
service courses at the University of Pittsburgh. The laboratory is supporting
expanded implementation of a two track calculus course, based on the Calculus
&amp; Mathematica materials of Davis, Porta and Uhl, and the Harvard Calculus
Consortium materials of Hughes-Hallett, Gleason, et al., which is affecting all
students in the science and engineering calculus sequence. In addition, this
project is facilitating revitalization of the mathematics curriculum at the next
level through reform of the mathematics courses serving engineering, physical,
and social sciences.
