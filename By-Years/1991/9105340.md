This award provides 50% funding toward the acquisition of a single crystal
diffraction system and a rotating anode X-ray source. The equipment is to be
installed in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of
Colorado. The University is committed to providing the remaining 50% funding
required. The diffraction system will be used in research focused on the effects
of crystal structure and bonding on the inter- and intra- crystalline
distribution of elements and isotopes in mineral systems, especially those found
in the Earth's mantle.
