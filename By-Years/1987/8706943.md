The revision of the classification and phylogeny of the Dorylomimini (beetles
which parasitize ants) is proposed. This study should contribute to the
understanding of the evolution of beetles which live in ant colonies and
parasitize ants. It should also contribute evidence for the understanding of ant
evolution and to the understanding of the integrating mechanisms that permit
foreign organisms to live in societies of social insects.
