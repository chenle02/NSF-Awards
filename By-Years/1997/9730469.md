9730469 Sadler DESIGNS is a one year, middle school, physical science and
technology course. It is based upon engineering design projects previously
developed and tested. "Design-under-constraint" challenges, in which students
creatively optimize the functioning of existing devices and processes, are
alternatives to traditional and discovery-based experiments. The challenges have
been found to significantly change students' science process skills and change
their preconceptions. The course addresses the physical science content
standards of the science standards through challenges in the construction of
batteries, bridges, electromagnets, solar heating and a gravity car. Each
challenge begins with student construction of a standard device. The students
are challenged to optimize the performance of a variable that has a large range.
The construction takes little time and the outcome is tested publicly. Students
are asked to predict results of trials and explain the outcomes. Teachers are
involved in the development and testing of the materials. The materials are
distributed commercially.
