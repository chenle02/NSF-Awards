The DNA content of rice endosperm nuclei, instead of remaining at the expected
3C level, increases to higher values. The questions that are being asked are the
following. What is the pattern of DNA synthesis and accumulation in endosperm
nuclei during the entire course of development of this tissue? If the endosperm
nuclei exhibits a modal increase in DNA content, is this referable to cell
fusion, polyploidy, polyteny, endoreduplication or selective gene amplification?
Is there evidence for the under.representation of certain genes during the
ontogeny of the endosperm? Autoradiographic (including DNA fiber
autoradiography) and Feulgen microspectrophotometic methods will be used to
study the changing pattern of DNA synthesis and accumulation. The reassociation
kinetics of endosperm DNA with leaf or embryo DNA and with cloned genes will be
employed to establish whether the high DNA content is due to endoreduplication
or gene amplification. The kinetics of hybridization between endosperm DNA and
rRNA will be analyzed to determine whether the rRNA genes are under.replicated
during endosperm development.
