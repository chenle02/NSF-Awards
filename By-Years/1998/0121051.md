This is a study of the propagation of ignition and extinction fronts (edge
flames) on diffusion-flame sheets using a combination of analytical methods and
numerical simulations. The scope and utility of the previously articulated
parabolic flame path assumption (PFPA) and its incorporation into the
activation-energy asymptotics framework are tested. Systems examined include
extinction fronts, colliding triple flames, and circular ignition fronts. The
work has implications for describing a member of important practical phenomena
including lift-off and blow-out of jet flames, autoignition in diesel engines,
flame spread over fuel beds, and local extinction in turbulent nonpremixed
combustion.
