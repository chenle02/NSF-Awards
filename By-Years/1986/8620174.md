Oregon State University is undertaking a 30-month project that addresses a need
and requirement within biological and chemical oceanography to improve sea-going
data gathering technologies that describe the distribution of nutrients and
organisms on space and time scales that are better focused than presently
available technology permits. Water sampling bottles, towed devices, and pumping
systems that are presently used to measure fine-scale distributions of nutrients
and chlorophyll are too coarse to describe plankton distribution in terms of
fine scale physical parameters. The overall plan is to develop a fiber-optic
system to sense and measure chlorophyll fluorescence and mate it to the existing
physical oceanographic instrumentation that measures microstructure and
turbulence. The multidisciplinary project will develop a sea-going laser/fiber
optic system for making high-frequency, high spatial resolution (vertical and
horizontal), in-situ biological and chemical measurements. The following
specific objectives have been identified: 1) develop an oceanographic
application for remote fiber optic fluorescent technology; 2) obtain scientific
data that demonstrates the importance and applicability of this technology; 3)
obtain coherence between biological and physical measurement scales in the upper
ocean; and 4) investigate potential methods for making in-situ measurements of
nutrient concentrations. Part of the development work is to be done by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on a sub-contract. The Office of Naval
Research and the Biological Oceanography Program are also providing support.
