9310595 Bott Meiofauna (animals between 50 and 100 microns in size) feeding
studies will be conducted in situ by following the accumulation in animals of
flouorescently labeled bacteria and algae added to flumes inserted in the
streambed. Simultaneous measures of bacterial and algal productivity using 3H
thymidine and oxygen change procedures, respectively will allow assessment of
the proportion of production consumed by meiofauna. Other grazing experiments
will indicate whether protozoa are important intermediates in the transfer of
energy from bacteria and algae to meiofauna and the extent to which meiofauna
consume protozoa. Finally, we will manipulate meiofauna densities and
concentrations of dissolved organic matter to see whether those predators or
nutrients, or both acting interactively or addictively regulate bacterial and
algal densities and productivity. %%% Meiofauna are a conspicuously understudied
group of organisms in streams, and the research here investigates their impact
on epibenthic bacteria and algae, as well as the relative importance of
nutrients and bacterivory in controlling bacterial biomass in streams.
