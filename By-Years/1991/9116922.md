This project is a cooperative effort to measure transport and water mass
characteristics of the Benguela Current at 30|S in the eastern Atlantic. A
section of Inverted Echo Sounders (IES) and current meters along 30|S will be
complemented by three IES'S AT 39|S. CTD surveys will be carried out along and
between the sections. Objectives are to monitor transport and source waters of
the Benguela in relation to variability in the Agulhas Retroflection region.
Data will be combined with similar data from the western side of the subtropical
gyre, collected by German inestigators, in order to address the total meridional
transport across 30|S. Although not part of the official US WOCE program,
results will contribute to WOCE activity in the South Atlantic.
