Small populations of endangered species risk extinction due to random changes
in population size, or due to harmful genetic changes. This research examines
the relative importance of these two factors for species survival. The
investigators will study this question using wild populations of two rare plants
species in western Montana. Results will contribute to general understanding of
changes in population size, as well as allow managers to formulate guidelines
and principles for preservation of these and similar species. Finally,
Lesquerella humilis, one of the species to be studied, is an alternative crop
species with potential economic value in industry and medicine. Unique
hydroxylated oils from Lesquerella have several uses in manufacturing. Sulfur
compounds (glucosinolates) from Lesquerella are being examined as a potential
antitumor drug. Thus, this research has important relevance to basic
understanding of conservation biology as well as potential for practical
application.
