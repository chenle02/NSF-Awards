This project is bringing today's technology into the mathematics classrooms at
North Harris College and giving their instructors the opportunity to enhance and
expand instruction techniques and teaching philosophies. They are bringing
technology into the classroom by: 1) placing, in each of our five classrooms, a
computer that projects its images through a projection panel hooked to a cool-
running projector and Personal Science Laboratory (PSL) Explorer software and
hardware, 2) having available five classroom sets of TI-85 graphics calculators
with overhead viewers. Their primary goal is to incorporate technology into
every mathematics course, not just as a drill and practice, but also as an
innovative tool for discovery, enrichment, deep thinking, and understanding will
allow for a variety of approaches to learning.
