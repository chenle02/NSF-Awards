This award will provide support for a ?Graduate Meeting on Combinatorial
Commutative Algebra? at the University of Minnesota the weekend of May 13-15,
2022. It will bring together graduate students and researchers in related fields
from a broad geographical region. At the event, research ideas and knowledge
will be shared, encouraging collaboration and increasing connections between
mathematicians at various career levels with algebraic and combinatorial
interests, among others. This gathering will help build community and advance
the professional development of graduate students and recent PhDs. This will be
accomplished by longer lectures by postdoctoral faculty and shorter talks and
poster presentations by those at the student level. Additionally, structured
conversations during lunch breaks will provide career guidance and open dialogue
on professional matters.

Combinatorial commutative algebra, the overarching mathematical theme of the
event, has cross-disciplinary appeal, connecting to algebraic geometry and
topology, applied and computational algebra, combinatorics, number theory, and
representation theory. Therefore, participants in the conference will be exposed
to, and share, a variety of research avenues and lines of questioning. The
latest developments the field will be discussed. The meeting will take place the
weekend before the international conference Open Problems in Algebraic
Combinatorics occurs at the University of Minnesota. The breadth of the
connections, as well as the proximity of the two events, will attract
participants from around the country and enrich the intellectual environment of
the meeting. Participants will learn about recent advances and techniques and be
exposed to various research directions and open questions. For more information
on the conference, see https://math.umn.edu/~mahrud/GradMoCCA.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
