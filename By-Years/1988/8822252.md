With this award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, Louis Messerle of the University of Iowa will investigate
organometallic compounds of the early transition metals such as zirconium,
hafnium, vanadium and tantalum as possible agents for the activation of carbon-
hydrogen bonds of alkanes and alkenes. The discovery of a good carbon-hydrogen
activation catalyst would allow the use of methane and lower hydrocarbons from
natural gas or biomass decomposition as an alternative to petroleum as an energy
source and feedstock for much of the synthetic organic chemical industry. The
emphasis in this work will be the synthesis and study of the alkane/alkene
reactivity of metal- dinuclear compounds, such as doubly bonded dizirconium and
triply bonded ditantalum complexes in intermediate oxidation states. Ancillary
ligands such as mono- and bi-dentate tertiary phosphines and penta-
methylcyclopentadienyl will be used to minimize competitive intramolecular C-H
activation. Functionalization studies, such as carbonylation, bromination,
monooxidation and photochemical dehydrogenation, on the new
alkyl/vinyl(hydrido)dinuclear products will be investigated.
