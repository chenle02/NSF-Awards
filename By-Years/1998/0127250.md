Geology (42) We are designing and constructing an artificial rock outcrop on our
campus at the University of New Orleans. Louisiana has no natural rock outcrops,
which impacts how local students learn geology. Students have tremendous
difficulty with 3-D spatial-visualization thinking and often have minimal
exposure to field geology and natural outcrops. Although Louisiana is ideal for
studying recent sedimentary processes it offers few opportunities for inquiry
about rocks and outcrops, both of which are essential for geology. This proof-
of-concept project is the first step in addressing these challenges. The outcrop
is being used by a large population of students and is designed to promote
collaboration between the Colleges of Science and Education and the local school
system. The artificial outcrop is one way we are trying to recruit
underrepresented students into the sciences, particularly geology.
