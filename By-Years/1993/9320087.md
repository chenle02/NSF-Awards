9320087 Holtz This project is an analytical and experimental investigation of
the seismic stability of geosynthetically-reinforced earth slopes. The
objectives are to: (1) increase the understanding of the fundamental seismic
behavior of geosynthetically-reinforced earth slopes, and (2) develop realistic
analytical models for the seismic design of such structures. Nonlinear dynamic
finite element analyses are used to evaluate the influence of material,
geometric, and loading characteristics, as well as ground motion parameters, on
the performance of steep (defined as greater that 2:1) geosynthetically-
reinforced slopes. Models of reinforced slopes will be built and tested under
simulated seismic loading conditions using a dynamic geotechnical centrifuge and
a large shaking table, in order to understand governing failure mechanisms and
critical engineering properties operative during earthquake ground shaking.
Existing analysis and design methods for static stability will be appropriately
modified to treat seismic loading in a rational way, so that geosynthetic-
reinforced slopes can be designed with increased confidence and economy. This
research has important implications for residential and commercial land
development in seismically-active regions. ***
