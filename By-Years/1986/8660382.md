This is a recommendation for an award to support research on the feasibility of
improving the dewatering of sludges derived from treatment of wastewater by the
use of enzymes. This work could provide an alternative for sludge dewatering
with substantial savings of energy and cost. The work will focus initially on
obtaining sludge microbes which over-produce polysaccharide slimes, followed by
isolating other microbes capable of degrading polysaccharides present in the
sludge. Factors influencing rapid, effective, and adequate polysaccharide
degradation will be identified and verified by addition of slime- degrading
microbial cultures, their bacteriophages, and extracted depolymerase enzymes to
model systems of slime-containing sludges. The proposal leading to this
recommendation was submitted in accord with NSF 86-I9, Small Business Innovation
Research. This proposed work has objectives consistent with those of the Program
in Environmental Engineering and the investigators have qualifications
appropriate for the work to be done. Award is recommended in the amount of
$39,580 for six months starting on February 1, 1987. This will be for Phase I as
described in NSF 86-19.
