The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project involves exploring the
commercial potential of cutting tool wear monitoring sensors. Cutting tool
manufacturers, machine tool manufacturers, and CNC machine operating companies
can potentially benefit through improved cutting tool production processes and
saving tooling time needed for production. There is a potential growing
industrial customer need to accurately, precisely, and inexpensively sense and
diagnose cutting tool wear, damage, and/or cutting edge quality. However, there
are few reliable instruments available in the market with the required accuracy,
resolution, cost, and on-machine usage. The proposed sensor allows for high-
resolution monitoring and diagnosis of edge quality by providing quantitative
information on morphological properties, including tool edge quality and wear
related to abrasion, attrition, and chipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps
project bridges a knowledge gap existing between the state-of-the-art
instrumentation technologies and cutting tool inspection methods. Existing
methods do not typically provide a quantitative measure to monitor the health of
precision cutting tools in a convenient and time/cost-effective manner. The
knife-edge interferometer developed in this project allows for precision cutting
tool wear measurement and monitoring by providing quantitative information on
morphological properties including abrasion, attrition, and chipping. This
project enables a new cutting tool wear monitoring paradigm, producing new
knowledge in instrumentation and characterization. This research will create a
new transformative wear diagnosis principle for precision cutting tools to
improve manufacturing reliability and the automation
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
