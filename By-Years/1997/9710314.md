9710314 Schmidt This award funds research by the principle investigator on four
broad topics in Number Theory. The first topic is linear recurrence sequences,
and research on this will necessitate refinements of the Subspace Theorem. The
second topic concerns Diophantine approximation both in the classical and in the
power series context. For the third topic, the PI wishes to contribute to
questions connected with Artin's conjecture on p-adic forms, in particular
bounds replacing the d^2 (which was proved wrong) in the conjecture, and
information on the primes p for which the conjecture is actually true. The
fourth topic is a particular project on solution trees of congruences in one
variable. This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number
Theory. Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole
numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one
whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in
areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
