This work involves the analysis and application of constant step- size adaptive
recursive algorithms. The PI is applying the weak convergence theory pioneered
by Kushner and incorporating prescaling to study the tracking behavior of
constant step-size algorithms. These algorithms will then be applied to the
problem of spectral line enhancement. This in turn has practical application to
the problem of detecting harmonic signals in noise, which occurs in
communications, signal processing, geophysics, military applications, etc. In
the second year, he plans to generalize the adaptive recursive method and extend
it to adaptive lattice filters which have been found to be quite useful in many
signal processing applications.
