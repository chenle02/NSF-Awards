A fundamental problem in the neurosciences is the characterization of the
mechanism(s) controlling the release of neurotransmitters and neurohormones at
nerve endings. These mechanisms are crucial to nerve cell communication and to a
healthy, functioning nervous system. Although the importance of calcium's role
in release has been well established, details in its action are poorly
understood. This research project is designed to examine, quantitatively, the
relationship between calcium currents and intracellular calcium concentrations.
Moreover, receptor mediated regulation of the calcium current and its effect on
intracellular calcium levels will be directly evaluated. Electrophysiological
techniques combined with microspectrofluorometry of calcium sensitive,
fluorescent indicators will be used to monitor intracellular calcium levels.
Techniques will be developed to allow simultaneous monitoring of neurohormone
release from single endings. This research will lead to a better understanding
of the properties and actions of molecular components regulating neurohormone
release from vertebrate nerve endings.
