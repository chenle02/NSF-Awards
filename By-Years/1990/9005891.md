Current research is being performed in the Optics and Material Science (OMS)
Lab at New Mexico State University in several areas of technical importance.
Among the several projects currently underway and being proposed for the future,
two specific areas are being currently emphasized. These areas are: a) optical
communications and b) optical methods in material evaluation. New and exciting
methods for communications, ultrastable solid state lasers and infrared imaging
are currently being explored for which the proposed optical systems can greatly
enhance the opportunities for success. A new ultra-high noise rejection high
efficiency quantum filter, which holds the record for the narrowest bandwidth
wide field-of-view operation, is under development in the OMS Lab. The device is
well suited to optical communication applications where a weak narrow-bandwidth
signals are buried in strong non-resonant noise. Pulsed optical systems of high
quality and the associated equipment will be put to good use in the further
development of the filter. Fast and accurate testing of materials and material
processing is also an area being studied in detail. The OMS Lab is studying new
techniques for the analysis of materials and the complex structures which embody
the materials. Infrared and laser optical systems will be used to study the
failure of airframe structures and highway bridges. Each of these areas are
critical to several industries in the U.S. Further development and transfer of
technology in these areas to industry will help to strengthen the industrial
base in the U.S.
