This project will fund the installation of 9 new magnetometers in the U.S. and
Mexico. Data from these new stations will be combined with data from the CANOPUS
magnetometers in Canada and the IGPP-LANL magnetometers in the U.S. to form a
mid-continent magnetometer chain of 22 magnetometers. The project will develop
the data analysis tools for using the magnetometer in a manner that is somewhat
analogous to seismology and is therefore being called "magnetoseismology."
Ultra-Low-Frequency waves detected by the magnetometers will be used to
determine the location of the plasmapause and to determine the plasma density
within the magnetosphere. Two methods of analysis will be investigated. The
first is an eigenmode analysis which determines the mass loading on a magnetic
field line be the eigenfrequency of the waves on the field line. The second
method will utilize the time of arrive of impulsive signals to determine the
density structure within the magnetosphere. The two techniques will provide an
inexpensive method of remote sensing of the plasma density of the magnetosphere.
The technique will be validated by using in situ measurements from a variety of
satellites. The project will provide data that can be used in space weather
nowcasting and forecasting. The project will include participation by high
school students and university undergraduates. The density data resulting from
the project will be an essential resource for two UCLA Ph.D students doing
related research.
