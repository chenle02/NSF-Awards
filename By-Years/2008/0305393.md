The Stabilized Explicit-Implicit Domain Decomposition (SEIDD) is
a&lt;br/&gt;class of globally non-iterative and non-overlapping Domain
Decomposition (DD) algorithms for solving parabolic equations on parallel
computers. &lt;br/&gt;These algorithms do not use large amounts of memory and
are inherently parallel, which makes them useful for large scale parallel
processing.&lt;br/&gt;The SEIDD approach aims to provide algorithmic solutions
that can better utilize parallel/distributed computing resources, thereby
improving the accessibility of high performance computing power for researchers
and educators from a broad range of science and engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;Through integration with education and curriculum
development, this research project promises to provide better education
opportunities in high performance computing for a wide range of students while
offering immediate training for computer science students in parallel algorithm
design and programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
