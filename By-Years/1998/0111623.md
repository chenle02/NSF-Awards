Summary: This proposal requests support for a workshop to outline a strategy and
protocol for constructing a community sediment model (CSM) that will incorporate
a series of modules that can be used to simulate evolution of landscapes and
sedimentary basins on a variety of timescales . Outcome of the workshop will be
a document that outlines a strategy and framework for developing and linking the
components of the CSM. &lt;br/&gt;
