Weld inspection procedures are of major importance in pipe line construction
where weld quality is essential to insure public safety and to eliminate
environmentally harmful leaks. Current practicve is to x- ray each weld, process
the film and assess the weld integrity. This process is slow and often delays
construction when inadequate welds are discovered long after the weld is
completed. Real time inspection of welds with x-rays is possible providing the
x-ray image is recorded electronically rather than photographically. The
electronically recorded image can be processed rapidly to ascertain weld quality
during the welding operation and data on weld integrity can be used to adjust
the welding process. This research program involves the initial design of a real
time weld inspection system. Specific tasks will include: determination of
radiographic performance requirements for pipelines, development of electronic
detection methods and system requirements, determination of heat shield methods
for the detector and system analysis to establish the time required for
inspection. Sigma Research is an R&D firm which has expertise in advanced NDE
methods. They are involved in developing piping inspection methods for other
sponsors which entail real time radiography systems. This research can draw on
results of previous developments. The principal investigator has ten years
experience in radiographic methods of NDE and is capable of successfully
completing the proposed program. An award is recommended.
