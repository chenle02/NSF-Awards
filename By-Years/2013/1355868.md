Researchers are further developing solutions for high throughput cloning of DNA
through synthetic biology. The project expands on data management, design
constraint specification, DNA assembly design, and experimental protocol
planning. These techniques each present algorithmic challenges as well as
empirical laboratory challenges. The replacement of many manual processes with
automated, high throughput techniques requires an interdisciplinary design team,
a highly coordinated computational/experimental effort, and a rapid design-
build-test cycle to validate the approach. This work may answer questions
related to the predictive engineering of compositional DNA designs with minimal
manual human intervention.

The results of this effort may impact the way that synthetic biology designs are
conceived, designed, and physically created. The team's techniques will
contribute to the rapid creation of new genetic material as well as broadly
applicable design strategies that can be made available to the entire biological
community. This work has the potential to seed an emerging bio-design automation
(BDA) effort that may touch many areas of molecular biology and engage a wide
variety of applications (energy, materials, drug discovery). Early work in BDA
may also create valuable DNA assembly and data exchange standards which will
help to unify the entire field.
