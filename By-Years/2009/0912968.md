This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to demonstrate
feasibility of a software tool employing advanced search algorithms applied to
antenna design and optimization. Current methods of designing and optimizing
antennas by hand are time and labor intensive, address limited complexity, and
require significant expertise. Genetic algorithm (GA) optimization has been
shown to find effective antenna design solutions that would not ordinarily be
found through engineering intuition. If the current effort is successful, the
core of a new software tool to demonstrate the feasibility of a highly-automated
design approach, where useful antennas can be generated without requiring
significant guidance: the user simply enters design requirements (e.g., RF
performance, dimensions, cost), and an automated optimization produces one or
more compliant designs will be demonstrated. This approach promises to improve
the performance and economics of future antenna applications for many industry
and government customers.
