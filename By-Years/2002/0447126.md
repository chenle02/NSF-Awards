0447126&lt;br/&gt;Gardner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provide support for
the acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) for
volcanologic and petrologic research on volatiles in magmatic and hydrothermal
ore systems requiring precision measurement of the abundance and speciation of
water and CO2 in minerals. The FTIR will complement existing microchemical
analysis equipment in the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of
Texas including a heating/freezing stage, electron microprobe, laser ablation
multicollector and single collector ICP-MS, and a computed x-ray tomography
facility. The FTIR will facilitate the acquisition of empirical data that will
aid in the development of improved models of the behavior and influence of
volatiles on magmatic, volcanic and ore forming processes. The FTIR will also
support undergraduate and graduate student training through the incorporation of
FTIR lab exercises in an Analytical Techniques course offered by the
department.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
