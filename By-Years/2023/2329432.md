This award supports the third South Central Topology Conference (SCTC) taking
place October 28-29, 2023, at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New
Mexico. The primary goal of this conference is to bring together researchers
including post-docs and graduate students in the field of topology from the
South Central region.

Modern topology is a highly active field of research with profound connections
to many other areas of mathematics. The conference will feature a wide range of
modern developments at the interphase of geometry and topology: dynamical
systems, hyperbolic geometry, knot Floer theory, contact geometry,
classification of vector bundles, unstable homotopy theory and equivariant
stable homotopy theory. The six plenary speakers will give one-hour colloquium-
style presentations. Additionally, there will be eight short talks given by
early career researchers. More information can be found on the conference web
page: https://www.hiroleetanaka.com/sctc/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
