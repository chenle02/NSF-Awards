The principal investigator will continue his work within the general area of
exchangeability. His general interest ranges over all aspects of the theory,
from the basic foundations and representation theorems, via specific properties
of exchangeable processes, to a variety of applications and extension to other
areas of probability theory. The present proposal is focused on some specific
problems involving multivariate representation theorems and their relation to
multiple stochastic integration, the notion of spreadability or subsequence
invariance, the representation of stable stochastic integrals and properties of
exchangeable interval partitions, their local time random measures and Palm
distributions.
