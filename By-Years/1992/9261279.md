Chronic needs for higher materials performance in present and future commercial
and military systems mandate improvements in materials properties. High melting
point, low density and high strength are among the material properties necessary
to achieve future system performance goals. Such requirements can no longer be
met using conventional metal alloys (including aluminum-based alloys which melt
at only 660 C). Magnesium-based intermetallics are among the best candidates to
fulfill the aforementioned requirements. Based on density, melting point (926
C), crystal structure (B2), and oxidation resistance considerations, an
intermetallic compound MgY has significant potential as a light- weight material
for 500 C - 550 C applications. The Phase I investigation concentrates on
establishing the room and high temperature mechanical properties of the
intermetallic MgY, improving the room temperature ductility, fracture toughness
and elevated temperature strength of the intermetallic. The Phase I
investigation should establish the potential of dispersion- strengthened MgY for
further development under a Phase II program. Unique plasma synthesis processing
will be utilized to produce these magnesium intermetallic alloys with specific
strengths higher than heretofore reported. High strength-to-weight ratio
magnesium intermetallic alloys have a high demand in aerospace and
transportation applications. Further, fiber-reinforced composites based on such
intermetallic matrices exhibit very high specific properties.
