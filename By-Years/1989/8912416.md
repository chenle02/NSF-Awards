This dissertation research project will allow an anthropology graduate student
to study the role of kinship and credit in two peasant villages in Korea.
Through a combination of survey and intensive interviews and participant
observation, the student will assess the role of kinship in helping wealthy
peasants accumulate capital, and the countervailing tendency for kinship
relations to drain capital from wealthy peasants towards their poorer relatives.
This research is important because peasant villages are the homes of a large
proportion of the world's population, and increased understanding of how peasant
farmers use credit in a society where practically everyone is related to
everyone else can help planners formulate policies that improve peasants'
economic situations.
