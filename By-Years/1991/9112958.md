Predominantly Black urban public schools have long been regarded as ghetto
wastelands, seriously remiss in their capability of providing more than minimal
education. This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant examines the effects
on Black student competitiveness in higher education and the labor market of
attendance at an historically Black public high school. A two-case comparative
study of an historically Black and an historically White public high school both
before and after desegregation will provide data to assess what factors aid and
what factors impede post-secondary achievement in these school settings. This
project will enhance our understanding of the factors contributing to long term
achievement in education and the labor force. This project also provides an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to lay the foundation for
more extensive research that will provide valuable information on the nature of
pre-college school environments.
