This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This award supports research to develop software
infrastructure required to efficiently solve the Einstein Equations of General
Relativity on the next generation of supercomputers. This capability will then
be exploited to evolve systems containing two black holes of unequal mass, an
important potential source of gravitational waves detectable by ground-based and
space-based detectors such as LIGO and LISA. Computer simulations of binary
black holes provide gravitational waveforms that can be used to search for
weaker signals than could be found without this information. The new
supercomputers achieve speed breakthroughs by increasing the number of cores per
CPU to tens or even hundreds. Computer codes designed for today's computers must
be redesigned to take maximum advantage of the new architechture. This project
is part of an ongoing effort at RIT to develop new, highly efficient, high-
accuracy numerical algorithms for General Relativity.
