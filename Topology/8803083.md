Aspects of the topology of algebraic varieties will be studied. Particular
emphasis will be on the development of new topological invariants or techniques
(e.g. intersection homology, motivic cohomology, and stratified Morse theory)
and on the study of particular varieties which are important in applications
(e.g., locally symmetric spaces and the variety of complete quadrics).
