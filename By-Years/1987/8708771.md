Progress in the development of software testing and debugging tools has lagged
behind advances in other software technologies, yet program testing and
debugging remain a bottleneck in the software production process, and they
continue to dominate the software production calendar and ledger. This research
is devoted to the study, design, and implementation of a new approach in
software testing and debugging. The principal objective is to develop a "non-
interference" software testing and debugging system to ensure minimum
intervention with the execution of the target system, at the same time,
providing the software practitioner with maximum control over program execution.
The non- interference testing system addresses the critical problem of specific
timing constraints in real-time systems which presents far more difficulties
than software testing on conventional computer applications. Although the
proposed system is oriented toward real-time system testing, it is potentially
applicable to a wide range of applications, especially for on-site support
testing of systems in operation mode. Justification and Recommendation This
research could lead to an improved understanding of the software testing
process. If successful it could be of real significance.
