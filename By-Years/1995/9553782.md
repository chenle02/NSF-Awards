Abstract: This project is a collaborative effort of the University of Alabama -
Birmingham (UAB), Auburn University (AU), the University of North Alabama (UNA),
and Miles College (MC). The project features intra-institutional collaboration
on courses: an innovative course developed and taught by a faculty member in
Materials Engineering and a faculty member in Education for preservice teachers
at UAB will be disseminated to other institutions. In addition, the project will
support the development of an analogous collaboration targetting General
Chemistry at UAB which involves faculty from Chemistry and Education. Inter-
institutional collaborations on teacher preparation programs will also be
supported and or developed. The first is a strengthening of an on-going
relationship between Miles College and UAB in which students can cross-register
for classes. The project will also develop two new collaborations which pair
Auburn University and Tuskegee Institute and UNA and Alabama A&amp;M.
