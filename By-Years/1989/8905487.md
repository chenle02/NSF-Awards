The establishment of a broad base of fundamental information on the
thermodynamics of polyolefin mixtures in the melt state will be accomplished by
a combination of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements of the
liquid mixtures and equation-of-state (EOS) measurements on the pure component
liquids. Model homopolymers and copolymers, synthesized by anionic
polymerization of dienes and subsequent hydrogenation, will be used in the
initial stages of the work. Labelled samples, needed for SANS, will be obtained
by using deuterium in place of the hydrogen. The highly uniform structure of
these model materials, and a judicious selection of copolymer pairings, should
provide single-phase liquid mixtures for samples in the polymeric size range and
a relatively clean analysis of the SANS data. The EOS measurements will permit
the use of liquid-state theory to interpret and generalize the results. The
influences of copolymer sequence distribution and co-mer size will be studied,
and bridging to commercial polyolefins will be started. Aside from supplying
thermodynamic data for an extremely important class of polymeric materials, the
proposed work will provide tests of current theories for polymer mixtures where
the local interactions are simple and the local structures are well defined. It
also provides the essential basis and appropriate model materials for studies on
the dynamics of phase separation, leading to the design of solid-state
morphologies in amorphous and semicrystalline polymer blends.
