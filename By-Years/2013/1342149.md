This project supports funding for students to participate in the International
Green Computing Conference (IGCC), to be held in Arlington, VA, in June 2013.
Green computing is a rapidly establishing interdisciplinary research area
spanning across the fields of computer science and engineering, electrical
engineering and other engineering disciplines. Green computing or sustainable
computing is the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently,
which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social
objectives. IGCC has established itself as the premier conference in this area.
The conference will enable researchers and students to the study and practice of
using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of
economic, ecological, and social objectives. This grant will provide travel
grants to 10 students who may otherwise not be able to attend IGCC and take
advantage of the available learning opportunities in the newly evolving research
area of green computing.
