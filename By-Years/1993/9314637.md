9314637 Hsu The Conference on Diffusion Theory and Analysis will take place at
Northwestern University from June 25 to June 30, 1994. The major activities
during the conference are 15 invited one-hour presentations and free discussion
sessions. The main purpose of this conference is to offer an opportunity for the
mathematicians working in diffusion theory and analysis and other related fields
to communicate and update their latest knowledge on the subject. Diffusion
theory as a part of probability theory studies collective behaviors of a special
class of random systems. These random systems are characterized by the
properties that they evolve continuously in time and possessing so-called Markov
property, which roughly means that the future of a system is independent of its
past history and is completely determined by its present state. The class of
random systems have been studies extensively both for its rich mathematical
structure and its practical applications in science and engineering. Our
conference emphasizes the mathematical aspect of diffusion theory, especially
its applications in analytical fields such as differential geometry and
differential equations. The speakers are carefully selected to reflect the
current state of the art of the field. They are active research mathematicians
whose lectures will no doubt both promote further research in the field and
serve current educational activities by attracting new graduate students into
our field.
