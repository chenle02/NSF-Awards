The principal investigator is developing an integrated framework for the
specification and analysis of real-time systems. Since the timing behavior of a
system critically depends on the availability of shared resources,the approach
unites the areas of process specification, concurrency theory and real-time
scheduling. The result is a layered framework called Communication Shared
Resources. At the top layer is the CSR Application Language, which describes the
functional and temporal requirements of a system. At the next layer is the CSR
Configuration Language, which maps process to resources, and specifies the
system's interconnection network. At the lowest level is the CCSR process
algebra, which embraces a resource-based view of concurrency,and is defined by a
prioritized operational semantics. The researcher is constructing an integrated
toolset based on this theory. A reachability analyzer checks for violations of
real- time constraints explicitly denoted within a finite-state applications. A
model-checker is used to verify real-time safety assertions that are not denoted
within an application. Finally, a simulator tests the system, using test suites
generated from the characteristics of the implementation environment.
