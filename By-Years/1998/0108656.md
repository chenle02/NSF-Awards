DEB-0108656&lt;br/&gt;Carey W. Krajewski&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collaborative
grant has been awarded to Dr. Peter Houde at New Mexico State University and Dr.
Carey Krajewski at Southern Illinois University to determine the genealogy of
one of the most diverse groups of birds known, the Order Gruiformes.
Genealogical relationships of families within the order will be assessed by
comparing DNA sequences of several genes. Past patterns of anatomical divergence
and geographic origins will be inferred from the pattern by which
characteristics of living species have changed genealogically. The ages of major
groups will be estimated from levels of difference between their DNA sequences.
Individual genes and anatomical characters can provide misleading information
about genealogy because of "convergence", so gruiform genealogy will be
reconstructed from a large body of independent data, all of which will be
evaluated for its consistency with the rest. Subsets of the data that are
inconsistent will be scrutinized for functional and developmental correlates.
This, in turn, will elucidate processes of convergence between lineages, both at
the level of genes and that of anatomy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gruiformes have
singular importance in understanding the timing and geography of bird origins in
general, because they are extremely diverse and geographically widespread. Many
families appear to be relics of the long bygone Age of Dinosaurs when the
continents were arranged quite differently than they are today. Gruiforms
present many examples of convergence, providing an unparalleled opportunity for
studying the processes that cause it. There is probably no other group of
vertebrate animals whose relationships are so poorly understood, yet for which
there is a comparable wealth of data on anatomical characteristics. There is
also preliminary evidence for convergence at the genetic level, a phenomenon
that has barely even been acknowledged in previous research. Thus, this group
presents a truly unique opportunity for understanding the correlation between
genetic and morphological change through time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
