Although most stomatal responses to environmental factors appear to be sensed
and transduced within the guard cells, circumstantial evidence suggests that
this is not the case for the stomatal response to humidity. This project
investigates the possibility that small changes in turgor pressure in the
mesophyll or epidermal cells initiates a cellular signaling pathway that
ultimately leads to changes in guard cell osmotic pressure associated with
stomatal responses to humidity. The influence of humidity changes on
intercellular concentrations of Ca2+ and components of phosphoinositide
signaling pathways will be assessed in both epidermal and mesophyll cells. HPLC
will be used to quantify components of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway,
and fluorescent probes will be used to quantify intercellular Ca2+
concentrations. For the latter experiments, a ratiometric fluorescent calcium
indicator protein (cameleon) has been expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. The
project will provide new insights into the mechanism for the stomatal response
to humidity. This response has a major effect on the overall water use
efficiency of plants in both natural and agricultural settings.
