9402229 Spong In this research project, fundamental issues related to the
design, analysis, and real-time implementation of robust and adaptive control
laws for underactuated mechanical systems are investigated. The class of systems
is quite broad and encompasses balancing and walking robots, a variety of
flexible structures including flexible link and flexible joint robots, as well
as robot models that include actuator dynamics, and many of the classical
control problems such as ball and beam, and cart-pole systems. The integrating
theme of the research effort is the utilization of the integrator backstepping
method for the design of underactuated systems. Currently, powerful design
techniques, such as feedback linearization, singular perturbations, and
passivity based methods, are available for fully actuated systems. These
techniques are extended for their applicability to underactuated systems. ***
