The PI proposes a thorough, five-part investigation of solar wind periodic
structures. He plans to (1) determine the occurrence frequency of the periodic
structures, and determine where in the overall heliospheric structure they are
observed; (2) explore the possibility that the structures occur preferentially
at certain scale-sizes, as opposed to discrete frequencies, and analyze the
spatial structure of these convected structures relative to current sheets,
shocks, stream interfaces, etc.; (3) study the magnetospheric response to
external, periodic forcing using a combination of event studies and MHD
simulations, with a primary goal the determination of the dayside magnetopause Q
value; (4) examine the pressure balance of the periodic density structures to
determine over which timescales they are stable, and use multi-point
measurements from L1 and just upstream of the Earth to explore the evolution of
such structures; and (5) explore the structure and evolution of periodic density
structures that are observed in the downstream regions of shocks and
discontinuities.
