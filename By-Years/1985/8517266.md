One of the innovations governments might use to improve the effectiveness of
hazard mitigation and management is actuarial funding. This involves the regular
payment of estimated average annual hazard-induced infrastructure losses into a
fund earmarked for use in hazard mitigation and recovery. Actuarial funding may
contribute to more efficient land use patterns and the construction of
infrastructure that is less susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other
natural hazards. This project will systematically evaluate the potential use of
actuarial funding as a means of coping with infrastructure losses from
earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Data will be collected from a cross-section
of local and state governments and several disaster-struck communities.
