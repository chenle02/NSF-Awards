The two investigators will continue their studies in aspects of Brownian
motion. Topics will include Brownian motion and the boundary behavior of
harmonic functions, reflecting Brownian motion with variable angle of
reflections, the Brownian convex hull, behavior of Brownian paths on the
boundary of a domain, the non-Markovian side of Brownian motions, and Brownian
motion on fractals. An additional topic of self-avoiding random walk will be
studied. The two investigators will continue their studies in aspects of
Brownian motion. Brownian motion is a specific stochastic process which is
studied in probability theory. This study will impact areas of mathematics
outside probability, namely potential theory and mathematical physics.
