9353833 Chang The Materials World Modules are a series of materials science and
technology kits designed to supplement existing mathematics and science
curricula in high schools. The modules close the gap between frontiers of
research and science in classrooms, providing open-ended experiences for both
students and teachers. Nine modules cover basic materials systems, materials and
society, and materials conservation and the environment. The modules provide
students with hands-on experiences in design, synthesis, and evaluation of
materials. The concepts of mathematics and science are reinforced in the
application of materials science and technology to product development and
manufacturing. Each modules includes a self-contained experimental kit, teacher
and student manuals, a video tape showing how experiments are conducted -
including safety instructions - and a software package for data analysis and
further modeling of the experiment. The products are developed by professors in
the Materials Research Center at Northwestern working with educators and high
school science, mathematics and technology teachers. A central electronic
databank on materials will be maintained at the Materials Research Center. ***
