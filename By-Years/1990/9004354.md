There are two competing models for the mesozoic tectonic history of southern
California - closure of a marginal basin between North America and an outboard
continental fragment and normal oceanic subduction under North America. The
Pelona- Orocopia-Rand-Portal Ridge schists and the Vincent-Chocolate Mountains-
Orocopia- Rand thrust faults are products of this tectonic episode. This study
will attempt to resolve this issue by close examination of the thrust fault in
the Gavilan Hills where the clear-cut northeast vergence forms the main argument
for the marginal basin model. The work will test the possibility that the
northeast motion is due to a younger normal fault which re-activated the
original thrust. Results are applicable to the resolution of Mesozoic tectonics
in the southwestern United States.
