9452487 Coulson The equipment described in this proposal will be used in lab
work for both engineering physics and principles of engineering technology
classes. Its purpose is to increase student involvement in the learning process
and to build student excitement through a multi-dimensional learning lab. It
will provide students with multiple methods of investigation on topics and
concepts covered in class lectures that could not previously be experimented
with in a conventional lab. This will not only improve student understanding,
but will enhance their problem solving skills and promote proper methods of
scientific investigation. The equipment requested includes six complete 486DX
computer systems, each with a lab interface, physics simulation software and
assorted probes; two printers; and two interactive videodisc systems. This
equipment will bring the latest technology into our labs, giving students the
ability to make investigations and acquire data through both traditional and
innovative techniques. ***
