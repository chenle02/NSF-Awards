The goal of this project is to involve the students in an investigation of a
significant geological region designed in the manner of an actual geological
investigation, including field work, sample preparation, laboratory
investigation, interpretation, and oral and written communication of research
results. The southern Lake Superior region provides a focus for the project
because it is diverse and provides a reasonable structural and tectonic
framework in which the students can place their individual work. The project
requires a polarizing microscope with transmitted and reflected light systems
and universal stage, video camera and monitor for class demonstration purposes,
and student petrographic microscopes. The equipment will be used in techniques
of petrographic analysis of the major rock types and analysis of deformed rocks
and minerals, and the undertaking of student research projects. The university
will provide 50% matching funds.
