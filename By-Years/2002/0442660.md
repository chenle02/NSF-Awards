Economics (82) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economics is a critical component of the
undergraduate curriculum, and the integration of experiments into economics
courses has proven beneficial in helping students to learn microeconomics
principles. Such experiments enable undergraduates to reflect on their responses
to economic incentives and on the role of institutional arrangements, thus
gaining a deeper understanding of economic models than they have acquired using
less-interactive learning environments. However, many institutions lack the
resources to develop their own dedicated experimental economics facilities.
Building on work to develop EconPort, an economics digital library, this project
is undertaking a national effort to disseminate experiments to hundreds of
instructors from a diverse set of two- and four-year colleges around the
country. Instructors learn about the experiments, and how to integrate them into
their courses, at workshops that are held primarily in conjunction with
economics conferences around the country. Formative project evaluation is
informing the development and presentation of the workshop materials; summative
evaluation addresses the efficacy of the workshops and how the use of economics
experiments shapes successful teaching strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
