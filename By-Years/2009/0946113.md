This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will extend an
existing manual patent editing system--adding automatic patent annotation
components. The components will include a page segmentation/recognition system
adapted to patent figures and an annotation system that links recognized text in
the image to corresponding terms in a text document. The immediate technical
challenge is providing a high-confidence recognition system despite the sparse
nature of the callouts, scan noise, and background line art distractions. This
research proposes using the patent specification text to guide the recognition,
suggesting what callouts are expected in each figure. The longer-term technical
challenge is providing this processor-intensive feature in a way that preserves
the responsiveness and extensibility of the browser-based collaborative editor
on which it's based. This research proposes to implement the recognition and
annotation process as a set of server-side automated participants' which act as
remote co-collaborators.

The U.S. economy relies heavily and increasingly upon intellectual property. As
patents become more significant in the operations and outcome of U.S.
businesses, it becomes increasingly important to assure that the system produces
quality patents cost-effectively and expeditiously. The proposed research allows
preparers to more easily prepare applications. Patent examiners could use it to
automatically detect errors and omissions in applications, improving quality and
reducing pendency. Patent researchers could use it to more incisively
comprehend, value, and dispute patent prior art. The prototype will,
respectively, be evaluated by several attorneys through an application drafting
cycle, USPTO examiners via a stand-alone installation, and researchers at a
popular search site.
