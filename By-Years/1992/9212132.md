This award, of $390,000, is for research and curriculum development for power
plant intelligent distributed control. Many new specialized skills in applying
simulation, computer networking, and microprocessor-based controller programming
have been acquired by the faculty and graduate students that have been choosing
this research. In order to accelerate the achievement of the goal of improving
power generation reliability, economy, and safety through the implementation of
modern control technologies, an efficient mechanism is needed for teaching new
graduate students and industry specialists the required skills for conducting
applied research in this area. For this purpose, current research will be
expanded to plant-wide system implementation and an introductory graduate level
course will be developed over a three year period. The course will later be
suitable for advanced undergraduates that are going to graduate school or will
be employed in the power industry.
