This award is to the University of New Mexico to support the activity described
below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships
for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the
University of New Mexico (Lead Institution), Sandia National Laboratory, City of
Albuquerque, Connect New Mexico, National Hispanic Culture Center, New Mexico
Trains, Aquila Group, Bandelier EFX, Big Byte, ContiFilms, Drumfire, IBM, Intel,
National Indian Telecommunications Institute, Pixar, Poeh Center, Pueblo of
Zuni, Vizeon, and The Studio. The proposed goal is to create a Digital Arts and
Technology Pueblo that will create an infrastructure in New Mexico for economic
development and innovation in the digital arts and science industry. Three
state-of-the-art centers with equipment and facilities for digital arts, which
are similar to incubators to create and nurture innovations in the digital arts
are being developed. Curricula in digital arts for training and education are
being developed and implemented. Infrastructure to enable the innovation,
technology commercialization and entrepreneural process is being established.

New Mexico is rich in culture and art as well as science and technology. Much of
the well-trained talent has been forced to leave the state owing to lack of job
opportunities. The state's isolation is an obstacle to entrance into the
information technology sector. This partnership establishes the infrastructure
for innovation leading to economic well being in the digital arts and sciences
industry. The effort brings expertise in digital science and technology with the
expertise in graphic arts to create an infrastructure for digital graphics
industry in New Mexico. The new companies and new jobs will bring economic well
being to the region. A strong emphasis is placed on recruitment and involvement
of Native Americans and Hispanics in the new industry in New Mexico.
