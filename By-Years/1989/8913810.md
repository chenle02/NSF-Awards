This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear Physics, held at
the Tilton School, Tilton, NH, July 17-21, 1989. This conference is the
continuation of the series of Gordon Research Conferences on Nuclear Physics.
The unique character of this conference is widely recognized both in the United
States and abroad. It has been organized to cover a number of the important
subfields in nuclear physics and makes possible for spirited discussion and
communications among scientists in these areas. The program this year selected
some of the most interesting developments, both theoretical and experimental, in
nuclear structure, electromagnetic interactions, heavy-ion collisions,
subnuclear effects and hadron structure and symmetries in nuclei. There were
also talks on new detector initiatives for nuclear physics and the NSAC Long
Range Plan for Nuclear Physics. Invited speakers, session chairmen and attendees
have been selected to ensure a mix of senior researchers, post-docs and advanced
graduate students among the participants. A major part of the funds will be used
to provide support for young scientists attending the conference.
