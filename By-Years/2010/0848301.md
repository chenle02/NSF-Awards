Many biologically active compounds are chiral, and more than 50% of today's top-
selling drugs are marketed as single enantiomers. The high and ever-increasing
demand for enantiopure compounds requires constant progress in asymmetric
synthesis. In particular, the development of new catalysts continues to be
crucial. Chiral bisoxazolidines with a rigid C2-symmetric scaffold have very
promising applications in asymmetric catalysis. This new class of N,O-donor
ligands will be applied in challenging enantioselective carbon-carbon bond
formation reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
Synthesis: Methodology and Organometallic Program is supporting the research of
Professor Christian Wolf of the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown
University. Professor Wolf's research is aimed at the development of new chiral
bisoxazolidine ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Studies to elucidate the
mechanism of bisoxazolidine-catalyzed reactions and efforts to fine-tune the
catalytic efficiency and asymmetric induction of this class of ligands will be
undertaken. The successful development of new asymmetric catalysts is expected
to provide new tools for the synthesis of complex chiral target molecules. This
will have an impact on the pharmaceutical, food, and agricultural industries.
