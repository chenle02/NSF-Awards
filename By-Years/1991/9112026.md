Foreign competition is having a considerable impact on the competitiveness of
salmonid pen.culture ventures in the US. One means to increase the economic
viability of US ventures is to rear additional species with clear.cut commercial
potential. Lumpfish are a possible candidate for net.pen culture for their roe
(caviar) and flesh. Lumpfish were grown in net.pens, spawned and initial
attempts at larval rearing begun with a Phase I SBIR. Further research on the
suitability of lumpfish for net.pen culture will be determined during the Phase
II SBIR by seeking answers to the following questions: 1) Can larval lumpfish be
reared with satisfactory growth and survival on artificial diets? 2) Can adults
survive, grow and produce normal eggs when held in net.pens at salmon densities?
3) Are non.spawning lumpfish held year.round in net.pens, a quality foodfish?
