Efficient Multilevel Methods for Electromagnetic Finite Element Analysis Finite
Element (FE) analysis is very widely used for computer simulation of
electromagnetic fields in various electric machines and devices. Although
significant progress has been achieved over the last two decades, considerable
computational difficulties remain. For complex engineering electromagnetic
problems, three dimensional FE meshes often have hundreds of thousands of
elements or more and the computational time may be prohibitively high. As a
result of the proposed project, the speed of electromagnetic FE analysis will be
increased substantially. This will be achieved by implementing and employing
Multilvel Preconditioners. The computational accuracy will be significantly
improved by using the Fully Adaptive Multigrid algorithm. Applications of the
proposed methodology to magnetic recording problems will be explored. In
particular, efficient FE simulation of multiparticle systems typical for
magnetic tapes should become possible. The ultimate goal is to make FE modeling
considerably more accurate, fast and practical for engineering electromagnetic
problems. This will facilitate analysis of electric machines, magnetic tapes and
recording heads, and will have important implications for nondestructive
testing, optimization, computer aided design, rapid prototyping, and in other
areas.
