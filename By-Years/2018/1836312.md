This grant, under the direction of Professor Jaroslav Trnka of the University of
California at Davis, supports the attendance of junior participants at the 2018
Amplitudes Summer School. This event will be held June 11-15, 2018 at the Center
for Quantum Mathematics and Physics (QMAP) on the campus of the University of
California, Davis.

This event focuses on research associated with the modern amplitudes program.
This program focuses on the development of a new set of techniques for
calculating the scattering of elementary particles against each other, as occurs
in particle colliders. Such new calculational techniques might even trigger a
deeper, transformative understanding of quantum field theory itself --- the
theory that combines quantum mechanics with special relativity. Progress in this
field has been accelerating over the past few years, and this event will provide
a comprehensive introduction to some of the most exciting discoveries in this
field. Participants at this week-long event will consist primarily of graduate
students and postdocs who will gain cutting-edge exposure to the research
associated with this research program from scientists who made some of the most
important discoveries in this field. The participants will also have the chance
to present the results of their own research to their peers. Thus the
participants will not only receive training in one of the cutting-edge topics in
theoretical high-energy physics, but also gain valuable talk-giving experience
to help them sharpen their presentation skills. This event thus serves the
national interest not only by advancing fundamental science in the United States
but also by simultaneously training the next generation of physicists to engage
meaningfully in its development.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
