Engineering (59) The Hispanic Engineering Scholarship Program promotes
increasing the level of student majors and level of retention and matriculation
of Hispanic students in several CSEMS related disciplines. These disciplines
include 120 Hispanic engineering students in undergraduate engineering areas:
Electrical,&lt;br/&gt;Industrial, Civil, Chemical, Mechanical, Environmental,
and Land Surveying, and graduate&lt;br/&gt;areas: Civil Engineering,
Manufacturing Engineering, Manufacturing Competitiveness, and Electrical
Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CSEMS goals directly correlate to the
scholarship program at PUPR. These include: i) improved educational
opportunities for students in the engineering disciplines, ii) increased
retention of students to degree achievement and iii) improved support programs.
Students are selected from a set of four categories: (1) Newly Admitted
Students; (2) Currently Enrolled Students; (3) Transfer Students, and (4)
Graduate Students. Program management staff conduct a series of yearly
activities for the cohort group that include: i) faculty mentoring offered by
the Retention Office, ii) employment interview skills offered by the COOP
Education Office, iii) admissions into Graduate Programs sponsored by the Office
of the Dean of Graduate Program, iv) tutoring experiences at the Center for
University Progress and, v) internship and research opportunities through the
COOP Education Office.&lt;br/&gt;
