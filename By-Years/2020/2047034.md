Computing systems that engage people physically with high degrees of autonomy
need to provide rigorous guarantees of safety. Formal methods can been used on
such systems to provide mathematical proofs to ensure correct behavior. However,
machine learning and data-driven approaches are now an indispensable part of
autonomous-systems design, and their reliance on highly nonlinear continuous
functions and probabilistic reasoning has largely been at odds with the logical
and symbolic-analysis frameworks in formal methods. As a result, the lack of
formal assurance has become the key bottleneck that impedes the wider deployment
and adoption of autonomous systems. This project targets this open challenge by
developing formal synthesis and verification techniques for learning-based and
data-driven control and planning methods for autonomous systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops the theoretical foundations as well
as practical techniques and tools for improving the fundamental reliability of
realistic autonomous systems such as autonomous cars and unmanned aerial
vehicles. The work builds on the investigator's prior work on formal methods
over continuous and hybrid domains towards the unification of symbolic and
numerical methods in practical engineering. The correct-by-learning methods can
ensure formal properties of general learning-based decision-making algorithms
towards safety and trustworthiness in all areas of AI applications. The
education and outreach activities are a crucial part of the project, as the
methods developed are only useful if they are adopted by the new generations of
developers of autonomous systems in a broad range of engineering domains. The
education efforts contribute directly to improving automation and usability of
formal methods in practical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
