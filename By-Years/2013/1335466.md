Irregular applications are increasing in importance to the computing industry.
For a long time they have underpinned computations of interest to the national
security arm of the federal government. But now, they underpin such questions as
ad placement in social networks, and analysis of complex data-sets in medicine
and science. For example, developing custom drug therapies involves analysis of
how cellular pathways, known drug/patient outcomes, and a particular patient's
DNA interact. These complex big-data problems require new computational models
in order to execute effectively on commodity hardware. The defining
characteristic of these applications is poor locality and massive available
parallelism. The key idea is use the available concurrency to tolerate memory
latency, instead of relying on locality. Using a highly optimized runtime
system, tuned for use on commodity processors and networking hardware it has
been shown that scalable performance on these applications can exceed custom
supercomputer-class hardware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research currently being
undertaken is to continue exploring and developing this latency tolerant scale-
out runtime system. The proposed research directions include exploring ways to
mitigate latency for disk (SSD) access, in order to tackle petabyte-scale
problems on small clusters of commodity hardware. In addition the research will
examine programmable router hardware in order to scale network aggregation into
the thousand-node-plus cluster range. Finally the research effort will focus on
enhanced language semantics and compiler techniques that make it easier to
implement the types of analyses and graph algorithms of interest to the
scientific, business, medical, and government communities.
