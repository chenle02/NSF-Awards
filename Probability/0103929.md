Essential properties of multidimensional probability distributions often
include geometric and analytic characteristics related to global behavior of
smooth functionals in a growing number of variables. This research focuses on
various concentration phenomena for different classes of probability measures in
spaces of high dimension. The classes of product measures, uniform distributions
over convex bodies, or logarithmically concave measures are good examples with a
number of challenging problems. The study of the role of the dimension as the
main parameter of a distribution is placed in the center of the research. Many
important properties of stochastic processes postulate possible behavior of
sample trajectories and often refer to distributions of various functionals.
Obtaining essential information on the process requires the study of
multidimensional distributions and leads to deep mathematical problems which are
also interesting in themselves from the point view of the natural development of
mathematical sciences. This research focuses on the study of global properties
of stochastic processes and on how they relate to different objects from
analysis, geometry and statistics.
