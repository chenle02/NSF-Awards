Statistical research on problems in semiparametric inference will be conducted
with most relating to survival analysis and several with a sequential nature.
Sequential tests will be constructed for the relative-scale parameter based on
survival analysis data with censoring in a two-sample accelerated-life model.
The model is semiparametric in that the relative scale parameter is a parametric
component while the baseline distribution is a nonparametric component.
Sequential effective score tests will be developed for this problem as an
alternative to sequential logrank tests. More general versions of this will also
be analyzed. Estimation will also be studied in accelerated- life models with
censored data. The settings will include the study of elapsed time in sequential
clinical trials on survival data, inference for bivariate models induced by
frailties, inference for proportional-mean-residual-life models, weighted U-
statistics in semiparametric models, large-sample "completeness", and sequential
stopping rules for Monte Carlo tests.
