This award supports planning for the Sanford Center for Science Education (SCSE)
which will be the exhibition and education component of the Deep Underground
Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) at the former Homestake Gold Mine in
Lead, South Dakota. In particular, the award supports the design of what will go
into the SCSE -- key program components and a preliminary design of its exhibit
space. This request will also support the development of the SCSE's
organizational structure and a transition plan for getting from preconstruction
through Opening Day. This science education center is planned to provide
exceptionally innovative and cutting-edge exhibit experiences, expand
educational opportunities for a wide array of students and teachers, and
generally enhance the efforts of Homestake-DUSEL.
