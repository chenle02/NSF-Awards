The project is to develop a course, textbook, solution manual, and videotapes to
teach potential engineering professors the craft of teaching. The course covers
the entire range of pedagogical material from learning theories to teaching
methods to ethics to the details of grading. The course is for PhD candidates
who plan a faculty career. Also, technological methods of delivery such as
computers and interactive videodiscs will be presented. In addition to the
availability of the book, solution manual and videotapes, a workshop for faculty
from other institutions who may wish to offer the course will be held to
encourage others to consider this approach to improving the quality of
undergraduate engineering education. The grantee provides funds for this project
that are a match for a fraction of the NSF award.
