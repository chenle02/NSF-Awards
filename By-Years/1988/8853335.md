The project is providing instruments and microcomputers to support a senior-
level Honors Chemistry course, Instrumental Methods and Data Analysis. The
course is placing heavy emphasis on data acquisition and handling using
computer-interfaced instruments and selected software packages on
microcomputers. Students are then able to evaluate the reliability of collected
data and subsequent calculations from their experimental results on several
classical instrumentation projects. Undergraduate research efforts are also
being enhanced by this project. The grantee is matching the award from non-
Federal sources.
