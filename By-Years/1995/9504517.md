9504517 Stevenson Title: Experimental Constraints on Melt Migration Models. The
porosity of the Earth's Mantle in the region under mid-ocean ridges is unknown,
but the knowing the porosity will lead to a much better understanding of how
liquids produced by melting of the mantle are transported to the ocean floor as
eruptions of magma. This project plans to measure the porosity of mantle
materials that are heated and pressurized to simulate conditions in the Earth.
The porosity that they intend to measure will be important for understanding
result of the major ocean ridge experiment called MELT which will be conducted
in the next year. They have demonstrated that they can make the appropriate
measurements on compacted salt and water, and plan to extend their work to
molten basalt in mantle minerals.
