This Presidential Young Investigator Award is to study the mechanics of waterjet
cutting. The fracture process due to abrasion during the cutting of
polycarbonate specimens will be recorded on a ultra high speed framing camera.
Detailed fracture mechanics analysis applied to abrasive water jet cutting will
reveal information on the jet penetration process and material behavior.
