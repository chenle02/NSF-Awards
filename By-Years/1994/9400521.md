9400521 Reinhold The American Society of Civil Engineers Conference on
Hurricanes of 1992 will convene on December 1 3, 1993, in Miami, Florida. The
purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers, practicing
engineers and representatives of the private sector and government institutions,
to discuss and determine the conditions of the buildings, structures and
facilities before and after Hurricane Andrew; their performance under extreme
load conditions; and the future research and other actions needed to lessen the
magnitude of life and economic losses in future storms and hurricanes. Results
from this conference will improve the capabilities and knowledge base necessary
to mitigate the damage resulting from disasters of this kind.
