Professor Christodoulou will study the global dynamics of a new model of
gravitational collapse in order to model the hydrodynamics of supernovae. He
will also study the global stability of rotating black holes to nonlinear
gravitational perturbations. This will help to understand the final stages of
coalescence of a black hole binary. Professor Christodoulou's efforts are
unusual, and highly valued and important. They provide rigorous mathematical
analysis to model problems which represent important aspects of gravitational
theory.
