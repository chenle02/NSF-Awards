9613958 Goodman-Strauss The 21st conference of the University of Arkansas Annual
Lecture Series in the Mathematical Sciences will bring together experts in the
field of Dehn Surgery in Three-Manifolds, which is one of the most vital and
active areas of topology at the present time. This meeting will provide a forum
for an exchange of ideas as well as an opportunity for young researchers and
graduate students to interact with prominent researchers in their area. Cameron
M. Gordon of the University of Texas at Austin will be the principal speaker and
will deliver a series of five fifty-minute lectures entitled Dehn Surgery. At
least a dozen forty-minute talks on related matters will be given by others, and
a large number of shorter contributed papers will round out the program. ***
