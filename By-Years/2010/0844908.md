"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The objective of
this research is to experimentally understand the requirements for manipulating
light in waveguides using electron spin polarization in order to develop
integrated optoelectronic devices to be used for optical communication. The
objective of the educational component of this proposal is to convey the
excitement of semiconductor physics and nanotechnology to students and the
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Recent
measurements of electron spin polarization that is generated and manipulated at
picosecond timescales using electric fields combined with recent advances in
integrated photonics technology offer a pathway for demonstrating electrically-
controlled integrated optical isolators, gigahertz electro-optic modulators and
low-loss waveguide switches in conventional semiconductors. With the educational
component of this proposal, it will promote greater understanding of
nanotechnology through demonstrations for introductory physics classes, public
lectures and open discussions with the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This research aims to demonstrate a new
class of integrated optoelectronic devices for optical communications, based
upon control of electron spin polarization. These devices do not require applied
magnetic fields and are compatible with the materials currently used for
electronics. The proposed educational activities will disseminate current
developments in nanotechnology to the public through the Physics Demonstration
Lab, the Saturday Morning Physics program and Science Cafes at the University of
Michigan. The "Science for Tomorrow" Career Program will reach students in
grades 6-9 and their families and inform, motivate and prepare them for careers
in science.
