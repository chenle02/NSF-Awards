This award supports cooperative research in neuroendocrinology between Dr.
Bruce McEwen of the Rockefeller University and Dr. Alexandro De Nicola at the
Institute of Biology and Experimental Medicine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This
work will identify the characteristics of and the degree of overlap between two
receptor systems for steroid hormones in the brain. Understanding the
communication between steroidal receptors is important to interpreting
interactions between other neurotransmitters and receptors. The use of new
molecular biological methodology will lead to new advances in brain
neuroscience. The principal investigators have a history of previous successful
collaboration and a former student of Dr. De Nicola, Dr. Coirini, is now a post-
doc in Dr. McEwen's laboratory. Both laboratories are well equipped for their
part of the research and therefore significant contributions can be made by both
sides in investigating the regulation of mineralocorticoid receptors by
glucocorticoids and the regulation of glucocorticoid receptors by
mineralocorticoids. Also, the levels of these hormones and how the binding
activity is affected by the regulation will be determined. This work will
continue a productive four-year collaboration.
