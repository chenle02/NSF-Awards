Students at Pitzer, a liberal arts college, are studying mathematics presented
in a manner that relates to real-world situations that interest them. Three non-
traditional mathematics courses are being designed to be attractive to students
who may have limited previous exposure to college- level mathematics. Major
portions of these courses involve students interacting with computer
workstations which are allowing them to directly control the elements of
mathematical phenomena and immediately visualize the result. Through these
interactions, students are gaining an understanding of mathematics and how it
relates to the world around them. The computer hardware and software are
providing a learning laboratory at a college where mathematical studies are
often something many students have learned to avoid and where computers are
frequently only associated with word processing. The immediate goal is to
revitalize the relationship students feel with mathematical studies. The
ultimate goal is to alter some of the misconceptions that may exist about what
is an appropriate mathematical education for liberal arts college students.
