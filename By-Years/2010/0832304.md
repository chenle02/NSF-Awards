Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for THz Application &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0832302
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Xi-Cheng Zhang &lt;br/&gt;0832304 Oklahoma
State University; Weili Zhang &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute (RPI) and Oklahoma State University propose a planning grant for a
collaborative center to investigate applications of Terahertz radiation. The
proposed center "Terahertz Technology and Applications Center" (THz-TAC) will
focus on developing new knowledge, tools, hardware, and personnel required for
THz wave non-destructive testing and stand-off sensing for industrial and
security applications. The center will leverage industry support and enhance the
impact of the fundamental research at academic campuses to the application-
driven tasks promoted by the industry members. The research to be pursued at the
proposed center will address frontier areas of the electromagnetic spectrum from
0.3 to 10 THz in a number of challenging topics. The investigator experience and
facilities appear to be well aligned with this project.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THz-TAC will present an excellent platform for
interdisciplinary research with broad applicability. There should be significant
benefits through academic program development and technology transfer is highly
likely, leading to more rapid utilization of terahertz technologies in industry
and improved industrial competitiveness. THz-TAC will have an immediate impact
on non-destructive analysis, a short term application (3 to 5 years) for
homeland security and a longer term interest (5 to 10 years) in biomedicine. The
THz-TAC's performance plan clearly addresses the interaction with
underrepresented students. RPI has excellent track records on the enrollment of
female and minority students. Diversity is well addressed in this planning grant
proposal. The non-invasive nature of the technology holds potential for many
areas of application in numerous fields.
