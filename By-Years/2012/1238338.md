The proposed planning activity seeks to undertake planning of the establishment
of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) site at Texas
Tech University of the existing Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing. The
center currently involves Arizona, Florida, Mississippi State and Rutgers, and
industry and government partners in the field. The Texas Tech site intends to
provide a practical work arena for development and coordination of standards,
standards-based software and reference implementations applicable to cloud and
other forms of advanced distributed computing. The site will fill a need to
organize, classify, develop reference implementations for and otherwise
contribute to standards-based software in advanced distributed
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned site, in combination with the
existing center plans to help build innovation capacity in cloud computing. The
outcomes from the Texas Tech site has the potential to support effective, broad-
based standards development for this emerging field. The site plans to have a
significant impact on students via mechanisms including the TTU STEM Education
and Outreach Project and the SURAgrid regional grid and cloud computing
educational dissemination project.
