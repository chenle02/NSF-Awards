This NUE award from the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry in the Directorate
for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Geosciences
enables Kenyon College to introduce nanoscience concepts to both science and
nonscience majors within the context of a liberal arts college. We will develop
instructional modules for introductory physics and chemistry lectures and
laboratories so that all students of these classes will receive training in
nanoscience concepts. In addition, modules will be developed for more advanced
physics and chemistry classes and seminar courses pertaining to nanoscience and
nanotechnology so that nanoscience concepts will be integrated into courses from
the first year through participation by students in research. Modules will also
address non-science-majors classes. The modules will primarily make use of an
atomic force microscope (AFM) and the development of a source of entangled
photons. While the AFM will provide our students the opportunity for "hands-on"
imaging and manipulation of matter at the nanoscale, the source of entangled
photons will illustrate the principles of the next generation of information
technology (i.e., quantum computation). By introducing these two key ideas in
nanoscience and nanotechnology, we hope to encourage our undergraduate students
to pursue careers in the revolutionary field of nanotechnology in the
future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal for this award was received in
response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF
03-044, category NUE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
