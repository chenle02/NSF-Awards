This proposal describes a workshop intended to enhance the knowledge of
undergraduate faculty, in the area of computer software testing, with an
emphasis on object-oriented software. The two-week program will be split across
two summers with the first session held at Clemson University during the summer
of 1998 and the second session to be held on the University of Alabama campus
during the summer of 1999. This workshop will bring together 25 faculty members
from across the United States who are interested in expanding the role of
software testing in the undergraduate computer science courses. This workshop
will provide an opportunity for the workshop participants to examine this issue
in detail, working in cooperation with the workshop staff. Specifically, we will
focus on: 1. A brief review of the fundamental concepts associated with object-
oriented development, 2. an in-depth examination of the current "state of the
art" with respect to testing software, including those aspects of object-
oriented systems that require special attention, and 3. an examination of how
this material can be integrated into the curriculum at each participant's own
institution. The workshop staff includes two faculty members from the University
of Alabama and one from Clemson University selected for two reasons. First, all
three are active in the area of testing object-oriented software. Second, this
group brings a variety of perspectives to the workshop. Unlike workshops where
one individual presents his/her viewpoint on a topic, this collaborative
approach will ensure that a wide range of thoughts and opinions regarding
testing are presented.
