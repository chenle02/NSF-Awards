Fish gene mapping studies have yielded the unexpected result that some
chromosomal associations of enzyme genes have been conserved through more than
400 million years of vertebrate evolutionary divergence. Linkage relationships
of duplicate enzyme genes in fishes further suggest that the vertebrate genome
evolved through three tetraploidization (duplication of the entire chromosome
set) events. Mapping of additional genes in fishes, as proposed in the current
research project, should establish the validity of the chromosome duplication
hypothesis and will allow predictions of the modes and rates of chromosome
evolution in vertebrates. The identification of highly conserved chromosome
regions may allow prediction of the chromosomal location of genes as yet
unmapped in man and may identify groups of genes under stringent coordinate
regulation. In this research a variety of genes will be mapped using both enzyme
electrophoresis and histochemical staining and DNA restriction fragment length
polymorphism linkage analyses.
