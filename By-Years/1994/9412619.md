941261 Turner This project enables the principal investigator to serve a period
of internship with a CAD vendor as a software engineer. The internship period
will be the starting point for new efforts by the Principal Investigator in
researching and proposing appropriate software paradigms and conceptual
abstractions that will lead to more productive software development efforts in
the manufacturing sector and in the CAD vendor community. The long-term
objective of the research is to develop new softwear paradigms for computer
aided design (CAD) by building a sound base of software engineering technology
that embraces the new user-oriented approach to applications development, and
frees the programmer from much of the current procedural detail which he or she
must master.
