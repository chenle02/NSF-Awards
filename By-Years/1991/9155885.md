The purpose of this biology education project is to promote: 1)the development
of curricular materials that facilitate learning via a modern biological
research approach, 2) dissemination of these and previous NSF-supported
curricular materials, and 3) the establishment and maintenance of a viable
communication network among biologists, science educators, software developers
and other individuals who share this approach. Faculty will come together at a
summer workshop to promote the development of the BioQUEST's open-ended problem-
solving, long-term research approach to the teaching and learning of biology(the
"3P's" approach: problem-posing, probelm-solving, and peer persuasion). Two-
thirds of the invited participants will develop materials with a view toward
addressing implementation of the BioQUEST approach to teaching and learning
biology and the use of computer tools and simulations in undergraduate biology
education. The other one- third of the participants primarily will initiate new
projects in content areas where software tools and computer simulations would
enahnce undergraduate biology instruction. In addition to materials development,
each participant will play a role in in the dissemination process by either
giving a presentation at a professional meeting, conducting a local workshop, or
writing an article for submission to a journal. Materials developed in these
projects may ultimately become part of the growing BioQUEST library. The
effectiveness of this effort in enhancing student learning will be evaluated at
several sites.
