Previous investigation of eolian material preserved in deep sea sediments has
resulted in new information concerning the behavior of continental climate and
atmospheric circulation on the orbital and tectonic time scales. These studies
have been hampered by the need for positive identification of the continental
source of the mineral dust and the determination of the degree of dilution or
masking of the continental eolian signal by material from volcanic and
hydrothermal sources. This award supports research designed to isolate a pure
eolian signal and to determine the provenance of the signal by a combination of
geochemical and geostatistical techniques.
