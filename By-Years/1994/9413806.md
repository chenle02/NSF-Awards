A low-energy electron microscope (LEEM) will be acquired with funds from the
Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The state-of-the-art LEEM will be
obtained from IBM where it has been developed in-house by R. Tromp. Currently
there are only a small number of LEEMs in the entire world and there are large
numbers of scientific applications to be exploited. The program will also
include some development by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with
LEEM and also by combining a novel optical probe using guided-wave optical
spectroscopy with LEEM. The research will involve epitaxial growth processes and
growth optimization of semiconductor films. Materials systems to be studied
include silicon, silicon-germanium and group III- nitrides. An effort will be
made to combine supersonic jet deposition with LEEM. Using a relatively new
electron spectroscopy, namely low-energy electron microscopy, studies will be
made of the epitaxial growth process and growth optimization. The research will
focus on silicon, silicon-germanium and group III-nitrides. Collaborative
efforts with IBM will be initiated to develop new capabilities for this
relatively new electron microscopy technique.
