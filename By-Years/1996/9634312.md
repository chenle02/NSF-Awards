The research introduces a novel axial representation of two- and three-
dimensional shapes that implements Binford's original notion of ribbons and
generalized cylinders for generic objects. Unlike current representation schemes
based on generalized cylinders, which use much more restrictive parametric
models such as straight homogeneous generalized cylinders, and are thus limited
to instances of these models, this representation can be constructed for
arbitrary objects by computing the one- dimensional valleys of a multi-
dimensional height field defined by the area of intersection of the object and a
parameterized plane. The main objectives of this research are: (1) to give a
data-driven, operational definition of ribbons and generalized cylinders that
yields practical algorithms for constructing the description of an arbitrary
shape from two- or three-dimensional data; (2) to establish the formal
properties of the representation with the aims of assessing its scope and
developing rigorous algorithms for detecting generalized cylinder projections in
images; and (3) to develop a principled approach to part decomposition and use
the constructed part-whole hierarchies to support efficient indexing in object
recognition tasks.
