This project details a three-phase plan to integrate technology into the entire
mathematics curriculum using the symbolic algebra package, Maple. The first step
is the upgrading of an existing calculus lab to a truly interactive electronic
classroom. In the second phase, the department plans to weave technology and
Maple into the fabric of the upper-level mathematics courses, changing the
complexion of these courses from `theorem-proof` to `lab-discovery-discussion-
proof.` The final phase introduces a new course for mathematics majors pursuing
teaching certification (Mathematics and Technology for Secondary Education).
Throughout the curriculum, Maple is being used to simplify computation and as a
tool for discovery. Before now, students had used Maple only in the freshman
calculus class. After that first year, Maple and all technology have been absent
from the curriculum. The success experienced in calculus can be duplicated in
all upper-level courses. With the new classroom/lab, the department has the
facilities to implement a plan for `computing across the mathematics
curriculum.`
