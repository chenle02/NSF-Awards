A survey will be conducted for three years to collect, identify and isolate
Ascomycetes (fungi) from freshwater habitats. Ascomycetes will be collected from
submerged aquatic macrophytes and woody debris in both lentic and lotic habitats
along two latitudinal gradients in North America. Identified specimens will be
deposited in major herbaria; cultures will be screened for the production of
asexual states and novel antibiotics, and deposited at the American Type Culture
Collection. Descriptions of new or noteworthy species will be published in
international journals and a monograph with descriptions, illustrations and a
key will be prepared. Data from this study will contribute to our understanding
of phylogenetic relationships among Ascomycetes, the influence of latitude on
fungal diversity and composition, teleomorph-anamorph relationships, and the
morphological adaption of Ascomycetes to freshwater habitats. Cultures obtained
during this study represent a new source of secondary compounds and provide
material to mycologists for further study in systematic, developmental,
physiological, molecular, and ecological studies. This project will provide
training to graduate student sin ascomycete systematics, preparing and
depositing herbarium specimens, identifying and describing taxa, isolating fungi
and depositing cultures, and manipulating a large taxonomic database.
