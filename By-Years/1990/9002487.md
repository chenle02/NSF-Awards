Research on chemical reactions on miscible polymer blends is an area in which
the opportunities for morphological control on top of chemical reactivity have
important implications in regard to final materials properties, especially in
polymer blends having critical solution temperatures where changes in reaction
temperature affect miscibility, phase separation, and chemical reactivity.
Oxidative studies will be carried out on miscible blends of poly(styrene) (PS)
and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME). PVME photo-oxidizes and thermo-oxidizes
much more readily than polystyrene -- allowing for large differences in
reactivity with oxygen. Prior studies have indicated that the rates of oxygen
uptake by the homopolymers are significantly different than that of the blends.
The research will involve - understanding the mechanistic chemical aspects of
the oxidative stabilization phenomena for PS/PVME blends by use of model
compounds, additional studies on the degradation products directly obtained from
their oxidation experiments on the polymer systems, the effect of specific
interactions such as hydrogen bonding on miscibility and oxidative aging in
these systems, extension of these concepts into other systems, and the effect of
added antioxidants and their distribution.
