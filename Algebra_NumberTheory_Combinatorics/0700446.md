This is a research in the field of algebraic geometry - a classical subject
studying the solutions to systems of polynomial equations. The project addresses
four problems providing novel interfaces between complex geometry and string
theory and quantum physics. The first one outlines a new way to extract Hodge
theoretic invariants directly from the sheaf theory of commutative or
noncommutative spaces. The formal structure of these linear entities will be
studied and through the physical notion of quantum mirror symmetry used to
produce new invariants of symplectic manifolds. In the second project a new
method is proposed for proving the K-equivalence conjecture in birational
geometry. The third project concerns the problem of deformation quantization of
geometric dualities and symmetries in the complex analytic context. The fourth
project analyzes the supersymmetry constraints for D-branes with non-trivial
fluxes wrapping algebraic cycles in Calabi-Yau threefolds. The large N
quantization of the branes is probed in the context of algebraically completely
integrable systems.

The understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various
linearization procedures in algebraic geometry, symplectic topology, theoretical
and mathematical physics. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic
structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad
spectrum of applications. The project outlines concrete interdisciplinary
applications to matrix quantum mechanics, string dualities and topological black
holes. This project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on enhancing the
geometric arsenal of techniques used in high energy physics and condensed matter
theory. This will be achieved by training a group of young researchers, and
graduate and undergraduate students in mathematics and physics, and by a
curriculum development of courses on Hodge theory, non-commutative geometry and
mirror symmetry, on the graduate and undergraduate level.
