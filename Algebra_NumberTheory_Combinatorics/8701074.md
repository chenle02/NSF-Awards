This research is concerned with infinite abelian groups. In particular, it will
focus on a collection of torsion-free abelian groups called Butler groups. The
principal investigator will investigate the construction and the structure of
these groups by using set theoretic methods. This research is in the general
area of abelian group theory. The current trend in abelian groups is to utilize
set theory and logic in determining questions on structure. Mathematical logic
enters into this context since scholars in this subject have discovered that
certain research problems in this area are either undecidable in ordinary set
theory or else require further set-theoretic axioms for their resolution. This
project will concentrate on a subclass of abelian groups called Butler groups.
