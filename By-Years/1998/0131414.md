Control of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) activity is the major mechanism underlying
cellular differentiation during development. For some genes, this includes
regulation at the level of transcription elongation. The mammalian Pol II
elongation factor ELL is distinguished as being able to increase the catalytic
rate of Pol II in vitro. ELL homologs are absent from yeast, suggesting that the
ELL family of elongation factors represents an adaptation of metazoans. The
long-term goal of this project is to understand the role of the ELL family of
transcription elongation factors in the regulation of gene expression. The
Drosophila homolog of ELL (dELL) broadly co-localizes with phosphorylated Pol II
on polytene chromosomes, is concentrated at sites of active transcription and is
associated with Pol II in whole fly extracts. Mutations in the dELL coding
sequence are found in independently isolated mutant alleles of Suppressor of
triplo-lethal [Su(Tpl)]. Su(Tpl) is an essential gene, and the phenotypes of
Su(Tpl) mutations are consistent with a defect in a general transcription
factor. dELL is the only ELL-family protein in flies. This project will test
whether dELL functions in transcription in living cells, and what role it plays
in regulating gene expression. Specific Aim 1 will test whether dELL is
recruited to the body of transcribing genes in vivo. Specific Aim 2 will test
whether dELL is limiting for gene transcription in vivo. The expression of
various patterning genes will be tested in early embryos in which dELL has been
inactivated by RNAi, to see whether loss of dELL results in their down-
regulation. Specific Aim 3 will test the ability of a dELL transgene to
complement the recessive lethality of Su(Tpl) mutations, and whether a truncated
dELL transgene behaves as a dominant negative on a wild-type background. These
studies will provide the first detailed understanding of the role for the ELL-
family of proteins and their gene expression in vivo. They will also provide the
foundation for a genetic dissection of dELL and for understanding the regulation
of Pol II in development.
