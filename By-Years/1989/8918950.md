This dissertation research will allow a cultural anthropologist specialized in
demography to study male attitudes towards paternity and their contributions to
fertility decisions. The project will study two cohorts of men, aged 25 and 35,
from Santa Clara County, California, to describe the values men have about
paternity, relate these values to social class, opportunity structure and life
history, and illuminate demographic and attitudinal data from large scale
surveys of fertility with this ethnographic view. This research is important
because most studies of fertility deal with women, yet the values and attitudes
of men are equally important. This in-depth study of males will thus contribute
valuable information that can serve to identify any bias in previous studies.
