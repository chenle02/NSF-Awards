This experimental research program focuses on the development of methods for
learning control to yield information about the forces controlling quantum
dynamics. This quantum control will use optical tools such as mode-locking,
Fourier filtering, and parametric conversion to tailor fields to turn on and off
in femtoseconds or less, and change their characteristics faster than a chemical
bond can open or an atom can ionize. Unlike tunable laser absorption, laser
cooling, or optical pumping, all of which also can control quantum states,
strong field control can induce interactions so rapidly that decoherence from
the environment or the electromagnetic vacuum cannot interfere. The broader
impact of the program involves student education and outreach to the
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
