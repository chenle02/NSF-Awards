The objective of this project is to further develop a sugar-based molecular
gelator into an oil-thickening agent for spill recovery and remediation.
Biocatalytically derived low molecular weight phase selective gelators are
important in advanced materials research. An alternative to environmentally
persistent polymeric gel systems, low molecular weight gelators are a new class
of functional smart materials, which assemble due to easily broken non-covalent
forces. Focusing efforts on these relatively unexplored highly tunable systems
have helped to develop a strong understanding of solid/liquid gel systems, the
utility and character of non-covalent forces in materials, and green synthetic
methods. Phase selective gelators, a subgenre of low molecular weight gelators,
are capable of selectively solidifying one of two immiscible liquid phases due
to solubility properties and physical occlusion. Most of these gelators have
been discovered serendipitously but continued attempts to rationally design
systems are needed to elucidate the structure-assembly/activity relationships
and allow for the systematic formulation and understanding of these molecules.
Low molecular weight gelators synthesized from renewable resources bridge many
sub disciplines in chemistry, engineering, and materials science including
sustainable design and green chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase
Selective Gelators (PSGs) have a wide variety of applications as oil thickeners.
Developed as biocompatible materials to recover spilled oil in offshore oil
spills, PSGs conceptually allow for the oil's recovery while currently used
dispersants solubilize the foreign matter into the marine environments. As
gelation is a physical process, without chemically altering the gelator or oil,
the PSG may be recycled and reused. In addition to oil spill recovery, oil
thickeners may be used in personal care, and food industry to transport liquids,
or to provide desirable texture or consistency in food. As PSGs can be easily
synthesized through low energy biocatalytic means from renewable resources they
represent a class of functional and sustainable value-added smart materials. By
developing environmentally benign products for widespread use researchers can
lower the dependence on synthetic chemicals while mitigating the effects of
synthetic systems in the environment.
