Research on Domestic Violence has grown significantly over the last several
decades, though few studies have examined this issue in the lives of women
living in poverty. This dissertation project will document the prevalence of
domestic abuse among a representative sample of welfare recipients. It will also
document the incidence of sexual trauma, depression, substance abuse and
homelessness within this sample. The project will explore the connection between
domestic violence and welfare receipt as it impacts on education, training and
employment. The role of domestic abuse, as an impediment to economic progress,
will be a central focus of the study. The project will employ both quantitative
and qualitative research methods. Survey data will be collected from
approximately 800 participants in a welfare-to-work training program. Following
the surveys, twenty-five to thirty past or present victims of domestic violence
will be interviewed at length in their homes. The study will contribute to the
sociological literature through empirical and analytical exploration of abuse
and trauma in relationship to poverty. The investigation of the connection
between domestic violence and poverty has important implications for ideological
premises inherent in the welfare reform debate.
