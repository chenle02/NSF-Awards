9634394 O'Sullivan Transport from the tropics to the extratropics in the
stratosphere occurs mainly by isentropic advection and stirring into the active
surf zone of the winter hemisphere midlatitudes. The transport couples two
regions of differing constituent concentrations: the (upwelling) tropical region
and the (mostly downwelling) extratropics. Besides varying seasonally, such
transport is affected by the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The principal
objective of this research is to investigate the manner in which the QBO affects
transport by (a) its mean meridional circulations, (b) its modulation of Rossby
wave propagation and breaking at the low latitudes, (c) its modulation of the
extratropical Rossby wave activity and surf zone mixing, and consequently (d)
its modulation of the global Brewer-Dobson residual circulation strength during
the winter season. The study will rely primarily on numerical simulations with a
three-dimensional model of the middle atmosphere and a tracer transport model.
The results will be compared with other simulations and satellite observations
of the middle atmosphere. This work will also provide estimates of stratospheric
transport rates form the tropics to the extratropics for each season and for
different phases of the QBO as a function of height. Dr. O'Sullivan is a young
scientist who has established an excellent reputation in the middle atmosphere
research community. His work is contributes not only to better understanding of
stratospheric dynamics, but also provides critical information on processes that
affect the photochemical processes of the region as well. ***
