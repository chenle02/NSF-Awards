With this proposal Dr. Foster of MIT/Haystack Observatory seeks funds for a
modest permanent CEDAR optical observatory on MIT property near the Millstone
Hill radar facility. At present, CEDAR optical instruments and visitors are
housed at several separate locations on space available basis. The new site
would provide a better optical horizon than any of the existing locations and
consolidate instrumentation and facilitate access to CEDAR investigators.*** //
