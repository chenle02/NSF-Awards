This investigation is a study game-like models of computation and their
applications in Computer Science. A theory of two-person computational games has
already ben developed and has applications in optimization, cryptography, number
theory and many other areas. This effort will continue research on two-person
games, by generalizing known results and extending the standard models to
include new classes of game-like problems. This project will also result in a
characterization of the complexity of some multi-person games that model
problems in distributed computation and cryptography. To complement this
research the uses of game theory in the design of distributed algorithms will be
investigated. The benefit of this research will be a better understanding of the
complexity of game-like computational problems, in particular, problems in
distributed computation.
