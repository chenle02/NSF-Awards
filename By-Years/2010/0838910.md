This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The proposal seeks funding to: (a) continue ongoing studies
that compare ground observations of Pc 1-2 waves with waves and ions observed by
Cluster and THEMIS spacecrafts, both on dayside closed field lines (especially
in relation to geomagnetic storms, to characterize their role in depleting the
ring current and radiation belt electrons) and in the lobe/mantle region, to
investigate whether they can be used to monitor the transport of magnetosheath
plasma toward the tail; (b) compare ground-based observations of Pc 3-4 waves at
cusp and polar cap latitudes with data from Cluster and THEMIS to investigate
their propagation from their upstream source into and through the dayside
magnetosphere and polar cap; and (c) continue recent satellite-ground studies of
Pi 1B pulsations and substorms, in particular by comparing multi-station ground
data with data from FAST, Cluster, and THEMIS spacecrafts, and by quantitatively
analyzing multi-station data to test methods for inferring source locations, and
by using combined ground and satellite Pi 1B data to probe the physical link
between the onset location and the ionospheric signature of substorms. It is
expected that the project will continue to play a significant role in a variety
of studies of geospace phenomena including the solar wind?magnetosphere
interaction and geomagnetic storms and substorms. The analysis effort associated
with this project is highly suitable for involvement and research training of
both graduate and undergraduate students.
