This award is to fund a workshop on research needs in human- computer
interaction to be held March 4-5 at the George Washington University,
Washington, D.c. The general need for high quality research in human-computer
interaction (HCI) is becoming more and more evident both in industrial and
academic settings. This workshop has a primary purpose to establish an agenda
for research in this critical area. The workshop brings together almost two
dozen of the most prominent HCI researches from the disciplines of computer
science, engineering, information science, psychology and human factors along
with NSF staff members. The results of the workshop is a report identifying
critical research issues and potential avenues for studying them, along with
necessary infrastructure recommendations related to educational, professional
and facility problems. The report will be published in major distribution
publications.
