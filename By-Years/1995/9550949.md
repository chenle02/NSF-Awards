83686 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Physics Title: A computerized nuclear and
particle physics laboratory for undergraduates This project will provide physics
students at Northwest Nazarene College with hands-on experience using modern,
computer controlled apparatus to perform meaningful measurements in nuclear and
particle physics. This goal meshes well with the pedagogical method supported by
the entire science division of requiring a strong research component as part of
the curriculum. In addition to experiments for the sophomore-level physics
laboratory, two experiments are proposed which would be part of a Junior/Senior
Research Program, in which students work one-on-one on research projects with a
professor. The program presented has been carefully designed for a small
department with limited resources. There are several reasons for selecting
particle physics experiments for this program. Particle physics is one of the
frontier areas of modern physics research, yet experiments of this type are not
usually part of the undergraduate laboratory curriculum. These experiments offer
one of the few opportunities students have for observing first-hand the effects
of relativity. By providing students with practical and up-to-date experience
using modern, fast electronic and computerized data acquisition and analysis, we
hope to give them the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in a career in
any branch of experimental physics.
