9724632 Bonner This is an award to provide support for instrumentation to
conduct collaborative research on decontamination of soil that has been
contaminated by crude oil, products resulting from the refining of oil and
residues from production of explosives. The research to be conducted in this
project involves identification of transformation pathways by which microbial
degradation of these contaminants occurs especially concentrating on the
identification of intermediates. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in accord with the NSF Instrument Development and Acquisition
Solicitation, NSF 97-24, Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program. The
availability of the equipment provided through this award is expected to enhance
the ability of environmental engineers and others to detect and monitor
intermediate products of microbial action on petroleum and petroleum products.
This knowledge is expected to have applications in the engineering design of
systems for decontamination of soil contaminated by the category of pollutants
being studied in this project. ***
