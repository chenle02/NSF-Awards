This research project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program, is a study of probe molecules in hydrogen and helium
clusters. Low lying phonon states of the cluster and the interaction of these
states with rovibrational states of a probe molecule will be treated by quantum
Monte Carlo theory. Computed quantities include lifetime broadening, shifts and
splittings in infrared and Raman spectra of probe molecules such as
sulfurhexafluoride or diatomic iodine. By comparing theory with experimental
measurements, the host-host and host-impurity couplings can be determined and
used to study other energy dissipation processes in quantum fluids. A second
major component of this project treats high energy (>1 keV) electron scattering
from clusters to study ionization and elastic scattering cross sections. It has
long been known that liquids (quantum liquids) composed of very light atoms or
molecules, particularly helium atoms or hydrogen molecules, exhibit unusual
properties such as superfluidity. The principal goal of this project is to test
mathematical and theoretical methods in the theory of these phenomena by
computing experimentally accessible spectral effects on small quantum clusters
containing probe molecules. The most immediate application of this fundamental
knowledge is to the theory of spacelab experiments involving superfluid
clusters, and to the development of improved cryogenic rocket fuels.
