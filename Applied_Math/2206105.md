Hydraulic shocks and roll waves can drastically affect inclined shallow-water
flow, which is particularly important to canal and dam spillway design. The
Principal Investigator (PI) will use theoretical and computational methods to
study the effects of rotational and multi-dimensions on the existence and
stability of flow patterns in inclined shallow water flow. The results are
expected be of interest to hydraulic engineers seeking to prevent damage from
anomalous large waves, either by preventing their appearance, or by building
remediating structures to a size and strength called for by the existing and
developing theory.

The PI will study a selection of novel problems on stability and behavior of
inclined shallow water flow. The objective of the project is the incorporation
of previously unaccounted multi-dimensional and rotational (vorticity) effects
in the study of stability and behavior of roll waves and hydraulic shocks in a
hydrodynamic engineering setting, to obtain comprehensive stability diagrams
across all parameters. The project involves applicable and nonstandard
mathematical issues addressing challenging problems from physical applications.
For example, successful treatment of multidimensional shock and roll waves would
advance general theory, while providing a solid framework on roll wave behavior
in shallow water flow/hydraulic engineering. The research methods that will be
used in the project include a blend of numerical, formal asymptotic, and
dynamical systems/turning point tools with specialized techniques coming from
detonation theory and hyperbolic conservation laws. The validation of simple
stability criteria for roll waves in shallow water flow and the introduction of
new asymptotic and numerical methods are of wider application in both hydraulic
engineering and the theory of hyperbolic shock and boundary value problems.
Likewise, the computation of all-parameters stability diagrams for commonly
occurring flows is of basic foundational scientific interest.
