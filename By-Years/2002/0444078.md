This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to test the validity of using
optically stimulated luminescence dating techniques on coastal sand covered
archeological sites in the Shetland Islands. The research project will employ
high resolution techniques, archaeology, geology, and ethnohistory to examine
human responses to short-term extreme environmental changes.
