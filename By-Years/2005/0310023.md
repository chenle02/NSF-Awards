ABSTRACT 0310023 Cornell University C. Richard Johnson

The Cornell University Blind Equalization Research Group (C.U. BERG) under the
direction of Professor C. Richard Johnson, Jr. has spent the past decade and a
half researching blind and semi-blind adaptive algorithms used in communication
receiver design, usually for blind equalization and blind synchronization. The
current focus of the BERG is the Broadband Adaptive Receiver Design (BARD)
Project, which aims to develop and study adaptive algorithms for emerging
broadband last-mile communications applications. One manifestation of thisw ork
isthe BERG'scurren t e.ort in the development of blind, adaptive algorithmsfor
channel shortening. Channel shortening is a generalization of equalization, and
it can be applied to the design of receivers for multicarrier communication
systems, the design of reduced-complexity maximum likelihood sequence estimation
(MLSE), and the design of interference suppression for multiuser detectors. The
BARD Project is taking an adaptive system-theory approach to the (blind) channel
shortening problem. Through thisapproac h, the BARD Project hasrecen tly
produced several blind, adaptive algorithms, leading to receivers with improved
performance in timevarying environments, and receivers with greatly reduced
complexity requirements. In addition, the BARD Project has analytically
characterized several of the existing non-adaptive approaches, leading to both
explanations of their (poor) performance in certain (time-invariant) situations,
and dramatic reductionsof their implementation complexity.
