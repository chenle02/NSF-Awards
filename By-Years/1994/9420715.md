This proposal represents a request that the National Science Foundation help to
sponsor a symposium entitled "Mechanisms of oocyte maturation and fertilization"
organized for the Seventh International Congress of Invertebrate Reproduction
and Development, to be held August 6th-11th, 1995 in Santa Cruz, CA. The
symposium considers hormonal and sperm interaction with the egg membrane in
invertebrate systems: sea urchins, abalone, etc. While many advances have
occuried regarding the molecules that initiate oocyte maturation, the receptor
mechanisms and initial mediating steps are still controversial. The applicant
makes the case that the time is right for various workers in the field of
research to come together to discuss recent progress. Travel expenses are
requested. Many of the invited speakers are foreign, and their acceptance is
contingent upon at least partial funding of their expenses. Results of the
Congress are published as full length, refereed articles in the journal
Invertebrate Reproduction and Development. ***
