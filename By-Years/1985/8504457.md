The objective of this research is to develop a generalized design methodology
for wire rope. The general strategy includes: taking the realm of systems and
categorizing them according to system design objectives; formulating design
objective functions based on the desired system properties; determining which
design parameters affect the objective functions; determining the types of
constraints that will distinguish individual systems within a category;
determining the actual constraints for particular types of applications; and
using the objective function to quantitatively compare different designs for a
specific application.
