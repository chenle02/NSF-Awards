Automation of short-run assembly cannot be justified economically. The problem
is how to reduce the labor cost for runs of medium length. It was hoped that
this could be accomplished by use of robots which are reprogrammable. Two
approaches have been taken. One is to develop visual, tactile, and force sensors
for the next generation of robots so that they can find the parts to be
assembled and then guide them to their appointed positions in the assembly. The
other approach is to use the present generation of robots, but to reduce the
cost of equipment which brings the piece parts to locations where the robot can
find them and pick them up. Much time and money have been spent on the first
approach but the results have been far from satisfactory. This effort deals with
the second approach. Four tasks are undertaken: design, fabrication, test, and
evaluation of low cost, easily programmable part feeders that convey parts, one
by one, from a jumbled collection to a point where the robot can find them,
properly oriented; design, fabrication, test, and evaluation of three- and four-
finger grippers versatile enough to handle a large variety of parts;
establishment of an assembly work station based on the foregoing tasks; and
development of rules for designing parts and products so that they are suitable
for robot-based assembly systems.
