The dark pigment, melanin, is thought to provide protection of tissue from
damage from harmful effects of sunlight exposure. However, melanin also is found
in the inner ear, and in the embryonic eye. In certain genetic strains with
reduced melanin, called hypopigmented, there are specific defects of auditory or
visual properties, where the severity seems to correlate with the extent of
melanin reduction and not with mutations in particular genes. This project uses
a multi-disciplinary approach of anatomy, physiology, behavior and classical
genetics to determine how reduced melanin in the eye is related to the elevation
of dark-adapted thresholds for vision, and to determine the location of the
defect within the retina of the eye. A novel hypothesis will be tested, to see
whether melanin may be acting as a buffer for calcium around the photoreceptor
cells. In addition to the impact on visual neuroscience, the results could have
impact on our understanding the basic role that this ubiquitous pigment has in
environmental adaptations in other systems and animals.
