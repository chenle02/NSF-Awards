This award focuses on a specific research program that will be using data from
the neutron monitor at McMurdo (which will be then moved to Jang Bogo) and from
other worldwide locations. The research program is based on a unique southward
cosmic rays "viewing direction" of the subject monitor for comprehensive
analyses of individual solar events by measuring three dimensional distribution
functions of solar energetic particles. The long and complete database acquired
by the McMurdo monitor over 50+ years also plays an important role in the
studies of historical trends in "solar modulation" of galactic cosmic rays and
the influence of solar magnetic activity on the radiation input into the Earth's
atmosphere. The recent deep solar minimum and slow recovery to the maximum are
unprecedented for the potentially new era in the studies of the Sun. To ensure
continuity of the McMurdo long-term dataset, it is proposed to move the monitor
to the new Korean station Jang Bogo, which is located in Terra Nova Bay and has
the viewing direction nearly identical to that of McMurdo. Solid science,
international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to
achieve excellent education and outreach goals. By providing undergraduates and
two-year college students with Antarctic research experience, the proposal
demonstrates how a future generation of scientists can make meaningful
contributions to the cutting-edge research.
