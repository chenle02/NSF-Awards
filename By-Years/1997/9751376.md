This project is introducing a materials synthesis and processing program through
the Department of Chemistry. The centerpiece of the program is a new laboratory
course entitled, Materials Synthesis and Characterization. The course features
four concurrent, semester-long, inquiry-based laboratory experiments drawn from
both industrial interactions and current research in materials synthesis.
Students are participating in each of the four experiments in a rotation that
requires information transfer from one group to the next. Thirteen experiments
are featured in the project. Students are being required to formulate long-term
research objectives and defend them under scrutiny from their peers, the
professors, and the industrial advisors. An interdisciplinary enrollment from
chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, and mechanical engineering is ensured
by aggressive recruitment. Problemsolving in this environment mimics how complex
research and development is performed and teaches the students how to interact
with colleagues from other disciplines. In addition to the aforementioned
course, the acquisition of the new characterization tools are impacting 15
materials-related courses and more than 100 students per year by enabling new
experiments. The project also involves the purchase of a thermogravimetric
analyzer, a thermomechanical analyzer, a dynamic mechanical analyzer, a
differential scanning calorimeter, a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, a gel
permeation chromatography apparatus, a diffractometer with thin film optics, and
an upgrade to a sputtering system that enables the deposition of multilayer
films. *
