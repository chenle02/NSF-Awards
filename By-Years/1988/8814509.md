The National Academy of Sciences/NRC has formed a Plasma Sciences Committee, to
represent the various aspects of this wide ranging discipline. This committee
will now prepare a number of studies: among them will be a survey of the field
of plasma science, which will be valuable both to scientists and to federal
agencies involved in this area. Other studies will lead to workshops and
symposia, exploring the most promising lines of future research. This field has
long needed these studies, and this committee will be an important and valuable
independent unifying body in this area.
