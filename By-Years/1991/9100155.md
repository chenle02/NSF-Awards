This award supports the integration of airborne gravity with the combined
airborne radar and aeromagnetic Corridor Aerogeophysics of the Southeastern Ross
Transect Zone (CASERTZ) program which will be conducted by the Byrd Polar
Research Center and the USGS. This program will survey two 220 x 330 km regions
between the Transantarctic Mountains and Marie Byrd Land during the 1990-1991
and 1991-1992 field seasons. The survey will consist of a 5 x 5 km track spacing
and is designed to determine the motion, volcanism and deformation history of
the Ellsworth-Whitmore crustal block of West Antarctica and the relationship of
the tectonics of this block to the evolution of the Byrd Subglacial Basin, the
Interior Ross Embayment and the Transantarctic Mountains. The airborne
gravimetry will improve the capability of the CASERTZ program to define crustal
structure and add a new capability to model crustal thickness.
