This award provides support for a spectrophotometric facility which will
enhance the capabilities of several groups carrying out materials research in
the Department of Physics at Oklahoma State University. The specific instruments
involved are a dual- beam ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer
and a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. The related research work
includes research into new laser materials, electro-optic materials,
piezoelectric materials and dosimetric materials.
