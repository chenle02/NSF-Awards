This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the
opportunities inherent in long-distance learning alternatives fashioned around
the telnet internet protocol. To date, virtually all long-distance learning
trials have been designed to operate using the procedures of the world-wide web
(HTTP, CGI, Java, etc.), but these web-based solutions have a number of obvious
intrinsic problems. Such solutions tend to be quite slow, and they are capable
of only moderate interactivity, often quite fragile, and rapidly become
surprisingly complex. In contrast, the telnet protocol, when used with a more or
less standard terminal emulator, tends to be very responsive over the internet,
especially when the protocol is very slightly modified, and very simple to
program against. The creation of a freely distributed player and accompanying
inexpensive authoring tool built around a standard terminal interface could be
of importance to areas with underdeveloped communications infrastructures, thus
making the internet accessible to those who can afford only low-bandwidth
internet. The distributed player and authoring tool proffered by Aics Inc has
the potential to have an important impact on the nature and methods of the
distribution of information opportunities for secondary education through
graduate and continuing professional education, and they could serve in
technical commercial sales and training and in more generally in crossing the
digital divide.
