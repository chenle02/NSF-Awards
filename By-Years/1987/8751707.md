The Solar Cycle 22 Project will (in 1989-91) take advantage of the upcoming
peak of the sunspot cycle to give twenty-four elementary and middle school
teachers first hand experience in studying solar activity and resultant earth
effects. The project sponsored by the Broome- Delaware-Tioga Board of
Cooperative Educational Services and the Roberson-Kopernik Observatory will
assist teachers in incorporating scientific investigation into the classroom.
The core of the project will be a three-week Summer Teacher Institute which will
culminate in curriculum development, with follow-up activities to include
setting up solar mini-stations in schools so that students may collect sunspot
data safely in the classroom. After the educational experience at the
Observatory, the teachers will supervise data gathering at their home schools
and disseminate their data through a communications network and series of
sharing sessions. The project will stress the interdisciplinary nature of solar
monitoring in that physical sciences, astronomy, earth sciences, and computer
science will be involved.
