This U.S.-Brazil award will provide support to Dr. James E. Womack, Texas
A&amp;M Research Foundation, to collaborate with Dr. Paula C. Schneider, Para
Federal University, and Dr. Elisabete J. Aamaral, Universidade Estadual
Paulista, on mapping specific chromosomes of river buffalo through the
construction and characterization of a panel of radiation hybrid (RH) cell
lines. They propose to construct a buffalo radiation hybrid panel and to develop
framework maps of buffalo chromosomes 1,2,X, and Y containing at least 60
microsatellites and 60 conserved genes or expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The panel of RH lines generated will eventually be
genotyped for markers throughout the genome, both in the laboratories of these
Pis and in other labs throughout the world. Thus a whole genome RH map will be a
product of the resource developed by this project. This map will be a primary
tool for comparison of the buffalo genome to that of other mammals to identify
evolutionary rearrangements and for identifying and isolating genes responsible
for traits of biological interest. This gives breeders insight into improvement
of animals related to agricultural needs.&lt;br/&gt;
