Mark Gordon of Iowa State University and Teresa Head-Gordon of UC-Berkeley are
supported by the Chemistry Division to support approximately 50 people at an
October 2004 workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss opportunities,
challenges, and unmet needs in the emerging, overlapping areas of
cyberinfrastructure and cyberscience, from the perspective of the chemistry
community. In addition to the two co-organizers, a steering committee of seven
additional persons will assist in the planning, implementation, and final report
of the workshop. Participants will compose a diverse group of researchers and
educators, from academic and industrial backgrounds, as well as representatives
from federal labs and funding agencies. The workshop report will inform the
Chemistry Division about key issues in cyber-enabled chemistry.
