Abstract Somasundaran, P./Columbia U. EEC-9708150 This award to the Columbia
University is to study the feasibility of establishing an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center on the characterization and development of novel
specialty surfactants for applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and
biological consumer products. The Center will also emphasize on the development
of knowledge base on the relationship between structure of different surfactants
for specific industrial applications. The research program, structure and
organization of the proposed Center will be studied in an industry/university
workshop.
