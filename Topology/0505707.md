The PI is interested in the large scale geometry of groups and complexes. One
project involves analyzing the asymptotic behavior of filling invariants of
groups. In collaboration with Martin Bridson, Max Forester and Krishnan Shankar,
the PI is investigating the first and second order Dehn functions of groups. In
joint work with Max Forester and Krishnan Shankar, the PI is exploring what
types of functions can arise as first or second order Dehn functions of
subgroups of CAT(0) groups, and of hyperbolic groups. Another project of the PI
and John Crisp, Anton Kaul and Jon McCammond involves generalized Garside
structures and associated complexes for Artin groups. Another project, comprised
of separate collaborations of the PI with John Crisp and with Jon McCammond,
focuses on non-positive curvature and dimension in group theory, and on the
connections between large scale notions and local notions of non-positive
curvature. A number of other projects include investigations into conjugacy and
isomorphism of generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups, ends of amalgams, distortion
of subgroups of hyperbolic groups, and the existence of surface subgroups of
hyperbolic groups.

Groups are used by mathematicians to study symmetry. A group is just a
collection of symmetries of an object. Examples include the geometric symmetries
of a wallpaper pattern, or of a crystal structure, or of an Escher painting, or
the algebraic symmetries associated to roots of polynomials. Mathematicians have
studied groups intensively as abstract algebraic objects since the 19th century.
In the 1980's M. Gromov proposed that we consider groups as geometric objects,
and began to derive deep connections between the geometric and the algebraic
properties of groups. One theme which emerged from Gromov's work is that the
geometric properties which have deep algebraic consequences are not local
properties, but rather coarse or "large scale". For example, and infinite ladder
and an infinite straight line are not locally alike, but are large scale alike,
and their symmetry groups will have many algebraic similarities. The PI
investigates large scale versions of isoperimetric problems (area versus
perimeter length problems) in groups, and also the geometry of coarsely
negatively curved groups. These investigations help deepen our understanding of
the nature of symmetry.
