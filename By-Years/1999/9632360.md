9632360 Mao This award provides funding to the Carnegie Institution of
Washington for the construction of a microdiffraction facility at the National
Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The
facility will make use of the ultrabright X-ray beam from a superconducting
wiggler insertion device at NSLS and provide for focus of the beam down to a
6-10 micron diameter at the position of samples subjected to ultrahigh static
pressures of up to two to three hundred megabars in diamond anvil pressure
devices. Laser heating of the microsamples will also allow heating of samples to
several thousand degrees simultaneously with high pressure. The X-ray
microdiffraction facility will be used primarily by Earth scientists at Carnegie
and elsewhere investigating the properties of materials in the Earth's deep
interior. ***
