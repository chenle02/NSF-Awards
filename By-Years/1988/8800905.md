This research will document an extreme foraging specialization that is unique
to diverse tropical bird communities, and then test specific hypotheses
concerning the maintenance of this specialization. A dozen bird species at each
of two Amazonian rainforest sites were found to forage primarily by extracting
arthropods from curled dead leaves suspended in the forest understory. Because
the dead leaves represent discrete resource patches, this research can quantify
leaf availability and use, as well as the abundance of available prey. A
preliminary empirical study suggests the following predictions to be tested in a
series of outdoor cage experiments on wild-caught birds and arthropods: 1) dead
leaf specialists have fixed preferences for dead leaf vs. other substrates, but
are flexible with respect to particular types; 2) specialists are more efficient
than co-occurring generalists at capturing prey hiding in dead leaves; 3) dead-
leaf arthropods have fixed preferences for hiding in these leaves; and 4) these
arthropods exhibit stereotyped behavioral responses to bird predation that in
turn influence the bird's foraging efficiency. This study differs from most
other insectivorous bird studies in two important ways; first, food availability
and diets are measured directly rather than inferred from feeding behavior or
morphology, and second, the amenability of this resource system to experimental
manipulation provides a rare opportunity to evaluate the role of the various
processes that may promote specialization.
