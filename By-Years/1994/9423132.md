9423132 Kursunoglu The approach for a unified view is central to much of
theoretical physics. This conference on "Unified Symmetry: In the Large and In
the Small" to be held in Coral Gables on Feb. 2-3, 1995 seeks to understand
better the links between the smallest constituents of matter, the elementary
particles and the building up of large scale structure in e.g. galaxies, as this
occurs in for instance the early universe. The broad exchange of information and
ideas in this conference is likely to yield interesting new insights into there
problems. ***
