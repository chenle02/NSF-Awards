9505342 Tzavaras We propose to study various topics related to the formation,
propagation and resolution of singularities during the dynamic deformation of
continuous media. The topics are: (i) Effect of viscosity on shock propagation
for hyperbolic conservation laws. (ii) Fluid-mechanic limits for discrete
velocity models for Riemann data. (iii) Formation of shear bands at high strain
rates. The proposed techniques are from the domain of qualitative theory of
partial differential equations, with the use of computational tools when
necessary to guide the theory. The proposed problems vary from concrete models
for specific phenomena, to general theory hyperbolic systems of conservation
laws, to developing techniques for studying the transition from discrete to
continuum theories. The theoretical understanding of structures such as shock
waves and shear bands is critical for designing improved algorithms in
technological applications where such phenomena are dominant. Shear bands are
regions of intensely localized strain that appear during high speed deformations
of metals and often precede rupture. Shear bands play a major role in ballistic
penetration of metals and in various manufacturing processes involving metals.
