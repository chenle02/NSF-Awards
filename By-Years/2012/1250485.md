Addressing the gap between scientific evidence, behavior, and policy is central
to moving society toward a sustainable energy path. An increasingly rich body of
work in the social and behavioral sciences is examining human motivation and
decision making. This research may hold the key to understanding energy
sustainability, but its results are seldom integrated into the technical and
energy policy communities. This researcher will manage a workshop to develop
detailed plans for building a Research Coordination Network focused on energy
production and use decisions that bridges the social science, technical, policy
and practitioner communities. The workshop will also establish a standing forum
at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to facilitate ongoing
dialogue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By connecting social science researchers whose
work can directly inform government agencies, professional societies, academic
researchers and non-governmental organizations, this workshop will facilitate
new interdisciplinary collaborations that will have a lasting impact on future
social and behavioral energy research. It will provide the basis for new energy
technologies and policies and will advance an agenda for future social and
behavioral research on energy production and use.
