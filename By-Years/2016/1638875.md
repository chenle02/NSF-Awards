This award supports the transition of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
(NRAO) from the current model in which the Green Bank Observatory (GBO) and the
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) have been managed and operated as integral
components of NRAO. From October 1, 2016 NRAO management and operations
principally will encompass the Very Large Array (VLA), the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and associated support functions and
development laboratories. GBO and VLBA will be managed and operated separately
from NRAO. Operation of all these state-of-the-art radio telescopes provides
important scientific capability to the U.S. community to explore fundamental
scientific areas such as the formation of planets in other solar systems and the
structure and evolution of the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A transition plan
outlines the specific steps required within a six month period to revise
operations of NRAO.
