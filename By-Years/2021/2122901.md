The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is to develop a new technology that
improves the ability of doctors to diagnose acute kidney injury in hospitalized
patients. Acute kidney injury is a medical condition which begins without
clinical symptoms or signs, and has been estimated to occur in up to 20% of
hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury results in significant harm to
patients as well as greatly increased overall health care costs. Acute kidney
injury is generally not recognized early in its course. Currently available
methods used to diagnose acute kidney injury are imperfect. Recognition of acute
kidney injury using presently available methods is delayed and only occurs after
the development of significant organ dysfunction. The technology that will be
developed in this PFI-RP project may detect acute kidney injury earlier so that
treatment can be rendered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a new
technology for continuous, real time measurement and real time analysis of
urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury. Specifically, a system for continuous
measurement of urine components will be developed and built. This system will be
used to measure and quantify urine components and develop a model of early acute
kidney injury. A machine learning prediction model will be developed and tested
with the model system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
