This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish the
technical and economic feasibility of a novel technology to completely oxidize
formaldehyde at dilute concentrations in air at room temperature by use of a
novel catalyst system. Formaldehyde-containing resins are widely used in the
U.S., leading to widespread emissions of formaldehyde at the product formation
molds, and in storage and use of these resins. A novel technology will be
developed to completely destroy the formaldehyde using room temperature
catalytic oxidation with a new class of noble metal reducible oxide (NMRO)
catalysts designed specifically for such compounds. This new class of catalysts
provides destruction efficiencies for the complete oxidation of formaldehyde
dramatically higher than traditional platinum VOC oxidation catalysts. This
research program will utilize catalyst composition studies to tailor a superior
catalyst for this application, reactor studies of the destruction efficacy of
the NMRO class of catalysts, and a competitive cost analysis of the technology
relative to other alternatives for formaldehyde destruction. &lt;br/&gt; The
commercial applications for the concept will be for efficient cleansing of
indoor air, cleansing of workplace air, and control of emissions at ambient
temperature and low cost, capable of rapid deployment. The commercial
applications of the research should be of value to both the private sector and
the government sector, providing cost effective commercial systems to enhance
indoor air quality and emissions controls. The program should help protect the
nation's environment and improve economic competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;
