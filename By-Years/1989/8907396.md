The work of the previous three years involving dynamic-pressure- dependent
studies of collective modes in 3He, novel schemes to excite collective modes,
sound propagation in UPt3, the development of a polarized 3He cell, sound
propagation in oxide superconductors, the installation of a new-Oxford cryostat,
and the superconducting properties of thin-film superlattices is summarized. Of
particular importance was the characterization of an acoustic anomoly in the
field dependence of the ultrasonic signal attenuation in UPt3 which may signal a
new kind of phase transition. They propose continuing studies of the collective
mode spectrum of 3He involving very short path lengths, novel excitation
schemes, nonlinear effects, and the polarized liquid. The importance of
microwave absorption studies in the dilution refrigerator region is noted and
studies of UPt3 directed at the observation of collective modes are proposed. A
top loading magnetometer alteration of our Oxford cryostat is proposed, again
with the major emphasis on UPt3.
