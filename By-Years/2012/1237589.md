This is an award to support the Space Weather Enterprise Forum (SWEF) being held
on June 5, 2012 in Washington, DC, which brings together members of government
at all levels, the private sector and academia, to raise awareness, improve
understanding, and to educate all participants on opportunities, needs and
priorities related to space weather. The forum focuses on the costs of space
weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an
emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community from 2011 to 2020. Space
weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve
society's needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable
information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and
applications to serve a broad user community.
