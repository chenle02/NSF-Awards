9600662 Schubiger Regeneration is a process necessary for survival. Some tissues
like the epidermis continuously regenerate while others, like the bone, only
after injury. Many aspects of regeneration are similar in different organisms.
For example, upon wounding in both Drosophila imaginal discs and amphibian limbs
a blastema of dividing cells is generated. Blastema cells divide rapidly and
regenerate the missing structures. There are indications that the same or
homologous gene products are involved in the regeneration process. Dr. Schubiger
already has defined the role of the protooncogene wingless in stimulating
regeneration and transdetermination. Thus, we have a molecular entry point on
regeneration. He plans to define how wingless interacts with decapentaplegic
(dpp) in inducing regeneration and transdetermination. Also a genetic screen
will be initiated that will isolate mutations whose normal gene products
interact with wingless in the regeneration process. Dr. Schubiger study
regeneration in imaginal, discs of the fly Drosophila because this system is
accessible to a molecular genetic approach. Dr. Schubiger also anticipates that
many genes that function in the regeneration process are evolutionarily
conserved.
