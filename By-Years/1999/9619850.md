This research studies robot motion planning for tasks involving rolling and
sliding contact with friction (generalized manipulatimn planning). The goal is
to derive and use new results in multi-rigid-body mechanics and mathematical
programming to develop techniques for the automatic generation of robust
feedback control strategies. These strategies will guarantee correct execution
of manipulation tasks with contact despite uncertainty in the parameters of the
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic models, and sensing errors. When correct task
execution cannot be guaranteed, the secondary goal is to specify a set of
tighter, but widest possible, bounds on the uncertain parameters and sensing
errors, which if satisfied, would guarantee correct execution. Application
domains for the expected results include industrial assembly, grasp acquisition
and dexterous manipulation, visual serving, medical assembly (e.g., hip
replacement), virtual reality, and mechanical design. To test the practicality
of the proposed approach and the validity of the underlying mathematical models,
a CAD-based, manipulation planning system will be implemented. Automatically
generated plans will be executed with real devices (i.e., an industrial robot
and a planar dexterous manipulation testbed available at Texas A&amp;M). In
addition, real problems and associated data will be provided by colleagues from
General Electric, Boeing, and the Amarillo National Resource Center for
Plutonium. The work involves a collaboration with Prof. Jong-Shi Pang, of the
Department of Mathematical Sciences at the Johns Hopkins University.
