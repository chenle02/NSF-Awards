The P.I. hypothesizes, from preliminary studies of current meter and
atmospheric records off the coast of British Columbia, that significant
correlations exist between internal wave- generated Reynolds stresses and the
mean horizontal shear of the coastal currents. Several additional data sets are
now available, and the P.I. proposes to investigate these correlations and their
significance to coastal circulation in general, and the energy balance in
coastal current systems.
