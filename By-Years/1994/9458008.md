Technical abstract: Materials and devices with very small dimensions but larger
than single atoms have recently been fabricated and studied. Novel effects have
been discovered in these so-called mesoscopic systems. In separate developments,
recent advances in the understanding of disordered systems, critical phenomena,
and non- linear dynamics have made it possible and imperative to ask deeper
questions about complexity. Our approach is to probe model complex systems such
as glasses and driven vortices in superconductors with novel mesoscopic
techniques. In this way important phenomena can be directly studied for the
first time. Non-technical abstract: Materials and devices with very small

discovered in these so-called mesoscopic systems. In separate developments,
recent advances in the understanding of such problems as turbulent flow and
neural networks have made it possible and imperative to ask deeper questions
