9218790 Fulker The purpose of this proposal is to continue Unidata's well
established role of supporting universities and to undertake a limited number of
new initiatives. The mission of the Unidata Program is to empower universities,
through innovative applications of current computing and networking technology,
to make the best use of atmospheric and related data for enhancing education and
research. To this end, the Unidata Program Center and the university community
have jointly built a nationwide computing and communications system that
provides universities with easy, cost- effective access to atmospheric data and
has transformed how the atmospheric sciences are taught on campuses across the
nation.
