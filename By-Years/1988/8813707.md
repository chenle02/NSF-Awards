The synthesis and properties of two classes of electroactive polymers will be
carried out; in both cases the synthesis and processing represent chemistry and
processing techniques that are somewhat novel. The first type of electroactive
polymer, synthesized by the oxidative coupling of 2,5-diethynylthiophenes and
containing thiophene rings connected by 1,3-diyne units, could be fabricated
into a highly oriented film because of its rod-like structure and facile
processability. This polymer should be conductive, possesses the structural
features necessary for transformation into an intrinsically conductive material,
and conversion thermally, chemically, or photochemically into unique structures
that could exhibit a variety of electroacitve properties. The second class of
polymer, containing a conjugated donor- acceptor unit designed to exhibit
efficient second harmonic generation, can be synthesized by the polymerization
of an ordered monomer assembly. This assembly is achieved by poling a non-
racemic chiral monomer (ferroelectric monomer) ia a smectic C phase and then
effecting the polymerization through radical or cationic initiation. The
synthesis of these materials should ultimately allow the fabrication of various
devices with improved electronic and computer speed and capacity.
