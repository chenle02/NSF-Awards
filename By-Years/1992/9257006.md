This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, involves the study of mixture models, including the development of
graphical diagnostics and formal tests for identifying the presence of mixing in
generalized linear models, determining the numbers of components in finite
mixture models, and the development of methods to incorporate the full
information available in case-control studies with errors in variables. The
National Science Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding
young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for
continued professional growth as a research mathematician and for significant
development as a teacher and academic leader.
