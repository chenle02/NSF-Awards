The Puget Sound Consortium for Manufacturing Excellence (CME) is a regional
education-industry partnership that is improving the connection between
manufacturing technology education, student career goals, and private sector
demand. The CME is working with its education partners to modularize
manufacturing technology curriculum based on existing, regionally focused
industry skill standards. Instruction is seamlessly combined for customization
of instruction to students and incumbent workers, and leads to a degree. CME
partner colleges and tech-prep programs are using CME modules in their
manufacturing and engineering programs. Professional development activities are
providing workshops for faculty on the design and use of the modularized
curriculum system. The CME is also assisting high schools and colleges in
promoting manufacturing career opportunities to students. Through its curriculum
and professional development services, the CME is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--
adapting and organizing already-developed instructional modules to form a
manufacturing technology curriculum that is responsive to regional industry
skill requirements;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- developing a Teaching Factory model
that develops skills by having students apply classroom instruction to real
problems in a work-like setting;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- training over 30 high
school instructors, college faculty, and other instructors on how to utilize the
modular curriculum system; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-- improving curriculum
articulation between high schools, community and technical colleges, and 4-year
colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term impact of the CME
will be more and better skilled manufacturing technology graduates, improved
technology instruction, articulation of the curriculum and enhanced coordination
among secondary and post-secondary institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt
