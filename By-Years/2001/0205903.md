AST 0205903&lt;br/&gt;Goodman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quasars and X-ray binary
stars are examples of astronomical objects that shine by converting the
gravitational energy of gas orbiting a black hole into heat and radiation. The
gas arranges itself into a flat disk centered on the black hole. Similar disks
surround young stars and form planets. Astrophysicists postulate that turbulent
friction between neighboring rings of these disks turns this orbital motion into
heat. Most believe that this turbulence arises from a magnetic instability that
has not yet been reproduced on earth except in computer simulations. The
instability requires a gas or liquid of high electrical conductivity, a
condition usually satisfied in space and in stars but not on earth. Air, water,
and other common fluids are poor conductors of electricity while ionized plasmas
created for fusion research are good conductors but too rigidly
magnetized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study astrophysical
instability and turbulence in a small laboratory experiment using an alloy of
gallium, a metal that is liquid at room temperature, less viscous than water,
more conducting than mercury, and safer to handle. This will be set into rapid
rotation between concentric cylinders in a strong magnetic field---a system
dynamically similar to an astrophysical disk. The goals are to confirm previous
computer predictions of the instability, to study its dependence on rotation,
shear, and field strength, to validate computer simulations, and perhaps to
demonstrate incipient turbulence. The results may confirm our understanding of
astrophysical disk turbulence, which cannot yet be observed
directly.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
