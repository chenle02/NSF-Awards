Knoop and Vickers indentation is analyzed to develop a test to rank the wear
resistance of brittle materials such as engineering ceramics. The indenter is
caused to slide along the surface of the specimen which causes subsurface
fractures to grow to the surface and break off, leading to material removal or
wear. The complete stress field, both elastic and inelastic, due to the diamond
pyramid indentation, is calculated. The displacement at the surface of the
specimen is matched to the shape of the indenter by numerically distributing the
elasticity Green's Function for the point force on the surface of the half
space. The inelastic strains are modeled with eigenstrains. The crack growth is
predicted using a critical stress intensity factor criterion in conjunction with
the assumption that the Mode II stress intensity factor is always zero. The test
will rank the wear resistance of ceramics, as well as predict the effect of
fundamental mechanical properties on wear resistance.
