This project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, deals with the spatial heterogeneities in materials near
their glass transition. The fluorescence of single probe molecules embedded in
the system of interest will be used for the direct characterization of the
heterogeneous environments. Three main issues will be addressed in this work: 1)
How does heterogeneity manifest itself on different length scales? 2) How is the
heterogeneity related to the fragility of the glass former? 3) Are the dynamics
in neighboring heterogeneous regions correlated? Polystyrene and glycerol will
be the principal glass-formers in which probe molecules of different sizes are
embedded. The students who participate in this research will gain valuable
experience in a contemporary area of physical chemistry that will prepare them
for further study or employment in the academic, government or industrial
sectors of the economy.
