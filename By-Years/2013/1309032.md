Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the
Universe, provide important tests of cosmology, and serve as rich astrophysical
laboratories for events such as mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
outbursts. As tracers of the evolution of structure, clusters of galaxies
represent an important cosmological tool, and this project aims to directly
measure the pressure profile in the intracluster medium of clusters to advance
our understanding of cluster physics.

This project aims to map the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) in galaxy clusters
at 90 GHz with the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) with a combination of
unprecedented mapping speed, resolution, and sky coverage. Using the MUSTANG-1.5
instrument, the investigators will image a statistically significant set of
X-ray and SZE selected sample of massive clusters in three seasons and will
observationally determine the scatter in cluster-mass/SZE observable scaling
relations due to cluster mergers, AGN feedback, and other astrophysical
processes.

Educationally, the principal investigator will also provide valuable research
experiences to undergraduate and high school students by bringing them into the
research program to assist, and even run, remote observing sessions.
