New Perspectives for Teaching Topics in Science, Technology, and Industry of
High School Level Through Teacher Enhancement and Teacher-Based Curriculum
Development is a two-year project which will bring together 46 teachers of
science, mathematics, and social studies. Participants will work together with
scientists, engineers, and historians to learn how such topics can be used
effectively within current curricula to stimulate interest in science and
technology. Examples will be used from Lowell history, which has national
significance, using museum education techniques of experiential learning. The
teacher guides, usable in high schools throughout the country, will be
distributed through the Tsongas Industrial History Center. The University of
Lowell is contributing in cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 57% of the NSF
award.
