Cognitive research indicates that science experts commonly use diagrams as
mediational tools for reasoning visually. But in science education materials and
practices, visuals are typically "aids" rather than fundamental representations.
This research will examine how students learn to comprehend, use, and construct
diagrams as thinking tools. It will focus on the diagram-dense field of
beginning optics. The project has two interacting phases: research on how
students understand static optics diagrams, and development and refinement of
prototype computer- based dynamic diagrams and diagramming tools. Specific tasks
are: (1) Pilot research, and analysis of diagrams in optics texts, (2) research
on instructional practices with these diagrams, (3) research on student
understanding and use of diagrams, (4) design and develop interactive diagrams
and a dynamic diagram-construction kit, (5) carry out research with prototypes,
and (6) formulate and disseminate implications for creation and use of
interactive diagrams in science education. Such research on visual education in
science will help guide development of new curricula and software for science
education. The project team of cognitive scientists, science educators, graphics
specialists, and systems developers is devoted to promoting learning and
reasoning in science with new data, theory, and innovative prototypes of dynamic
diagrams. These interdisciplinary activities more directly link science
education research, materials development, and classroom activities. Cost
sharing is provided by the Institute for Research on Learning which is
contributing indirect costs and APPEL which is contributing four MacIntosh II
systems.
