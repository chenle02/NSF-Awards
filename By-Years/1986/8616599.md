This research is concerned with the exploratory development of a new
experimental technique for directly measuring the dynamic tribologic
interactions in complex fluid films confined between two solid surfaces. Central
to the program is the Surface Forces Apparatus for measuring the forces between
surfaces in liquids with a distance resolution (between the surfaces) of one
Angstrom. This technique will enable fast molecular relaxation processes to be
studied for the first time. This process involves for example, various
viscoelastic, hysteric, and interfacial shear properties in very thin fluid
films and the effect of surface interactions on these properties. The fluids to
be studied will be of the polymer-surfactant type, lubricants, and mixtures of
these.
