Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0924903: Robert Rhodes, University of
Georgia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Peru award will support a workshop
focused on the recession of tropical glaciers in an era of global climate change
and the subsequent impacts on water resources such changes will have for
vulnerable segments of society. The workshop will be held in July 2009 in Lima
and Huarez, Peru, and will be co-funded by USAID as part of the NSF-USAID MOU.
Organized by Dr. Robert Rhodes of the University of Georgia in collaboration
with Dr. Jorge Recharte from the Andeans Program of the Mountain Institute in
Peru, the workshop will focus on (a) the importance of water resources
management for long-range planning and climate change adaptation, (b) how
changes could affect those aspects of life in the mountains that depend on
glaciers for sustenance, and (c) the identification of priority research,
collaboration, and pilot project initiatives. Furthermore, USAID/Peru will
provide grants for implementation of high-priority projects identified in the
workshop. Additionally, CONCYTEC, Peru?s National Science Council, will channel
results of the conference to national research policies and actions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together a diverse community of
researchers, graduate students, practioners, and policy makers from the United
States and Peru as well as Bolivia, Ecuador, France, Nepal, Netherlands, and
Pakistan. Outcomes from the workshop will lead to new insights regarding systems
that increase downstream awareness for climate change in mountain regions.
Additionally, new interdisciplinary research and field projects of interest to
NSF, USAID, and the participating countries will be an outcome of this
workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
