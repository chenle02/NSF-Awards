9623777 Richardson The theme of the proposed work is to examine the
consequences of the very large amplitude quantum motion in solid helium. The
first objective is to observe and measure the rates of exchange of 3He atoms in
three, four, and six particle rings. According to theory, the ring-like exchange
motion is responsible for the unique nuclear magnetic ordering in solid 3He. The
ring exchange motion has never been directly observed. Special nmr techniques
will have to be developed for the observation. A further objective of the work
is an attempt to see new modes of atomic motion by using Magnetic Resonance
Imaging. Several unusual and important phenomena have been predicted but have
never been observed. %%% The researchers will use nuclear magnetic resonance
techniques to study a remarkably interesting material, solid helium. Because
helium has such a very light mass, its atomic motion is quite large even near
absolute zero temperature. Modern magnetic resonance techniques will be used to
study the nature and consequences of that motion. For example, the zero
temperature state of solid helium has been predicted to have the atoms moving
rapidly in ring like rotations, rather than sitting quietly at fixed crystalline
lattice points. ***
