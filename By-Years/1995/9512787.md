9512787 Moncrief This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
research in mathematical physics between Vincent Moncrief at Yale University and
Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris VI).
The main objective of their project is to obtain new results on the global
behavior of large classes of cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations. The
investigators aim to characterize the maximal Cauchy developments of such
spacetimes by proving the analogue of global existence theorems for general
relativity. They will also study the boundary behavior of singular solutions and
classify spacetime singularities themselves in a geometrically natural way. This
research will benefit from the extensive expertise of the U.S. and French
investigators in the area of mathematical general relativity. ***
