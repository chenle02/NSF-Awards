This grant is for partial support for a two-day symposium, "Medical and
Biological Engineering: A Celebration of the Past and Challenges of the Future".
The symposium, featuring prominent engineers and scientists, is the culmination
of a two- year effort to establish a new organization (American Institute for
Medical and Biological Engineering) that will catalyze the interaction of the
currently fragmented segments of medical and biological engineering. It is
expected that the new organization will play a major role in the further
development of the rapidly growing field of bioengineering.
