The workshop will address the identification of basic and generic issues
dealing with mechanical tolerancing computer representation to permit
unambiguous communication between design, manufacturing, quality control and
inspection, and total field application. Mechanical tolerancing concerning
dimensions, features, surfaces, and all functional aspects of mechanical
components and assembly are applicable. Issues arising from mission statements
and performance specifications will be included. This workshop will advance the
state-of-knowledge by addressing critical issues regarding mathematical
representations and computer models for manufacturing automation. A workshop
report will be published.
