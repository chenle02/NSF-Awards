In this project we will study geometric structures and the structure of
representation varieties. These topics are a natural outgrowth of previous
research programs that focused on low-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds. The
areas of Kleinian groups and the geometry of 3-manifolds have seen an amazing
amount of progress over the last decade. As a result these areas are in a
position to refocus their efforts. The situation has become more like that of
surfaces where one is interested in families and spaces of structures. It is
important to try to understand the genealogy of 3-manifolds, how they are
related by various topological and geometric operations. This has led to the
study of many other types of geometric structures, such as projective and
Lorentzian structures, that don't have an invariant metric. These structures are
interesting in their own right. They also provide a context in which to view the
relation between the different eight 3-dimensional metric geometries, leading to
the concept of transitional geometry. Furthermore, there are interesting
questions about geometric structures in other dimensions, involving an array of
different Lie groups, such as hyperbolic structures in high dimensions, complex
and real projective structures on surfaces, and representations of surface
groups into higher rank Lie groups.

The idea of studying various types of metrics on spaces dates back at least to
the late 19th century and the work of Poincare, Klein, and others. Much of their
motivation came from the desire to understand physical phenomena. Modern
physics, beginning with Einstein, has led to an even greater need for
sophisticated mathematics to understand the physical universe, particularly that
coming from metric geometry. Although the physical world is not a completely
homogeneous one like the type of structures studied in this project, hyperbolic
and Lorentzian geometry are believed to represent useful models for
understanding physical phenomena. Geometry in dimension 3 is particularly
appealing because it is visually accessible to many people, including beginning
mathematics students and those with less technical backgrounds. It also has led
to the creation of a number of graphical interfaces that have been widely
utilized.
