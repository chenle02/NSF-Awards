Liquefaction-induced ground failures are a major cause of damage during
earthquakes. An important step in minimizing this damage is to identify sites
that are susceptible to liquefaction by making in situ measurements of soil
properties related to excess pore pressure development. Existing methods of site
investigation are unable to characterize a site completely because measurements
are made at discrete locations only; the spatial variability of soil properties
has to be inferred by other methods. The objective of the first phase of this
project is to develop and implement seismic geotomography to obtain a more
complete characterization of sites susceptible to liquefaction. In seismic
geotomography, a mass of soil is traversed by a large number of seismic waves to
measure the vertical and lateral variability of the initial tangent shear
modulus (a parameter used for liquefaction susceptibility evaluation). The
objective of the second phase is to apply seismic geotomography at a site in the
Charleston, South Carolina, seismic zone so as to compare geotomography with
conventional site characterization techniques, such as the standard penetration
test (SPT) and the cone penetration test (CPT). Soils susceptible to
liquefaction are known to exist in this area.
