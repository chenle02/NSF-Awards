This project will use high resolution multiple-channel (MCS) and chirp seismic
data to characterize the stratigraphy and sedimentation patterns of continental
shelf sediments off Martha?s Vineyard, Massachusetts. These sediments host an
extensive freshwater aquifer which is out of equilibrium with its environment.
The research will combine these geophysical methods with hydrological modeling
to better describe the distribution, chemistry, and the emplacement mechanisms
of this unique aquifer. From the modeling efforts quantitative predictions will
be made of the forcing mechanisms that affect groundwater flow in such aquifers
over geological time periods. Such aquifers have not received much study to date
and could potentially provide a source of water and nutrients to marine coastal
environments and thus be an important and overlooked component of the water
cycle.

Broader impacts: Freshwater aquifers as these could potentially serve as an
important resource for human consumption in coastal regions. The research will
support graduate students at each of the institutions of the three PIs.
