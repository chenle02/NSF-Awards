Symbolic representation is one method mathematicians use to deal with infinitely
many objects and infinite amounts of data. This SGER project aims to investigate
symbolic expressions in a generality not addressed by existing computer algebra
systems. For example, polynomial representations in most algebra systems permit
each term to have symbolic coefficients but not symbolic exponents. Similarly
limits in a summation or product formula are generally constrained to be
constants rather than symbolic. An objective of this proposal is the
identification, examination, and development of mathematical properties of such
abstract symbolic objects naturally occurring in research in algebra and
mathematical physics.
