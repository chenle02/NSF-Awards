This project will bring fourteen students to Utah State University for eight
weeks in the summer of 1992. Recruiting will be primarily in Utah, with a focus
on minorities and women, and in particular Native Americans. The students will
develop tools useful for the research projects through a series of lectures, and
then will work on particular research projects with Utah State faculty members.
The following research topics will be emphasized: parallel algorithms, debugging
tools for a parallel environment, optimization which combine fine grain
parallelism with course parallelism, and neural networks.
