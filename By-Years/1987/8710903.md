This award supports a two year effort to develop a membrane inlet system for
mass spectrometry and to use it in preliminary measurements of oxygen flux
during phytoplankton photosynthesis. The initial photosynthetic studies are a
novel approach to phytoplankton photosynthesis and respiration and in addition,
the membrane inlet system can be used for a variety of marine studies of
biologically active gases. These latter applications include carbon dioxide so
that a small portion of the award will be made as part of the Global Ocean Flux
Study (GOFS).
