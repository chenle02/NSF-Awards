Lee The focus of this research is on a next generation fabrication technology
for analog/digital converters and the demonstration of the integrability of the
new technology through the implementation of a high-performance analog-digital
converter. Research concentrates in two areas: l. BiCMOS Phase-locked Loop
Designs. Testing of the first silicon containing transmit and receive phase-
locked loops includes tests at 250 Mhz and a characterization of the master
slave phase-lock technique, verification of the accuracy of the SPICE simulation
and a check of injection locking. Based on the tests and evaluations, the
complete system is then designed and implemented in a second chip design. 2.
Integrated Capacitive Sensors and Circuits. Integrated capacitive pressure
sensors are being fabricated and tested. Sigma-delta oversampling techniques in
the readout are being investigated as a possible replacement for the successive
approximation readout technique currently in use.
