This project is to provide funding for sixteen faculty members from minority
and women's institutions to attend the 1992 Snowbird Conference of the Computing
Research Association, and for four individuals identified by the Computing
Research Association to participate in the 1992 Conference of the Association of
Department Heads of Computer Science and Engineering at Minority Institutions.
This is an extremely worthwhile endeavor which should establish lasting links
between the major research institutions in computer science and the group of
institutions that service a significant number of students from underrepresented
populations in computer science and engineering. It is critical that more
individuals from underrepresented populations become involved in research
activities in computer science and engineering, and this project represents a
strong effort in that direction.
