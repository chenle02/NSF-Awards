This award provides participant support for the "Chico Topology Conference", to
be held at California State University, Chico, on April 24-26, 2020. The purpose
of the conference is to bring together leading scholars, post-doctoral
researchers, and graduate students to share their research in a variety of
fields within topology. NSF funding of this activity will allow participants,
particularly early-career mathematicians and graduate students, to attend the
conference and benefit from the scientific program. This will in turn promote
the long-term viability of research networks in topology along the West Coast.

The three day conference will feature hour-long invited talks and thirty-minute
contributed talks. Rather than being a specialist conference that serves an
already established research community, the conference will promote cross-
fertilization of ideas and new professional connections between different
branches of topology. The invited speakers include experts in homotopy theory,
low-dimensional topology, and applied topology. Since the target audience is
broad in scope, the talks are intended to be accessible to a wide audience. More
details are available at the conference website
http://tmattman.yourweb.csuchico.edu/CTC.html.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
