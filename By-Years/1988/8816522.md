This award provides one-half of the funding required to purchase a
multicollector, stable isotope mass spectrometer with micro-sampling
capabilities to be installed and operated in the Department of Geology at the
University of California-Davis. The University is committed to providing the
remaining half of the funds necessary for the purchase and will house and
maintain the equipment. The new instrument will establish the first campus-wide,
multi-purpose stable isotope facility at UC-Davis where three Principal
Investigators will constitute the prime-user group with research projects on
fluid-rock interactions in submarine and subaerial hydrothermal geochemistry and
interpreting the paleoclimatic record of deep-sea core samples.
