Under previous NSF funding we conducted a novel experiment to study the
internal structure of what appears to be the central uplift region of a fossil
meteor crater near Kentland, Indiana. We request funds to analyze these data to
refine our knowledge of their structure using three tools. (1) Analysis of 8
miles of reversed and split refraction data using conventional methods to
resolve structural details around the edges of 1.5 by 2 mile rectangular study
area. (2) Application of a new technique called fan shot geotomography that can
be used to invert for lateral velocity variations on a two dimensional slice
through the earth at the depth of the refracting layer. (3) Development and
application of a new wavefield migration technique for imaging laterally
reflected head waves. With this technique we hope to image major lateral
discontinuties along a horizontal slice through the earth with a resolution
comparable to normal incidence reflection data images of subsurface layering.
The later two techniques require some additional technical development. With
further development these techniques may prove valuable for application to
future large scale investigations of lithospheric structure.
