The Department of Biology and Microbiology is incorporating the methods of
modern Molecular Biology and Biotechnology into the undergraduate Microbiology
laboratory curriculum. The improvements are providing a strong background in
classical Microbiology, as well as giving students hands-on experience with the
techniques that have revolutionized Microbiology and other Biological Sciences
in the last decade. Centrifuges, spectrophotometers, electrophoresis equipment,
and microcomputers are being used to implement major improvements in Bacterial
Genetics and Bacterial Physiology laboratories. These changes ensure that the
students receive modern instruction in the methods, principles and applications
of DNA isolation, electrophoretic separation of DNA molecules and proteins, gene
cloning techniques, DNA sequencing, and the use of computers to evaluate DNA
molecules. Tissue culturing equipment is being used to instruct Immunology
students in the fundamentals of cellular and humoral immunity and to provide
them with experience in tissue culturing.
