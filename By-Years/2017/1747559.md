This project is providing forecasting capabilities for the NSF-sponsored Western
wildfire Experiment for Cloud chemistry, Aerosol absorption and Nitrogen (WE-
CAN) field campaign. WE-CAN is a major field intensive planned for summer 2018
and includes deployment of sophisticated atmospheric chemistry instrumentation
on the NSF/NCAR C-130 to sample and systematically characterize the emissions
and first day of evolution of western U.S. wildfire plumes. Planning for this
field campaign is currently underway and forecasting capabilities are urgently
needed to ensure the success of the campaign. The WE-CAN field campaign will
provide new information about emissions from wildfires, including information on
the emissions of major toxic species in smoke plumes, the evolution of fine
particulate matter in the plume over time, and the interactions of smoke
particles with nearby clouds.

The support for WE-CAN provided by this effort includes the use of (1) the real-
time High Resolution Rapid Refresh smoke (HRRR-Smoke) modeling system, and (2)
the FxCAVE (Forecast-extended Common AWIPS Visualization Environment) virtual
client that delivers operational National Weather Service (NWS) forecast
observations and forecast models. There will be at least 4 graduate student
forecasters involved in WE-CAN.
