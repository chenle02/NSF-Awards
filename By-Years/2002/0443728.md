Upflowing ions in the aurora are investigated by use of extant radar, optical,
and satellite observations, and by analytical time-dependant modeling of
ionospheric flow continuity and energy balance. The temporal and spatial auroral
morphology associated with intense upflow events is first established by review
of Sondrestrom, EISCAT, and EISCAT Svalbard radar data along with wide-angle
optical spectral imaging. Selected events from the morphology study are
scrutinized to provide detailed state-variable quantification during auroral ion
outflow events. The state variables are then used as constraints on a time-
dependent, coupled, continuity and energy balance analytical model that
simulates ion and neutral diffusion, photochemical reaction rates, metastable
emissions, and thermal balance. The model maps three-dimensional ionospheric
affects to the ground, permitting salient comparison with ground-based
observations.
