This astronomy project will use computer models to understand how disks of gas
and dust form around very young stars. It is from these disks that planets, like
Earth and the other planets in our Solar System, are formed. There is now strong
evidence that most, if not all, stars in our Galaxy have their own system of
planets. The team at the University of Virginia will use sophisticated computer
code that they have been working with for many years to study this process. They
will include the effects of "magnetic fields" and "turbulence" in their models.
Both are thought to be important processes in space, especially in the large
clouds that we know lie between the stars. These clouds collapse under their own
weight to form stars and planets. A graduate and an undergraduate student will
be involved in this project. The investigators will produce animated movies of
disk formation for use in large introductory astronomy classes for non-science
majors and will develop activities for a mobile planetarium as part of the "Dark
Skies, Bright Kids" program, a science educational activity that targets
elementary school students in rural Albemarle County,
Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Star-forming cores are observed to be
significantly magnetized and magnetic braking has been shown to be capable of
suppressing disk formation, leading to the so-called magnetic braking
catastrophe. The goal of the proposed program is to determine whether the two
leading candidates for averting the catastrophe, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) effects and turbulence, can allow the planet-forming disks to form in the
presence of a realistic magnetic field, and whether such disks satisfy the
increasingly tight observational constraints set by recent ALMA observations.
The proposers will use and further develop a well-tested MHD code known as
ZeusTW. In the second part of the project they will use the ENZO adaptive mesh
refinement MHD code to synthesize disk formation in isolated cores and in
clusters.
