This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Johansen to initiate
independent studies aimed toward elucidating the mechanism of determination of
correct cell fate choice and subsequent cellular differentiation during
development in Drosophila. It is anticipated that this award will help Dr.
Johansen obtain the preliminary results necessary to launch an independent
research career.
