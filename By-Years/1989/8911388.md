Dynamic data storage and retrieval problems involve the representation of data
in memory in such a way as to permit certain types of modifications of the data
(updates) and question about the data (queries). The theory of data structures
is concerned with finding such representations that are efficient with respect
to various criteria, such as time per operation and memory required. On the
other hand it is important to understand the intrinsic limitations of efficiency
for any implementation. In the project, various data structure problems are
analyzed: dynamic dictionary, orthogonal range queries and union-find with the
aim of proving lower bounds on their complexities in the powerful cell-probe
model of computation. The effect of register size on complexity and the relation
between amortized and single operation complexity are being studied. Other
topics outside of data structure theory are also being investigated, including:
the power of bounded depth threshold circuits and some algorithmic problems in
distributed computing.
