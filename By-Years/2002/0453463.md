The primary goal of this NSF REU site proposal is to systematically
increase&lt;br/&gt;the graduation rate of undergraduate students and the
enrollment in graduate&lt;br/&gt;school by involving undergraduate students in
state-of-the-art Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science and Engineering research activities.
This project emphasizes the&lt;br/&gt;participation of minority students
belonging to groups with significant&lt;br/&gt;growth rates, in particular,
Hispanic students from the University of Puerto&lt;br/&gt;Rico Mayaguez,
students from USF and other minority universities in Florida,&lt;br/&gt;and
students from Latin American countries. During a 10-week summer
session,&lt;br/&gt;participating students will learn to use tools and techniques
to solve&lt;br/&gt;current research problems in Artificial Intelligence,
Robotics, Computer&lt;br/&gt;Networks, and Digital Image Processing, as well as
work on other research&lt;br/&gt;projects in collaboration with the H. Lee
Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research&lt;br/&gt;Institute, the Center for Urban
Transportation and Research, and the Center&lt;br/&gt;for Robot-Assisted Search
and Rescue. After an initial week of formal&lt;br/&gt;orientation on the topics
of research methodology, literature searching,&lt;br/&gt;research writing and
presentation skills, participating students will spend&lt;br/&gt;nine continuous
weeks with a faculty mentor working to solve a well defined&lt;br/&gt;problem in
a selected area of interest. Formal and informal interactions&lt;br/&gt;with
other students, faculty members and industry members will also
be&lt;br/&gt;included in as students work on projects and attend social
events.&lt;br/&gt;
