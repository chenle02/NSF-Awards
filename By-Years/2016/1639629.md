In computational complexity theory, the performance of an algorithm is
traditionally defined by its worst-case resource usage as the size of the input
tends to infinity. In practice, this asymptotic worst-case measure may be
inappropriate for several reasons: the worst-case performance may occur only for
contrived instances that never occur in practice; the instances occurring in
practice may have special structural features; the average-case performance of
the algorithm may be much better than its worst case; or heuristic algorithms
may empirically be observed to perform well. The workshop will focus on these
non-worst-case phenomena. It will explore probabilistic models of the input
distribution, structured classes of inputs such as planted models, and empirical
measurement of performance. The goal will be to provide tools best suited for
the practical evaluation of algorithms.

The workshop will enhance communication among the mathematics, computer science,
statistics and operations research communities. It will be open to all potential
participants, and the workshop findings (including video recordings of
presentations) will be distributed to the public for comment and engagement. The
organizers will encourage students to attend the workshop, and will actively
recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range
of applications.
