9500184 Krajewski The purchase of a ground-base drop size distribution probe, a
tipping bucket raingage, an uninterruptible power supply, and a computer for
data logging and preprocessing of collected data will be used to support
research in hydrometeorology. The equipment will be used to study the
fundamental problem of rainfall, its modeling and its forecasting. The equipment
will also advance the educational mission of the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic
Research and other units of the University of Iowa. The collected data will be
made available to researchers world- wide. ***
