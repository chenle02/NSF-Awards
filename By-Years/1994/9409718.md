Matching funds are provided for the purchase of a state-of- the-art x-ray
fluorescence spectrometer to be used in support of research in the areas of
materials and minerals at Michigan Technological University. Primary users will
be faculty and graduate students from the Department of Metallurgical and
Materials Engineering, with significant use also from the Department of
Geological Engineering, Geology and Geophysics. Research programs in the
materials area requiring the new spectrometer include studies of: structure-
property-composition relationships in intermetallics, austempered ductile irons,
and mechanically alloyed materials; macrosegregation in castings;
microstructural development in multi-component oxide systems; means of
minimizing hexavalent chromium effects in steelmaking refractories; parameters
for powder forging low alloy steels; compositional effects in grain boundary
segregation; and welding electrode wear mechanisms. Programs in geology that
would use the new instrument include studies of: volcanic ash and rock;
paleomagnetic effects in rocks and sediments; techniques of enhanced petroleum
recovery; ground water effects related to fluid flow in porous media and
remediation strategies; and the Precambrian rocks in the Lake Superior basin.
The new instrument would replace a 16- year-old spectrometer in the x-ray
analytical facility at the University. The old instrument, which has been used
heavily by a large number of users, is no longer reliable, and is inadequate for
current and future projects requiring analyses of a large number of samples with
greater precision, accuracy, and much lower detection levels.
