Equipment--an image analyzer (video camera and digitizer) and a tuneable dye
laser source--will be added to existing equipment to extend experimental
capabilities at the University of Michigan. The extended equipment will be used
in a variety of related fluid dynamic studies: coherent turbulent bursts in
boundary layers; turbulent flame structure; atomization and flame front
location.
