9317379 Foster This project is study of the deep and bottom water formation
processes of the antarctic continental shelf off Wilkes Land between 145 deg E
longitude and 160 deg E longitude. The project is to be carried out jointly with
an Australian oceanographic project. Preliminary work in 1985 has shown that
hydrographic sections in this area are quite similar to those of known deep
water formation regions in the southern Weddell Sea. This project will include
the year-long deployment of six current meter moorings, and tracer studies
(oxygen, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, stable isotopes, and nutrients) to
test whether shelf waves and tides are the principal mechanism for mixing shelf
water with the off-shore intermediate water. Two oceanographic cruises are
planned for this work: a cruise of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in February
1995, and a cruise of the Australian ship R/V Aurora Australis in February 1996.
