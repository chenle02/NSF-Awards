ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0203051&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Deepak Kapur&lt;br/&gt;U of New
Mexico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems of (i)determining whether a given
polynomial equation system has a common solution, (ii)deriving conditions on
parameters appearing n polynomial equations,such that they have a common
solution,as well as (iii)developing an e .cient representation of common
solutions are of fundamental significance. These problems arise in numerous
applications:engineering and design, robotics, universe kinematics,
manufacturing, design and analysis of nano devices in nanotechnology, image
understanding, graphics,solid modeling,implicitization,CAD-CAM design,geometric
construction,design,and control theory. Multivariate resultants and related
elimination methods have been found useful for addressing these problems. The
resultant of a polynomial equation system gives the necessary and su .cient
condition on its&lt;br/&gt;parameters for a common solution to exist. When there
are parameters in a polynomial system,numerical techniques often do not apply.
Investigations of efficient elimination methods are also of considerable
importance in algebraic geometry,polynomial ideal theory and other related
aspects of computational algebra and symbolic
computation.&lt;br/&gt;Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the
generalized Dixon formulation developed by Kapur,Saxena and Yang,based on
Bezout-Cayley-Dixon methods and efficient elimination/resultant method. A
particularly attractive feature of the generalized Dixon formulation is that t s
problem-adaptive since timplicitly exploits the sparse structure of the
associated polynomial system as well as its non-genericity.&lt;br/&gt;
