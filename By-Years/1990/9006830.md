Crassulacean Acid Metabolism is an intriguing photosynthetic pathway that
interacts with a number of environmental factors including water stress. The
general objective of this proposal is to understand the compartmentation and
regulation of mitochondrial malic acid metabolism in succulent plants with
Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM). Specifically, regulation of malic acid
metabolism in mitochondria during acidification and deacidification will be
examined using in vivo tracer flux analysis and in vitro studies of
mitochondrial metabolism. On-line methods for monitoring 18O fractionation will
be developed to determine the importance of the alternative respiration pathway
for malate fluxes during the CAM process. This research will improve
understanding of the physiological regulation of CAM metabolism, a biochemical
pathway that apparently helps certain plant species respond to environmental
stress. The results will also be applicable to other physiological processes in
which malic acid plays a key role such as generation of osmotic pressure during
stomatal opening and ionic balance during nutrient uptake and incorporation.
Finally this research will develop direct measurements of alternative pathway
respiration, a key physiological response thought to provide plants with
flexibility in the face of environmental fluctuation.
