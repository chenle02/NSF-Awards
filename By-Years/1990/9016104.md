The understanding of the transport phenomena associated with the melting of
packed particulate beds is critical to our ability to predict processes which
occur during severe nuclear power plant accidents, or for the containment of
radioactive wastes through in situ vitrification, and for a wide range of
materials processing techniques which depend on powders as a raw material. This
program, the first indepth study of heat and mass transfer during melting of
packed particulate beds, involves both experimental and numerical research. The
objective is to determine the transport properties for melting packed beds
essential to modelling the melting process. These properties include effective
thermal conductivity, capillary pressure, and relative permeability. In
addition, the shape of melting particles is critical to modelling the
densification which occurs during melting. The results of this research will
enable the melting process to be accurately modelled. This will allow the
process to be designed to achieve desired objectives in a wide range of
applications ranging from vitrification of hazardous wastes to the production of
new materials.
