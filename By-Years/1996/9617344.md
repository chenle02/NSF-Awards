9617344 Twisdale The project will use failure data collected on occasion of
Hurricane Bertha making land fall in North Carolina on July 1996, using an
unbiased sample of structures affected within the designed wind speed region of
the storm for testing structures with an integrated building performance
prediction method. In the project a numerical windfield model of validated and
re-created storm windfield data will be integrated with wind tunnel test data to
predict loads on building components and on cladding components resistance
models. The result will be an end-to-end model for evaluating structure cladding
performance. The importance of these results are reflected in the fact that
cladding loss of integrity results in wind and water penetration which in turn
produce the damage of building contents and great total economic losses. ***
