This award provides funding for six one-day meetings of the Illinois/Missouri
Applied Harmonic Analysis Seminar during the calendar years 2008-2010. Each
meeting will consist of five 45-minute research presentations, followed by an
open problem forum. The meetings will disseminate new results, spread knowledge
of important unsolved problems, and stimulate new collaborations, some of which
will cross the disciplinary divide that separates mathematics from engineering.

The meetings are intended to furnish a catalyst for the creation of an
interdisciplinary regional network in applied harmonic analysis, a network that
links senior scientists, junior scientists, and graduate students and that
encourages participation by women and members of underrepresented minorities.
The meetings should also serve to enhance the visibility on the national scene
of this regional activity and to give young researchers a broad perspective on
the field.
