Calcium is recognized as a major intracellular modulator of metabolic functions
in all cells and important in developmental and repair processes of neuronal
cells. A major requirement for investigation of the role of calcium in these
situations is the ability to monitor changes in intracellular calcium over the
several days to weeks required for the repair and growth process. This project
is designed to develop the methods to optically record calcium fluorescence for
periods of up to 2 weeks, simultaneously monitoring cellular electrical
properties. These studies will be followed up with ultrastructural studies to
determine the intactness of the cell flowing long term fluorescent dye treatment
and electrophysiological studies. This project has the potential for opening new
methods for direct monitoring of long term processes in cells and can be
immediately used as probes for various processes are developed.
