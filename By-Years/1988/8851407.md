An automated soil testing machine and an associated stereo- photogrammetric
device for instructional use in the undergraduate level soil mechanics, soil
mechanics laboratory, geotechnical engineering, and design of earth structures
courses will be developed. Specific experiments designed for the use of
equipment include triaxial test, consolidation test, model footing
investigation, and soil-inclusion interaction study. It is believed that this
micro- computer-controlled soil testing machine with accompanied stereo-
photogrammetric capability would provide at least two major improvements over
existing equipment: (1) exposing students to the up-to-date electronic control
and sensing techniques applicable to geotechnical engineering, and (2) enhancing
students' appreciation of the importance of deformation evolutions for a
foundation-related problem.
