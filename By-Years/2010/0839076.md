&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, the PI will provide a primary data set
for magmatic water contents for Costa Rican volcanoes. Existing models for the
Central American arc call for greater extents of water recycled to Nicaraguan
than Costa Rican volcanoes. In this project the PIs will measure volatile
concentrations (H2O, CO2, S, Cl, F) in olivine-hosted melt inclusions, by ion
and electron probe. Another focus, partly driven by the lack of abundant olivine
in Costa Rican tephra, will be the development of new techniques, one a
hygrometer based on the rare earth element pattern recorded in clinopyroxenes,
and the other based on the H2O concentration in clinopyroxenes. The PIs propose
to provide a comprehensive dataset for water contents along the Costa Rica-
Nicaragua arc sector, including approx. 20 arc volcanoes. This will enable
rigorous testing against the existing geochemical gradients, as well as results
of seismic imaging and the development of interpretations of the
data.&lt;br/&gt;The study involves a female graduate student and involves a data
set of interest to a broad community of MARGINS workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
