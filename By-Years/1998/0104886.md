A diverse group of mormyrid fishes has recently been discovered in Gabon. These
fishes produce weak electric pulses to communicate with one another. Past
studies indicate that they can detect differences between pulse waveforms and
use this information for same-species recognition. Each species emits a distinct
electric signature, with one notable exception. Two signal forms ("normal
polarity" and "reversed polarity") are produced by co-occurring individuals that
cannot be distinguished by sex, shape, or preliminary comparisons at five
genetic markers. These forms may be alternate morphs within a single
interbreeding species or two nascent species caught in the process of
divergence. These alternatives will be investigated by (1) playing back signals
to breeding fishes and observing their preferences during two field trips to
Africa and (2) surveying hundreds of genetic regions for differences using the
new Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism technique.

If the evidence supports reproductive isolation between forms, the fact that
they cannot be distinguished by external measurements or preliminary genetic
data would indicate species formation to be extremely recent or still in
progress. Such cases are difficult to find in nature. They yield important
insights into the conditions that give rise to new species. A lack of
reproductive isolation between forms, on the other hand, would demand a re-
thinking of the importance of electric signals as mating barriers for all
members of this group. The results of this project will also be significant to
neurobiologists studying electrosensory coding in mormyrid fishes -- a field
that has contributed to work on other time-coding sensory systems such as
hearing.
