- An Integrated Approach Biology majors are required to complete a course in the
area of molecular/cellular biology. The Cell Biology course meets these
requirements. Currently, the laboratory portion of this course is taught in
small groups in a research lab utilizing limited equipment. A Cell Biology
Teaching Lab has been identified; the purpose of this proposal is to remedy the
equipment limitations. A thematic approach to studying cellular processes at the
whole cell, organelle, & molecular levels is proposed. At the whole cell level
students learn tissue culture techniques and localize organelles and proteins
in-situ. Studies at the organelle level include isolation and identification of
mitochondria. Isolation and characterization of mt DNA and proteins demonstrates
analysis at the molecular level. Experiences in manipulating cellular responses
and computer-assisted learning are planned. The equipment requested will allow
20-24 students to participate in these activities. This theme based, integrated
lab experience is a departure from the traditional single-exercise approach. An
added dimension is allowing students to develop tissue culture techniques, an
increasingly important exposure in this age of animal rights concerns. This
integrated approach will be reported in the literature as a major contribution
to the field of cell biology laboratory instruction.
