This travel award supports the participation of junior and senior US researchers
in the program “New statistical physics in living matter: non equilibrium states
under adaptive control” that takes place July-December 2023 at the Isaac Newton
Institute for Mathematical Sciences of the University of Cambridge, UK. The
program will initiate discussions among a wide range of researchers about the
fundamental physics and mathematical modeling of biological systems, with a
focus on active, far-from-equilibrium properties and the consequences of these
for adaptive control. The interdisciplinary nature of the research can impact a
variety of fields from materials science and engineering, physics, applied
mathematics, biology to medicine. About one third of the more than 100
participants will be from US institutions, including 10-15 junior researchers.
The program includes four week-long workshops, consisting of typically 24
invited and 15-20 contributed talks that emphasize representation of younger
scientists and underrepresented groups.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
