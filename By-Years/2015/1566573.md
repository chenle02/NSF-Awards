The organizers aim to promote significant US participation in the Conference on
Geometric Functional Analysis, to be held May 16-20th, 2016, at the University
of Alberta, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The conference will be among the
largest of its kind in recent years, surveying the state of the art on modern
geometric functional analysis and its applications. The plenary talks include a
number of previous invited speakers to the International Congress of
Mathematicians. Emphasis will be placed on promoting interaction between early-
stage researchers and leading experts, contributing to future research
opportunities. Early-stage researchers from across the US will be able to
showcase their work through talks and a poster
session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric functional analysis is concerned with
geometric and linear properties of finite dimensional spaces, studying their
characteristic behavior when the dimension, or a number of other relevant free
parameters, grows to infinity. Since high dimensional systems appear naturally
and play an essential role in mathematics and applied sciences, the techniques
from the field are of broad interest. In the last decade, geometric functional
analysis has had a significant impact on a variety of fields including the
geometry of convex sets, random matrix theory, quantitative metric geometry,
probability and applied fields such as compressed sensing. The aim is to
communicate new techniques that merge tools from the latter fields to the
broadest of audiences. Participants will have the opportunity to hear about the
latest developments and the landscape of future research directly from the main
contributors. Further information is available at
