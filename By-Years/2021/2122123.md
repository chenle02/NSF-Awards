This project assembles a working group of scientists to study the prehistory and
early history of the development of wealth inequality. The key measure of wealth
inequality to be examined is differences in house sizes at any single moment in
time, since wealthier households tend to live in larger houses in many different
societies. The team will first assemble these data for as many regions as
possible. Then, house-size differences will be compared with information on
other social and cultural trends in these societies over time (for example,
changing political organization, violence, and population size), in regions
where these are known, to understand how changes in these domains affect wealth
inequality (and vice versa). The researchers will also examine the relationship
between house size and wealth in contemporary societies to better understand how
patterns in the archaeological record potentially connect to the dynamics of
inequality in the present. The research is coordinated by the Coalition for
Archaeological Synthesis and administered by the University of Coloradoâ€™s Center
for Collaborative Synthesis in Archaeology. The dataset assembled by this team
will be made available to other researchers through the Digital Archaeological
Record at the close of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is generally
believed that wealth differences that are too extreme may degrade social
cohesion due to declining social mobility, reduced aggregate demand, and
associated psychological impacts. On the other hand, it is also sometimes
claimed that some level of wealth differentiation is necessary to stimulate
innovation leading to aggregate prosperity. This research provides an
opportunity to examine such generalizations over very long spans of time using a
very broad geographic lens. Drawing on previous research, the degree of
difference in house sizes will be measured using the same indices (such as the
Gini coefficient) used by economists to characterize differences in wealth or
income in societies today. Changes through time in these measures can be readily
correlated with changes in other social indicators to assess the circumstances
leading to high, or low, wealth differentiation in the past. The results of this
project can help inform the debate on perceived high levels of wealth inequality
in many societies today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
