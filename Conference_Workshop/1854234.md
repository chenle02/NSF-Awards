This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the thirty-first and thirty-
second international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic
Combinatorics (FPSAC), held at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia on July
1-5, 2019 and Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel on July 13-17, 2020. The
most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world,
FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely
with top mathematicians from many countries. Each conference, which includes
nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty
posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.

A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to
recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary
speaker is an "emerging star," and talented young researchers are well
represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special
feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The
conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups.
Furthermore, English and French have been designated as official languages for
FPSAC 2019 and 2020 to promote a diverse pool of participants. Attendance at
this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior
researchers. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in
combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry,
commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry,
and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
