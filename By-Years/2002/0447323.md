EAR-0447323&lt;br/&gt;Druffel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is
the development of a preparative capillary gas chromatograph (PCGC) that can be
used to separate individual organic compounds from environmental samples. We
will develop techniques to measure the radiocarbon (14C) in very small amounts
(&lt;4 micrograms carbon) of these compounds using accelerator mass spectrometry
(AMS). We will use an existing AMS that is operable for measuring small samples
(15 micrograms carbon). Funds from this grant will be used for the PCGC and high
vacuum lines, and to support a full-time postdoctoral researcher and part-time
technician. The cycling of organic matter in soils, rivers and oceans remains a
major uncertainty in the global carbon cycle. Measurement of the 14C in
individual organic compounds is an essential tool to study the sources,
preservation and cycling of carbon in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine organic
matter. The graduate students involved in this project will obtain a strong
background in organic biogeochemistry, as well as earth system science. It is
anticipated that the techniques that we develop will become widely used
throughout the environmental ecology and biogeochemical
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
