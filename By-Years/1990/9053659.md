The project provides a fresh approach to the design and quality issues which
relate to U.S. competitiveness. The approach involves adding a new introductory
course to the undergraduate curriculum which teaches that quality must start at
the initial design level. This course is multidisciplinary, transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries, and unifies and focuses all aspects of
design on high quality and low cost. Such a course imparts the key role of
"Quality Through Design" at the freshman level and serves as a unified
foundation for further undergraduate and graduate studies.
