The goal of this proposal is to develop a model of turbulent fluctuations and
transport in the magnetopause current layer. It continues work on the
microphysics of the magnetopause by applying the investigator's model for the
current convective instability to the magnetopause and to use the results to
explore some of the macroscopic consequences. In particular, a fundamental goal
is to obtain anomalous transport coefficients for the current diffusion which
can then be incorporated in global MHD codes. The theoretical work proposed here
is fundamental to developing an understanding of magnetic reconnection and
anomalous transport at the magnetopause, which are thought to be key mechanisms
for the transport of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere.
