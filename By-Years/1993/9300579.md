There will be a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Cornell. Every effort is to be made to
include women and underrepresented minorities at a proportion that reflects
their numbers in society. Under-represented minorities will be energetically
recruited through the NSF-funded Engineering Synthesis Coalition. The summer
program will start with a two-week training period, in which the students will
learn basic machine shop skills, some computer skills, and basic electronic
circuit construction skills. The students will then work with their individual
advisor, meeting at least weekly. The summer program will also include weekly
REU meetings, tours of Cornell labs and of local companies, and some social
activities. Every student will write a final report and all students will give a
short final oral presentation. Participation in the REU program is likely to
increase the chance that students will pursue graduate studies.
