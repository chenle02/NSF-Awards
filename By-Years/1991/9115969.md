The optimum demodulator for spread-spectrum multiple access systems is known to
be extremely complex and not practical for implementation except for a very
limited number of users. Several suboptimum receivers have been found to achieve
near optimal performance (in the absence of coding) with much reduced
complexity. In addition, it is known that for spread-spectrum systems coding can
significantly improve the performance in a jamming and multiple-access
environment. This project is an investigation of the performance of coded
spread-spectrum multiple-access systems with various types of near optimal, but
reduced complexity, decoders and demodulators. The aim is to design reduced
complexity decoders and demodulators that achieve a favorable tradeoff in
complexity and performance.
