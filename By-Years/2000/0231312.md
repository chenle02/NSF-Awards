This project provides the national educational community with an Antenna Toolbox
that is used with the MATLAB package to illustrate complex phenomena related to
the design of antennas, and with the physical features, the propagation
characteristics of electromagnetic fields, and the important aspects of the
physical layer for a wireless communication system. The educational material
being developed is unique in that it provides full-wave electromagnetic
solutions using a computing platform, MATLAB, which is the only universal
computational language understood by the majority of electrical engineering
students worldwide. Other computational educational materials provide software
written in Fortran, and hence are not readily accessible to undergraduate
students. Other available MATLAB-based software for antenna analysis and design
utilize approximations and hence, they do not include all the physics associated
with a particular design. This MATLAB ANTENNA TOOLBOX represents a unique and
valuable contribution to the educational cornucopia that is available to faculty
who teach at the undergraduate student level. Furthermore, this toolbox is to be
used in a complementary fashion with other analysis tool and codes that the
students are familiar with. Therefore, by casting the difficult subject of
antenna design and analysis in a familiar form (e.g. a MATLAB Toolbox) and to
utilize the full capabilities of MATLAB to integrate graphical user interface,
efficient computation, and graphical output, it is expected that the faculty
will better respond to the different learning styles of all students taking
antenna design and analysis courses. Hence, student retention in these courses
should be better.
