SGER: Advances in Difficult Aspects of Reference Resolution&lt;br/&gt;This
exploratory project is investigating two difficult phenomena in the domain of
reference resolution: (1) the resolution of plural pronouns that can corefer
either with a single syntactic constituent or with a set of constituents from
different places in the text: they, those two, all three, etc. and (2) the
resolution of 3rd person singular and demonstrative pronouns that can corefer
either with a single syntactic constituent or with a span of text: it, that,
this, all of this, etc. These phenomena have been treated in limited ways to
date because the methods that have been most widely deployed for reference
resolution have expected the antecedent for referring expressions to be a single
noun phrase in the preceding context. In the cases under study, the antecedent
need not be constrained in this way. This work is aimed at achieving human-like
intelligence to support, for example, sophisticated communication between
intelligent agents and people. It is theoretically grounded but keeps practical
concerns at the fore. The component algorithms can inform reference resolution
in any domain by any system in the relatively near term, advancing known types
of technology and not relying on any unexpected breakthroughs. Among the
resources to be distributed to the community are system-independent reference
resolution algorithms, a corpus of relevant examples and their semantic
representations, a reference resolution engine, and a critical survey of
accomplishments, outstanding issues, and paths for further
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
