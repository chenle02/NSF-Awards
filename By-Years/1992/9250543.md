The Departments of Chemistry and Geology are upgrading their respective
curricula in the areas of x-ray diffractometry and spectrometry by adding a
computerized control and data analysis system to their x-ray diffractometer, and
by replacing an obsolete ball mill used to prepare geological materials for
quantitative analysis using an x-ray spectrometer. Students and faculty have the
capability of: collecting and storing x-ray diffraction patterns digitally as
computer files where the data can be easily accessed, processed, and analyzed;
doing phase analysis of polycrystalline materials using an up-to-date version of
the JCPDS powder diffraction file (on electronic media) and computerized
search/match software; quantitatively determining the percentages of different
phases in multiphase, crystalline materials; and preparing geological materials
for quantitative chemical analysis with a quiet, non-contaminating pulverizing
system. Students are being provided with valuable experience in the use of
computer-controlled instrumentation for data collection and analysis.
