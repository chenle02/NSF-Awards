This is a Research Initiation Award (RIA). The research aims at resolving long-
standing problems with the use of speech-act theory in computational systems for
natural language understanding and to provide methods of interpreting
unconstrained discourse. The integration of verbal and non- verbal speech acts
are still very poorly understood and is critical for human-computer
interactions. This research seeks to integrate many modalities with the study of
speech acts, an important conceptual framework in speech and dialog processes.
The goals are: (1) to determine how the theory of meta-acts can be extended and
refined to model negotiations of reference and confirmation of mutuality of
knowledge, and (2) to determine if meta-act models can be validated
predictively. Meta-knowledge models include information about conversations that
are non- verbal, such as turn-taking. The project derives meta-acts as a
rational strategy of action, given attributions of the participants' beliefs,
goals and expectations at the point in the dialogue in which the acts actually
occur. The acts are then expressed in a rule-based simulation of similar
conversations. A byproduct of the research is a database of analyzed and
transcribed data useful for other researchers. It is expected that there will be
substantial impact in human-computer interactions research and aspects of
research in speech and natural language processing.
