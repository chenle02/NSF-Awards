This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award will support the collaboration of
Ignacio Grossmann of Carnegie Mellon University and Jaime Cerda of the
Universidad Nacional del Litoral (UNL), Argentina. The project aims to develop
new algorithmic methodologies for production planning and scheduling of
multipurpose batch plants producing simultaneously products of low to medium
demand. A goal of these methodologies will be to satisfy product demands on
time, but also minimize idle times and product inventories. Another objective
will be to develop realistic models that account for assignments of groups of
consecutive tasks to a single equipment item, simultaneous production of
intermediate and finished products, multiple processing paths, and
setup/changeover times. To develop effective solution methods, models will be
investigated that do not rely on discretization of the time domain, and that can
be enhanced with fast heuristic techniques. The proposed techniques will be
implemented within an expert system shell that can provide for better insights
and understanding by the user. This project is expected to produce benefits to
both sides that will complement existing research in optimization and batch
processing at Carnegie Mellon and UNL.
