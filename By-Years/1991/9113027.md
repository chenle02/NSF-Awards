Desalination of ocean water is a major way to provide fresh water to communities
along coastal and arid regions. Desalination plants existing in these areas are
typically either multi-stage flash evaporators or reverse osmosis operations.
While both methods have advantages, there are also disadvantages that affect
their efficiency. The use of a high frequency electric field for heating of salt
water to accelerate evaporation would eliminate some of the disadvantages of the
distillation methods of desalination. This method would reduce corrosion which
is a major problem in the flash evaporators. Furthermore, this will allow for a
rapid on-off operation of the system which would give better utilization of
electric facilities. In this project, the evaporation kinematics of streamlets
of brine under the influence of 100mHz electric fields is being studied. If the
high frequency field significantly lowers the barrier to evaporation in the
brine, this project may introduce a wholly new technology in the area of
desalinating water for agriculture and human consumption.
