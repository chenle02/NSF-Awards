This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in
analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. For three summers
beginning in 1992, nine undergraduate students will spend ten weeks engaged in
basic research in chemistry under the direction of various faculty members from
the chemistry department. The REU activities include unique features such as a
joint effort with the scientific staff at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
and a concerted effort to reach out to minority and Appalachian students. The
REU program will run in conjunction with existing programs that bring nearly 100
visiting undergraduate science majors and faculty to the University of Tennessee
at Knoxville (UTK). The large scope of these programs, the extensive resources
of UTK and ORNL, and the considerable previous experience of UTK in
undergraduate training are essential ingredients for the success of this
program.
