9720652 Draayer The objectives of Louisiana EPSCoR are to become: (1) more
competitive in gaining national research and development (R&amp;D) support, (2)
more actively engaged in science and technology (S&amp;T) transfer activities
with business and industry, and (3) more effective in educating larger numbers
of S&amp;E students, especially minorities, at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels. The cornerstone of the State's plan is the Louisiana Education
Quality Support Fund. Combining Support Fund money with EPSCoR support, the
Louisiana Board of Regents (BoR) co-sponsors statewide programs with federal
agencies that focus on stimulating systemic and sustainable S&amp;T
improvements, facilitating collaboration and sharing of resources, and on
improving student teaching and opportunities. Targeted are R&amp;D areas that
help develop and strengthen the economy of both the State and Nation. A major
objective will be expansion and strengthening of an innovative program that
received a 10-year BoR commitment: the Joint Faculty Appointments Program
(JFAP). The JFAP establishments nationally competitive S&amp;E research teams
between the state's Historically Black (HB) and Majority White (MW) Colleges and
Universities (CUs). Six additional JFAP/Research Excellence (RE) teams and two
annual JFAP/Science Education (SE) awards for educational enhancement activities
will be initiated. In addition, to bring researchers from different campuses
together to focus on issues of common S&amp;E interest, a "Planning Grants for
Major Initiatives" program will award annually two $60K grants to build
constituencies and prepare NSF major initiative proposals. Another form of
collaboration - researchers and industry - is scheduled for significant
expansion, with plans to assess and alleviate barriers to the state's
commercialization process, review university commercialization policies and
develop a statewide commercialization plan and higher education S&amp;E
commercialization curriculum. Collaborativ e efforts will be strengthened by
placing existing or planned statewide communication avenues at the disposal of
faculty and students. These include: (1) an Audio/ Video Research Network, soon
to be at 13 sites; (2) an ATM Internet Backbone; (3) a Faculty Expertise
Database, ultimately to include a listing of Louisiana's major research
facilities and instruments; and (4) an Electronic Research Administration
project to automate grant and contract administration activities.
