The purpose of this project is to offer a two-week workshop on Teaching Physics
Using Interactive Digitized Video. The workshop: (1) fosters a discussion and
formulation of new strategies for the teaching of physics using the capabilities
of interactive digitized video technology; (2) enables 30 physics professors to
become skilled in the use of interactive digitized video for the teaching
physics courses for undergraduates; (3) helps physicists develop lessons that
change the present physics content using the existing interactive digitized
video software and hardware; (4) prepares them to lead local, regional, and
national workshops on new science content using interactive digitized video
technologies; and (5) makes the new interactive, digital video physics lessons
developed by the workshop participants available to physics educators throughout
the country.
