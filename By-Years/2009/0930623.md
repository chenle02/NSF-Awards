This Small business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to develop silicon-
germanium based quantum dot materials that operate over a wide range of optical
wavelengths by virtue of their composition and size distribution. This
innovative material will allow the development of broadly absorbing solar cells
on silicon with a single junction technology or the development of highly
efficient broadband photo-detectors for telecommunications applications.

Successful commercialization for this materials technology would improve
performance in the areas of high speed telecommunications, and photovoltaic
devices for energy conversion. Broadband detector technology for
telecommunications could be a very large market since this material would allow
for one detection technology to efficiently cover many wavelengths, as well as
being integratable with existing silicon IC technology. For use in the
photovoltaic industry, the development of a highly efficient visible to near-IR
absorbing materials technology would be significant since costs can be lowered.
