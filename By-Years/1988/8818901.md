The major objectives of the proposed research are to continue basic
investigations into the mechanism of phagocytosis using Amoeba proteus as a
model cell system, and in the context of an undergraduate institution, to expose
undergraduate students to a realistic research experience. Phagocytosis is a
fundamental cellular process which involves the uptake of particulate material
through surface membrane infolding and vesiculaton. In the initial three years
of NSF support for this project it was demonstrated that chemotactic peptides
can induce phagocytosis in the amoeba. A more detailed analysis of this process
is now proposed. Stimulation of phagocytosis involves calcium movements and
possibly components of the arachidonic acid cascade, perhaps in a signal
coupling role. The events associated with signal coupling during phagocytosis
will now be analyzed. Initial association of the signal with the cell surface
will be measured by following the binding of tritiated peptides to the amoeba
surface. In order to establish the mechanisms by which surface information is
transmitted to the cell interior, the role of G proteins, diacylglycerol,
inositol trisphosphate, calcium, and arachidonic acid metabolites in signal
transmission will be investigated. The amoeba is a particularly useful model
system for the study of endocytosis, and the results of this study should
increase our insight into the mechanism of phagocytosis in this and other cells.
This study will also contribute to basic understanding of cellular signal
transduction mechanisms in general.
