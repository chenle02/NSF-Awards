A joint experimental/theoretical program is undertaken in order to study a new
class of microcavity resonators having whispering gallery resonances. The
Q-values of these asymmetric cavities can be controlled at will and allow
fundamental studies of quantum/wave chaos to be performed as well as having the
potential to impact the development of optical communications networks.
