The investigators will use the CHARA Interferometer to observe and analyze the
inner regions of planet-forming disks around Young Stellar Objects. Their work
will test models of accreting protoplanets, stellar surfaces, spectral
variability of Young Stellar Objects, and non-axis protoplanetary disk
symmetries. As part of the analysis, they will develop critical imaging software
using Compressed Sensing Theory for image reconstruction and analysis of the
data. The work has significant broader impacts in that the algorithms used for
image reconstruction will be publicly available and also applicable to
astronomical interferometric data obtained with other instruments, including
those working at other wavelength regimes (such as radio), and may be used by
many astronomers in the community.
