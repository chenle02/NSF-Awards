The Science Education for Public Understanding Program (SEPUP) will develop,
field test nationally and publish two one-year courses: a more concrete course
for middle school and a course emphasizing global issues for high school. The
courses will stress issues-oriented science and the use of scientific evidence
and risk-benefit analysis in making decisions. These courses will continue the
emphasis of the Chemical Education for Public Understanding Program (CEPUP) on
societal issues involving the use of chemicals and expand the scope of the
program by dealing with other issues in life, earth and physical sciences and in
technology. Eight new modules will cover many of the large themes of science
proposed in Project 2061 along with issue-oriented themes such as evidence-based
decision-making, uncertainty and controversy, science and social systems. Course
materials will stress students as active participants in doing science with the
goal of developing independent thinkers able to make evidence-based decisions
about issues in science and technology. Materials will include a teacher's
resource book, a student text, projects and extension activities, kits
videotapes and software. Assessment of student learning is built into the
materials.
