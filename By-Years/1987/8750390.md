This project seeks to expand the scope of archaeological field and laboratory
activities through the acquisition of key pieces of equipment. The goal of the
proposal is twofold. The first is to enable students to work more efficiently
both in the field (e.g., through magnetometer-based subsurface survey) and in
the laboratory (e.g., through the application of a database management system).
The second is to expand the range of analysis and data presentation in student
research through the use of more sophisticated equipment (e.g., transit mapping,
high power microscopy, and photographic recording).
