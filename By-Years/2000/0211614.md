Li&lt;br/&gt;0211614&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to develop
mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;regarding biodiversity in the context of resource
competition.&lt;br/&gt;Recent numerical work suggests that competition for
multiple&lt;br/&gt;resources can generate periodic oscillations or even
chaotic&lt;br/&gt;oscillations, and a large number of species can coexist on
very&lt;br/&gt;few limiting resources. However, both mathematicians
and&lt;br/&gt;ecologists still lack analytic understanding of mechanisms
that&lt;br/&gt;generate diversity in ecological communities. The
investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies several resource competition models, including
standard&lt;br/&gt;competition models with multiple resources and competition
models&lt;br/&gt;within food webs; he gives rigorous analysis for the models
and&lt;br/&gt;provides insight into diversity of competing species. Theory
of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and theory of dynamical systems are
used&lt;br/&gt;to determine the long-term behavior of solutions of the models
in&lt;br/&gt;the form of attracting steady states, limiting cycles or
strange&lt;br/&gt;attractors. Important issues are what causes competing species
to&lt;br/&gt;coexist, and locating parameter ranges in which
coexistence&lt;br/&gt;occurs.&lt;br/&gt; The question of the maintenance of
species diversity in&lt;br/&gt;natural systems has intrigued mathematicians and
ecologists for a&lt;br/&gt;very long time. This work provides a general
understanding of&lt;br/&gt;factors affecting abundance and biodiversity. The
results have&lt;br/&gt;important implications for determining the patterns of
species&lt;br/&gt;composition in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and for
managing&lt;br/&gt;natural resources such as forests and lakes.&lt;br/&gt;
