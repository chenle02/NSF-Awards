This project examines three pathways to becoming urban in an expanding city:
being born in the city, migrating from a rural area to the city, and living in a
formerly rural area that is swallowed up by the expanding borders of the city.
The emphasis is on those who did not migrate but become urban through city
expansion as they have been the least studied to date. The questions
investigated concern how people understand local belonging, which people and
what places are viewed as truly urban and local, who is viewed as part of an in-
group or out-group, and who is deemed worthy of local citizenship rights and
shared public spaces. Findings will be useful to policy makers and other
concerned parties seeking to more effectively promote social inclusion in
rapidly transforming cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection for this
project consists of fieldwork in a large and rapidly growing city. Spatial
methods such as mental mapping exercises and city walks complement approximately
140 interviews: 40 interviews with each of the three kinds of city residents and
20 interviews with urban planning experts, drawn from different parts of the
city. The interviews investigate how residents subjectively define the spatial
and sociocultural boundaries that distinguish the urban and non-urban, the local
and non-local, and the deserving and undeserving in their minds. Findings will
yield a clearer picture of whether and why a sense of belonging or alienation
persists among different types of city residents and how different kinds of city
residents view the claims of others to citizenship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
