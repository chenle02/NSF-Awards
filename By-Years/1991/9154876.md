The Indiana State University will initiate a three-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Life Science for 24 students entering grades 11 and 12. The
theme of this project is "Our Nutritional Environment." Each participant will
select a problem, conduct a literature survey, develop an experimental design,
collect and analyze data, prepare a scientific manuscript, and give an oral
presentation of the research. The philosophical and sociological implications of
science in general and this type of research in specific will be presented as
continuous and interwoven components of the project. Guest lecturers, research
scientists and faculty will introduce the students to a wide variety of careers
in biology.
