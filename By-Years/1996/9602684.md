This award will be used to partially support the renovation of research and
research training laboratories in the Eric Johnston Science Center on the campus
of Whitworth College. Constructed in 1966 and never renovated, the building
houses the departments of Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Primarily configured
as a classroom facility, the science center can no longer support current or
future research programs due to the poor design of and the limited amount of
adequate space. In view of this, the College has embarked upon a long range plan
that encompasses the construction of a new addition to the existing structure in
conjunction to renovating the building. ARI funds will be used to renovate space
currently used for research and research training activities in Johnston.
Renovations will consist of: reconfiguring space, upgrading HVAC, plumbing, and
electrical systems, and installing new fume hoods, casework and safety systems.
The project will aid biology faculty and their students as they investigate
problems in the areas of cell and molecular biology, freshwater microbial
biology, plant genetics and plant ecology. Improvements to chemical research
space will allow faculty to conduct research in organic, physical and
biochemistry in a safer environment. Renovating physics laboratory space will
not only provide dedicated space for research investigations, but will also
provide space for two student projects: night airglow and postural stability
studies. It is anticipated that the improved infrastructure will increase
faculty productivity and training opportunities for students to partner with
faculty in scientific research.
