The principal investigator requested support for the Second international Joint
Meeting of the IMS (Institute of Mathematical Statistics) and ISBA (the
International Society for Bayesian Analysis), to be held in Bormio, Italy on
Wednesday, January 12 to Friday, January 14, 2005. A central theme of the
conference will be Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and related methods and
applications in the 15 years since the publication of Gelfand and Smith (1990,
JASA), the paper that introduced these methods to mainstream statisticians. The
requested funding is to support the travel expenses of junior statistical
investigators from US institutions, i.e., persons pursuing a PhD or DrPH in
statistics or a closely related field, or who have received such a degree within
the five years preceding the conference. Such investigators are often doing
research that is among the most novel, interesting, and important for
international dissemination, yet lack the travel funds necessary to attend such
a conference, since they have not yet established a publication track record
sufficient to attract external travel and other funding for their work.

The benefit of and need for attendance at such meetings by junior statistical
researchers is particularly great, since they contribute mightily to their
professional development and help ``level the playing field'' with more
established senior investigators. The specific anticipated benefits from the
conference are: to provide an opportunity for researchers to discuss an area in
some depth, by allowing ample time for presentations on a specific subject; to
motivate young researchers to conduct research in the conference's focus areas
that provide ample opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration; to encourage
young researchers and students to present their work, interact with senior
colleagues, and make contact with their peers in a friendly, small meeting
environment; to include a large portion of researchers and students from
underrepresented groups among participants, and provide the opportunity for one-
on-one discussions with colleagues from other institutions; to disseminate
materials from the meeting as widely as possible, by posting the presentations
on the ISBA web site at www.bayesian.org.
