9415728 Lindell This project is being funded as part of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects of the
January 17, 1994 Northridge earthquake. The study will survey companies
operating hazardous material facilities to assess the extent to which the
earthquake initiated releases, caused precursor events (such as damage to
storage tanks, pipes, and valves), and produced a loss of emergency response
systems (especially power and communications). The study will also assess the
degree to which the facilities had developed hazard mitigation and emergency
preparedness measures before the Northridge earthquake, have upgraded these
measures since the earthquake occurred, or intended to upgrade them in the near
future. The research will provide a greater understanding of the magnitude of
hazardous materials threats posed by earthquakes, and the factors that influence
the adoption of mitigation measures and emergency preparedness actions. ***
