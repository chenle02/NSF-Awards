0210213&lt;br/&gt;Schneider&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant available through the
Instrumentation and Facilities program of NSF's Division of Earth Sciences will
allow Ohio University's Department of Geological Sciences to acquire rock and
mineral sample preparation equipment and to upgrade existing petrographic
laboratory facilities. These facilities are to be used for both instructional
and research proposes in an effort to efficiently characterize and prepare
samples prior to, and with the purpose of, geochemical and isotopic analyses.
Students and faculty alike will benefit from the technology upgrade. Projects
that take advantage of these facilities reflect understanding active geologic
processes and how ancient examples are preserved in the rock record in order to
advance our geological understanding of planet
earth.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
