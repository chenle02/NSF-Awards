This award provides support to Dr. David B. Grusky under the National Science
Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards program. The objectives of
this program are to provide research support to the Nation's most outstanding
and promising young science and engineering faculty. The awards are intended to
improve the capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand
for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for academic and
industrial research and teaching. This award will allow the investigator to
pursue his research in the study of social stratification in the United States.
The objective of his work is to present a systematic history of the rates,
patterns, and sources of American social mobility over the last 150 years. He
will construct a standardized archive of comparable unit- record data from a
variety of contemporary and historical sources, and will use these data to
assess the effects of long-term economic and institutional changes on the
parameters of the mobility regime. The results will provide new evidence on the
continuing debates over the effects of economic growth and development on (a)
the demographic composition of social classes, (b) the opportunities for upward
mobility among blacks and other minorities, and (c) the structure of ethnic
differences in social stratification.
