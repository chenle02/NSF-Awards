This workshop will be conducted to integrate the 9 NMI individual research
projects awarded last year and 9 more awarded this year. Since the intent of the
overall NMI program is to leverage these individual research projects and
incorporate their work as much as possible, it is essential to conduct a
workshop with all the NMI PI s to plan the activities for the second and third
year of NMI. This workshop will be conducted on July 16-17, 2002 in Chicago. The
purpose of the meeting is to bring together the PIS so that the various
individual research project activities can be coordinated and integrated with
the larger NMI program plans. The proposal includes a draft agenda and list of
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop has been designed so that NMI
PIs have a chance to introduce and discuss their research and activities to
other researchers and the NMI Team. The NMI PIs will also have the opportunity
to modify their activities to better support the larger NMI program and leverage
other work being done by middleware developers. One of the first tasks will be
to define how the individual research efforts can be incorporated into the NMI
work plan, and secondly, to outline a specific work plan and process to
integrate the software and middleware over the next two years.&lt;br/&gt;
