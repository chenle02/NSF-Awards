In complex scientific research classification and regression problems, it is
common for several different data sets to be used to describe the response. Each
of these data sets provides a unique view of the response, but typically none of
these views describes the response perfectly. The investigator develops
computationally efficient statistical methodology to model multi-view data
within a framework for statistical analysis, variable and view selection, and
the interpretation of results. The methodology is based on both regularization
approaches involving sparse penalties in additive models and algorithmic
intensive iterative-based approaches. In addition, the investigator provides a
solid foundation for analysis of residuals in this context, establishes the
consistency of the model, and addresses the practical issue of concurvity. The
investigator is committed to raising awareness in scientific research
communities and industries of the advantages of using these modeling techniques
in the analysis of complex research problems involving data from multiple
sources and to training future statisticians and related professionals through
hands-on experiences with these data sets. To support this effort, the
investigator develops and maintains a powerful, user-friendly statistical
software package to implement this methodology.

In the modern world our ability to collect data from many different sources has
expanded dramatically due in part to computer innovations over the past few
decades. What has not kept pace is the ability to analyze data from many
different sources simultaneously. As a result, scientific researchers in
academia and industry are not fully harnessing the information that can be found
by appropriately combining multiple, diverse sources of data in a way that can
provide interpretable results. This is a challenging problem involving advances
in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and database management. The
investigator addresses this problem from a statistical analysis viewpoint. Many
applications of this research involve new statistical methods to help with
cancer research, pharmacology, genetics, proteomics, text data processing, and
homeland security. The need for analyses of large, complex, multi-view data sets
is substantial in scientific research today, and this need is currently unmet.
The results of this work are transforming how researchers in many fields analyze
and interpret data.
