Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0906086&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: Moon Duchin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;br/&gt;(Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects in this proposal are clustered around
themes in&lt;br/&gt;low-dimensional topology, asymptotic geometry, and the
dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of group actions. Teichmuller space and the mapping class
group&lt;br/&gt;are objects for special attention, and tools developed for
that&lt;br/&gt;setting are often promising for wider study in metric
geometry&lt;br/&gt;and geometric group theory. The PI proposes to build on
recent&lt;br/&gt;work on flat metrics, their length spectra, and the
associated&lt;br/&gt;boundary theory, as well as work on synthetic
curvature&lt;br/&gt;conditions and their applications to random walks.
Specific&lt;br/&gt;avenues of future investigation include asymptotics on the
space&lt;br/&gt;of singular flat surfaces; filling inequalities and
higher&lt;br/&gt;divergence functions adapted from symmetric spaces to
group&lt;br/&gt;theory; and the use of intersection patterns of
metric&lt;br/&gt;half-spaces to study the dynamics of
isometries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While quite abstract, ideas in this work can
also prove&lt;br/&gt;beautifully applicable-- for instance, Thurston's theory of
flows&lt;br/&gt;on surfaces has direct and strong applications to the study
of&lt;br/&gt;mixing in fluid dynamics. More immediately, though,
this&lt;br/&gt;research area addresses foundational questions
toward&lt;br/&gt;understanding geometric structure of complicated spaces in
the&lt;br/&gt;large, in the small, and changing over time.
