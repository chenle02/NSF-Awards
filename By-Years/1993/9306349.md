9306349 Bertness This study examines the relative importance of positive
interactions in shaping salt marsh plant communities. It tests the hypothesis
that positive interactions are characteristic of harsh physical environments
since sessile organisms frequently buffer one another from physical stress. The
project will examine the distribution of facilitative phenomena across salt
marsh stress gradients to quantify the association of facilitative interactions
with stressful habitats, explore the mechanisms (s) responsible for generating
facilitative interactions among marsh plants, and investigate the community
repercussions of facilitative associations on the distribution patterns of marsh
plants. %%% In contrast to competition, the role played by positive interactions
in natural communities has received little attention and is usually ignored in
general discussions of community organization. This work will directly examine
the importance of facilitative phenomena in affecting process and pattern in a
widespread native plant community and thus contribute to understanding the role
played by facilitations in nature. ***
