This project is certifying new teachers who are qualified and competent to teach
in the Dallas, Arlington, and Fort Worth Independent School Districts. This is a
collaborative effort among the University of Texas-Arlington's (UTA) Colleges of
Education and Science and these surrounding urban school districts. Together,
the leadership team is providing a program of campus courses, online courses,
and classroom teaching experiences to certify 37 new mathematics and science
teachers for the three school districts. The program objectives are to: 1)
recruit mathematics and science teacher candidates from baccalaureate programs
and career changers from local industry, 2) provide a quality two-track teacher
certification program for the candidates, and 3) induct, monitor, and mentor the
teacher candidates through the program and their early years of teaching. This
project is actively recruiting teacher candidates of underrepresented groups,
and those in science and mathematics areas where there is greatest teaching
need, specifically the physical sciences and higher-level mathematics.
Undergraduate candidates are introduced to teaching by placing them in partner
school districts with Mentor Teachers two days a month in year one; and in year
two, two days a week in fall, and in full time residency in spring. Career
changers are placed in classrooms throughout their one-year programs: two days a
week in the fall and in full time residency during the spring semester. All
candidates are engaged in standards-based inquiry teaching, problem-based
teaching experiences, action research, curriculum development, and reflective
practice, and in the sharing of findings, curricula, and reflections via website
postings, online interactions, and professional-style presentations.
