An investigation is made into issues related to the existence and uniqueness of
a finite deformation that generates a right or left Cauchy-Green strain field.
Among the goals of this project are the determination of compatibility
conditions appropriate to a prescribed left strain field in three dimensions and
a constructive proof of the known compatibility conditions for a right strain
field. Furthermore, methods of solution of boundary-value problems involving
large deformations of continuous media are developed that exploit the foregoing
compatibility conditions.
