A team of three scientists from Kansas State University, Michigan State
University and the Desert Botanical Garden will investigate polyploidy (the
condition of having more than one set of chromosomes) and diversity in the plant
genus Phlox (Polemoniaceae). The Phlox species P. amabilis, P. nana and P.
woodhousei all exhibit variation in ploidy level and occur as diploid (two sets
of chromosomes, 2X), tetraploid (4X) and hexaploid (6X) populations in the
southwestern United States. Geographic patterns of ploidy level variation will
be documented for these groups using flow cytometry and chromosome count data.
By combining phylogenetic, population genetic, morphological, and ecological
analyses the researchers will infer relationships among populations, reconstruct
their origins, estimate patterns of gene flow, investigate the effect of
polyploidy on phenotypes, and identify whether particular ploidy types are more
commonly associated with different ecological niches. Data from these approaches
will also be used to revise the taxonomy of the
group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While polyploidy is considered to play an important
role in plant evolution, our current knowledge of ploidy level variation
relative to diversity is limited. This project investigates questions of general
interest on polyploidy and diversity and integrates findings to advance a
broader understanding of the role of polyploidy in the diversification of
plants. Educational modules relating incorporating this research will be
developed for public school and botanical garden audiences, and participants
from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level will benefit from training and
collaboration.
