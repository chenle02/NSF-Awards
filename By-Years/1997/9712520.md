Producibility of the planar-flow process depends on the dynamics and stability
of a group of three-phase and two-phase configurations. The stability and
control of these are crucial in strip-casting (or melt-spinning), impact-
forming, die-casting, spray-foaming, and extrusion, among others; that is, in
virtually any casting process where integrity of bulk properties and surface
quality are paramount. The objectives of this research are: (1) to understand
the fluid mechanics of air entertainment at the upstream meniscus; (2) to
develop implications of certain compatibility relations that constrain the
downstream injunction; (3) to identify the physics responsible for an observed
transition from smooth to rough texture with applied pressure; and (4) to
capture the feedback influence of fluid flow on the morphological stability of
the solidification front. The ultimate goals are to understand the influence of
processing on microstructure: the number, size and orientation of grains; to
control surface quality and to widen the process operability window; and, to
better control the phase-change, process stability and thereby quality of the
ribbon, foil and sheet produced. Improvements on the engineering side are
expected to go hand-in-hand with scientific advances.
