The objective of this research is the continued development of methods to
describe quantum dynamics in extended semiconductor nanostructures, and the
application of these methods to explore a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena
associated with the behavior of electronic excitations in nanoscale structures.
These objective includes exploring the feasibility of creating and manipulating
coherent electronic excitations in disordered arrangements of organic molecules
anchored to TiO2 nanostructures, with emphasis on studies of quantum
entanglement, decoherence and schemes for conditional quantum dynamics. The
approach is a combination of large-scale ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations with quantum dynamics simulations of electronic relaxation based on
model Hamiltonians gained from a tight binding
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of quantum dynamics in semiconductor
nanostructures is important for a huge variety of systems and remains an open
problem. The emphasis of the research program is on modeling quantum dynamics of
electronic excitations in organic molecules functionalizing TiO2 nanostructures.
However, the resulting theoretical advances will have a much wider
applicability, including many other functionalized nanostructures with common
electronic excitations. The implications of the proposed studies will likely
extend beyond an understanding of the model systems investigated to problems
that range from the design of efficient solar energy conversion cells to the
problem of photocatalytic decomposition of pollutants (e.g., organic material)
in soil with significant TiO2 content. In addition, the program will naturally
broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in the sciences and
benefit the educational infrastructure at Yale by creating a multi-disciplinary
frontier research opportunity for students from various academic
departments.&lt;br/&gt;
