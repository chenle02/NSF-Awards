Lee 9360334 A critical deficiency in current dielectric materials that prevents
their use in the next generations of ultra fast computing systems. Organic
polymers offer the most promise in this area and are already beginning to
displace inorganic material such as silicon dioxide in these applications due to
the performance advantages offered by organic systems. New organic materials
with the right combinations of properties are desired. Polyquinolines of not
have the deficiencies that plague polymides and polyquinolines are ideally
suited to serve as dielectric materials due in part to their inherently low
dielectric constants (2.6-2.8), low moisture uptakes (0.15%), and excellent
thermal stability's. In addition, a facile synthesis of polyquinolines has
recently been developed at Maxdem which greatly simplifies their preparation and
allows for the easy modification of their structure to yield new polyquinoline
derivatives. However, trial and error methods of preparing new derivatives are
to time consuming and costly because of the complex interrelationships between
polymer properties. This will establish structure-property relationships
essential to the development of optimum polyquinoline derivatives for electronic
applications. ***
