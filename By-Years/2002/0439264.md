Abstract for collaborative award DMS-0439264 and DMS-0440708 of Pollack and
Weston:

Iwasawa theory is concerned with the relation between the Galois theoretic and
p-adic analytic aspects of arithmetic objects. The investigators propose to
study the Iwasawa theory of modular forms with supersingular reduction. A
primary focus of this work is the behavior of Iwasawa invariants in p-adic
analytic families of modular forms such as the eigencurve of Coleman and Mazur.
In fact, the definitions of these invariants, well known in the ordinary case,
are not yet known in general in the supersingular case. In order to define and
study the algebraic Iwasawa invariants the PI's intend to use the p-adic Hodge
theory of Fontaine to study the growth of Selmer groups of modular forms over
cyclotomic fields. The definitions of the analytic invariants should be related
to special values of modular L-functions; exhibiting the desired behavior in
families will involve a study of congruences of special values of modular
L-functions, a recurring theme in much recent work. An eventual goal of this
project is to show that the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory can be checked for
an entire family by checking it for a single form in the family. The
investigators also intend to study the generalization of the Riemann-Hurwitz
type formula of Kida, Hachimori and Matsuno, which describe the change in p-adic
Iwasawa invariants over p-extensions of number fields, to modular forms of
higher weight.

Number theory, often considered the oldest mathematical discipline, has in
recent times developed remarkable applications to cryptography. Many of these
applications involve arithmetic geometric objects known as elliptic curves.
Modular forms, the primary object of study in this proposal, are generalizations
of elliptic curves which play a fundamental role in modern number theory. The
questions investigated in this proposal deal with invariants which are closely
related to those of interest in cryptography and may perhaps yield some insight
into them.
