0420378&lt;br/&gt;Hornbuckle&lt;br/&gt;Requested is a GC tandem mass
spectrometer instrumentation for the detection and analysis of organic matter.
In addition, equipment for automation of sample handling/injection is requested
which will make the instrumentation accessible to a wide variety of users in
research applications involving analysis of odor from animals, content analysis
of burial vases excavated from Italian tombs, to analysis of degradation
products of PCBs. The instrumentation will provide significant stimulation of
the intellectual activity. The impact of the new instrumentation will be by
extending the possibilities of ongoing research activity. It will be integrated
in educational efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
