Key experiments are proposed for the advancement of quantum dynamics, the study
of time evolution in systems described by quantum rather than classical
mechanics. Both few and many body systems will be examined in real time. These
include microwave driven highly excited hydrogen atoms, a search for a quantum
breaktime in the evolution of a microwave driven ensemble of strontium atoms and
an investigation into the gas-plasma phase transition in an overdense gas of
Rydberg calcium atoms. These experiments will enhance our understanding of the
relationship between the quantum theory of small systems and the nonlinear
dynamics of classically macroscopic systems.
