Research Topics in Parallel Computing and Complexity Theory Research will be
conducted in the areas of parallel computing and computational complexity.
Specific topics include: o development of general methodologies for design and
analysis of algorithms for parallel networks; development of techniques for
efficient simulations between networks with different architectures; o
investigation of the computational power of parallel networks in comparison to
sequential models and other models of parallel computation; o mapping algorithms
onto fixed-size parallel architectures and experimental validation; o
development of techniques for showing problems to be in NC (the class of
problems solvable by boolean circuits of polynomial size and polylogarithmic
depth); o investigation of properties (e.g., closure properties) of NC; o topics
in complexity theory: space-time trade-offs, hierarchies of computation,
nondeterminism versus determinism, parallel versus sequential, (un) decidability
of decision problems.
