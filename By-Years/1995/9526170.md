9526170 Chen This project is to organize and conduct a joint U.S.-Japan Seminar
on "Advanced Stability Concepts and Methods for Seismic Design in Structural
Steel." The seminar will focus on advances in the state- of-the-art achieved in
the last few years, with major emphasis on achievements resulting from the
experiences of and research subsequent to the Northridge and Great Hanshin
Earthquakes. It will culminate in the production of a monograph which is hoped
will serve as a state-of-the-art guide to analysis and design for seismic
retrofitting and new construction in steel. The seminar and monograph will
reveal weaknesses and voids in current American and Japanese practices as well
as new technologies that are the most promising for improving seismic
performance. They will foster change to eliminate these deficiencies from
current standards and specifications and provide new design concepts and
methodologies. This activity is a part of US-Japan cooperative science program
administered jointly by the International Division of NSF and Japanese Society
of promotion of Sciences (JSPS). ***
