9309366 Fekete Many genes have been identified that are expressed by various
cells in the developing nervous system, yet we do not know the function of the
vast majority of the gene products. One way to test these genes functionally is
to alter their normal expression during development. A potential method for
experimentally manipulating the expression of a gene of interest is to use a
retrovirus to introduce the gene into cells that do not normally express the
gene. These cells can then be studied for changes in their attributes. This
project seeks to optimize the efficiency with which retroviruses can transmit
candidate genes into the developing brain. This will be done by manipulating
some key parts of the genome of the retrovirus, and then testing for increased
and widespread gene transfer. If successful, the improvements will permit a
greater repertoire of genes to be tested for a functional role in the
development of the brain. *** EXE q P VGA DRV @ j 6 9309366 Fekete Many genes
