A large and diverse number of marine organisms accumulate a remarkable
diversity of toxic halogenated organic compounds. However, neither the
ecological roles nor biosynthetic controls of these compounds are well
understood and this is especially true for organisms other than molluscs and
sponges (poriferan taxa). This project involves a synoptic study of the benthic
enteropneust, Saccoglossus kowalevskyi, which will establish some of the key
environmental and genetic factors which regulate patterns of haloorganic
accumulation in these organisms, and provide new insights on the effects of
toxic haloorganics on microorganisms and biogeochemical processes in marine
sediments. Saccoglossus kowalevskyi is ideally suited for this work since: 1) it
is a common component of the intertidal macrofauna; 2) many aspects of its
biology (e.g., feeding, digestion, reproduction, excretion) are well
characterized; 3) it has a significant impact on freshly- deposited organic
matter in the intertidal zone. In addition, this research will help establish a
model for secondary product accumulation that differs from currently accepted
models based on studies of molluscs and sponges.
