MARRA 9311255 This proposal is a continuing effort of to collect and process
data on optics and pigment distribution by combining the efforts of JGOFS and
the Word Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). The
program will operate a bio-optical profiler to collect data on the biological
and optical properties of the upper water column. Data to collected include
spectral irradiance (7 channels each of upwelling and downwelling ), broad-band
visible irradiance (PAR), fluorescence, and beam transmission. This is perhaps
the first undertaking of a systematic and consistent data collection on the
oceans pigment and optical properties, and would be invaluable in improving
algorithms for satellite imaging of ocean pigments and in estimating primary
production. ***
