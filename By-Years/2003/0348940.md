This research project will develop adaptive, personalized, topic-driven crawlers
to help search engines. The current search engines do not scale in a dynamic
environment. The proposed research will overcome this limitation. The research
will utilize an autonomous agent-based approach to building new scalable
algorithms. The career development plan will include integrating the results
into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The students will also carry out
projects using the results of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
