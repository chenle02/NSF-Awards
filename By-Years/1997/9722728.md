9722728 Cheng This award supports a three-year program in geometric modeling
for engineering design. A cooperative project between the University of Kentucky
and Tsinghua University, the program seeks to advance the state of the art in
geometric modeling, give U.S. students experience in China through participation
in the research project, and improve methods for collaboration remotely via the
world wide web. The proposal adds an international dimension to DDM 9400823.
Geometric design and modeling is a major research and development area in
computer aided design. The automobile, aerospace, and shipbuilding industries
rely heavily on applications of many techniques developed in this area.
Geometric modeling for engineering design, however, is a difficult field and
many unanswered question remain that inhibit use of computers in engineering
design. Research on new computational and visualization techniques seeks to
facilitate further modeling and design. This project proposes to develop and
deliver CAD/CAM software systems which support such methodologies. This requires
development of network CAD/CAM interfaces and collaborative design paradigms for
a number of components of an object- oriented geometric modeling tool kit. These
will be implemented as platform-independent applications which can be accessed
from anywhere over the Web. Project personnel will include faculty level
scientists from Tsinghua University's Computer Aided Design Center which is one
of the largest geometric modeling research teams in the world. US participants
include faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of
Kentucky. Two undergraduate students from the University of Kentucky will
participate each year, and will be chosen from groups underrepresented in
computer science and engineering fields. The students will participate in the
research fully, including in research visits to Tsinghua University, Beijing,
China. Support on the Chinese side is provided by the National Natural Science
Foundation. This project is supported under the US-China Protocol on Cooperation
in Basic Sciences.
