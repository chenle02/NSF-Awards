This study will test the sensitivity of planktonic foraminifer assemblages to
changes in the upper ocean environment in the North Atlantic gyre. The study
will compare time-series of species abundances in sediment trap samples
collected in the long-term Ocean Flux Program at Bermuda. Analyses of biweekly
samples collected from 1989 to 2002 will be compared to hydrographic records
from station S and biogeochemical data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series
study (BATS).
