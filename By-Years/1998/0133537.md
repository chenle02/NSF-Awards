Home Area Networks (HANs) are an emerging technology that is very likely to play
a major role in future homes. Broad deployment of this technology, however,
depends strongly on the achieved security and the policies used to allow
unsophistcated users to express and communicate their security requirements. The
key objective of this research is to investigate technologies and methodologies
which can be deployed and used to protect home networks. The research
contributions include (a) user-accessible security policies, (b) a framework for
the safe and secure communication between devices in a Home Automation Network
(HAN), and (c) the collection and analysis of empirical findings by deploying
such devices in a home environment. Without the security components that this
research will produce, wide deployment of HANs may have devastating
consequences. The results of low security awareness coupled with "always-on"
connectivity have been demonstrated by the problems caused by computer viruses.
In addition, the proxy-based communication framework that will be implemented as
part of this research, will also be applicable to self-reconfigurable networks
that may be found in health monitoring systems, battlefield sensor networks,
etc.
