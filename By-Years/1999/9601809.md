This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona acquire a hybrid mass
spectrometer (MS) with an electric sector (E)-magnetic sector(B)/curved field
reflection time-of-flight (TOF) geometry. This equipment will enhance research
in a number of areas including the following: (1) design and synthesis of a
variety of biologically active linear and cyclic peptides, pseudopeptides,
peptidomimetics and complex peptide libraries (2) structure/physical
property/reactivity relationships in hemes and heme proteins (3) studies of the
enzyme and compounds that mimic features of the molybdenum and heme centers of
the enzyme (4) synthesis and characterization of new organic compounds (5)
synthesis of carbohydrate based natural product analogs and the development of
novel carbohydrate based materials (6) design and synthesis of novel amphiphilic
molecules that form organized assemblies upon solvation (7) novel organic
snthesis methodology to synthesis of novel materials, and (8) mechanism of lipid
transport in insects. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the
technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic acid
molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
