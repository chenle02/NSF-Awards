This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides support for the
work of Professor John Baldwin, Syracuse University. The work focuses on how
simple organic molecules undergo a variety of chemical reactions. These
reactions are particularly important for a fundamental understanding of the
dynamic behavior of such molecules, particularly at the interface between
experiment and theory. New quantitative information on basic types of thermal
isomerization reactions will be obtained by preparing labeled compounds and
carrying out reactions which track the labels. Among the systems to be
investigated are stable, isotope-labeled versions of the simple hydrocarbons
cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclopentane, cis-1,3-pentadiene,
cis,cis-1,3,5-heptatriene, cycloheptatriene, and three bicyclic olefins.
Reaction stereochemistry, kinetics, kinetic isotope effects, and mechanisms will
be determined. Both established and novel techniques, including tunable diode
laser and vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy, will be used in these
studies.
