The REU program will introduce thirty talented undergraduates to research in
the field of membrane science. Ten students from eight Kentucky colleges and
universities are matched with five faculty advisors. The individual projects are
designed along the lines of the research program of the supervising advisor to
ensure direct scientific interaction with the graduate and postdoctoral students
of each research group. Weekly seminars during the summer and evening seminars
in the fall stimulate discussion and provide information on career possibilities
as well as on current major research issues, experimental methodologies and
specialized instrumentation. Program emphasis is placed on literature searching
and analysis techniques, on critical evaluation of each individuals experimental
data, and on the development of effective scientific communication skills.
Student presentations on their projects complete the program.
