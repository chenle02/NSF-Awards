The project provides partial funding for the U.S. participation in a workshop
organized jointly by a group of scientists at the Mathematical Institute at the
University of Bergen and at the University of South Florida. The workshop is
planned as an interdisciplinary event to discuss several cutting edge problems
on the border between modern mathematics and mathematical physics, more
specifically, problems broadly associated with so-called Laplacian growth,
stochastic and discrete Loewner evolutions, quadrature domains, gravitational
lensing, Hele-Shaw flows, and integrable systems. The topics chosen for the
workshop are "hot" topics which are on the borderline between mathematics and
physics. Recently, most of these themes, long studied in mathematical physics,
received an unexpected but dramatic insight from classical complex analysis
based on the notion of Schwarz function of an analytic curve.

The funding is intended for the U.S. participation in the planned workshop. The
workshop is a step in a larger initiative conceived by the organizers to create
a multi-facetted joint USA-Europe series of collaborative projects and will
serve to increase internationalization of newly developed collaborations and
promote the establishment of in-depth scientific partnerships. Supporting the
travel of promising young researchers and graduate students to the workshop
where scientists from Europe and the US, old and young, prominent and just
beginning, are essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and
congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in
mathematics and physics, will encourage many younger students to pursue some of
these topics in their future research. Most of the funding is designated to
support the travel costs of young scientists, graduate students and members of
the underrepresented groups.
