This project will continue and update a series of data about patents granted by
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from 1963 through 1987 will be
classified by year of grant and year of application, nationality of inventor,
sector of assigned owner, and field of technology in terms of the Standard
Industrial Classification. Separate data will be tabulated for patents owned by
universities and colleges, patents owned by Government agencies, and patents in
narrow technology fields of special interest.
