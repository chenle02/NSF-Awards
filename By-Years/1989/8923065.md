Seasonal variations (caused by changes of oceanic density stratification) in
the occurrences of coastal (harbor) seiches generated by internal waves will be
examined by combining data and modeling. Data collection will continue at Puerto
Princesa on Palawan Island. Existing archives of tidal elevations will be
analyzed to determine the potential global significance of this process.
