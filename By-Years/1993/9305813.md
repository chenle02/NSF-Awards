American scientists and students will participate in an international
conference on brain development entitled 'Specificity in Neural Development.'
Normal function of the nervous system depends on a precise pattern of
connections between nerve cells. In the adult brain, this pattern of connections
is very complex, with some nerve cells communicating with other nerve cells over
a meter away. The mechanisms by which this complex pattern of connections
develops are unknown, but considerable insight into these mechanisms has been
gained through recent investigations. This conference will bring together many
of the world's scientists working on this problem. These scientists will share
their knowledge and through discussion chart the future directions of the field.
