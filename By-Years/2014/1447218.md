The goal of this project is to develop 3D virtual replicas of common engineering
laboratory experiments that can improve learning impact and broaden access to
engineering laboratory materials for undergraduate students. The virtual
laboratory improves the learning impact in that users have a safer means to
explore the experiments and can view the experimental equipment and setup in
ways that are not possible in real-world laboratories. Additionally, users are
free to repeat the experiments as many times as they want without consuming
additional real-world materials or laboratory time costs. Further, the virtual
laboratory allows users to make mistakes safely and learn from both successful
and incorrect experiments; such "learning by exploring via negative examples" is
currently not feasible in real-world laboratories due to safety and time
constraints.

This research team aims to continue developing interfaces for engineering labs,
specifically four 3D virtual gaming strength of materials laboratories including
Beam Bending, Column Buckling, Fatigue, and Pressure vessel tests. Together with
the three completed virtual simulations developed in the first phase of the
project, they cover all the learning outcomes of the Strength of Materials Lab
course and complete the transformation of the improved learning experience for
this specific lab. This learning model could easily be expanded to include
interfaces for other subject labs such as mechanical engineering, chemistry,
biology, physics, and others.
