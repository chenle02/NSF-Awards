This research is focused on the spin-charge correlation in magnetic
nanostructures. For layered films, we will extend our research from single
quantum well (QW) system to double QW system. QW states in a single layer can
result in the magnetic interlayer coupling. Interaction between two QWs is
expected to generate new magneto phenomena. For stepped films, we will use
nanometer-sized atomic steps to laterally modulate 2D thin films at nanometer
scale. Great achievements have been made in layered structures in the last
decade. Lateral modulation of a 2D thin film should further shrink the
dimensionality to generate new properties. New idea of spherical substrate will
be applied to control the step orientation and the step-density in a systematic
way. All samples will be grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and characterized
by Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), Low-Energy Electron
Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy (STM). Electronic properties of the nanostructures will be measured
by Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and the magnetic properties
of the films will be measured by Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE)
technique. Graduate students involved in the project will receive training in
fundamental experimental techniques using cutting edge technology.

The miniaturization of of information storage technology has reached a stage
that physical processes at the nanometer scale dominate the overall properties
of the storage materials. This rapid development challenges fundamental research
to understand materials properties in nanostructures. The goal of this proposal
is to gain a deep understanding on how materials properties change as the size
approaches the ultimate nanometer length scale in magnetic materials. To realize
this goal, well-defined magnetic nanostructures will be built by Molecular Beam
Epitaxy (MBE) with a control at the atomic level, and investigated with state-
of-the-art techniques such as Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES),
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect
(SMOKE), etc. Quantum confinement of electrons inside the nanostructures will be
studied to explore its role in new magnetic properties. Success of this project
will be important not only to the understanding of low-dimensional magnetism,
but also to the development of magnetic technology. Graduate students involved
in the project will receive training in fundamental experimental techniques
using cutting edge technology. This training will prepare them for a range of
careers in both academe
