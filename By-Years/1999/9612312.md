The Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy (COSEPUP) undertakes
major independent studies of national issues in U.S. Science policy and U.S.
technology policy. In recent years, for example, it has conducted prominent
studies on U.S. policy goals for science and technology, policies related to
global warming, integretiy in the conduct of scientific research, U.S. policy
for civilian technology, and recruitment and retention of Presidential
appointees. COPSEPUP's core activities, including meetings of the Committee
itself and staff of two, are underwritten substantially by internal funds
(individual studies are separately funded). NSF has supported COSEPUP for 30
years and is continuing its support this year. $522,000 is requested for the
next three-year period.
