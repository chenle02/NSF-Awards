Theoretical methods, such as normal mode analysis and ab initio calculations,
are being combined with experimental studies to provide rigorous analyses of
infrared and Raman spectra of macromolecules in terms of their structures and
morphologies. The present research covers five areas: (1) a study of the
longitudinal acoustic mode in poly(ethylene oxide) as an example of a helical
polymer, incorporating normal mode analyses of the effects of intermolecular
forces and chain defects on this mode; (2) a study of chain conformations in
chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride) by normal mode analysis, involving refinement
of a force field for vicinally chlorinated hydrocarbons; (3) a study of surface
enhanced Raman spectra of poly(vinylpyridine) in order to characterize the
interaction of the polymer with a metal surface, starting with a detailed normal
node analysis of such spectra of the monomer; (4) a study of spectra and
structure in polyprolines, based on a refinement of a force field for the imide
group in N,N-dimethylacetamide; and (5) a study of the dependence of polypeptide
force field on conformation, based on ab initio calculations on dipeptides.
These studies will provide new insights into general and specific features of
the relationships between spectra and structure of macromolecules.
