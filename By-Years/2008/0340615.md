Bhaduri 9800009 This project involves both scientific issues as well as
technical developments under one comprehensive project. From a scientific
viewpoint, the project deals with synthesizing nanocrystalline ceramics and
densifying them with an activated consolidation process such as microwave
sintering. Nanocrystalline materials signify particulates with at least one
dimension lOOnm (1nm 10-9 m) or less. These materials are expected to have
altered physical and mechanical properties, provided they can be consolidated
maintaining the nanocrystalline structure. However, this is a challenging job
since densification occurs with concurrent grain growth. In this work, microwave
sintering will be used as an activated consolidation process. Sintering schedule
will be determined after measuring the high temperature dielectric properties of
the powders. The technical developments will be carried out under the GOALI
program wherein a consortium of several local industries will be involved. These
industries represent a wide variety of products from powder production to
cutting tool development as well electronic materials. Widespread interactions
are expected to take place among the partners.
