In recent years a large proportion of minority males have experienced direct
involvement with the criminal justice system. This project involves the
dissertation research of an anthropology student from Yale University, studying
the social costs of incarceration in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington DC,
where over 40% of the black men are estimated to be under some form of
correctional supervision-parole, probation, drug rehabilitation, etc., on any
given day. The project will study the effects of the prison incarceration of
young minority males on their own reinvolvement in the community after their
release, and on their families, while they are in custody and after they come
out. In addition the study will analyze the local discourse on race and local
perceptions of the morality of the criminal justice system. The method will be
general participant observation in the neighborhood as well as formal interviews
with local police, lawyers, ministers, public officials and residents. A set of
interviews will be conducted with families with no experience with the criminal
justice system as well as those with currently incarcerated members. The student
will focus on resource sharing and networks of support of the families as they
cope with the absence of a member. This research is important because it will
advance our understanding of the effects of increased incarceration rates in
inner city neighborhoods. The new information will be valuable to policy makers
trying to ameliorate the negative impact of incarceration on households and
communities.
