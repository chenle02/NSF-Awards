9419244 Jouse While the detailed mechanisms for storing memories in the brain
are still unknown, neurobiologists have identified specific sites where
information is stored. One of these memory sites is the mammalian hippocampus.
With this award, a collaborative team consisting of nuclear systems engineers
and a neuroscientist will conduct theoretical modeling studies to test ideas
about how information is stored in the hippocampus. These studies will provide
new ways of thinking about biological memory formation, that will impact future
work on the cellular mechanisms of learning, and related engineering
applications such as neural network models of learning systems.
