9313230 Myers This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Depart-ment of Chemistry at the California Institute of Tech-
nology in the purchase of a high resolution Mass Spectrometer. Six faculty
members whose research is dependent upon high resolution mass spectroscopy will
greatly benefit from the acquisition of this instrument. Research projects to be
carried out with this instrument include: 1) Synthetic, structural and
mechanistic studies in organotransition metal chemistry, 2) Sequence specific
recognition and cleavage of DNA, 3) Synthesis and characterization large organic
molecules such as water-soluble cyclophanes, which are used in host-guest
studies, 4) Organometallic, organic and polymer synthesis and characterization,
5) Chemical studies of protein structure, function and design. 6) Synthetic and
mechanistic studies in organic chemistry. %%% A high resolution mass
spectrometer is an instrument used to measure the precise molecular weight of a
molecular ion. This information is an important piece of data used to help
determine the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular geometry of a
molecule. It is one of the essential tools needed to learn the detailed
structure of newly synthesized molecules. ***
