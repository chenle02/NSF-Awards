The principal investigator of this project and his collaborator study elliptical
Radon transforms (ERT), which play an important role in bi-static models of
various imaging modalities such as near-field ultrasound tomography, synthetic
aperture radar, geophysical exploration imaging, and sonar. Bi-static data
acquisition geometries involve separate emitter and receiver to image a medium
using signals such as acoustic or electromagnetic waves. This approach offers
several advantages. In the case of radar imaging the receivers are passive;
hence separating their motion from the active emitters allows receivers alone to
be flown in an unsafe environment. In sonar, data collection involves the
receivers towed behind the boat transmitting the sound source. In ultrasound
tomography separate emitter and receiver can provide data sets, for example, of
high angular resolution. Assuming constant speed of wave propagation in the
medium, the mathematical model for all these modalities is expressed through the
ERT defined by integrals of an unknown function over ellipsoids or ellipses. The
investigators develop image reconstruction techniques for several imaging
modalities based on such elliptical Radon transforms. The principal mathematical
problems they address include: development of microlocal analysis of ERT in
various practically important data acquisition geometries, development of exact
and approximate inversion formulas and algorithms for ERT, description of
injectivity sets, and range characterization of ERT, i.e. the characterization
of consistency conditions for the data for the aforementioned imaging
modalities. The investigators test the results of their research in laboratory
ultrasound experiments performed by their collaborators in radiology and
biomedical engineering.

The principal investigator and his collaborator solve image reconstruction
problems that are of great importance in several fields including ultrasonic
reflectivity imaging in medicine, geophysical exploration, sonar and synthetic
aperture radar imaging. Many of these problems have similar mathematical
representation, and the investigators develop solutions as well as derive
numerical algorithms for such problems. The goals and novel results of this
project provide a positive impact on healthcare technologies (e.g. early
detection of cancer), national security (e.g. improved radar systems), economics
(e.g. improved geophysical exploration, or industrial nondestructive testing),
and for many other fields of modern life, where the use of remote sensing and
imaging has become an indispensable tool. The investigators work with their
collaborators to test the results of their research in laboratory ultrasound
experiments. The investigators advise and mentor students on research topics
directly related to this proposal, and train future specialists of the field.
They are committed to graduate and undergraduate teaching and engage students
from underrepresented groups in the form of introductory workshops, tutorials
and short courses. The investigators broadly disseminate the results of the
project through publications in selected scientific journals and presentations
at conferences.
