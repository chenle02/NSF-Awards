It is proposed to investigate L-functions of automorphic
&lt;br/&gt;representations and their applications in the following
&lt;br/&gt;contexts:&lt;br/&gt;lifitng from Classical Groups to
GL(n);&lt;br/&gt;Converse Theorems for GL(n);&lt;br/&gt;L-funcitons for
GL(n);&lt;br/&gt;sub-convexity results for L-functions.&lt;br/&gt;These are all
ongoing projects. In addition there is&lt;br/&gt;a return to previous work on
non-symmetric complex&lt;br/&gt;homogeneous domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal is devoted to the study of Langlans' philosopy,&lt;br/&gt;which is the
main part of the modern number theory.&lt;br/&gt;We obtained, by using Converse
Theorem, important results&lt;br/&gt;relating the problem of lifting of generic
automorphic &lt;br/&gt;representations of the classical groups to
GL(n).&lt;br/&gt;Our basic achivement will be the proof of the local and
&lt;br/&gt;global Langlands' conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;
