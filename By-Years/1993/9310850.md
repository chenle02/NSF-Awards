9310850 Roberts The rates of malate metabolism and transport in maize root tips
will be measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination
with other biochemical techniques. These processes will be quantitated in tissue
exhibiting different rates of malate synthesis, in response to potassium ion
uptake, or assimilation of ammonium ion. Specific reactions that will be
monitored include (i) utilization of glycolytically-derived malate by
mitochondria for oxidation; (ii) action of PEP carboxylase and malic enzyme, and
their coordination with activity in the Krebs cycle and amino acid biosynthesis;
(iii) movement of malate between cytoplasm and vacuole. The combined
measurements will permit observation of interactions between the different
components comprising malate metabolism. This information is a prerequisite to
an understanding of respiration, mineral nutrition, intracellular pH regulation,
amino acid biosynthesis and growth - particularly with respect to the
integration of these processes in vivo. ***
