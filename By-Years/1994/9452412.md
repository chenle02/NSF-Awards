The project renovates the Pomona College 1-meter telescope for undergraduate
research and class work. Four faculty representing all five of the Claremont
Colleges will supervise undergraduate research projects using the telescope. In
addition, the colleges offer introductory astronomy and an observational
astronomy classes that will also use the telescope. The research projects
include observations of supernovae, imaging surveys of lenticular galaxies,
spectroscopy of variable stars, observations of clusters, mapping of molecular
clouds, and quasar photometry.
