The research is to investigate physics of charged particle beam dynamics that is
relevant to research in basic and applied sciences. Research topics of this
grant investigate beam dynamics of isochronous storage rings and coherent photon
sources, accelerator modeling and independent component analysis for beam
measurements, space charge effects on high power beams, electron cloud
instability, and polarization preservation in high energy storage rings. These
topics can provide high-quality beams in high energy accelerators for nuclear
and particle physics research. The broader impact of this grant is to train
Ph.D. students in beam physics and technology. Our research results can also
provide high-quality and high-power beams for applications in industry, national
security, medicine and cancer therapy.&lt;br/&gt;
