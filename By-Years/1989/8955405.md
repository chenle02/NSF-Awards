Texas A&amp;M University will initiate a 4-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in Engineering for 18 students in grades 11,12. Students engage in a
4-week experience in science and engineering on the campus of Texas A&amp;M,
with special orientation toward Chemical Engineering. Approximately equal
numbers of males/females and minorities/non-minorities are included. The program
includes research projects under the direction of engineering faculty as well as
classroom instruction and discussions in communications skills, research
techniques, engineering problem solving, creativity, ethics, using spreadsheets
on PC's to solve problems and career orientation. Campus field trips through
scientific facilities and plant trips through industrial facilities are
included. Written and oral reports will be required on the research projects and
plant trips. Students from small and rural high schools are targeted. Follow-up
includes presentations to high school or peer groups.
