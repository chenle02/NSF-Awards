9353967 Wilkinson Borough of Manhattan Community College has been a leader of
the Calculus reform movement. Their present precalculus, calculus and
differential equations curriculum emphasizes students working in groups and
using computer graphers and computer algebra systems to create written honors
projects and animated mathematical movies. It adapts the model developed by Uri
Treisman at Berkeley to a large urban non-residential college, and moves beyond
the Treisman model in its strong emphasis in technology and alternative
assessment models. This project builds on their previous calculus curriculum
projects. They are offering two regional summer faculty workshops for each of
two summers. One workshop is for faculty inexperienced in technology and focuses
on the preparation of collaborative computer portfolios in precalculus and
calculus. The second workshop for faculty more experienced in technology and is
emphasizing the use of new computer technology (e.g., Macromind Director) that
animates graphs, and allows students to create mathematics movies in
precalculus, calculus, and differential equations. ***
