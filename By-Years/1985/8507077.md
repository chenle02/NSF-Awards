This research develops a novel approach to measure and verify the extent of
disturbances induced while preparing soil samples for geomechanic tests. The
soil will be modeled as a dilatant strain-hardening frictional material to
account for soil-wall interface effects during sampling. An elaborately designed
laboratory arrangement will be used to monitor induced disturbances and
determine the extent of stress and pore water pressure changes while taking
samples from a soil block. The results from the model study will be correlated
with experimental data. The importance of measuring induced disturbances in soil
samples has been well recognized by the geomechanic community. A quantitative
method to assess the extent of these disturbances has, thus far, not been
developed. The research approach is innovative and has a potential to make a
significant impact in geomechanic experimentation.
