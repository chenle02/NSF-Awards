The University of South Alabama will conduct during the summers of 1996 and 1997
a series of four four-day hands-on workshops for two and four-year college
faculty on the appropriate use of the Texas Instruments TI-85 and TI-92 graphics
calculators in collegiate mathematics. Two of the workshops will take place
during the Summer of 1996 and two will be scheduled for the Summer of 1997. The
purpose of the workshops is to engage participants in developing an intellectual
framework for the appropriate use of the graphing calculator in the study and
teaching of precalculus, calculus, differential equations, matrix theory and
elementary statistics. This will be accomplished both by having participants
work through material developed by the PIs and also by having participants
create their own materials. Upon completion of one of these workshops
participants will be able to: 1) make appropriate use of the graphing
calculator, and address the technical and pedagogical issues such usage
involves; 2) return to their home institutions and take the lead in the
appropriate introduction of the graphing calculator into their curricula; and 3)
help build a coalition between two and four-year institutions so as to foster a
more coordinated effort in the teaching of collegiate mathematics courses.
