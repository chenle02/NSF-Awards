9530529 Shearer This grant provides $120,000 as three years partial salary
support of a computer technician whose responsibilities would include
maintenance and operation of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics'
(IGPP) computer network of 125 workstation and 131 PC's. The addition of a full-
time network manager for this group will allow the PI's to focus on their
research on global, regional and marine seismology (including seismic detection
of nuclear detonations), mantle dynamics, geomorphology and space geodesy as
opposed to the ever increasing need for maintenance of their expanding network
of CPU's, mass storage devices and other peripherals. ***
