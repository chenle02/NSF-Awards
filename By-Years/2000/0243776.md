The Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) is a collaboration
of&lt;br/&gt;Duke University, North Carolina State University, the University of
North&lt;br/&gt;Carolina at Chapel Hill, and other institutions in the North
Carolina&lt;br/&gt;Triangle area, which has established a diverse research
program in low-energy nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics. TUNL has a strong reputation
for providing hands-on experimental&lt;br/&gt;research experience to graduate
and undergraduate students, who are involved&lt;br/&gt;in all aspects of nuclear
physics experiments. Research projects are focused&lt;br/&gt;on resolving issues
in, for example, few-body physics, nuclear-level&lt;br/&gt;densities, weak
interactions and fundamental symmetries, photonuclear&lt;br/&gt;reactions,
nuclear astrophysics and radiative-capture reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a realistic
and&lt;br/&gt;active research experience through the completion of a self-
contained&lt;br/&gt;10-week project and through the understanding of the
project's integral&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the ongoing research program at
TUNL. The broad scope of&lt;br/&gt;activities at TUNL, which involve data
collection, data analysis and&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation development, offers the
variety in project selection needed&lt;br/&gt;to productively involve students
who have diverse academic and research&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds, capabilities and
interests. To broaden the research experience,&lt;br/&gt;a special lecture
series has been incorporated into the program to increase&lt;br/&gt;the
students' exposure to current topics in nuclear physics and to
share&lt;br/&gt;details about the research resources at TUNL. At the end of the
summer&lt;br/&gt;program, students prepare written and oral presentations that
help them to&lt;br/&gt;organize an overview of their research
projects.&lt;br/&gt;
