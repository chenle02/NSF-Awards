McGovern CUNY-Hunter College This is a dissertation improvement grant proposal
to fund the work of Jim Woollett. The project examines subsistence and cultural
change in Labrador Inuit culture. Consideration of subsistence economy in the
study of contact-period cultural change has hinged upon ethnohistoric and
possibilistic interpretations. This project combines zooarchaeological and
archaeobotanical analyses of the existing collections produced from recent
excavations at several sites in Labrador with oral history studies that address
local environment and land-use patterns. The study will link changing economic
behavior to social and environmental causes, most particularly through detailed
studies of the organization and scheduling of seal and whale hunting.
