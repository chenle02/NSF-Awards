9455660 Naumann Computer programming is often taught primarily by example, and
there is widespread interest in more systematic methods, especially
mathematically rigorous "formal methods". There are now undergraduate level
textbooks and teaching materials for beginning programming courses using the
method called program derivation, whereby correct programs are derived from
their specifications by calculation. The objective is to develop lecture notes
and programming assignments for an undergraduate data structures course based on
program derivation. The materials are based on those now being used in the
classroom, and will be evaluated by educators at other universities for content
and suitability for use in undergraduate courses in data structures. By meeting
the need for instructional material based on the extensive research literature
on program derivation, this project directly benefits educators who wish to
teach scientifically based systematic methods of programming. By providing
material on par with textbooks for the more traditional approach, this project
helps to provide a basis for meaningful comparison between curricula based on
formal methods and other curricula.
