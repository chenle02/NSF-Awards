The apparent polar wander path for North America during the Late Cretaceous to
Paleocene interval contains a deflection or cusp that may reflect a period of
major plate reorganization. However, the resolution of the APW is insufficient
to demonstrate that portions on either side of the cusp are small circle paths
and that the cusp is a distinct break. This project will utilize several
volcanic sequences of Late Cretaceous to Eocene age in Montana to refine, using
standard paleomagnetic techniques, the North American Late Cretaceous apparent
polar wander path. The work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers
at the Michigan Technological University.
