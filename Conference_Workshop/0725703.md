The proposal is to fund the participation of mathematicians, based in the United
States, in the Lars Ahlfors Centennial Conference in Helsinki in August, 2007.

Ahlfors was the first Fields Medallist; his work has influenced and, indeed,
foreshadowed a major portion of modern mathematics. The emphasis of this
conference is to share the current intellectual streams which have their source
in or were redefined by Ahlfors' work --- the areas of expertise of the speakers
include partial differential equations and geometry, 3-dimensional topology,
iterations, quasiconformal mappings, percolations, probabilistic number theory,
string theory and too many areas of analysis to list. We expect that this
interaction will provide a cross-fertilization of the modern manifestations of
these ideas which are worthy of their roots.

It is astounding that near half of the Fields medallists have published papers
based on, or strongly influenced by, Ahlfors' work. The conference has been
organized so that participants can better understand why his work is so central
and how, through renewed interaction, it will continue to exert a major
influence on the future direction of mathematics.
