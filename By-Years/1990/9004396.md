This project is to deploy a moored array of current meters in the Brazil Basin
of the South Atlantic as an element in the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE) process study in the deep basin (DBE). This is an international effort
with contributions from France and FRG. A basic premise is that by carefully
measuring the amount and characteristics of the inflow into this basin, an
understanding of the cross-density flow may be obtained. This is an important
element in large scale modeling for climate purposes.
