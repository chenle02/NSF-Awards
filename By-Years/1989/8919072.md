For a relatively brief period, the central United States witnessed a
florescence of prehistoric culture focussed on the Mississippi river site of
Cahokia. The site, which dates to approximately 1000 A.D., may have been
inhabited by up to 50,000 individuals. It likely controlled a stretch of river
and hinterland of 250 miles in length, and the construction of temple mounds
indicates a stratified society with complex religious ritual. Dr. Milner and his
students will conduct archaeological research which will provide insight into
the Cahokia phenomenon and set it into a broader regional context. Over the
course of two summers, Dr. Milner, assisted by two graduate students, will visit
and study materials from a series of Cahokia related sites located in the
Mississippi River floodplain and adjacent tributary drainages. Although they
will visit many sites to examine surface remains and geographical situation,
they will rely primarily on data collected by previous excavators. They will
work at a number of institutions which house such materials and study both field
maps and notes as well as excavated remains. In particular they will focus on
ceramics and examine a large body of data using a single recording and analysis
scheme. This will allow direct cross site comparison. This research is important
for several reasons. First, it will address the archaeologically significant
question of how such complex societies as Cahokia arise and are maintained. Some
archaeologists have argued that the site of Cahokia itself exercised direct and
tight control over outlying settlements. Others postulate a more indirect rule
with a significant degree of local autonomy. Secondly, the project will make
maximal use of data collected by many investigators over a number of years, and
thus increases the significance and contribution of past work. Finally, the
project will assist in the scientific training of two graduate students.
