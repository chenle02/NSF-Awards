The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) is providing technical
assistance to key leaders in state education agencies (SEAs) to: 1) build SEA
leaders' knowledge about effective mathematical professional development
research; 2) deepen their understanding about necessary supports and structures
that should be in place at the SEA and district level to scale up reform efforts
needed to successfully implement the new college- and career-readiness
standards; and 3) enable SEA leaders to incorporate what they learn and analyze,
with the help of experts and peers, their existing mathematics college- and
career-readiness standards implementation plans to ensure their plans are
reflective of the research and best practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To reach
these goals, CCSSO is inviting two key leaders from each state to a national
meeting in the Washington, DC area where they will interact with and receive
feedback from national mathematics education experts and peers on how to
strengthen, revise and refine their standards implementation plans. The project
is guided by an advisory group consisting of a broad range of experts in
mathematics, mathematics research and mathematics practice. The project is
creating a tool that will allow state leaders to evaluate the quality of their
implementation plans based on research and promising practices. State teams have
access to the experts and CCSSO personnel following the national meeting as the
teams refine their implementation plans.
