For over half a century various digital communication techniques have been
developed to address reliable transmission over imperfect links. These
developments include information theory, practical source and channel coding
schemes, and various effective modulation techniques. Many different channel
models are considered in the literature extensively, and devised solutions have
been put to efficient practical use; impacting all aspects of the world we live
in today. Random insertions and/or deletions in addition to other, better
understood, channel impairments (e.g. noise, intersymbol interference, etc.) are
of utmost concern in many modern digital communication systems, including
recording channels, transmissions through the Internet, character recognition
systems, covert communications, and so on. The presence of insertions/deletions
is often the bottleneck for more efficient reliable communications and higher
areal densities in recording. Despite many advances over the past fifty years,
channels with deletions/insertions are still far from being fully understood. To
give a simple example, the capacity of a binary deletion channel is still
unknown, and no practical coding/decoding schemes with performance close to
available theoretical bounds are available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies insertion/deletion channels from both
an information theoretic point of view, and a channel coding perspective.
Specifically, it involves development of novel information theoretic results and
practical &lt;br/&gt;coding schemes for such channels, with extensions to
channels with intersymbol interference, additive noise, and other impairments.
Capacity approaching low density parity check (LDPC) and turbo coding schemes
are considered. In addition, a new set of interesting problems involving
insertions/deletions over wireless fading channels, including multi-input multi-
output (MIMO) communications, are formulated, and solutions are developed.
