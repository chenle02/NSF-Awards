This award funds a one-year Bridges for Engineering Education planning grant at
Oregon State University. This project aims to create a plan to address
fundamental curriculum changes needed in electrical and computer engineering.
The project will focus on laying a foundation using a team of faculty, staff,
and students from engineering and education programs on campus to identify,
using design research, details of research into curriculum development; and to
develop a plan for research that is centered on the cultural aspects of adoption
and dissemination of curriculum in the academic community.
