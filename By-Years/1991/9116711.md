The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria research project between
Drs.William H. Outlaw, Peter H. Homann of Florida State University (FSU), Dr.
Clanton C. Black of the University of Georgia, Dr. Andrew Maretzki of the
Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association (HSPA), and Drs. Mitko Nikolov Angelov,
Emanuil N. Karanov, Antoaneta B. M. Kroumova, and Liliana Todorova Maslenkova of
the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Institute of Plant Physiology (Sofia), is to
conduct biophysical, biochemical, and molecular biological investigations on
plant physiological processes that affect plant productivity. Specifically, the
researchers will study photosynthesis allocation and water stress, basic
disciplines which are relevant to agronomic productivity. This project in plant
physiology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine
complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
