This award to David Griffeath at the University of Wisconsin will support the
development of a user-friendly interface to the Cellular Automaton Machine
(CAM-8). The CAM is a parallel processing machine that was built to handle
problems modeling cellular automata. Cellular automata are rules, usually
spatially local in nature, which give rise to interesting and complex global
spatial dynamics. This interface will be developed in conjunction with
ecologists and will focus on models of interest to them. This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research will investigate the potential for the cellular automata in
modeling and understanding ecological processes with complex spatial dynamics.
