This project permits surveying engineering students to have a labortory
experience of applying photogrammetric methods to computer aided mapping and
geographic information systems. The project lab includes a fast, versatile
computer aided analytical stereoplotter. With this equipment, students
experiment with stereo models and with generating and manipulating digital
terrain data bases. In combination with other existing equipment, advanced
students monitor structural deformations, measure underwater structures and
analyze human body and joint movements for bioengineering studies. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
