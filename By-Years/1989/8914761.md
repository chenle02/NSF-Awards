Quantitative measurements of the initial stages of crystal growth, surface
diffusion and surface reactions will be made on some selected metal-
semiconductor and semiconductor-semiconductor systems. These studies will use
new surface analytical measurements based on a unique UHV-SEM-STEM instrument,
employing thin film and bulk crystallographic orientations and step
configurations. Analysis of nucleation densities, diffusion profiles and Ostwald
ripening will enable accurate adsorption, diffusion and binding energies of
adatoms. Initial systems to be studied include silver deposited on silicon(111)
and germanium(111), germanium on silicon(100), the formation of nickel and
cobalt silicides on silicon, and the use of buffer layers to prevent silicide
formation in these magnetic systems. These studies will be at near-atomic
resolution.
