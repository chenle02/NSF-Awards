We are proposing the Mariana Vent Larvae (MarVeL) Workshop to catalyze new
collaborations between multi-disciplinary research groups from the U.S. and
Japan, with the goal to develop a coordinated plan to study connectivity between
hydrothermal vents in a region of high priority to the international community.
S. Mitarai will serve as local host for the workshop in Okinawa. Our goal is to
propose a coordinated research plan to our respective government agencies for an
interdisciplinary and international study focused on the Mariana vents. These
are the only vents in a marine protected area in U.S. waters. Our combined
expertise and resources will enable insight into larval biology and dispersal in
the deep sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a history of U.S. and Japanese
research interests in the Mariana region, with collaborations generally
involving geo-scientists (e.g., marine geology, geochemistry) and focusing on
seafloor processes. Our collaboration involving physical oceanographers and
biophysical modelers will extend studies up into the water column. Women
scientists and early career scientists (postdoctoral researchers and graduate
students) from both the U.S. and Japan will participate at the workshop.
