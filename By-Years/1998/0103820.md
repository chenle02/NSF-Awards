This proposal addresses one simple question: how can we develop effective multi-
agent systems out of the exception-prone (buggy, malicious, or simply "dumb")
agents and infrastructures we can expect to encounter in open system contexts?
This problem will be addressed by developing technologies that can determine, at
run time, what exceptions can occur, as well as what exception detection and
resolution strategies are appropriate, for a dynamically changing agent
population and system environment. This work will build on two key ideas: (1) it
is possible to identify highly reusable domain-independent exception handling
expertise, and (2) this expertise can be instantiated in the form of distinct
exception handling services that outsource exception handling from the agents,
requiring only that they adhere to some relatively simple guidelines. The
potential impact of this work will include (1) enabling the creation of multi-
agent systems that can function effectively in open contexts, while (2) reducing
the burden on agent developers by obviating the need to create agents with
sophisticated exception handling capabilities.
