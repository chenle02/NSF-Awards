9553537 Shahin The College of Misericordia in Dallas, Pennsylvania, will
initiate a four-week, residential Young Scholars program serving twenty students
entering 10th grade in the summers of 1996 and 1997. The disciplinary foci are
in biology and mathematics, emphasizing the use of difference equations and
matrices to analyze biological relationships in animal physiology and
homeostasis. Students will interact with scientists, teachers, career
professionals, and college students and develop an appropriate research proposal
for an investigation to be implemented the following academic year.
