This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will conduct exploratory
research aimed at testing; a) the feasibility of developing finite element code
in a massively parallel environment; b) the feasibility of using ATM as a data
transfer protocol. This will be the first attempt toward exploting massively
parallel environments and high performance computing in constructing a test-bed
for networked, real-time, physically-based virtual reality.
