Association&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RI: Infrastructure 2002: NSF CISE/EIA RI and
MII PI Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation has
requested assistance to coordinate the Principle Investigator's meeting for the
Research Infrastructure and Minority Institutions Infrastructure programs. The
PI meeting is a chance to bring researchers together to learn about the work of
other research projects, and to provide a forum to discuss new ideas and future
directions of the programs. CRA proposes to act as the organizer of the annual
RI/MII PI Workshop. CRA is in a unique position to carry out the workshop
support. Their organizational mission is to support research and advanced
education in computing, and it brings them in contact with many of the
departments represented in the RI and MII programs. This workshop will be held
at the Cliff Lodge at Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort in Snowbird, Utah on July
12 - 14, 2002.
