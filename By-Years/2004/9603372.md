This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in materials theory
involves Michael Widom of Carnegie Mellon University and Remy Mosseri of the
University of Paris VII. The award provides travel support and living expenses
to Dr. Widom and his graduate student. The objective of the research is the
study of quasicrystals, which are novel aluminum-based alloys that exhibit
quasiperiodic structures. The project addresses problems of counting and
dynamics of tilings. The U.S. and French investigators bring to this
collaboration complementary expertise in atomic level modeling and theory. The
project will advance understanding of the physical and mathematical structure of
quasicrystals.
