This award provides support for the Fifth International Conference on
Structural Safety and Reliability (ICOSSAR '89). The ICOSSAR conferences are
international in participation and significance, and also cover all
technological areas with regard to problems of structural safety and
reliability. The forthcoming conference will emphasize the implementation and
application of reliability-based design and analysis. This is expected to help
establish methods of mitigating the potential loss of property, human life and
societal productivity arising from the functional and physical failure of
critical engineering systems due to multiple natural and man-made hazards. The
subject of structural safety and reliability and related applications of
probabilistic analysis are now much more widely recognized as an important part
of engineering and engineering education. The conference will greatly enhance
the potential of engineering applications of safety and reliability of
structures.
