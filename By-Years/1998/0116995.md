Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0116995&lt;br/&gt;J. Lopez, Arizona State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is one part of a
collaborative research effort between Dr. Lopez of Arizona State University and
Dr. Hirsa of Rensselaer and (CTS-0116947) on the effects of bulk flow on
monolayer formation at gas/liquid interfaces. These two are renewal proposals
for the present Grants CTS-9803478 at Rensselaer and CTS-9896259 at
ASU.&lt;br/&gt;The present grants focus on the experimental and
theoretical/computational study of interfacial transport properties of
monolayers of insoluble surfactants on the air/water interface. It is proposed
to extend the study to the effect of bulk liquid flow on the self-assembled
monolayers along the air/liquid interface. Dr. Hirsa will carry out experimental
investigations and Dr. Lopez will perform theoretical/computational
studies.&lt;br/&gt;
