The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholars Program

This project is creating an environment for success for academically talented,
yet disadvantaged engineering, mathematics, and computer science students by
matching them with an engineer or scientist to work side by side on a research
project as well as actively participate in academic and professional development
activities. Further, each CSEM Scholar has an industrial mentor who works with
the scholar for professional development. These activities provide experience
and foster confidence in each recipient thereby producing better qualified and
well- rounded graduates to enter the workforce or graduate school.
