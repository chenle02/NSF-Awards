This US-Hungary Joint Fund research project on Spin Density Waves in Low
Dimensional Solids will be conducted by Dr. Gyorgy Mihaly, Central Research
Institute for Solid State Physics, Budapest, and Professor Kazumi Maki,
University of Southern California, Los Angeles. This effort will feature the
theoretical aspects of collective electrical properties in low dimensional
systems. The researchers will explore two basic features of the spin density
wave excitation: a) Coulomb effects in the low temperature nonlinear conduction
and b) the unusual low-frequency response below the gap energy, including weak
relaxation processes. Results leading to separation of thermal effects and the
influence of thermally excited screening carriers should contribute to our
understanding of spin density wave dynamics. This research in solid state
physics fulfills the US-Hungary Joint Fund's program objective of advancing
science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Hungary to combine
complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. Funds for the project are provided through the US-
Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with established guidelines.
