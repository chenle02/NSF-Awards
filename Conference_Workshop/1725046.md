This award provides support for the U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and junior researchers to participate in the conference "Reaction-
Diffusion, Propagation, Modelling" that will take place at the Institut Henri
Poincare, November 20-24, 2017, in Paris, France. Reaction-diffusion equations
serve as a mathematical description of many phenomena in nature and society. The
emphasis of the conference is on novel mathematical models in theoretical
biology, economics and social sciences. The list of invited speakers at the
conference includes many prominent applied scientists and applied
mathematicians, as well as leading experts in the area of partial differential
equations (PDE). The principal goals of the conference are to further the
synergistic interaction between the applied and theoretical approaches, review
some very important recent achievements in nonlinear PDE and their applications,
and to discuss the future directions of this scientific area. 

The list of speakers comprises a mix of generations, from highly prominent
senior mathematicians to junior researchers.  Six out of the nineteen confirmed
speakers are female mathematicians.  The conference discussions will cover a
broad spectrum of topics: Fronts in unconventional models in life and social
sciences, nonlocal diffusion equations, dynamics of accelerating fronts, fronts
and singularities in evolutionary biology, and nonlocal models in fluid
mechanics, among others. The relatively small number of talks over five days
will give the participants a time to have deeper discussions, than for standard,
more compressed conference schedules. This will facilitate interactions and
collaboration between the applied scientists and relatively pure mathematicians.
The conference will provide for junior American participants an invaluable
experience of interacting with their European peers and with senior scientists,
thus broadening their professional training. The conference website is
