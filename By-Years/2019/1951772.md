This project examines the magnitude, patterns, processes, and experiences of
displaced migrant youth. The project considers the factors driving child and
youth migration and displacement across various border spaces, and within
broader legal, socio-cultural, political, and economic contexts. The project
provides training, mentorship, and professional development to a postdoctoral
researcher and to undergraduate and graduate students. Findings will be
disseminated widely through academic and other outlets. The research will
provide insights relevant to border security and service providers working with
displaced youth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projectâ€™s primary research objective
is to discern the magnitude, spatial geographic patterns, contexts, and
processes of migrant youth in borderlands while mapping the geographies of youth
migration and displacement. To do so, this study employs a mixed-methods
approach integrating youth-centered methodologies including art based
ethnographic tools, participatory workshops, and oral histories with youth; GIS
and story mapping; key informant interviews; participant observation; and
immigration courtroom ethnographies. Additionally, the project will utilize
innovative participatory approaches to develop child-centered methodological
tools specific to facilitating integration of youth perspectives into wider
migration studies. Results will make theoretical and methodological
contributions to migration/refugee studies and children/youth studies, within
and beyond geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
