The Gordon Research Conferences, initiated in the late 1920's by Dr. Neil E.
Gordon, promote discussions and the free exchange of ideas at the research
frontiers of the biological, chemical and physical sciences. Scientists with
common professional interests come together for a full week of intense
discussion and examination of the most advanced aspects of their field. These
Conferences, which are usually held in small isolated New England towns away
from other distractions, are attended by graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, junior investigators and senior scientists, and provide a valuable
means of disseminating information and ideas. This award represents full or
partial support of seventeen conferences in the biological sciences, being held
in the summer of 2004.
