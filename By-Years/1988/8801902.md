Sperms of flowering plants will be isolated from pollen in their native state
and will be used to perform in vitro fertilization. The two dimorphic sperms
will be characterized to understand better the double-fertilization process in
flowering plants. Results from this investigation have potential use in
agriculture and biotechnology.
