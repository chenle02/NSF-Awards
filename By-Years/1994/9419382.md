9419382 Lesher The program has as its goal to provide experimental constraints
on the polybaric differentiation histories of North Atlantic magmas, and to
evaluate geodynamic models of plume-initiated rifting of the Greenland-European
continent. Two experimental studies will be conducted. First, the melting
systematics of garnet lherzolite will be characterized at conditions inderred
for the early Tertiary "Iceland" plume using the diamond aggregate technique to
determine the compositions of low degree melt fractions for garnet lherzolite.
Second, the partitioning of high field strength, rare earth, and transition
group elements between basaltic liquids, clinopyroxene, and garnet will be
measured up to 4.5 Gpa. The data obtained in this study are expected to have
wider applications in the field of igneous petrology, geochemistry, and
terrestrial and marine geology.
