Choline acetyltranferase is the enzyme that produces the important
neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The nervous system uses this neurotransmitter
for communication between neurons in the brain and also for signalling organs
throughout the body. Nervous system disease, such as Parkinson's, epilepsy and
Alzheimer's, often shows a loss of neurotransmitters and their associated cells.
For these reasons, the conditions that allow and enhance the expression of
neurotransmitter.synthetic enzymes, are important to understand; they are
indicators of neuronal cell health and may well be the reason why neurons die in
some brain diseases. The research outlined is designed to exploit newly gained
information regarding choline acetyltransferase. This enzyme is processed
multiple times by healthy neurons, and the absence of such processing is
corellated with nervous system disease states. The proposed work will delineate
the nature of the processing and provide the necessary information to begin
identifying intracellular processing sites. Antibodies to the enzyme's precursor
will be produced so that this newly discovered enzyme form can be identified and
studied. These reagents can be used at the cellular level to determine the
location of the precursor and what organelles are responsible for the
processing.
