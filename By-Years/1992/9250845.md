This project involves the acquisition and installation of a computer-based
instrumentation and control system in an Energy Conversion/Electric Power
Systems Laboratory. The system will be capable of direct data acquisition
through A/D converters, data collection from other instruments over an IEEE-488
bus, and closed loop control of electric machines through variable speed
drives.Using the computer for data collection relieves the student of the very
time consuming and tedious chore of reading instruments and recording values.
The computer makes short work of the data analysis, and the student quickly sees
the quality of the data. A major goal of this project is to ensure that the
student is not allowed to divorce herself/himself from the experiment. The
computer must enhance the study of the concepts and be as transparent as
possible.
