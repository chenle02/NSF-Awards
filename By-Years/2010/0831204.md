Many applications of social networks require relationship anonymity due to the
sensitive or confidential nature of relationship. Anonymizing graphs by
replacing the identifying information of the nodes with random ids does not
guarantee privacy since the identification of the nodes can be seriously
jeopardized by applying subgraph attacks. This project is exploring new
approaches with novel applications of matrix perturbation and spectrum analysis
in privacy preserving social network analysis, and is developing new effective
techniques and tools for edge-based social network randomization. Specifically,
the project is investigating how well edge-based randomization protects link
privacy and how much it affects the graph's utility. Utility loss is quantified
by focusing on the change of the spectrum and eigenvectors of networks since
both the spectrum and eigenvectors have close relation with many real space
graph characteristics. Further, the project is developing spectrum/utility
preserving randomization methods which can better preserve graph characteristics
without sacrificing much privacy protection. The research is advancing the
theoretical understanding of fundamental issues related to both privacy and
spectral analysis of social networks and the design and implementation of
practical edge-based randomization techniques for publishing social network
data. The research also involves, through courses and thesis projects, graduate
and undergraduate students to enhance their knowledge and skills in privacy
preserving social network analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
