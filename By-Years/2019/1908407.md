This research will improve our understanding of how misinformation becomes woven
into narratives online, how technology influences this process, and how design
might be used to alter it. Online misinformation can influence public health
attitudes, potentially costing billions of dollars and numerous lives. Online
narratives are a critical object of inquiry because narratives are fundamental
to how people construct socially shared belief systems, and they can be the
primary means by which misinformation is spread online. It is therefore
imperative that we develop a better understanding of the interplay between
attitudes, misinformation, and narratives in the online social contexts. This
research will contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions among
technologically mediated social systems and public health attitudes, leading
directly to new insights about how to design sociotechnical strategies for
correcting misinformation that is embedded within them. More generally, this
proposal will begin to explore how different design features interact with the
production of narratives in the context of misinformation. Most importantly,
this research will generate a set of insights about how the design of online
networks can influence the correction of misinformation of many kinds.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will span a series of crowd-based experiments
to investigate how people in online networks work together to combine
misinformation to create and defend public health narratives. These experiments
leverage a novel research platform for examining how people in online networks
combine information to create coherent stories. The studies will consider three
research questions: (1) How does information diffuse in the context of other,
connected pieces of information? (2) How do different signals about information
credibility influence the creation of stories? (3) How do network diversity and
the content of corrective messages influence attempts to correct misinformation
embedded in socially shared stories? All of these studies consider how existing
public health attitudes influence the way that people in online networks process
public health information. This work will extend current models of information
contagion to account for the fact that individual pieces of information to which
individuals are exposed depend on one another as well as the background
knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of receivers. The project will also consider
how designed social signals, such as the number of 'likes' a post receives, and
pre-existing attitudes interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
