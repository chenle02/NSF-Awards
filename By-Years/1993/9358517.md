9358517 Philipp knowledge for teaching has been an area of much research in the
past decade. Today some of the domains of knowledge identified include knowledge
of subject matter, pedagogical content knowledge, knowledge of the curriculum,
and knowledge of learners. Research has shown that experimental teachers who
have had access to research about students' thinking within well- defined
mathematical content domains listen to children explain their mental processes
used when solving problems and accept a larger variety of strategies than
control teachers. These experimental teachers also spend less time during class
on drill activities and more time on problem solving. The research extending
this work to preservice teachers is just emerging, and one area that has not yet
been investigated is the relationship between teachers' content knowledge,
pedagogical content knowledge, conceptions of mathematics, and understanding of
students' mathematical thinking. This project will research the relationship
between preservice teachers' mathematics content knowledge, their pedagogical
content knowledge, their conceptions of mathematics, and their understanding of
students' mathematical thinking at different points during their teacher
preparation. These findings will be compared to the relationship between these
forms of knowledge possessed by inservice teachers. This knowledge/belief will
be operationalized through videotapes of preservice and inservice teachers
interviewing and tutoring children.
