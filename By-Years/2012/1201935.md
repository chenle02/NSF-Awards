Research Objectives and Approaches. The objective of this research is to
demonstrate that high-performance, safe electrochemical double layer capacitors
(supercapacitors) can be effectively fabricated on flexible substrates,
transforming the rigid and bulky sealed devices of today into lightweight,
solid-state energy storage platforms. The approach is to utilize the in situ
immobilization of an ionic liquid in contact with high surface area electrodes
to form a flexible ionogel electrolyte.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.
Electrochemical double layer capacitors can meet the needs of many charge
storage applications, bridging a gap in performance between batteries with high
energy densities and ceramic capacitors that can provide high power through
rapid discharge. Preliminary results indicate that ionogel capacitive behavior
can be nearly equivalent to that of the neat ionic liquid, in spite of the
electrolyte phase transformation from a liquid to a gel. This project seeks to
further optimize ionogel performance by widening the range of gel formulations
currently under study, to understand the capacitive behavior at the gel
electrolyte/electrode interface, and to integrate thin ionogel electrolyte films
into fully flexible device architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.
This work will make an immediate and lasting impact on the field of flexible
electronics and advance the development of ionogels as high performance solid
electrolyte materials. Research activities will be integrated with science
education, student training, and outreach to a broader audience through on-
campus interaction with underrepresented minority high school students, graduate
student leadership at a local energy conference, and development of new course
materials.
