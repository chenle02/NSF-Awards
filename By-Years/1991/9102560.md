It is proposed to run an eddy-resolving primitive equation numerical model to
examine the influence of outcropping on mid- latitude jet separation. The effect
of seasonal heat flux variation on outcropping will be examined. Realistic wind
forcing will be achieved by adding a thermodynamically active top layer.
