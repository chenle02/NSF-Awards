In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability
Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Frank Leibfarth from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology will develop recyclable solid supports for the efficient
and economical production of complex molecules, including polysaccharides,
peptides and oligonucleotides. This award has support from: the Directorate for
Engineering; and the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Science
in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will combine solid phase
synthesis on a polymer support with dynamic covalent chemistry with a continuous
flow system to carry out the reactions that create the target molecules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to
develop better, more efficient methods for the synthesis of complex molecules
(e.g. pharmaceuticals) with minimum production of chemical
waste.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Leibfarth will be working with collaborators
Prof. Timothy F. Jamison of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts
Institute of and Dr. Sejal Patel of Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research.
Dr. Leibfarth will also work with the MIT Office of Engineering Outreach as well
as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers on educational projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science,
Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program,
with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that
lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the
necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this
project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves
in an independent research career related to sustainability.
