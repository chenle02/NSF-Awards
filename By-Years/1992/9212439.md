A sample holder is constructed for a transmission electron microscope that will
allow ex-situ, controlled atmosphere studies of environmentally sensitive
materials. The device has capabilities, in particular the ability to treat
samples at atmospheric pressure, that are not available at national microscopy
facilities and offers an advance in electron microscopy design. The modified
electron microscope will be used to study morphology of metal particles in
heterogeneous catalysis, corrosive interactions of metal surfaces, and the
influence of environment on dispersed phases of oxides.
