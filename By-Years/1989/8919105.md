The central focus of this research is to obtain a better understanding of the
formation of micro- or macro-structures for several classes of polymers and
their transformation by application of mechanical stress, electric field or
heat. The ultimate goal is to obtain a general model incorporating cooperativity
and capable of defining the molecular mechanism responsible for macroscopic
mechanical-electrical (piezoelectric) or mechanical-optical behavior of
polymers. The research is to be carried out in several stages: 1. Technique
development to measure structural changes with high precision and temporal
resolution; 2. Clear definition of sample morphology; 3. Measurement of the
response of chain conformation or segmental orientation of each structural
subunit when stressed; 4. Comparison of experimental data to presently available
theories to develop more complete models. The characterization of syndiotactic
poly(styrene), which exhibits several solid-solid phase transformations, will be
carried out. Identification of parameters governing mechanically induced
polarization, or its converse, electrical field induced stress, for
piezoelectric polymers will also be a primary area of investigation. These
experimental data will be initially analyzed using a cooperative transition
model.
