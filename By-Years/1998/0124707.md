This recommendation memo provides support and justification for funding the
Principal Investigator to participate in a DELOS Digital Libraries Workshop to
be held in San Cassiano, Italy in June, 2001. This meeting, entitled "Digital
Libraries: Future Research Directions for a European Research Programme," is
expected to be a seminal event for producing the core intellectual agenda and
operational framework for the next phase of European activities in digital
libraries research and applications. The US and EU agendas are naturally linked
by common goals to achieve interoperability at the networking, systems, content,
usage and other stages in the information lifecycle. A long-term overall goal is
the development of shared resources for a global information cyber-
infrastructure. The meeting is being organized by the DELOS Network of
Excellence on Digital Libraries, in cooperation with the Cultural Heritage
Applications Unit of the 5th FP IST Programme of the European
Commission.&lt;br/&gt;
