The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are new and
innovative products that support sustainable agriculture through precise,
automated livestock herd management. Beef cattle is anticipated to be the
initial application as beef cattle are largely inspected and managed manually.
This is a labor-intensive process and can be prone to mistakes, as lose of
tracking of animals in the pastures and rangelands. There is a lack of
commercially viable technologies for tracking and monitoring cattle beyond a
relatively short range. This innovation directly addresses this shortfall
through location tracking and providess health monitoring of individual animals
over long distances, enabling beef producers to save management time and labor,
avoid losses, maximize herd fertility and nutrition, and sustainably manage
rangelands to prevent environmental damage.

This I-Corps project develops a new technology platform that generates high
quality, geospatially enabled data with the ability to significantly advance the
scientific understanding of livestock productivity and management. This
innovation applies recent advances in internet of things (IoT) communications
and mobile computing hardware to create a low-power system that collects,
analyzes and transmits animal health and location information. This innovation
builds upon research that demonstrated the feasibility and design path for the
technical approach, and initial animal testing that demonstrated sensor
functionality for non-invasive data collection from livestock. The platform has
potential to determine biomarkers for early detection of disease, quantify the
effect of external stressors on livestock fertility and productivity, enable
tools and and procedures for automated/machine-assisted herding, and quantify
the ecological benefit of sustainable grazing practices. Sufficiently large
datasets will enable advanced algorithms for assessing animal health states.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
