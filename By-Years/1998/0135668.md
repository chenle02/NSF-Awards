As a component of the State Department's contribution to the World Summit
in&lt;br/&gt;Johannesburg (September 2002), this study will examine the
geographic foundation for&lt;br/&gt;natural resource management and development
issues in Africa. Specific examples will&lt;br/&gt;be drawn from case-study
regions where USAID and other agencies have broad&lt;br/&gt;experience. Centered
on a place-based, integrative framework, the study will draw
on&lt;br/&gt;experiences of U.S. government agencies, international groups,
decision-makers, and&lt;br/&gt;experts to examine 1) existing remote-sensing and
GIS efforts in case-study regions, and&lt;br/&gt;lessons learned from those
efforts, 2) existing levels of local expertise and technology,&lt;br/&gt;and
ongoing efforts in geospatial capacity building, 3) a range of questions
relating to the&lt;br/&gt;practical application of new and existing spatial data
(e.g. required resolution, challenges&lt;br/&gt;of integrating layers of
environmental and social data, and baseline data against which&lt;br/&gt;future
change can be measured); 4) the role of decision support systems in the
application&lt;br/&gt;of these data; and 5) options for making efforts
sustainable beyond 2002.&lt;br/&gt;
