Cryptography protects confidential communications: electronic commerce, voter
information, diplomatic communication, human-rights interviews, medical records,
and much more. However, attackers recording messages today will be able to
decrypt those messages with future quantum computers. The most confidence-
inspiring response is the McEliece cryptosystem, which has a strong security
track record and is a leading contender for standardization of post-quantum
cryptography, but this cryptosystem has a key size around a megabyte.
Applications that cannot afford megabyte keys are currently forced to use
cryptosystems whose security is much less stable. This project aims to build new
post-quantum systems that bring McEliece's security stability and confidence to
a wider range of applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The public key in McEliece's
cryptosystem is a generator matrix for a subfield subcode of an error-correcting
code, specifically a genus-0 Goppa code. Subfield subcodes of higher-genus Goppa
codes can correct more errors for the same code length and code dimension,
improving the tradeoffs between efficiency and security. Showing that
cryptosystems built from these codes can run at reasonable speed will require
vertically integrated optimization of cryptosystem design, curve selection,
decoding algorithms, algorithms for computer algebra, and vectorized software,
with the further challenges of ensuring security against both mathematical and
microarchitectural attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
