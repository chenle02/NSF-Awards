The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the National Member Organization
representing the United States in the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis (IIASA), an international research institute located in
Laxenburg, Austria. The NAS carries out its membership responsibilities through
the U.S. Committee for IIASA, housed in the Board on International Scientific
Organizations (BISO). These responsibilities take two forms: participating in
governance of the Institute through participation in the IIASA Council and
direct interaction with the organization; and facilitating and encouraging U.S.
interest in IIASA's activities. The goals of this award, to be performed by BISO
and the U.S. Committee for IIASA, reflect both the IIASA Strategic Plan,
2021-2030 and the BISO Strategic Plan, 2019-2024, and are to help build and
promote strong science programs at IIASA, and to strengthen and promote a strong
U.S.-international, IIASA-related network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IIASA has made
and continues to make important contributions to complex global issues by using
a systems analysis approach to advance and inform both science and policy and
covering topics of societal importance such as food and water security,
biodiversity and sustainability, systemic risk and resilience, and climate
change and population. IIASAâ€™s goal is for its research to be used for policy
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
