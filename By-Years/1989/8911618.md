In this proposal a plasma chemical vapor deposition diamond growth system will
be developed. It will consist in general of a microwave source, Astex plasma
chamber, high vacuum system, and various hydrocarbon gases. Once the growth
system has been developed, the deposition of thin film diamond onto various
substrates will be carried out. This will involve the optimization of several
growth parameters such as; gas flow rate, vacuum system pressure position of the
substrate with respect to the plasma, time, energy density, types of hydrocarbon
gases, and gas ratio to insure single crystal diamond growth. To determine the
characteristics of the thin film depositions a variety of materials and related
measurements will be performed.
