Differential equations play a central role in mathematics and its applications,
for example, in differential geometry and mathematical physics. Fully nonlinear
elliptic and parabolic equations are some of the main equations under current
investigations by researchers. Building on the recent progress, in this project
the principal investigator will establish general existence and regularity
results for these equations on real or complex manifolds and develop technical
tools which can be applied to solve other types of equations. Results in this
project will yield interesting applications in geometry and help to understand
general partial differential equations.

A central issue in solving fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations is
to establish a priori estimates which present great challenges due to the high
nonlinearity of the equations and the general geometry of the manifolds as well
as their boundaries. The project's goal is to search for new methods to overcome
these difficulties. In particular, it will identify the optimal conditions under
which one can solve the equations on general manifolds. The principal
investigator also plans to study a very general class of equations on which few
results are known, and attack some difficult problems in complex geometry.
