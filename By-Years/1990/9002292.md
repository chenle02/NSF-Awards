The reseach concerns the computational complexity of feasible computations. The
objectives of this project are twofold: to establish a firm complexity theoretic
underpinning for public-key cryptography; to reveal the rich structure that
individual complexity classes, such as NP, appear to have, and to increase
understanding of the structural relations between low-level complexity classes.
One emphasis will be to continue research in structural complexity theory that
lays a foundation for cryptography. The approach is to base the investigation of
existence of cryptographic assumptions (or primitives) directly on structural
properties of complexity classes, rather than on presumed intractability of
individual concrete problems.
