9550694 Community School District 23 (C.S.D. 23) situated in the Oceanhill-
Brownsville community of Brooklyn, New York, proposes to implement a summer
science camp. This project will increase students' interest in and exposure to
science, engineering and mathematics. The proposed science camp will serve 120
students from Junior High School 263 and intermediate School 284 in this school
district. The primary goal of the project is to stimulate an interest in
mathematics, science and engineering for middle grade students, and to encourage
project participants to consider science, math, and engineering as possible
career choices. The major focus of the project is an enriched interdisciplinary
math, science, engineering, and technology multi-media program. Activities
include: 1) Instruction through an integrated/interdisciplinary curriculum; 2)
Student centered classroom activities; 3) Professional development and
instructional workshops; 4) Involvement of parents and community members as role
models and mentors for minority students; 5) Career exploration through
interaction with scientists, mathematicians and engineers; 6) Urban
environmental studies; and 7) Activities focused on research methodology
utilizing computers. Project participants will experience the excitement of
"doing science" in the areas of science, engineering, mathematics and
technology. Students will be paired with teachers of physical science, computer
science, engineering, math, and technology from various institutions of higher
education. ***
