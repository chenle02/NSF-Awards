The project's research covers several topics in mathematics and is focused on
the study of probabilistic, geometric, and information-theoretic aspects of high
dimensional phenomena, including concentration of measure and asymptotic
behavior of various functions of a growing number of random variables. The
concentration tools are the subject of many exciting developments, since they
help explore most essential properties of general complex systems where
randomness of their numerous small parts results in a stable limit behavior.
Being connected with challenging mathematical problems, this research area has
proved to be very useful for applications in other fields such as statistics,
information theory, computer science, machine learning. One of the objectives of
the project is to clarify the role of growing dimension as a unifying source in
high-dimensional models and, in particular, its influence on the entire
evolution in time as opposed to local rules. Proposed research will have a
broader impact by creating new connections between different mathematical fields
and providing them with powerful interdisciplinary tools. The project will also
have an important impact on educating in mathematical sciences. More
specifically, the investigator intends to develop new advanced concentration
tools for spaces with sufficiently many symmetries including Grassmanian
manifolds. It is planned to apply them in the study of global properties of
multidimensional projections for log-concave and more general hyperbolic
measures, that are related to the thin shell (variance) problem and the K-L-S
conjecture of Kannan, Lovasz and Simonovits. Another sort of applications deals
with randomized models of summation for dependent data under correlation
conditions. Part of the project is devoted to limit theorems and asymptotic
expansions in the central limit theorem for information-theoretic distances such
as the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler distance) and relative Fisher
information, which will be accompanied by proper Berry-Esseen bounds. The
project also deals with Edgeworth-type expansions and informational bounds in
the problem of Poisson approximation. The proposed themes refer either to long-
standing open problems or to challenging questions related to recent
developments.
