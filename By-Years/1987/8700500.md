The principal investigators propose a novel digital speech coding and
compression technique for mobile voice communications applications to generate
high quality and natural sounding speech over a wide range of bit rates. The
technique uses quadrature mirror filters to partition speech into several
subbands. Each band is then individually coded using Adaptive Predictive Coding
with Multi-Pulse-Excitation. Their preliminary results from Phase I indicate
that the technique provides near-toll quality speech at bit rates of 12.0
kbits/s and above, communication quality at 8.0 kbits/s, and synthetic quality
at 2.4 kbits/s. The technique is robust to bit errors up to an error rate of 5 x
10E-03. Phase II will extend the above findings to a real-time implementation
using digital signal processors. During this phase they will also investigate
economical implementations for commercialization.
