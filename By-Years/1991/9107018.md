The primary objective of this US-Hungary Joint Fund research project between
Zsolt Bor, JAIF University, and Walter E. Bron, University of California,
Irvine, is to investigate methods for increasing the wavelength coverage of a
laser system. Methods will include a modified version of a recently developed
coupled-cavity mode locking, the use of the traveling wave excited amplified
spontaneous emission as wide-spectrum probe light, and new frequency conversion
schemes for ultrashort pulses. This project in the field of laser physics
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
competence.
