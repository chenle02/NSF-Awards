Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Cunningham, Brian&lt;br/&gt;1512043&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this proposal is to develop a novel approach for coupling multiple
optical cavities together to enhance the excitation of fluorescent emitters used
for biological and chemical detection. Wavelength-tuned external cavity lasers,
photonic crystal resonator surfaces, and gold nanorods are combined to
demonstrate large enhanced fluorescence detection of
proteins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface-based fluorescence assays and surface
enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are widely used in life science research,
molecular diagnostics, and microscopy. There is strong motivation to improve
their detection sensitivity while at the same time reducing the cost/complexity
of detection instrumentation. This project would develop and characterize a
fundamentally new approach towards excitation of surface-adsorbed photon
emitters and scatterers that can be applied towards surface-based fluorescent
and SERS assays for biomolecular analytes used in life science research,
genomics, proteomics, diagnostics, and environmental monitoring. The approach
incorporates inexpensively manufacturable nanostructured surfaces and an
nexpensive, compact detection instrument that will facilitate broad adoption.
The project involves graduate research, undergraduate internships, integration
of laboratory demonstrations into undergraduate courses, and activities that
involve hands-on demonstrations to middle school children.
