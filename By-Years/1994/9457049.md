This National Science Foundation Young Investigator project is in the general
area of surface chemistry, with a specific focus on the characterization of
semiconductor surfaces. During the five-year tenure of this award, Professor
Maboudian and her students will carry out fundamental studies on the interaction
of hydrogen and hydrocarbons with indium-antimony surfaces, which serve as
useful models for gallium arsenide semiconductors. This chemistry will be
explored using a wide range of surface sensitive techniques, such as x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, Auger, and high
resolution electron energy loss spectrometry. The use of self-assembled
monolayers to provide unreactive, defect free semiconductor surfaces will also
be explored during the course of this research project. This project, in the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, should yield
important insights into the structure of semiconductor materials that are of
great importance in the electronics industry. Additionally, this award will
enable Professor Maboudian to further her overall professional development as a
researcher and educator at the University of California at Berkeley.
