The Center for Science Education at the Education Development Center (EDC)
proposes a renewal of the EDC K-12 Science Curriculum Dissemination Center for a
final year. The Center has supported the dissemination and implementation of
research-based science materials in small, rural, geographically isolated and
poor K-12 school districts. The Center works through eight regional hubs to
reach rural areas in or adjacent to the following states: Colorado, New Mexico,
Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oregon, Washington, Montana,
Iowa, South Dakota, Alabama, Florida and Georgia. In the original grant the
Center worked to (1) increase the number of school districts knowledgeable about
research-based K-12 science curriculum and help them to critically assess the
materials; (2) increase the number of districts piloting, adopting or
implementing such materials; and (3) enhance the capacity of local resource
providers to support curriculum implementation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
renewal will shift the Center's work to building the capacity of district and
regional science education leaders to support the high-quality implementation of
these science curricula. In the final year the Center will:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase the science leadership capacity of teachers
and administrators from strategically selected school districts to address high-
quality curriculum implementation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Increase the capacity
of the hubs and regional resource providers to support and sustain improvements
in science education in their regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Increase outreach
to national educational associations to influence their support of science
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
