Social scientists have long theorized about the influence of networks on
behavior, how they sustain cooperation, transmit information, and facilitate
economic transactions. With the increasing availability of network data in a
variety of social contexts, scientists now have the opportunity to subject
theory to rigorous empirical testing and uncover new facts to improve
understanding of social behavior and better design economic policies to advance
the national welfare. Toward this end, this research develops new econometric
tools for the analysis of network models, especially models of network
formation. New tools are needed to account for the unique structure of network
data and complexity of network models.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigator
studies econometric models of network formation with strategic interactions.
These are latent-index models that allow links formed by other individuals to
directly influence one's own propensity to form links. A main objective of this
research is to prove a central limit theorem relevant for inference both in
static models which use as data only a single snapshot of a large network, and
dynamic models which exploit a short time series of a large network. The
investigator also develops practical methods for inference. In studying the
dependence structure of large networks, this research is also relevant for
inference in models of social interactions when the network is
endogenous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
