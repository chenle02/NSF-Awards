This is an nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the structure, dynamics,
and electronic states in quantum-confined small clusters and icosohedral alloys.
The research will involve development of sophisticated NMR techniques that will
allow the resolution of atomic environments characteristic of interior atoms in
clusters as well as surface atoms. By separately monitoring the interior and the
surface, it will be possible to understand the bulk and surface melting process
and to investigate the lattice dynamics near the melting point. Th double
resonance technique and refinements thereof wil be used to study host-guest
interactions between inclusion clusters and molecular sieve frameworks, such as
aluminophosphate sieve materials.
