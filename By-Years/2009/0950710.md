This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
CAREER award to Clemson University will advance fundamental knowledge of the
social interactions that influence under-represented students' decisions to
enter and persist in engineering. The research is very innovative because the PI
is the first to apply the theoretical framework of social capital to explain
engineering students' academic and career choices. The work is notable in that
it builds upon the results of researchers in other fields to bring fresh
perspectives and new tools to the study of engineering student persistence. The
research findings and methods will be disseminated widely to academic and
practitioner communities. The project will enhance the number of students who
complete engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs or start new
high tech businesses.
