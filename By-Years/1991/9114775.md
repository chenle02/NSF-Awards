A novel radiographic flow visualization technique, whose development was
initiated under a NSF research equipment grant, is proposed to study the
buoyancy and surface tension induced convection and their interaction with phase
change in model systems relevant to materials processing, including crystal
growth and casting. The technique is based on the use of metallurgically
compatible, neutrally buoyant tracer particles which are more radio-opaque
compared to the melt. The proposed work will include further development of the
radiographic tracer technique as well as studies on the convection-mediated
solidification processes, including the formation of mushy zone.
