0216975&lt;br/&gt;Jordan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support
the purchase of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from agents of the
European Space Agency. The SAR imagery will be archived at computational
facilities of the Western North America InSAR (WInSAR) Consortium. SAR imagery
supports tectonic, volcanological, and hydrologic research by consortium members
through interferometric analysis of temporally separated SAR pairs to detect to
spatially continuous, subtle (mm to cm) deformation of the earth's surface over
large baselines (100s of km). As the U. S. does not currently have a satellite
borne SAR sensor that provides global coverage while Western Europe, Canada and
Japan do, WInSAR negotiated SAR data buys from ESA address a national deficiency
in the short-term and create a cost-effective means of providing SAR imagery to
the nation's geoscientists. The NSF Division of Earth Sciences, the USGS and
NASA co-support WinSAR data buys.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
