Women are in the minority in most sciences, although they form a growing share
of the total in social science. This project will analyze the job histories of
about 11,000 persons listed in 27 consecutive years of the annual listing "Guide
to Departments of Anthropology". The project will link individuals in successive
years to study their professional careers within these academic departments
(until recently the main source of professional employment for anthropologists).
Hypotheses to be tested involve the tentative finding that male and female
appointment and promotion rates converge over historical time, and that the
differences between male and female promotion rates diminish as persons advance
to higher ranks. This research has implications for the general job market and
women's labor force participation. The narrowness of the investigation within
one discipline will allow control over key variables such as prestige of degree-
granting and hiring departments, the variation within subdisciplines, and labor
flows within a single discipline. The data base will be the foundation for
future studies which link other data (on productivity, salary) to these.
