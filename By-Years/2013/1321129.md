This project addresses the study of cooperation in distributed networks, first
through the study of simple structures that isolate dedicated resources for
global or local cooperation and then directly in general networks. The work is
organized into three thrusts. The first thrust employs a global facilitator that
has access to all messages in the network and can transmit a rate-R description
of these messages to all nodes. Bounding the capacity of such a network as a
function of R gives a first-order estimate of the minimal cost and maximal
benefit of cooperation in a given network. In the second thrust, we move from
global to local models of cooperation to understand how much of the cooperative
advantage can be achieved using smaller groups of cooperators. The final thrust
studies the implementation and approximation of the most successful cooperation
strategies from the earlier thrusts for use in wireless, sensor, and wired
networks; here the rate employed to enable cooperation shares the same network
resources as the capacity it aims to increase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Example
networks demonstrate large potential benefits in communication system
performance through the use of strategies that employ cooperation among the
communicating devices. Performance improvement is here measured as an increase
in the amount of information that can be reliably delivered through a
communication network. Increasing rate through cooperation may allow more users
to simultaneous communicate or each user to communicate at an increased rate in
a given network. This project aims to develop the theoretical foundations of
cooperation-based communication strategies and to help guide the design of
communication protocols that realize the benefits of cooperation in practice.
