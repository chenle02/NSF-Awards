This research is expected to provide data which will further the understanding
of the science of polymer materials used for electrical insulation applications
and which can be used to develop better materials for power apparatus. During
the course of this project, the following will be undertaken: 1)the study of the
fundamental mechanisms leading to the failure of polymeric insulating materials
used in outdoor power apparatus, and 2)the development of a theoretical model to
predict the optimum conditions for failure and life of polymeric insulating
materials. The study will use a variety of experimental techniques such as
simulated outdoor testing in a fog chamber equipped with an on-line data
acquisition system, study of the composition and bonding arrangement of
molecules on the surface of a specimen using Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical
Analysis, and the determination of molecular energy levels using scanning
electron microscopy and gel permeation chromatography.
