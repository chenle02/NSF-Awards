This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of a computer system that
will be installed and operated in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford
University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funding
required. The computer system will be used in the research of the seismology
group at Stanford and will be applied to problems such as modeling earthquake
source mechanisms, very low frequency ground motion ("quiet earthquakes"), and
seismic tomographic techniques.
