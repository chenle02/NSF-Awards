0402897&lt;br/&gt;Bash&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Rhode Island's
Graduate School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to improve the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Endeavor, an NSF-
owned ship operated by URI as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The fluorometers, PAR sensors, and the pinger-
receiver system supported here will replace aging systems with modern ones,
maintaining state of the art capability for researchers using the ship. The
replacement cable for the undulating towed vehicle, available as a portable
system on any UNOLS vessel, is an important upgrade to ensure continued
availability of that system. These improvements will be of substantial advantage
to marine scientists using R/V Endeavor and other vessels in their research
during 2004 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
