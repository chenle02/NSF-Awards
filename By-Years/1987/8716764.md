This doctoral dissertation award will support research on the cultural ecology
of Amerind depopulation. The purpose of the project is to construct systems
dynamics computer simulation models in order to assess the historical-statistics
of Amerind depopulation, examine the roles of purported causes of these
population collapses, and make interregional comparisons. Controversy exists
about the magnitude of pre-Colombian Amerind populations and the scale of their
ensuing decline after the Spanish conquest. This project introduces systems
dynamics modeling to the study of New World Indian depopulation. The technique
allows explicit and dynamic linkage of the factors directly governing human
population survival and reproduction to elements in the broader environmental,
sociolcultural, technical, and historical milieux. By comparing the models
developed for different regions, this study emphasizes the importance of
location in understanding differing patterns. More broadly, this project will
help us decipher how multiple factors have affected the population decline of
aboriginal societies after European contact and add to our general knowledge of
population change.
