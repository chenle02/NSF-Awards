This project is to provide 78 one-year scholarships in Engineering and
Technology (Civil, Electrical, Environmental and Mechanical), Mathematics,
Computer Science, and Life Sciences at Pennsylvania State University Harrisburg.
Scholarships will be awarded based on academic achievement, financial need, and
interest in STEM fields. To ensure the success of the scholarship recipients,
the project will implement additional services and processes including improved
early progress report, a new bridge-mathematics course, mentoring by STEM
working professionals and peer mentoring through a STEM scholarship club. To
attract students to the program, the project plans to enhance the pipeline by
helping high schools to create Engineering, Mathematics, and Science clubs. The
project intends to leverage the University's Office of Development to sustain
its effort over time. The project results will be communicated through
conference presentations, papers and website dissemination to targeted
audiences. The project will help to improve educational opportunities for
students, to increase the retention and graduation rates, and to produce well-
educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need.
