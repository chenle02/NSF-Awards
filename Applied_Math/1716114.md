This project is concerned with an interdisciplinary and multifaceted
investigation of the dynamics of particles confined to a fluid interface.
Specifically, our proposal considers surface-trapped particles on a drop in an
applied flow field and seeks to determine the flow-driven particle organization.
These are mathematically challenging multiphase problems with application to the
study of emulsions and the development of new novel materials with designed
properties. Specific examples include emulsions with effective viscosity tunable
by an electric field, the fabrication of colloidal photonic crystals, or the
fabrication of "digital colloids" in soft robotics.

The primary focus will be on investigating the dynamics of particle-laden drops
at medium to low surface coverage in applied flow fields. The PIs will develop
mathematical models, analytical solutions, and accurate and efficient
computational solutions of the dynamics of many particles on a moving drop
interface. This is a complex free boundary problem that presents several
challenges: the dynamics of the three-phase contact line, the curvature and
deformability of the interface, and the many-body hydrodynamic interactions
mediated by the fluids embedding the interface. The PIs plan to develop a
multifaceted approach where analytical solutions using asymptotic methods will
be sought for the dynamics of a single particle, a novel numerical approach
using chimera grids and level set methods to determine the full-range dynamics
of the particle-fluid system, and a point-particle method that efficiently
simulates the collective dynamics of large numbers of particles.
