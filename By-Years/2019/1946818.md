This project is a multi-sited study of women in immigrant communities who use
potentially toxic beauty products to lighten their skin. Its goal is to examine
women’s understanding of the risks involved in using the products and their
rationales for doing so. The project first uses archival sources to understand
the global skin lightening market, how mercury came to be added as an
ingredient, and efforts by companies to replace it with less toxic alternatives.
Second, it examines how diverse communities perceive scientific and public
health information about chemical toxicity, their reasons for purchasing skin
lightening products, and whether and how scientific and public health data
influences consumer choices. The project involves mentoring and training post-
doctoral and undergraduate researchers, developing new undergraduate courses,
and broadly disseminating research findings to community groups and to civil
society groups working to address the environmental health issue of mercury in
beauty products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines how the public’s
understanding of science intersects with issues of health, race, and immigration
in the United States by researching the use of potentially toxic skin bleaching
products by members of immigrant communities in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and
New York City. It seeks to understand the social, economic, political, and
cultural rationales of women who use these products, and their similarities and
differences across East and South Asian and West African immigrant communities.
Historical and archival research methods will be used to uncover the history of
adding mercury to cosmetics for skin bleaching, and to understand beauty
industry practices related to skin bleaching products and efforts to expand this
market despite public health concerns. Interviews will be conducted with leaders
of community-based organizations to understand their opinions and knowledge
about skin bleaching products. Focus groups will then be conducted with members
of these organizations to reveal the contextual factors that influence product
use among immigrant populations. Project findings will be disseminated back to
community-based organizations and the public to enhance public understanding of
the risks associated with exposure to these beauty
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
