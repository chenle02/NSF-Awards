This project aims to combine the facilities and personnel of the University of
California at Santa Barbara and a group at the University of Erlangen, headed by
Gottfried Dohler. Research focuses on the growth and characterization of non-
stoichiometric compound semiconductors and graded semiconductor quantum
structures, and will combine molecular beam epitaxy of samples and electronic
characterization at Santa Barbara with optoelectronic characterization at
Erlangen. There will be an exchange of researchers with the goals of
transferring knowledge and allowing students to gain hands-on knowledge of each
groups experimental methods.
