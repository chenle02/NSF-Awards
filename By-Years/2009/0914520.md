Hopa Mountain, an educational nonprofit organization based in Bozeman, Montana,
will pilot an innovative Native Science Fellows program for high school and
college students to participate in community-based science organizations in an
effort to increase their engagement in higher education and geosciences careers.
There are four primary goals: (1) To increase the number of Native American
students (ages 15-35) who are engaged in community-based geosciences education
and careers; (2) To provide role models and work experience for Native American
high school and college students interested in the geosciences; (3) To develop a
career ladder network of Native students that are interested in pursuing
geosciences careers; and (4) To build a network of community-based science
professionals who are committed to the success of Native students and provide
on-going support for personal, academic and professional success.

Specific objectives of the Native Science Fellows pilot program are to match
promising Native American high school and college students with summer and
school year fellowships that will provide them with paid, hands-on field work
and professional experiences to build skills and pathways to academic and
careers in the geosciences. These students will also be linked to geoscience
mentors and supportive Native Science Fellows peer and professional networks.
