Removal of dissolved matter from liquids is a problem of considerable difficulty
in some cases. For instance, purifying brackish water for domestic or industrial
use is a chronic problem in some coastal and/or arid regions. Also, dozens of
municipal water sources contain large amounts of dissolved matter which must be
removed before the water can be used. In order to achieve high levels of
separation, many methods in which the fluid passes back and forth through a bed
of absorbents have been examined over the years. The present proposal seeks to
study a method, known as dual recycle thermal swing absorption (DRTSA) process,
in which the product from the equipment is recycled back to increase the extent
of separation substantially. The objective is to examine some fundamental
physical and chemical issues that affect the performance of this process so that
the economics of the process can be evaluated subsequently. If successful, this
work will be of value in many industrial and domestic treatment processes.
