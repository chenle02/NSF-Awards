Number theory is one of the oldest of all branches of mathematics, with its
first important results dating back more than two millennia. While whole numbers
are in a sense discrete objects, in modern times they are often studied using
techniques of continuous mathematics, such as calculus. The PI's work focuses in
particular on the use of p-adic numbers, which were introduced early in the 20th
century as a number system analogous to the real numbers, but recording
information about divisibility of integers. In addition to theoretical results,
the p-adic numbers give rise to computational techniques with some relevance in
computer science, especially in modern cryptography.

Building on recent breakthroughs in p-adic Hodge theory, we extend the field in
several different directions. We extend the theory of p-adic representations to
allow coefficients in larger rings, with an eye towards applications to the
p-adic interpolation of automorphic forms. We also allow the replacement of
p-adic Galois groups with etale fundamental groups; this is expected to shed new
light on the p-adic Langlands correspondence. Finally, we consider ways to
replace the p-adic numbers with the full ring of integers; this involves
systematic use of Witt vectors over arbitrary rings.
