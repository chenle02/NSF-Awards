ABSTRACT AST-9420443 Wolfe, Arthur M. Tytler, David Drs. Wolfe and Tytler, at
the University of California at San Diego, will use spectra of absorption line
systems toward Quasi- Stellar Objects to explore gas located at moderate
redshift distances in the Universe (z &lt; 5). The observations will be obtained
using telescopes of the Keck and Lick Observatories. Projects led by Dr. Wolfe
will use the properties of damped Lyman Alpha systems to investigate the gas
contents, abundances and dynamics of early galaxies. Dr. Tytler will focus on
the intergalactic medium (IGM) and hot ionized gas. ***
