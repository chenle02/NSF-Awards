IBN: 9727258 PI-CARNEVALE A newly developed computational tool for neuroscience
is NEURON, which allows computer simulation of a variety of models of activity
in nerve cells and small networks. This short course gives an introduction to
potential users to allow them to decide whether it will be useful for their own
work, to introduce practical techniques and strategies for effectively using
simulations, and to provide advanced users an update on new features. Because
this tool for realistic biological stimulation is specifically designed for a
variety of computational platforms, it makes a very sophisticated tool that is
widely and freely available. The impact of this course is potentially very
large, across all fields of neuroscience, because it promotes the integration of
quantitative modeling into research and education in ways that extend far beyond
what is now regarded as the domain of computational neuroscience.
