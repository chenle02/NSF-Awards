This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of New Mexico purchase of a 500 MHz NMR.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the
following: (1) synthesais of biologically active compounds, (2) mechanism of
enzyme catalysis, (3) molecular routes to inorganic materials, (4) organic
photochemistry and mechanistic enzymology, and (5) novel main group ring and
cage chemistry. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers,
catalysis, and in biology.
