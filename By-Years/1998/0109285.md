This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design,
fabricate and test parallel coaxial evanescent microwave probes (EMP) with
integrated piezoelectric actuators and neuromorphic electronics. EMP is being
developed and commercialized by MICC in collaboration with researchers at Case
Western Reserve University for a variety of imaging applications including thin
film quality control, semiconductor characterization, biological studies, and
other applications in metrology. EMPs have very fast scan rates (>1 cm/s) and
they yield information regarding the dielectric constant as well as the
microwave conductivity of materials. They are also non-contact with the
capability of imaging both conducting and insulating materials. Integration of
actuators and neuromorphic electronics with EMP's will enable their development
in manufacturing quality assessment and other high throughput applications.

EMPs have very high spatial resolutions (=0.1 um -100 um and in some cases
atomic resolution) and their application in manufacturing will have significant
impact on quality control and assessment. The possible market for such a system
is in multi-billion US dollars per year in the US alone. The proposed parallel
EMP arrays will be tested using a mock pulsed-laser deposition set-up at MICC.
