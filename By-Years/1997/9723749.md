Abstract 9723749 Maddock In order to understand how cell growth and division
occur, it is necessary to determine how proteins that normally control the
timing of cell division work. Central players in this process are GTP-binding
proteins. These proteins act as cellular switches, receiving input signals and
then transmitting the signal to downstream proteins. The activity of the GTP-
binding proteins is usually modified by other specific proteins. Recently, a new
family of GTP-binding proteins has been found in many different kinds of
organisms. This evolutionary conservation between distantly related species
suggests that this family of GTP-binding proteins has a fundamental, though
currently unknown, cellular role(s). The goal of this research is to understand
the cellular role of this GTP-binding protein and to define the relationship
between this protein and interacting proteins. These studies will be in the
bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Caulobacter is the ideal model system to
dissect the role of this protein since cell cycle studies are easily performed
and all of the molecular and genetic advantages of a bacterial system can be
exploited. Due to the conservation of these GTP-binding proteins this work is
likely to have application in other systems. %%% This research is looking at the
function of an essential protein, a GTPase, which is conserved from archea and
bacteria to humans. The evolutionary conservation suggests that this protein has
a fundamental role, and the objective of this research is to determine that
role. ***
