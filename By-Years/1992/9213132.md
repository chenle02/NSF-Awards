This Research Equipment Grant (REG) is to purchase an Ultrasonic Scanning
System for the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of materials. Several research
efforts are currently underway at the school in the area of processing of
composite materials. A new process, where carbon fibers are coated with resin
material before weaving, is being developed. Resin materials that exhibit poor
melt flow characteristics that inhibit consolidation can be used by this
process. Also being researched is a process to fabricate three dimensional
composite parts using stereolithography. By preferential placement of fiber
reinforcements, as the resin is cured in layers by Ultra-Violet light, it will
be possible to engineer the mechanical properties of the component as required
by its functional specifications. The ultrasonic scanning system is needed to
assist in all these efforts. The structural integrity of the produced material
can be verified easily by this equipment and will be beneficial in the
development of these projects. These research efforts are all aimed at
developing new techniques to make components out of composite materials in a
rapid and cost-effective manner. The successful implementation of these
projects, which will be benefited by this equipment, will benefit the industrial
manufacturing sector.
