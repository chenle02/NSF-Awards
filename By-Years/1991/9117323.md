The PI will continue to develop new methods to analyze the statistical
structure of the magnetic field reversal chronology, in particular, to relax the
constraint applied to all previous statistical analyses of reversal chronologies
that reversals occur instantaneously. One of the main reasons for doing this is
to examine the core's stability properties in the time intervals that include
polarity transitions. A secondary goal of these models is to help identify the
most unreliable sections of the magnetic reversal chronology. An additional goal
is to examine polarity transition data and mean field data to determine if there
are statistically significant departures of the Earth's magnetic field from
axial symmetry. Emphasis will be placed on combining all the above data analyses
with dynamo (and related) theory.
