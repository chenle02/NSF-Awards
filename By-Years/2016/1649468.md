This grant provides travel funds to increase participation from US researchers
in a new research community by funding student travel to the Symposium on
Search-Based Software Engineering. Search-based software engineering is new
paradigm for software engineering in which software is developed by searching
for components and optimizing for functionality and nonfunctional properties
within constraints, with the goal of automating software engineering. The goal
is to encourage research in this area while providing important
educational/training experiences for the students and helping to build the next
generation of global researchers. The grant will pay attention to
underrepresented groups and take into account economic considerations.
