9406043 Tzeng This project is a program of research in the construction,
analysis, and decoding of error control codes. The primary objective is the
development to efficient error control coding techniques for reliable data
transmission and storage. The specific areas of investigation are (1) developing
algebraic methods for determining the maximum error-correcting capabilities of
cyclic codes and algebraic-geometric (AG) codes; (2) constructing efficient
algorithms for decoding cyclic and AG codes; (3) bridging the gap between the
;more traditional cyclic codes and the AG codes; and (4) developing efficient
concatenated coding coding schemes using AG codes. For the determination of
minimum distance, the project will develop an approach based on Newton's
identities and their extensions. Closely related approaches based on the
shifting method of van Lint and Wilson and the method of counting the number
of"sentinels" in a syndrome matrix will be investigated. The techniques utilized
will both lead to minimum distance determination and to a procedure for
constructing algorithms capable of using the maximum error-correcting
capabilities. Considerable is planned to develop links between cyclic and AG
codes. Concatenated codes using convolutional codes as inner codes and AG codes
as outer codes will also be studies. Both theoretical and practical issues will
be addressed. ***
