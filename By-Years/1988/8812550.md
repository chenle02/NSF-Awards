Title: Syntheses of Novel Borazine Derivatives This is a Minority Research
Initiation (MRI) planning grant to study the formation of covalent boron -
nitrogen bonds by aminolysis of various organoboron species. It is an area of
chemistry at the frontier of science and where the scientific interest is high.
The investigator hopes to provide new knowledge and understanding of several
basic synthetic problems on boron - nitrogen reactions. The planning process
will allow the investigation of several reactions under varying environmental
conditions involving time, temperature, and solvent. This grant will provide
support for a well-trained minority chemist to prepare a competitive proposal
for submittal to the MRI research initiation component.
