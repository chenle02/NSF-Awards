The teaching of mathematics for undergraduate minority women, particularly those
majoring in the sciences, is being enhanced by the use of computers (IBM PS/2)
and software (Mathematica) that allows students to experiment and explore
concepts. A laboratory is equipped to provide the capability for interactive
teaching and a classroom is equipped with a faculty workstation and projection
system. Courses in linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics are
being taught using these facilities.
