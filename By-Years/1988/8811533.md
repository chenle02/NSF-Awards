Rotational inertia is the force which prevents the movement of a rolling or
spinning object. Research to be conducted uses electrorheological (ER) fluids
along with computerized control systems to alter the rotational inertia of a
wheel. By doing so the wheel and its load (an automobile, for example) can
instantly change its speed by electrically altering the rotational inertia of
the wheel. The objectives of this investigation are: (1) control the rotational
inertia of a wheel by controlling a fluid inside the wheel using valves which
are electrically operated by electro- rheological fluids, and (2) quantify the
efficiency in terms of energy use and speed of a computer control version to
estimate its range of real world applications. Controlling the direction of the
fluid throughout the wheel would entail an extensive system of valves and
hydraulics. In this experiment, ER fluid valves will be positioned throughout
the interior cavity of the wheel. In this manner a microprocessor-based
digital/analog control system can electrically operate the ER valves.
