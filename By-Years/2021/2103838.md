This project studies the number of solutions to certain equations, using the
shape of spaces associated to these equations, as well as this shape itself.
There is a new invariance property of the number of such solutions. This
invariance not only applies to the number of solutions in the complex numbers,
but also solutions which are ordinary fractions, such as one half. It is
obtained by using A1-homotopy theory due to Morel and Voevodsky. Mathematics
education is furthermore supported by continuing a program of week-long summer
math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each
of the summers of the project period, approximately eight high school students
will work on an important mathematical problem, learning the background material
as necessary, and solving it as a group. They will be accompanied by two high
school teachers. A Research Experience for Undergraduates aimed at the graduates
of the program is provided to continue mathematical training and provide
research mentorship. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A1-homotopy theory was
introduced by Morel and Voevodksy in the late 1990's and allows the successful
import of tools from algebraic topology into the study of solutions to
polynomial equations. The PI and collaborators are studying the interaction
between A1-homotopy theory and classical questions from enumerative geometry
such as "How many lines meet four lines in space?" A1-homotopy theory functions
well over very general base schemes and in particular over any field, resulting
in enumerative results over non-algebraically closed fields valued in bilinear
forms. This project searches for such results connected with characteristic
classes, Gromov--Witten theory, and zeta functions and develops tools in motivic
homotopy theory suggested by these applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
