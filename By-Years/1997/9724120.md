Kay 9724120 Circadian clocks are known to regulate many essential cellular
processes in all organisms so far examined. In higher plants most major
metabolic pathways are subject to circadian regulation, as well as developmental
events such as the photoperiodic control of flowering. However, the molecular
components of these biological clocks remain unknown. Using Arabidopsis thaliana
as a model plant and the luciferase gene fusion and bioluminescence imaging
system developed in this laboratory, work will be continued on the
identification and characterization of the DNA-protein interactions involved in
regulated chlorophyll A binding protein (CAB2) gene transcription, the genetic
analysis of the interactions between circadian and phototransduction pathways
and genome-wide identification of clock-controlled genes in Arabidopsis. The
long term goal is to further our understanding of how circadian clocks are built
in eukaryotic cells. Although they are known to regulate many essential cellular
processes in all organisms thus far analyzed, the molecular components of these
biological clocks remain unknown. Using Arabidopsis as a model plant, genetic
and molecular approaches will be used to enhance our knowledge of the
mechanistic basis of the regulated response of gene expression to circadian
rhythm.
