Experimental and theoretical investigations of possible mechanisms of backflow
of information in neurons are proposed. Such retrograde flow of information is a
crucial aspect of learning and plasticity of neural networks involving
backpropagation. The experimental preparations to be used are hippocampal slices
of the rat brain. Evidence of retrograde pathways of informational flow other
than membrane electrical potentials will be sought. One stimulus will be
mechanical compression of efferent axons or axon hillocks. Changes in synaptic
response at the dendritic and axonal levels will be monitored as evidence of
backpropagation. The time scale of interest will be milliseconds as opposed to
slower processes of axonal cytoplasmic flow in either direction. If functional
plasticity is demonstrated, electron- microscopic examination of synapses will
be made to seek cytoskeletal or vesicle alterations that correlate with the
functional changes. Theoretical models will consist of cytoskeletal components
of actin-myosin gel, microtubular structure and a viscoelastic matrix
representing cytoplasm. An active tension will be assumed in the actin-myosin
gel. Possible modes of wave propagation in the composite structure will be
investigated. The significance of the proposed research will be very important
of correlation of biological counterparts to theoretical models of neural
networks.
