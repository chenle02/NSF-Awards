The goal of this project is to continue to provide a mechanism for the quality
control of oceanic carbon dioxide measurements, in particular those that are
made as part of international global programs. This will help to ensure that
such measurements are comparable and accurate although made in different
laboratories at different times. Such measurements are important components of
global scale survey cruises such as those of the Global Ocean Ship-based
Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP), as well as playing a significant
role in the quality control of ocean acidification measurements. The provision
of reference materials to the international community helps to improve the
overall quality of oceanic carbon data around the world both for field studies
of the distribution of oceanic carbon, as well as for studies related to ocean
acidification. It is a significant US contribution to global research
infrastructure in this field. Numerous students are involved in, and receive
training through, this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve the goal
outlined above, the Scripps laboratory will prepare and certify reference
materials for the following parameters of the oceanic carbon dioxide system in
seawater: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, and pH. The
reference materials for total dissolved inorganic carbon and for total
alkalinity will be based on natural seawater, sterilized, bottled, and analyzed
using appropriate reference methods for these parameters. Reference materials
for pH are based on Tris buffers in synthetic seawater and calibrated using
spectrophotometric pH measurements. In addition, the laboratory will distribute
calibrated acid titrant for alkalinity measurements. Reference materials will be
distributed to US and to international investigators to assist in the quality
control of oceanic CO2 measurements. During the three years of this project, the
laboratory expects to distribute about 30,000 bottles of reference material.
These materials will also be used to provide test samples for use in
collaborative studies of the analytical methods used to determine these various
parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
