The aim of this renewal proposal is to study the electronic and geometric
structure of ordered and defect-ridden transition metal oxide surfaces, and the
rich chemistry which they exhibit. A wide range of surface sensitive electron
spectroscopic techniques, including ultraviolet- and xrayphotoelectron
spectroscopy, auger and high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy will
be used.
