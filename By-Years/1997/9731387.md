9731387 Weaver This five year program will provide summer research opportunities
for teachers with the university or other research groups around the region.
These research opportunities will last for a minimum of eight weeks. The
projects will be in the discipline areas of biology, chemistry, physics, and
earth sciences. It is expected that there will be no less than 22 teachers in
the project each year. In addition to the summer research projects the teachers
will be expected to participate in academic year follow-up sessions to assist
with implementation of what was learned in the summer research to their classes.
Some funds will be available for the teachers to purchase supplies and to attend
professional meetings. The project will begin operation in the summer of 1998
and is expected to run through the summer of 2002 and into the academic year.
The project is providing $1,013,195 in both gifts in kind and actual money which
represents 204% of the award amount of the project.
