This project is mathematical research in the theory of operator algebras
bearing on issues in geometry and topology. The operator algebras (or
C*-algebras) here are thought of as noncommutative analogs of (the algebra of
continuous functions on) a compact topological space. Differentiable structure
can be introduced in the form of a C*-dynamical system, with a Lie group acting
on the C*-algebra. More specifically, one of the goals of the project is to
establish a Chern-Weil theory for C*-dynamical systems, thereby introducing a
whole new class of differential and topological invariants for noncommutative
differentiable manifolds having principal fibre structures. Another problem is
to characterize the smooth structures of manifolds (commutative or otherwise) in
terms of certain subalgebras and cyclic homology theory. The principal
investigator will continue his study of the close relationship between dynamical
invariants of structurally stable flows and K-theoretical invariants of flow
algebras.
