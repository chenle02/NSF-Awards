This project under the Leadership in Laboratory Development catagory is
developing a model for the incorporation of modern, computational analytical
chemistry into bachelors programs at the junior/senior-level. Examples of how
the leading concepts in analysis, as distinct from measurement, can be taught in
conjunction with measurement are being developed. Among the techniques that are
being implemented are: Principal Component Analysis, Target Factor Modeling,
Rank Annihilation, and the use of the SIMPLEX algorithm for non-linear least
squares modelling.
