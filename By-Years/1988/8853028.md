This project expands this institution's already existing materials program to
include state-or-the-art nondestructive evaluation of materials and manufactured
components. The equipment incorporated into the lab includes: a scanning laser
acoustic microscope, acoustic emission analysis system, image analysis system
and eddy current test device. These computer interfaced devices are used to
evaluate both metallic and non-metallic materials. Students using the enhanced
materials lab are able to experiment with: material identification, flaw
detection, flaw size determination, semiconductor continuity, sintering
efficiency, debonding of composites, fatigue crack propagation, martensitic
transformations, weld flaw detection and characterization of hydrogen damage.
This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
