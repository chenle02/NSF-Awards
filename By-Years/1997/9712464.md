This project will be directed at developing a `seismic-while- drilling'
capability for the Ocean Drilling Program. In this technique the seismic source
is the drill bit and the sound is received on geophones on the seafloor. The
advantage of this technique is that no additional ship time is required to
acquire the seismic data.
