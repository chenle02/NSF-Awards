9702448 Acoff This CAREER research plan addresses the autogenous weldability of
intermetallic compounds using gamma TiAl as the model material. Objectives of
the research are: (1) Development of fusion welding processes for cast and
wrought alloys of intermetallic compounds using autogenous welding, identifying
the causes of cracks and voids; (2) Determination of the effects of energy input
on the weld microstructure and the mechanical properties (hardness, fracture
toughness, tensile properties); (3) Simulation of the autogenous fusion zone and
heat-affected zone microstructures using computer modeling to predict weld and
heat-affected zone microstructures and properties. The educational plan of this
project complements the research plan outlined above. Objectives of the proposed
educational plan are: (1) Enhance the undergraduate materials curriculum with
increased computer simulation and modeling; (2) Involve undergraduate minority
students from Stillman College in research activities; and (3) Attract minority
students to graduate study at the University of Alabama. %%% As a class of
materials, intermetallic compounds and alloys are of technological interest
because they are lightweight and maintain high strengths at elevated
temperatures (over 1100 C). One such intermetallic compound, gamma-based
titanium aluminide, has been of particular interest because its properties
demonstrate excellent potential performance in aerospace, structural, and high
temperature applications. ***
