Morgan 9408951 The inability of investigators to track microscopic larvae of
marine animals has impeded our understanding of planktonic processes that
regulate larval supply to adult populations. This project will be to adapt
techniques that have been used by entomologists to study dispersal by crustacean
larvae. The study will determine the feasibility of tagging barnacle and crab
larvae with rare earth elements (REE) by examining uptake and persistence of
marker, levels of marker passed from females to larvae and variability of rare
earth elements in larvae from natural populations. The success of adapting this
technique for marine animals largely depends on whether or not REEs can be
accumulated and retained by animals in seawater long enough to be useful as
tracers of larval movements. ***
