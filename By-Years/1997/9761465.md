*** 9761465 Tuchinskiy This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will attempt to develop a new kind of self-lubricating anti-friction
ceramic/polymer composite with high mechanical characteristics and low
coefficient of friction. The structure of the composite comprises a ceramic
matrix and fibers of lubricating phase oriented perpendicular to the friction
surface. The fibers are formed in situ, their diameter may vary significantly
from a few microns to a few millimeters, while a uniform distribution is
provided automatically within the process. The content of the solid lubricant
may vary over a wide range. The objectives of the Phase I research are to
develop a method for production of anti-friction composites comprising Si3N4 and
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), investigate their characteristics and define the
compositions and structures providing optimum combinations of mechanical and
tribological characteristics. If successful, the method could be applied to
production of many tribological as well as structural composites. The research
may thus result in creation of a new generation of high effective anti-fiction
materials. There are numerous potential applications for self-lubricating
ceramic materials, including a large market in the propulsion systems and
machine tool industry. Application areas in the machine tool industry include
extended life spindles, high speed head options, ultrahigh speed machining
centers and high speed grinding spindles. The end benefit to the customer from
high speed machine tool bearing applications probably exceeds that of the
aerospace application. Other applications for self-lubricating ceramic bearings
are in the chemical processing and semiconductor manufacturing areas. This
includes screw pumps, reactors and vacuum systems. Additional applications are
for air valve control systems or material conveying equipment in hot
environments. ***
