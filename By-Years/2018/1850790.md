Abstract &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;PI Last Name: Shapiro&lt;br/&gt;Title: The
Environmental Bias of Trade Policy &lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID:
1850790&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to advance knowledge on
the environmental consequences of trade policy. The project investigates the
extent to which tariffs and other policies affect pollution emissions. The
research analyzes the relationship between the amount of pollution an industry
emits and the trade and environmental policies the industry faces. The research
also looks at the reasons for such relationships and studies the environmental
and economic consequences of changing existing policies. More broadly, this
project assesses the interactions of trade policy, environmental policy, and
environmental and trade outcomes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An optimal policy would
charge a uniform price on all global greenhouse gas emissions, since greenhouse
gas emissions create the same environmental externality regardless of where they
are emitted. The world is not close to this optimal policy and currently
regulates only a small share of global greenhouse gas emissions, typically at
low and heterogeneous prices. This research provides comparisons of tariffs and
non-tariff barriers against pollution emissions. The research also investigates
explanations for these patterns, including the potential importance of an
industry's upstream location (i.e., the extent to which it sells output to other
firms as intermediate goods rather than to final consumers). Additionally, the
research investigates how counterfactual trade and environmental policies would
affect pollution and social welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
