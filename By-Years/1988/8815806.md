Variable stars play an important role in astronomy. They play important roles in
determining the cosmic distance scale, studying the structure of the Milky Way
Galaxy, investigating the interior structures and evolution of stars, and
observing stellar surface activity. The Principal Investigator proposes to carry
out a sky survey of poorly studied variable stars that, during the tenure of
this proposal (FYs 1989 - 1991), will include over 1000 stars and eventually
will be expanded to include more than 6000 variable stars.
