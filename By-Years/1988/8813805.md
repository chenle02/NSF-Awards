This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of gas-surface reaction dynamics. The research program will
investigate the forces between a diatomic molecule and a surface when the
molecule is crossing an activation barrier prior to dissociative chemisorption
or associative desorption. The anisotropy of the reactive gas-surface potential
will be probed as a function of molecular orientation geometry using multiphoton
laser ionization spectroscopy to detect the specific states of the products of
activated associative recombination. Angle-selected, velocity-selected,
polarization spectroscopy will be employed to detect specific chemical events.
The results of these experimental studies will provide detailed new insights
into how chemical reactions occur on surfaces. In addition they will enable
precise testing of theoretical methods of modeling the interaction of molecules
with surfaces. Development of reliable methods for constructing potential energy
surfaces will in turn facilitate modeling of surface chemical reactions.
