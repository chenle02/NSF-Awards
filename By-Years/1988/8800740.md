This award for cooperative research between Shao L. Soo of the University of
Illinois, Urbana and Professor Zhou Lixing of Tsinghua University, Beijing,
China, supports research on the motion of gas-solid suspension in a cyclone.
Research will address the relations between the collection efficiency of a
cyclone separator and the motions of fluid and particles in it. Existing
knowledge on cyclone separators is limited by the lack of knowledge of the
details of these motions which can only be obtained by measurements with an
accurate laser-doppler velocimeter. Accurate measurements will make possible
validation of advanced analytical studies and computer modeling. The emphasis of
this research is to help generate optimum design criteria for cyclone
collector's used in processing and control of particulate emissions. The
cooperative nature of this project involves use of specialized laser facilities
at Tsinghua University, a top engineering university in China, and complements
Dr. Soo's ongoing research on multiphase flow.
