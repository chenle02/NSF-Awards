This EDC project will implement a landscape study designed to understand
mathematics curriculum leaders' needs for research that informs their decision
making. The proposed project aims to identify and organize research that is most
useful to K-12 mathematics curriculum decision makers and to develop improved
mechanisms for them to make good use of such research. Products will include
research reports and an annual seminar. The goal is to create an infrastructure
designed to support K-12 mathematics leaders in their efforts to better use
research to inform curricular decision-making processes. The project will
address three primary audiences. The first and broadest is district, regional
and state curriculum leaders responsible for designing and managing the
selection and implementation of mathematics instructional materials. These
include people in positions such as mathematics supervisors, curriculum
coordinators, assistant superintendents of curriculum and instruction, state
mathematics directors and leaders of regional consortia providing curriculum
support to local districts. The second audience is teacher educators in graduate
and undergraduate mathematics education programs who work with developing
teachers and administrators. The project's third audience is the mathematics
educational research community, particularly those conducting studies of
mathematics curriculum, its use and its effectiveness. The project will host an
annual research seminar to discuss the challenges of curricular change and
related research.&lt;br/&gt;
