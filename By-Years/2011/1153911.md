Tibetans have lived at altitudes above 3000m (~10,000') for at least 10,000
years and consequently have distinctive biological traits, including
unexpectedly low levels of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen. Genes
accounting for such hemoglobin levels were recently identified and occur at
uniquely high frequency among Tibetans. The likely mechanism for this high
frequency is higher fertility and child survival for those people with the low-
hemoglobin forms of those genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test
the hypothesis that Tibetan women at high altitude in Nepal with the low-
hemoglobin variants of the genes have more surviving children than those with
the other variants. 1350 women of Tibetan ethnicity residing at 3000m or higher
who have completed their reproductive careers will provide DNA for typing the
genes called EPAS1, EGLN1 and HIF1alpha that were previously found to regulate
the response to hypoxia (low oxygen availability), such as that occurring at
high altitudes. In addition, measurements of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen
saturation of hemoglobin, as well as information on these women's fertility
history and the survival of their children, will be collected.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The predicted outcome is that women with the forms of the
genes that are most frequent among Tibetans will have lower hemoglobin
concentration, higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and more surviving
children. Those results will connect a severe environmental stress to biological
and genetic variation and reproductive success, building a case for natural
selection operating in a human population and improving our understanding of the
processes of adapting to new environments. This U.S.-Nepalese collaborative
research has health implications at all altitudes because these genes are
necessary for intrauterine development, and they play central roles in the
biology of diseases as diverse as osteo- and rheumatoid arthritis, heart
failure, and cancer.
