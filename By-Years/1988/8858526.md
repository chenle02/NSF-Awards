The objective of this project is to identify new technologies in image analysis
and and computer graphics that may have applications for observing and
evaluating fluid transport in porous media. This is the initial increment of
support for research to be undertaken by this Presidential Young Investigator
who has an interest in using visual analytical techniques for analyzing the
transport of immiscible fluids through porous media as a step toward formulation
of physical models that can be used to predict the rate of diffusion and
dispersion of groundwater pollutants. The work involves use of digital image
analysis techniques for analysis of microscopic transport processes, observation
and quantification of small-scale variations in pore structure and fluid
properties on macroscopic transport processes as steps toward obtaining a better
understanding than now exists of the transport of immiscible fluids in porous
media. This, in turn, is expected to have applicability in engineering design of
systems for management of fluids that pose a threat to the quality of
groundwater used for industrial, commercial and municipal purposes.
