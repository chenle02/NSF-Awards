9706707 Grassi This project is concerned with Calabi-Yau manifolds and their
relation to physics. On the physics side, there are seven types of string
theories, which are all consistent. Five of these theories are classical and two
are new. The principal investigator will approach Calabi-Yau manifolds from
different perspectives and analyze them by "patches". In particular, she will
focus on dualities involving the two new string theories. This is research in
the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts
of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the
past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in
the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field
makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and
conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics,
theoretical computer science, and robotics.
