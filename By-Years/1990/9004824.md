Models of the long-term, global carbon cycle have lacked a geographic dimension;
model input and output have been restricted to global-mean values. Climate
change on million-year time scales can be driven by redistribution of the
continents and their weathering lithologies (as this affects atmospheric pCO2).
This project will explore the nature of Phanerozoic climate change by performing
several new climate simulations. Runs at different pCO2's for the same time
periods will elucidate the relationship between global temperature and runoff
(the two most important variables affecting chemical weathering rates and thus
pCO2). These climate variables will then be used in calculations of global
weathering rates, using paleogeologic maps prepared during our previous
research. In addition, two other important factors, topography (relief) and
biological enhancement of chemical weathering rates, will be assessed, using
present-day observations of their affect on soil and stream chemistry, and by
assembling and reconstructing paleophytogeographies. The goal of this research
is to create a realistic, coupled model of climate and biogeochemical cycles
that can be used to investigate the geographic and temporal variability of
Phanerozoic climate.
