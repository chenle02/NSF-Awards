GER-9554586 Root The Nation has a pressing need for chemical engineers who are
conscious of environmental prerogatives and are able to discover innovative new
processes that will satisfy chemical demands and meet environmental and economic
criteria. We are requesting Graduate Research Traineeships in Catalysis for
Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing. The trainees will gain expertise in
developing new catalytic technologies that can b used for production of desired
chemical products or intermediates with little or no generation of undesired
waste or byproducts. The Department of Chemical Engineering has substantial
expertise in catalyst design, process design, and analysis. The focus on
environmental consequences of upstream processing decisions will train students
to optimize the entire chemical process through use of appropriate catalytic
technologies, and permit development of alternative chemical synthesis pathways
that are environmentally benign. The chemical industry is one of the largest
contributors to international trade, and chemical engineers trained in
environmental consequences will be critical in maintaining competitiveness. Our
training program will produce engineers who will receive not only the excellent
academic training for which Wisconsin chemical engineers are know, but also a
research and educational experience that will develop awareness of and ingrained
concern for the environmental implications of their professional activities.
