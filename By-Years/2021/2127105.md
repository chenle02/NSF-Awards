The broader impacts of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II
project enables a cost-effective expansion of generation and storage of
renewable electricity. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 80% or more by
2050, and smart grid technologies have a compound annual growth rate of 20% with
a market estimated at $35 B. One important element of the grid is the
transformer, a critical enabler of large scale vehicle-to-grid technology
necessary for greater electric vehicle adoption. This project advances a new
transformer manufacturing technology that will lower hardware costs of grid
infrastructure and decrease construction and permitting costs, which can account
for as much as 85% of total costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business
Innovation Research Phase II project uses precision additive manufacturing to
enable solid state transformers for the next-generation electric grid. By
operating at higher frequencies, solid state transformers provide power
conversion and grid services with high power density and lower hardware and
project costs. Currently, solid state transformers are hampered by their
wirewound electromagnetic components that perform poorly at high frequencies and
are costly to produce. This project will enable new classes of devices with 10x
improvements in performance. This project will produce technology demonstration
prototypes of a power conversion product and plan for translation at
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
