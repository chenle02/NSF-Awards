The State of Connecticut proposes a Statewide Systemic Initiative to improve
mathematics and science education. The project will undertake five interrelated
components: (1) The establishment of the Connecticut Academy for Education in
Mathematics, Science, and Technology, which will be chartered by the General
Assembly and will set standards, assist local districts in reform, and serve as
an advocate for educational equity. (2) District-level curriculum reform and
teacher enhancement, targeting especially 25-35 disadvantaged urban and rural
"priority districts." (3) Activities involving higher education, including
restructured teacher preparation and collaboration with the schools. (4) Math
and science enrichment programs for students and parents provided by science-
rich institutions, business, and industry. (5) A public relations campaign for
public understanding of the importance of education in mathematics, science, and
technology. Cost sharing: 105%.
