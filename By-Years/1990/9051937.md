Knowledge of modern optics is increasingly important to workers in many areas
of science and technology. Accordingly, the University of Oregon Physics
Department has committed itself to the development of a strong program of
research and education in the fields of optics and optical physics. Over the
last two years, three tenure-level faculty members specializing in various
aspects of optical physics have been added to the Department. An integral part
of the new program is the development of an undergraduate teaching laboratory
specializing in modern optics, optical technology, and spectroscopy. The ten
experiments, of which the laboratory is composed, have been designed and will be
taught by faculty actively involved in optics research. Equipment specified is
almost without exception of the same type that is actually found in real
research and development laboratories engaged in optics related work. Students
successfully completing the course will have acquired not only a wide knowledge
of the principles of optics but will also be well versed in the practice of
optics. They will also gain exposure to simple yet important techniques such as
the representation of physical processes on oscilloscopes, and the computer
control of laboratory apparatus.
