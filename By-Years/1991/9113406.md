This award will support collaborative research between Philip Mulry, Colgate
University and Gordon Plotkin, University of Edinburgh. Utilizing certain
algebraic tools, specifically monads, algebras and categories, the investigators
propose to develop a systematic and conceptual approach to the interpretation
and solution of questions in computation theory and programming language
semantics. Dr. Plotkin's group is especially strong in the areas of Dr. Mulry's
research. They have identified three research topics of complementary interest
and expertise: (1) partial data types; (2) categorical fixed semantics; and (3)
special models of computation involving strong closure and properties, and
intrinsic internal structure. The U.S. investigator will benefit particularly
from Dr. Plotkin's diverse approaches to these problems and his pioneering
research on denotational and algebraic semantics of programs. The results of
this collaboration are expected to advance understanding of the fundamental
structures of computer science and its theoretical foundation.
