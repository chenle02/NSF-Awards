In this project the principal investigator will investigate techniques for
measuring wind stress near the sea surface in support of a program to measure
surface wave characteristics and to investigate mechanisms of generation of
surface waves by wind. Various anemometers will be evaluated, and
recommendations will be made for re-design and incorporation of the most
effective instruments in future field program. Further studies of the action-
balance equation model of wind- generation will also be carried out.
