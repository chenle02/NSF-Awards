9457826 Wang This research, supported by a National Science Foundation Young
Investigator Award, will focus on the mathematical theory of control systems.
Research will be conducted in the areas of (1) feedback stabilization for
nonlinear systems using a Lyapunov approach and (2) the relationships between
"input/output" differential equations and state space representations. The
National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award recognizes outstanding
young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for
significant development as a teacher and academic leader.
