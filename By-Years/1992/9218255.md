Glendale Community College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a 56,000
bits per second line through the Los Nettos mid-level network. The connection
enables the school's faculty and students to communicate and collaborate with
the international scientific and educational community, and to access network
resources such as libraries, databases and supercomputers. This award funds part
of the costs for two years.
