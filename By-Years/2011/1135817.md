i6 Membership for Southwest Sciences, Inc &lt;br/&gt;Phase II proposal #0646479
&lt;br/&gt;i6 Proposal #: 1119658 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southwest Sciences, Inc
has requested support for a one year membership to the New Mexico Technology
Ventures Corporation that was recently selected as the recipient of the Economic
Development Administration's Region 5 i6 award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal
of the proposed project is to improve the marketability of the diode laser
hygrometer developed in this SBIR project. Funding of this project will permit
Southwest Sciences to participate as a partner company in the i6 Challenge Grant
awarded to Technology Ventures Corporation (TVC) of Albuquerque, NM (EDA Austin
Region award). During the supplemental project, the prototype Phase II
instrumentation will be refined and improved so that it can be marketed for
direct sales to customers in the atmospheric research community.
