This research project will continue efforts in the area of probabilistic
analysis of structural loads and will attempt to overcome some of the
limitations of the current methods for load combination analysis. A major
objective of the project is the development of a simple and general approach for
approximating the largest value distribution and other descriptors of individual
load effects and their combinations. It is planned to: 1) examine novel load
models (translation processes) that can be obtained from Gaussian processes by
nonlinear transformations, 2) develop techniques for the analysis of linear and
nonlinear combinations of independent or dependent translation processes, and 3)
calibrate the proposed models to common structural loads based on statistical
observations of these loads and to determine probabilistic characteristics of
their combined effect.
