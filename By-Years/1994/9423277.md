This planning grant will focus and refine theory and methodology for field
research on collaborative processes in long-term interdisciplinary and inter-
institutional projects organized to solve complex social and technological
problems. Two projects, one on adolescent social welfare issues and one on
issues of regional water management, have agreed to serve as primary case
studies; five others will be involved in pre-testing. In this phase of the
research, the investigators will 1. consolidate and evaluate theories that
address collaborations, anchoring the project in Vygotskian sociocultural
theory; 2. develop hypotheses about collaborator values, roles, and working
methods; the interaction of these variables in multifaceted projects, and the
effects of these interactions on project climate, productivity, and
effectiveness; 3. determine levels of analysis; 4. identify social and political
issues affecting the primary case studies; 5. design a case study approach
balancing generalizability and depth; 6. refine and pre-test methods; and 7.
interview three key participants in each primary case. During this phase, the
investigators will present their results at regional and national conferences.
At its end, they will prepare and submit a research proposal to implement the
design that they have developed.
