9301044 Jackiewicz This two-year award supports US-Italy cooperative research in
waveform relaxation methods between Zdzislaw Jackiewicz, Arizona State
University, and Alfredo Bellen, University of Trieste, Italy. The objective of
their research is to investigate convergence, order, stability, and
contractivity properties of time-point relaxation and waveform relaxation Runge-
Kutta methods for ordinary differential equations. Such methods are appropriate
in a parallel computing environment and have been successfully used for time
domain analysis of large dynamical systems. Jackiewicz and Bellen are
specialists in waveform relaxation methods, which aim to develop effective
numerical methods for systems of ordinary differential equations. The topic area
is important because systems of ordinary differential equations arise naturally
in modeling a variety of important physical, biological, and geological
phenomena and in many industrial applications. This collaboration allows the
Italian expertise in parallel methods for differential equations to be
complemented by Jackiewicz's experience in general linear methods for
differential equations. This should lead to a better understanding of numerical
solution of ordinary differential equations in a parallel computing environment.
