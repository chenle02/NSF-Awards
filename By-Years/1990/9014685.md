This award enables Reed College to attach to NSFNET through a 56,000 bit per
second line to the NorthWestNet mid-level network. Access to NSFNET provides
Reed faculty with increased opportunity for collaboration and improves their
access to a wide range of research tools such as supercomputing and shared
databases. Reed has established a local area network linking faculty and student
workstations to a variety of local services including databases, compute
servers, printer servers and reference materials. This NSFNET connection helps
meet a long-term goal of the College, to provide access to remote services, by
extending this distributed computing environment to regional and national
supercomputing centers, library catalogs and reference materials of other
institutions, and remote database servers.
