Under an SGER award a search will be made for ultra-low friction materials. The
work is based on the premise that very smooth and very hard surfaces of
materials which do not deform by dislocation movement, by cracking, or by large
elastic deformation hysteresis due to molecular movement could have extremely
low friction. To test this hypothesis a number of highly cross-linked,
covalently bonded elastomers will be sought out and their frictional properties
related to their bond structure.
