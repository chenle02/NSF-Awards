This project employs a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean carbon model, driven by
NCEP reanalysis products, to investigate the sources of the large interannual
variability in the concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The hypothesis
that these fluctuations arise from variability in the exchange of carbon between
the ocean and atmosphere, and between the atmosphere and the land, will be
tested. Fresh insights into such problems as the modulation of the northern
hemisphere carbon sink, the CO2 response to ENSO, and the way in which
interdecadal modes of climate variability manifest themselves as carbon sources
and sinks are anticipated. This research addresses a major source of uncertainty
in climate change studies, and is expected to provide useful results to both the
scientific community and general public.
