Watson 9626968 The investigator derives global convergence theorems and develops
practical numerical algorithms with high quality mathematical software for
probability-one homotopies in the areas of constrained optimization, large
sparse unstructured systems of nonlinear equations, polynomial systems of
equations, and various disturbance rejection controls. The emphasis is on useful
convergence theorems expressed in terms of conditions on the original problem
rather than conditions on the derived problem. Important applications in control
systems design and multidisciplinary design optimization are used to guide the
theoretical investigations. The mathematical software uses the existing curve
tracking kernels in HOMPACK, leveraging HOMPACK to build application-specific
shells. Realistic models of physical phenomena are typically large and
nonlinear. Solving the large nonlinear systems of equations resulting from such
models requires new algorithms, and some recently developed homotopy algorithms
have been successfully applied to problems in circuit simulation, aircraft
design optimization, composite material design, control system synthesis, and
manufacturing mechanism design. This work studies the theoretical properties of
these new homotopy algorithms, and develops practical, high quality mathematical
software that provides a useful tool for engineers and scientists.
