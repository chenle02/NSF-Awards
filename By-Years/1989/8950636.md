The Computer Science Department at Eastern Michigan University equipped a
lecture auditorium for its Basic Studies Computer Science course with computer
and state-of-the-art peripheral equipment. This course is designed specifically
for non-computer science majors. This funding support changed the traditional
lecture format to include direct student-computer interactions during class
time. Student experiments in class are particularly effective in a large lecture
session because the faculty can exploit the computational capabilities of the
computer in real time. The goal of this project is to target each classroom
experiment to a specific concept, principle or effect of computers. To this end
the project combines microcomputers and audio and video components with the
necessary projection devices into an integrated instructional unit. This award
is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
