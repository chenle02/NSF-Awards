This project will investigate atmosphere-ocean interactions in the tropical
Pacific using a hierarchy of coupled atmosphere- ocean models of intermediate
complexity. Focus will be on examination of the effects of different atmospheric
models and surface boundary conditions on the interannual variability signal
related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Besides
investigating the fundamental mechanisms hypothesized to contribute to the ENSO,
the project will determine the feasibility of using an improved version of the
intermediate model for predicting El Nino occurrences.
