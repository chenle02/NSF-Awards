It has long been recognized that temperature changes at the earth's surface are
propagated into the subsurface but with an amplitude attenuation and time delay
that increase with depth. Thus corrections to heat flow are sometimes calculated
for the effect of the Pleistocene ice ages, and the effects of the Little
Climatic Optimum of the 10th and 11th centuries and the Little Ice Age of the
17th and 18th centuries may be detected in some geothermal records. Many
borehole temperature profiles show changes in the temperature gradient in the
uppermost 100m that may be driven by a secular change of surface temperature
over the past century. The purpose of this project is to enable four geothermal
laboratories (University of Michigan, University of North Dakota, University of
Utah, Southern Methodist University) to interrogate and analyze their respective
borehole temperature archives for data relevant to questions of global climate
change. These archives contain extensive data from the USA and Africa south of
the equator.
