The goal of this project is to build a prototype of the Arithmetic Cube, which
is a high-speed programmable VLSI processor for solving linear digital signal
processing problems. The structure of the cube is based on algorithms for the
discrete Fourier transform of small sets of points, which require small numbers
of multipliers.
