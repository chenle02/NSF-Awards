This project is aimed at developing a VLSI-like design methodology for Nano-
electro-mechanical Systems (NEMS). Specifically, computer-aided design (CAD)
tools are being developed for functional and compact modeling of nano-electro-
mechanical devices. Unlike macroscopic and some microscopic devices, where
continuum physical principles are valid, at nanoscales it is important to
account for granular nature of the devices. A multiscale approach combining the
lowest level atomistic approaches to the highest-level continuum theories are
being developed for functional modeling of NEMS. The development of compact
models is being investigated to enable design of large and interconnected-array
of NEM devices. Finally, carbon nanotube based NEMS are being investigated as
basic building blocks for nanoscale sensors, actuators, devices and
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
