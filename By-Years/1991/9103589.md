The proposed research will focus on the numerical simulation of localized
failure in the form of discontinuous bifurcation. A unified approach will be
developed to capture spatial discontinuities within fixed grid and moving grid
methods using mesh re-alignment. The computational framework to be developed
will provide (i) singularity-enriched finite elements with the ability to
transmit localized failure within a fixed grid lay-out, (ii) grid re-alignment
strategies in order to capture discontinuities of the first order via nodal re-
location. The proposed work will also encompass theoretical and computational
developments to regularize softening formulations via nonlocal fracture energy
concepts.
