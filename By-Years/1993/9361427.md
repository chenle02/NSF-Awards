9361427 Langford Atmospheric science platforms of all types require a reliable
and cost-effective means of communicating with home laboratories. Current
satellite techniques suffer from low data rates, excessive latencies, high
costs, or other complications. A new generation of low-altitude commercial data
relay satellites offers attractive opportunities to improve over-the-horizon
telemetry and telecommand. Aurora Flight Sciences proposes to develop and
demonstrate and atmospheric science data link using Orbital Sciences
Corporation's ORBCOMM satellite system. While Aurora's work will be directed
towards data relay requirements for aircraft and balloons, it will be applicable
to a broad range of science pursuits including buoys and ground stations. ***
