Modern programming languages ranging from Java to Matlab rely on just-in-time
compilation techniques to achieve performance competitive with computer
languages such as C or C++. What sets just-in-time compilers apart from batch
compilers is that they can observe the programs actions as it executes, and
inspect its state. Knowledge of the program's state and past behavior, allows
the compiler to perform speculative optimizations that improve performance. The
intellectual merits of this research are to devise techniques for reasoning
about the correctness of the transformations performed by just-in-time
compilers. The project's broader significance and importance are its
implications to industrial practice. The results of this research will be
applicable to commercial just-in-time compilers for languages such as JavaScript
and R.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a general model of just-in-
time compilation that subsumes deployed systems and allows systematic
exploration of the design space of dynamic compilation techniques. The research
questions that will be tackled in this work lie along two dimensions:
Experimental -- explore the design space of dynamic compilation techniques and
gain an understanding of trade-offs; Foundational -- formalize key ingredients
of a dynamic compiler and develop techniques for reasoning about correctness in
a modular fashion.
