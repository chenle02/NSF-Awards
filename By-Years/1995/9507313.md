The objective of this research is to evolve generic initial data for
cosmological models to determine its asymptotic behavior. So far, this method
has been successfully applied to the plane symmetric (vacuum) Gowdy cosmology on
the 3- torus where strong support for its conjectured velocity dominated
singularity has been obtained and interesting nonlinear interactions between the
two polarizations of gravitational waves in the model have been observed.
Cosmological observations indicate that, on the largest distance scales, the
dynamics of the Universe today can be described by Einstein's theory of general
relativity. It has long been known that, followed backward in time, Einstein's
equations imply that a singular state of infinite density and temperature (the
Big Bang) occurred a finite time ago. However, the nature of this predicted
generic singularity is not known. The primary focus of this research is a long
term numerical study to determine the nature of the generic cosmological
singularity.
