This dissertation grant is for research to analyze the influence of women in
supervisory positions on the attainment of the individuals they supervise. The
first part of the study focuses on the impact of female faculty on the
educational and labor market success of female students. Data from the National
Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1973 and the High School and
Beyond sophomore cohort will be utilized for the analysis. Statistical analysis
of the these data will shed light on the issue of whether there is a positive
role model effect of female faculty on women's education and success in the
labor market. The second part of the project analyzes the effects of supervisor
gender on male and female employees using the concept of compensating wage
differentials. The major data source is the National Longitudinal Survey Youth
Cohort. Of special interest is whether there is a mentoring effect for women
having a female supervisor. This research is important because it will shed
light on the importance of role models and mentors in reducing educational and
labor force attainments differences between men and women.
