9601411 McGee Mechanisms regulating enzymatic reactions on membranes will be
studied using membrane-dependent proteases as experimental model systems. The
kinetics of these systems will be analyzed under biologically relevant
conditions by tracer dilution techniques in continuously perfused cultures of
intact cells. Effects of hydration and electrostatic forces will be investigated
under controlled osmotic stress, ionic strength and temperature. Available
theoretical treatments of reaction kinetics will be selected and combined on the
basis of experimental data, to arrive at a general model equation. This equation
will incorporate easily identifiable parameters and will have immediate
practical uses in membrane research. %%% The proposed studies will provide new
and fundamental information on the catalytic function of biological membranes.
This information will serve to predict the role of diffusion and the
consequences of colloidosmotic fluctuations on membrane-reactions in vivo. The
predictive models, developed on the basis of this research, will be applicable
to a large group of physiologically important protease pathways and will fill
major gaps in the general understanding of mechanisms controlling reactions on
surfaces. ***
