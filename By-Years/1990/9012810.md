This program continues a research effort on high resolution transmission
electron microscopy studies of phase transitions and solid state reactions in
modulated structures. The emphasis in the new research will be on modulated
structures which appear in the high temperature superconductors. The initial
effort will be on the bismuth-strontium-calcium cuprate system. The study of the
modulation modes and their relation to the critical temperature will be
investigated. The control of the modulation mode to find new, improved materials
is of interest. The study of the microscopic features of intergrowth of
modulated structures and their relation to the superconducting properties will
be emphasized.
