This is a NSF Small Grants for Exploratory Research to enable the American
Association for the Advancement of Science to gather and establish time-critical
base-line data on the impacts of post 9/11 security measures on the conduct of
scientific research. Since 9/11, finding the right balance between serving the
national security and maintaining the openness required for the advancement of
science has increasingly become a challenge. The scientific community has
acknowledged its responsibilities to contribute to the nation's security, but
has voiced concerns about the impacts on science of increased emphasis on
national security. There is anecdotal evidence that the research community has
been affected in ways that have disrupted the conduct and communication of
scientific research. The American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) project will track and analyze the impacts on science of new national
security initiatives. In the initial year of what is intended to be a longer-
term effort, AAAS will design a database to collect and manage data documenting
instances of how science and scientists have been affected. It will collect
these data through several different methodologies, and create a web site to
serve as a clearinghouse of information on issues related to science and
security. AAAS will eventually make the database accessible to others for
extended analyses of the data. During the course of the project, AAAS will
periodically brief the media, U.S. policy makers, representatives of industry
and foreign embassies, and members of the scientific community on its findings.
