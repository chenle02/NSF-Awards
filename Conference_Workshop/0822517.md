The Thirtieth Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern
University on October 24-25, 2008. The program was organized by a committee
consisting of Ananda Weerasinghe, Julien Dubedat and Joseph Quinn. The Main
Speaker will be Jean-Francois LeGall and the Hour Speakers will be Alexi Borodin
and Savas Dayanik.

The Midwest Probability Colloquium hosts 75-100 people from the greater Midwest
region, A special effort is made to encourage attendance by graduate students,
minorities and under-represented groups in the mathematical community. This is
done by hotel supplements and, in some cases, travel supplements. As in the
past, Northwestern University will also provide some partial support.
