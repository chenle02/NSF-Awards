The Maine EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement award is designed to
enhance Maine's competitiveness in molecular biophysical sciences through a
partnership between the University of Maine and Maine's non-profit research
organizations. The proposed Biophysical Sciences Institute brings together
University of Maine faculty in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and
spatial engineering, with biomedical researchers at the Jackson Laboratory and
Maine Medical Center Research Institute. Maine EPSCoR proposes to hire
additional tenure-track faculty in the fields of biophysics and advanced optics,
biochemistry, structural biology, applied mathematics, computer science, image
analysis and visualization, and material science. The new and existing
investigators will form research teams to develop new measurement techniques,
new sensors, and innovative approaches to data processing and interpretation in
intracellular structures and dynamics, functional materials as a means to
manipulate cellular reactions, and biocomputing. In addition to establishing the
institute, Maine EPSCoR will integrate research and education through
improvements to graduate training.
