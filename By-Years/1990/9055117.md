The Interdisciplinary Science Center of Hampton University will initiate a
three-week, residential Young Scholars (EAI) project in math and physics for 24
minority students entering grade 7. Participants will have an opportunity for
math/physics enrichment working with Hampton University physics and mathematics
professors as well as with scientists from a Department of Energy site, the
Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).
