This proposal deals with the study of Galois representations associated to
elliptic curves and modular curves. Several years of study have yielded a large
number of classes of these representations and an appreciation for their
properties. The PI proposes to link representations in these classes. If carried
out successfully, this will provide an alternative to the Serre-Mazur- Ribet
program that gets around the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture. This is research
in the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and
questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among
the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely
aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an
essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error
correcting codes for electronics.
