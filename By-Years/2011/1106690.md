The main goal of this application is to utilize spectral analysis techniques for
dealing with high-dimensional inferential problems. Techniques of random matrix
theory, especially Stieltjes transforms of spectral measures, will be utilized
to enhance understanding the effects of dependencies among observations on
commonly used statistical procedures in high-dimensional settings. As a key
component, investigations on the spectral characteristics of large random
matrices with dependencies among both rows and columns will be carried out. In
addition, new regularization schemes will be developed that are tuned to the
characteristics of the data, including possible non-stationarity of the
observations, and make use of the intrinsic parsimonious structures in the data.

The proposed application is motivated by problems in a wide range of scientific
fields such as wireless communication, spectrometry, genomics, environmental
modeling, atmospheric science, brain imaging and econometrics. The emphasis of
this proposal is to develop theoretical understanding and practical tools for
analyzing complex and large-scale data arising in these disciplines. The
research outputs from this project are expected to give wider access among
scientists and practitioners in various disciplines to modern statistical tools
and concepts for dealing with high-dimensional data. In addition, the tools and
ideas developed through this project are likely to contribute towards downstream
technologies that require sophisticated real-time data analysis techniques for
complex time-varying signals.
