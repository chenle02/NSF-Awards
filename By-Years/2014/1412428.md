The configuration of points on a surface at which computations are carried out
affects how well one can approximate functions of the surface or the shape of
the surface itself. Configurations that optimize some notion of energy
associated with the arrangement of points can lead to better approximations.
This research project explores efficient implementation of such optimal
configurations, to provide improved tools for data sampling methods and for
simulating complex geophysical processes such as climate changes and heat
diffusion in Earth's mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization problems for
energy are of significance in discretizing various surfaces and volumes. For
example, point configurations generated by a suitably weighted Riesz energy can
approximate a prescribed density on the object. The investigative team is (i)
implementing numerically the theory developed by the principal investigators by
exploring efficient algorithms for the computation of near optimal energy
configurations on manifolds, and (ii) developing the asymptotic theory of
periodic versions of optimal energy problems and especially their connection to
lattice (crystalline) structures. Undergraduate and graduate students as well as
post-doctoral fellows play an active role in the research program.
