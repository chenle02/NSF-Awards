Dagan Corporation has recently developed an integrating patch clamp that uses a
capacitor in the headstage to sense charge. Both the noise and band width
characteristics of this instrument are superior to those of resistive patch
clamps. However, preliminary studies indicate that the packages of the
individual electronic components are adding significant noise to the system.
Under the direction of Dr. Allan Erickson, the firm will examine background
noise and determine methods to reduce this noise to a minimum. The applied
approach will involve the use of a hybrid integrated circuit with unique
packaging materials. In Phase 1 of the research, the optimal choices of
materials for various parts of the package will be determined. Phase 2 focus on
developing an actual probe incorporating the knowledge gained in Phase 1. In
Phase 3, the patch clamp probe designed in Phase 2 will be combined with the
remaining support circuitry, and a commercial patch clamp will be built and
marketed. In addition, a general purpose current monitor for sub-picoamp
measurements will be developed for use in other instruments.
