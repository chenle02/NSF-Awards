This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Columbia University. Leonard Fine
is the site's Program Director and Bhawana Venkataraman is the Co-Program
Director. Twenty-four faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award
period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week
program. To increase their record in the past of 15% minority students to at
least 20%, they will actively develop personal contacts at minority serving
institutions with faculty and administrators. Research available to the students
includes analytical and theoretical chemistry, synthetic and biological
chemistry, physical and inorganic chemistry, solid state and nanochemistry,
polymer chemistry and materials research. Students will participate on a regular
basis in group meetings and seminars. Two daylong field trips are planned -- one
to a national laboratory and the other to an industrial laboratory. An external
review is being developed in addition to students and research mentors
completing a survey both at the start and at the end of the program. Students in
the program will be tracked in subsequent years.
