The proposed research will investigate the ability of commonly-used poisons and
preservatives to prevent alteration and decomposition of organic matter
collected in sediment traps. In-situ experiments will be conducted under
conditions which represent both coastal and open ocean areas, periods of maximum
high and low productivity, and oxic and anoxic environments. The experiments
will test the ability of different poisons/preservatives to prevent
compositional changes of organic matter in sediment traps and will provide
fundamental information on the relative decomposition rates of individual
compounds and compound classes, specifically contrasting terrigenous and marine
material in oxic and anoxic basins. Two major questions will be addressed: 1)
what is the effectiveness of various poisons and preservatives on the
composition of organic matter collected in sediment traps; and 2) what is the
extent of decomposition or preservation of the major classes of biogenic
compounds? The approach to answering these questions will be to determine
concentrations of organic compounds (lipids, sugars, amino acids, pigments, and
lignin oxidation products) in sediment traps which have been unpoisoned or which
have been treated with HgC12, NaN3, chloroform, salt gradient, formalin, or
antibiotics. Field experiments will be conducted in Dabob Bay, Washington,
during low and high productivity, in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, in oxic
and anoxic waters, and at the time-series Station "S" off Bermuda.
