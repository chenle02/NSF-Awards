This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research
investigates a new approach to surface reeconstruction in computer vision.
Surface reconstruction, the process of recovering descriptions of the visible
surfaces in a scene from a noisy and perhaps sparse set of depth points, plays a
fundamental role in such robotic tasks as object modeling, grasp planning and
navigation. Standard approaches have two limitations: they assume that there are
no extreme errors in the data; and they assume that the visible surface can be
accurately modeled with a single piecewise continuous function of the image
coordinates. These limitations severely restrict the applicability of present
surface reconstruction techniques. The new approach overcomes these problems
using a two phase technique: (1) a local estimation phase that produces
polynomial surface patches in regions throughout the image, including possibly
overlapping surfaces, and (2) a global refinement phase that links and refines
mutually consistent local estimates.
