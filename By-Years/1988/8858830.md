This is a Presidential Young Investigator award which will be used to study the
radiative properties of clouds over a high latitude snow/ice lower boundary, and
to relate the radiative transfer processes to atmospheric dynamics. A major
objective is to develop a technique for parameterizing clouds and their
radiative properties for numerical weather and climate prediction models, with
applications to the seasonal variation in aerosol concentration in polar regions
and to the resulting arctic haze problem.
