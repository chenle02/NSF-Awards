W:\awards\awards97 9701409 Tonner This renewal project will study the structural
and magnetic properties of metastable magnetic ultrathin films of transition
metals, grown under controlled conditions by ultra-high vacuum physical vapor
deposition and by sputter-deposition. Growth conditions will be chosen to
produce novel crystal structures, which are not ordinarily found in the bulk
phase diagram. We combine structural and magnetic measurements to correlate
changes in the magnetic phase diagram with surface crystallography and
morphology. Multiple structural techniques are employed, including quantitative
electron and photoelectron diffraction, and surface x-ray diffraction. Magnetic
measurements are primarily done using circularly polarized soft x-ray circular
dichroism. The emphasis is on ultrathin binary alloys, coupled ferromagnetic
bilayers, and 'wedge' and 'sandwich' nanostructures. %%% This is a renewal
project in which modern techniques of crystal growth will be used to create
magnetic nanostructures which have unique and surprising properties. We are
searching for ways to produce magnetic materials that can be useful in a new
generation of computer digital electronics. These devices, called spin-valves or
spin-transistors, use magnetism in the way that the older transistor uses
electronic charge. Since the magnetic information can be stored for long periods
without the need for an external power source, spin-valves are attractive as a
new type of computer memory device for portable computers. The physical
properties which are desirable for a high efficiency spin valve require us to
control the growth of magnetic layers with atomic precision. The magnetic
behavior of these metastable, ultrathin, magnetic films can be completely
different from that of an ordinary 'bulk' material. We are studying the
relationship between structure and magnetic properties, to develop ways of
predicting and optimizing ultrathin mag nets for spin valves. ***
