X-ray standing waves and surface diffraction, along with electrochemical
techniques, will be used to study solid-liquid interfaces of deliberate
architecture. The study will include an emphasis on the potential dependent
structural changes and ionic permeation of phospholipid membrances on
electrodes, and on redox active self assembling and Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers
on electrodes.
