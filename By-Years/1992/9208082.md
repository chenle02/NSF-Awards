This research will draw lessons for the design of United States' hazard policies
from experiences in Australia and New Zealand with cooperative approaches to
hazard mitigation. The research foci are the merits-based hazard mitigation
policies in New South Wales, Australia and cooperative hazards planning in New
Zealand. Experiences with these cooperative regulatory policies and their
lessons for the United States are to be examined through collaborative study by
American, Australian, and New Zealand researchers. The research objectives are
to: (1) document the strengths and limitations of cooperative regulatory
provisions as implemented for selected hazards policies in Australia and New
Zealand; (2) compare the performance of cooperative regulatory provisions for
selected policies in Australia and New Zealand with a parallel set of research
results in the United States; and (3) assess the implications of these findings
for future regulatory provisions as part of U.S. earthquake and other hazards
policies.
