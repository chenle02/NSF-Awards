&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on developing circuits and architectures for
asynchronous high-performance computers. Asynchronous organization has a number
of significant advantages over the traditional globally synchronous approach
that we plan to exploit. These advantages can be broken down into two general
categories: those that relate to the circuit-level properties of asynchronous
circuits, and those that relate to the higher-level sequential properties of
this form of implementation. Circuit advantages, which are mostly directly
related to the absence of the global clock signal, include lower electro-
magnetic interference (EMI), lower power, and easier system integration due to
the local and modular interconnection of asynchronous system pieces. Higher-
level organizational advantages&lt;br/&gt;include the ability of an asynchronous
system to adapt to data-dependent delays in system components, take advantage of
early completion of system activities, and more naturally mediate sub-
task&lt;br/&gt;concurrency during system operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
