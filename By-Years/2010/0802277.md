The Nanotechnology Rural Education Initiative (NANOredi) builds upon the success
of Dakota County Technical College's (DCTC) ATE MnNANO project in partnership
with the University of Minnesota's Nanofabrication Center. NANOredi's
Nanoscience Technology certificate program provides students from rural
communities in southeast Minnesota, who are interested in pursuing careers in
nanoscience, with transitional opportunities before transferring to a
metropolitan college or university. Minnesota State College-Southeast
Technical's certificate program includes the three core nanoscience courses that
are offered in the first year of the DCTC program as well as general education
math and science courses. NANOredi, in partnership with the Rushford Institute
for Nanotechnology, also provides a regional Nanotechnology Conference for
leaders in industry, government, community organizations, and educational
institutions to raise awareness of the opportunities and trends in
nanotechnology.
