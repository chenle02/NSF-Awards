P.I: Thoroughgood&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 0215437&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE) will provide
coordination, communication, evaluation and strategic planning services to the
Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence network. Central Coordinating
Office activities supported by this award will include a series of network PI
and outreach meetings to build community consensus and enhance communications
between Centers. The COSEE CCO will also conduct an annual 'value-added'
workshop on a topic of concern to the network. Topics will include program and
network evaluation and assessment as well as the development of an overall
strategic plan for COSEE. In addition, the CCO will handle the recruitment and
organization of an appropriate national advisory group for the network. The
office's functions will also encompass outreach to non-COSEE educators and
scientists as well as agencies and institutions with an interest in ocean
science education. A COSEE network website will be established in conjunction
with the Bridge website. Subcontractors include the Office of Program Evaluation
at the University of South Carolina (evaluation) and the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science (website development).&lt;br/&gt;
