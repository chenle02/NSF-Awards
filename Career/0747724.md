Elliptic curves are fundamental objects in arithmetic geometry, together with
their higher dimensional generalizations, abelian varieties, and their function
field analogues, Drinfeld modules. The extraordinary interest in these objects
emerges from their remarkable analytic, algebraic, arithmetic and geometric
properties. Jean-Pierre Serre was the first to investigate elliptic curves from
an analytic number theoretic point of view, in a systematic and innovative way,
mostly motivated by conjectures proposed by Serge Lang and Hale Trotter in the
1970s in analogy with classical deep open problems in number theory. Serre's
research on analytic properties for elliptic curves was subsequently continued,
among others, by Rajiv Gupta, M. Ram Murty and V. Kumar Murty, and, more
recently, by the PI herself. The PI proposes to expand and deepen her prior
research investigations to higher dimensional abelian varieties and Drinfeld
modules, through analytic tools, such as sieves, used in an arithmetic
geometrical context. Her research efforts will corroborate with her educational
endeavours, such as doctoral and postdoctoral mentoring, and will be made
available to a broad audience through conference presentations and workshop
organization.

The proposed research lies in the general area of number theory, a
distinguished branch of mathematics with a marvelous long history and exciting
current developments and applications. The central objects of study in number
theory are prime numbers and Diophantine equations. The proposed research
projects concern thorough studies of prime numbers with additional interesting
properties coming from geometric contexts. Apart from the intrinsic interest in
the main theoretical questions underlying these projects, there is yet an
additional appealing interest emerging from the practical implications of
progress on these questions to fields such as cryptography and coding theory.
