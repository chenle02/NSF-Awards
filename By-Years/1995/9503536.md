9503536 Leaman In this project, the PIs will continue and complete the analysis
of these data an array of subsurface drifting floats which were deployed for
several years in different components of the Deep Western Boundary Current east
of Abaco Island in the Bahamas. The motivation for this experiment arose from
previous observations that high-velocity cores are not coincident with high (or
low) concentrations of tracers (particularly freons). Focus will be on
hypothesized reasons for this discrepancy, particularly on recirculation gyres
and topographic effects. ***
