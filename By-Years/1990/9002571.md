Failure of concrete structures during construction constitutes a significant
percentage of construction failures. Among the causes of formwork failure are
inadequate strength and overloading. The proposed study will concentrate on
developing probability models for predicting the resistances and stiffnesses of
handset wood slab formworks commonly used in multistory concrete construction.
The behavior of a formwork system is not only a function of the strength and the
physical condition of its members but also the quality of its installation
workmanship. Therefore, to develop formwork load-deformation and resistance
models, samples of formwork members and form installation workmanship data will
be collected from several construction sites. Each collected member sample will
be erected in the lab for test with the same installation deviations and
inaccuracies measured for it at the construction site. The tests results will be
used to derive probability models expressing the resistance and stiffness of
wood formworks.
