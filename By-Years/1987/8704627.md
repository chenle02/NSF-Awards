This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used in a number of projects including: (1) Lagrangean
decomposition applied to problems in integer programming, (2) the development of
robust statistical procedures for situations with missing data, (3) adjustment
of permutation inferential techniques for observational studies where the
treatments are not assigned at random to the subjects, (4) investigation of the
properties of time series estimation methods when there is missing data, and (5)
the use of bootstrap methods to produce prediction intervals in time series
settings.
