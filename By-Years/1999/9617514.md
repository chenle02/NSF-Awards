Instrumentation necessary to apply the novel technique of hyperpolarized
xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to biological
investigations conducted in vitro and with living plants and animals will be
developed. This instrumentation will include an optical pumping chamber to
generate the hyperpolarized xenon, a gas delivery system for administration of
the gas to the animal and a low temperature trap for removal of the rubidium
vapor (necessary for the generation process). This technique will result in
greater sensitivity and contrast in magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic
resonance imaging when applied to these systems. It will aid in illuminating
such systems and problems as: the integrity and function of excitable lipid
membranes; the relation of lung structure to lung mechanical properties; gas
diffusion within the lung; regional blood flow and oxygenation in the brain;
functional cortical mapping; intercellular gas diffusion in leaves and other
plant organs; and water fluxes in roots and leaves.
