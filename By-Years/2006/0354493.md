ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consistent with EPSCoR's current guidelines, Rhode
Island is eligible for the submission of a planning grant, since it receives
0.75% or less of the total NSF research funds to all sources within a state
averaged over the past three years (NSF 02-027). Therefore, the University of
Rhode Island submitted proposal No. &lt;br/&gt;EPS 0354493, Drawing a Road Map
to Research Excellence in Rhode Island. It is aimed at initiating an 18-month
planning process to improve the competitiveness of the state's research
enterprise by substantially increasing its investment in research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed process builds on previous state planning
that identified life science as the initial target of research infrastructure
investment, triggering $180 million investment in facilities by the University
of Rhode Island and Brown University-the state's two PhD-granting institutions.
It will also integrate Rhode Island's life science research enterprise with
existing programs for workforce development and technology by increasing the
pipeline of students into K-16 science programs and the impact of university
research on state economic development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhode Island has
formed a state governing committee comprised of leaders in academe, state
government, and the private sector to lead a statewide study of barriers and
possible solutions. It is expected that the proposed planning effort increases
not only collaboration among the state universities, but also improves the
educational experience of science and technology students, and increases the
educational opportunities of underrepresented groups through the establishment
of closer relationships between the primarily undergraduate schools and research
universities. &lt;br/&gt;
