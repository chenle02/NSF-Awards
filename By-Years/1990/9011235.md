Hydrogenated amorphous silicon films will be deposited using low pressure,
continuous microwave discharges in toroidal and linear systems available at
Texas Tech University. The liquid sources will be used as a replacement for
silane, phosphene, diborane and methane. We plan to use infrared absorption
spectroscopy, continuous wave emission and picosecond time-resolved
photoluminescence spectroscopy, time of flight measurements, and
photoconductivity techniques to characterize the films prepared under a variety
of deposition conditions. The liquid sources together with the magnetically
confined microwave produced plasma are expected to deposit high quality films at
very high growth rates (&gt;10A/s). We are already getting interesting results
on intrinsic and carbon doped films deposited in a linear system. Our ultimate
goal is to improve the quality of the films by varying various deposition
parameters (e.g., microwave power, magnetic field, gas pressure, substrate
temperature, etc.) This will finally improve the quality of the devices made
from these films. Another goal is to reduce the toxic and explosive risks
associated with present film deposition techniques.
