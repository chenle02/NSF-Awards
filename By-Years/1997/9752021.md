This project will revise the curriculum in drafting and design in order to
ensure that community colleges can educate students to current and projected
industry standards in computer-aided drafting and design. An in-depth study of
the design process in a 3-D modeling environment and of the new package of
skills which the process demands will culminate in the creation and piloting of
a new curriculum which will include rapid prototyping and CNC machining. The
resulting curriculum manual will be disseminated nationally. In order to insure
its successful implementation, faculty and teacher workshops will be conducted
and internship opportunities will be provided.
