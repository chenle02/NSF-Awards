Developing force by applying pressure to a closed container is a simple enough
concept; controlling the pressure and flow so that the point of application of
the force is constrained to move exactly as desired requires a comprehensive
knowledge of fluid mechanics and automatic control theory. The study of fluid-
power has become an essential part of the training of agricultural, aerospace,
industrial and mechanical engineers. Fluid-power devices may be found in
equipment ranging from a garden tractor to a flight simulator. A sequence of
fluid-power experiments starting with basic fluid properties and culminating in
the control of linear and rotary actuators is provided to the student. Some
fluid-power controls are capable of very rapid response and instrumentation must
tract this response. The new instrumentation will be capable of measuring flows,
pressure, and displacements at intervals of 1/1000 or less. The fluid power
industry routinely uses microcomputer based instrumentation and it is essential
that an engineering student should appreciate the capability of such
instrumentation.
