Description: This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Dwight Baker, Yale
University, and Dr. Samira Mansour, Suez Canal University. The overall purpose
of this collaboration is to identify useful Frankia strain inocula that will
improve growth and yield of Casuarina plantations in Egypt. Much of the research
will be conducted at the Suez Canal University in Ismailia, Egypt under the
supervision of Dr. Samira Mansour. Dr. Baker will assist in the design of the
experiments in Egypt and travel to Ismailia for the set-up of screening trials.
At the conclusion of the trials in Egypt, Dr. Mansour will travel to Yale
University and complete the DNA analyses in Dr. Baker's laboratory. Scope: This
project brings together research scientists from two countries working on
nitrogen-fixing trees (Casuarina) and bacterial symbionts (Frankia). It is
anticipated that this collaborative research effort will result in improved
strains of Frankia that could enhance growth and yield of Casuarina. This
collaboration forms a valuable part of our emerging perceptions of Frankia
biology. Therefore, this project fulfills objectives of the Science in
Developing Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration.
