The focus of this research is in the photochemical introduction of oxygen into
organic substrates in zeolites using two approaches. In the first approach a
viologen electron-transfer sensitizer will be used to activate unsaturated
substrates towards reaction with either triplet oxygen or superoxide. Several
viologens with different reduction potentials will be studied in order to
understand the factors that influence the viability and reaction efficiencies.
In addition, the use of novel atropisomers of viologens will be used to
determine the feasibility of enantioselective photooxygenations. In the second
approach singlet oxygen sensitizers will be used to conduct intrazeolitic
singlet oxygen reactions with both alkene and sulfide substrates. New
mechanistic tools such as oxygen tracer and trapping experiments will be
developed in order to understand these intrazeolite singlet oxygen reactions.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Edward Clennan of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming, Laramie. Professor Clennan
will focus his research on the development of new ways to introduce oxygen into
hydrocarbons, which is of great interest to the agricultural, pharmaceutical and
fine chemicals industries. Chemistry students at the graduate and post-doctoral
level will be trained in Professor Clennan's lab.
