9614754 Rhodes The primary aim of this project is to provide insights into the
processes of magma generation within the Hawaiian mantle plume using the
geochemical and isotopic composition of samples from Mauna Loa, a volcano with
one of the best-documented prehistoric eruptive geochronologies. This goal will
be achieved by completing the geochemical database on a group of samples from
Mauna Loa that have been previously analysed with 14C. The intent of this
proposal is to utilize this unique record to provide detailed documentation of
both long- and short-term geochemical variations in Mauna Loa's eruptive
history. This information will allow the determination of periods of cyclical
activity in the eruptive record where the magma supply rate appears to have
changed dramatically. Samples from critical periods, selected on the basis of
XRF data, will be analysed for additional trace elements by INAA, and for Sr and
Pb isotopic compositions. The results of this work will be used to evaluate
long-term geochemical and isotopic trends from the perspectives seen in the
short-term data, and to provide answers to questions of the nature and evolution
of the plume source over time.
