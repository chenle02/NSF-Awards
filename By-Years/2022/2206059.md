This award, enabled by the partnership between NSF and the Czech Science
Foundation (GACR), supports a collaboration that combines expertise from the
University of Michigan, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and ELI-Beamlines
in the Czech Republic to develop tools for modeling experiments at high power
laser facilities. With rapid recent progress in laser technology, high-power
laser facilities can generate some of the most extreme electromagnetic fields in
the universe by focusing the laser light down to a tiny spot. These fields can
accelerate charged particles to near the speed of light in a fraction of a
million billionth of a second, producing bright, point-like sources of
radiation. In such strong fields, high energy gamma-rays can spontaneously decay
into pairs of matter-antimatter particles, thus creating matter from light. This
project will further chart a path to studying even more extreme laser
intensities, aiming to develop ways to make dense and ultrashort duration beams
of antimatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop the required
theoretical tools and investigate the conditions for experiments studying strong
field quantum electrodynamics phenomena. A postdoctoral researcher will
integrate codes for modeling the interaction point physics. This will enable
detailed studies of quantum broadening of the electron spectrum, polarization
and spin effects and determining the requirements for a laser facility to study
avalanche- and shower-type cascades. This will enable design of experiments at
existing laser facilities, including ELI-Beamlines. The project will also chart
a path to the generation and behavior of lepton-photon plasma and establish a
research collaboration between the NSF ZEUS Laser Facility at the University of
Michigan and ELI-Beamlines in the Czech Republic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
