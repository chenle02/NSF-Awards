This research will test the hypothesis that halogen-containing oxidants (such as
HOBr) play a significant role in sulfate aerosol formation in the marine
boundary layer. Because HOBr and HOCl transfer unique isotopic signatures of
oxygen to their oxidation products, the oxygen isotopic composition of the
measured sulfate reflects the relative importance of the different mechanisms of
oxidation. Measurements of Delta(17)Oxygen in sulfate, a value dependent only on
the oxidation pathway of SO2 to sulfate, will be made on aerosol filter samples
previously collected from nearly every major ocean basin. The global chemical
transport model GEOS-Chem will be run for the days that the filter samples were
collected. The modeled data for Delta(17)Oxygen will be compared with
observations to provide constraints on the relative importance of hypohalous
acid (HOX) in sulfate formation at each location.

The results of this effort are important for understanding sulfate formation in
the remote marine boundary layer. Sulfate is a major component of atmospheric
aerosol and is especially important in the formation of new aerosol. This
research is highly relevant for gaining a better understanding of cloud-aerosol
chemistry and climate change.
