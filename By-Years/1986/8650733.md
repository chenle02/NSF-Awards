The Williams College Department of Physics and Astronomy will purchase equipment
to conduct laser spectroscopy experiments. Junior and senior undergraduates will
use the equipment in laboratory courses to explore laser spectroscopy and
computer control of experiments. A nitrogen pumped dye laser, a spectrometer,
and a boxcar integrator will be used to explore some of the recently developed
techniques of modern spectroscopy. All three instruments will be controlled by a
computer. The boxcar integrator, which is a tool for recording fast electronic
signals, and the computer will also be used by senior honors students carrying
out original research under the supervision of a faculty member. This
sophisticated modern equipment will be an important addition to the college's
teaching facilities.
