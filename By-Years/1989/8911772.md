Professor Giere has organized a workshop on the implications of the cognitive
sciences for research in the philosophy of science. The Workshop is to be held
under the sponsorship of the Center for Philosophy of Science at the University
of Minnesota. It is scheduled to take place October 26-29, 1989. The idea behind
the workshop is that the cognitive sciences have reached a sufficient state of
maturity so that they can now provide a valuable resource for philosophers of
science who are developing general theories of science as a human activity. The
hope is that the cognitive sciences might come to play the sort of role that
formal logic played for Logical Empiricism or that history of science played for
the historical school within the philosophy of science. This development might
permit the philosophy of science as a whole finally to move beyond the division
between "logical" and "historical" approaches that has characterized the field
since the middle 1960s.
