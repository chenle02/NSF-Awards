This research project concerns noncommutative differential geometry and
topology. This project deals with developing special functors that have been
discovered by the principal investigator. These functors are used to study
systematically the dense subalgebras of certain algebras that arise in modern
analysis. These dense subalgebras carry more sensitive geometric data in many
areas of application. Previously known algebraic K- theory and cyclic theory
functors are sensitive to this data but tend to be uncomputable. The principal
investigator's functors are designed to provide better access to geometric
information about these dense subalgebras. The project is in the general area of
analysis and geometry. It concerns the study of certain 'mappings', which are
called functors. These functors determine invariants of the topology and
geometry of certain manifolds significant to the geometric aspects of the
mathematical sciences.
