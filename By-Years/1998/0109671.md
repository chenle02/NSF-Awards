This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
integrated, wireless transceiver Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)
circuits for neuron based data acquisition (DAQ) systems. Currently available
multi-channel neuron DAQ systems require a tethered connection for the
surgically implanted analog head stage electronics. This wired connection limits
the subject's freedom and motion. If a low power, wireless connection were
possible, these limitations are eliminated. Furthermore, a wireless connection
broadens the use of DAQ systems to clinical possibilities with humans. The
critical design parameters for the wireless head stage transceiver circuits are
4 Million Bits per second (Mbs) data rate and 1mWatt power dissipation. The
first is needed to meet the 16-channel bandwidth requirement.The second is
required because of the miniature size and lightweight constraints of the
battery power source needed for a wireless connection. The specific objective of
the project is to design the most efficient wireless transmitter and receiver
for the neuron DAQ system. Two protocols, namely, minimum Frequency Shift Keying
(FSK) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) will be considered and evaluated. This
comparative evaluation, also involving Bluetooth radio chip sets, will be
conducted on the basis of efficiency, layout area, noise and process immunity.
Integrated CMOS filters, mixers and oscillators with off chip antennas will be
simulated, designed and extracted to meet the 4Mbs and 1mWatt benchmark.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of
neuroprosthetics to restore sensory and motor function in patients with neural
damage.
