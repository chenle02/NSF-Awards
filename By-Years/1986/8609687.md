A video image memory system, acquistion procesor and digitizer, and a cursor
generator will be acquired to complete a distributed, yet integrated, imaging
facilty for the Center for Fluorescence Research in Biomedical Sciences.
Interactive video image acquisition and analysis, and supermini computers for
data acquisition and reduction are also part of the imaging facility. Four
separate laboratories are networked to allow multiple user applications. A wide
variety of projects in cell biology, cell physiology, developmental biology,
regulatory biology, and biological chemistry will be supported by in the
instrumentation. Among the projects to be supported are analyses of the growth
factor stimulation of quiescent cells and macrophage chemotaxis. Ratio imaging
will be used as a spectroscopic method for determining the spatial and temporal
changes in (cellular) physiological parameters such as pH and pCa. Multiple
parameter analysis of two or more separable fluorescent probes will also be used
to correlate spatial and temporal dynamics of a variety of cellular funcitons.
Three dimensional reconstruction will be carried out on actin networks in living
cells. A method of two wavelength total internal reflection image analysis will
be used to quantitate the distance from the cell substrate to selected
molecules. Methods for mapping the spatial and temporal variations in
fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy of suitably labeled proteins
in living cells will be developed. The first target for mapping with be
calmodulin. Overall, the equipment, coupled with other resources in the Center,
will permit state-of-the-art measurements greatly extending our understanding of
cellular function.
