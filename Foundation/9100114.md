Lempp will pursue research in classical recursion theory. He plans to
concentrate on the question of which structures can be embedded into subclasses
of the Turing degrees (in particular the recursively enumerable degrees,
intervals thereof, and the degrees of differences of recursively enumerable
sets) in order to study the algebraic structure of these subclasses as well as
the decidability of fragments of their first-order theories. Furthermore, he
envisions a new framework for priority arguments similar to the forcing
framework in set theory. Finally, he plans to study splittings of recursively
enumerable sets. Recursion theory deals with the theoretical limits of
computability. It has had a profound effect on how mathematicians think about
the notion of proof as well as other concepts at the core of mathematics.
