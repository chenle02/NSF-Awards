This award will permit the principle investigators to establish, manage and
operate a new Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO).
Drilling and coring are essential for directly accessing the Earth?s subsurface.
Drilling generates samples where lack of exposure or alteration by weathering
limit scientific inquiry and understanding of the Earth system. It further
allows assessment of materials at depth through in-situ measurements and long-
term observation and monitoring of deep earth processes, providing a means for
validating observations made from the surface. Core samples drilled from
sedimentary archives generate a four-dimensional perspective on the earth-life
system. Current and future drilling targets enable research on an enormous
variety of topics, including paleoenvironment, biological evolution (including
hominid evolution and dispersal), deep-earth biosphere, fault mechanics and
seismicity, magmatism, meteor impacts, and groundwater
contamination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CSDCO will perform the following
critical functions for the scientific community: 1) engage with interested
researchers to develop projects, engineer optimal drilling solutions, solicit
bids and secure contracts for efficient drilling operations that meet project
goals; 2) support complex project-specific domestic and international logistical
requirements; 3) provide an experienced drilling-science interface and sample
and data management during drilling operations; 4) provide an open and well-
equipped laboratory with all appropriate infrastructure for rapid and thorough
initial processing of all types of core samples and management of derivative
data; 5) curate all types of cores and data/metadata in physical and virtual
repositories; 6) foster the development of an engaged, active, and
technologically advanced drilling community; and 7) broaden participation of
underrepresented groups.
