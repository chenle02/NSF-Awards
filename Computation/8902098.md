Professor Helton's project is research in mathematics that has applications to
problems in engineering. The mathematics involves matrix-valued functions on
planar regions such as the disc. Among these there is a particularly well-
behaved class of functions called analytic. Best-approximation of more or less
arbitrary functions by analytic ones, and finding analytic functions that take
on prescribed values at prescribed points in the region are problems that turn
out to be important in the design of feedback stabilized control systems. By
applying methods of functional analysis and operator theory, Helton seeks
efficient ways of solving problems like these. Helton's point of view is that
commutant lifting in operator theory is nearly equivalent to interpolation
theory for matrix- valued functions. He will seek to develop a nonlinear
commutant lifting theory, and to link it with the existing theory of nonlinear
control systems. He will investigate qualitative and numerical aspects of
optimization over spaces of analytic functions; computational experiment and
theoretical insight will support one another mutually in this part of the
project. A further aspect of the work involves matrix completion, filling in the
entries of a partially specified matrix so as to make the result have a
particular property such as positivity. Throughout, Helton will keep in view
applications to optimal control and worst case design in the frequency domain.
