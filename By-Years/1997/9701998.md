9701998 Barabasi This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member and, as such,
involves both research and education. The research component is comprised of a
study of the connection between theory and experiment which aims for a coherent
understanding of the basic mechanisms and universality classes determining the
morphology of interfaces moving in porous media. The influence of disorder and
fluctuations on surface morphology will be investigated. The research has
implications for oil recovery and environmental research. The educational part
of the award involves utilizing the world wide web for improving graduate
courses. A comprehensive database will be developed of instructional materials
available on the web. Effective incorporation of this material into the
curriculum will result in a virtual meta-course. %%% This is a CAREER award to a
