The electronic structure and properties of metallic alloys are explored using a
combination of experimental probes and sophisticated theoretical and
calculational schemes in order to gain new insights into the electronic origin
of complex properties of metallic alloys. Problems to be addressed include
order-disorder transitions, the effects of constitutional vacancies anti-site
defects, size effects, core level shifts and charge redistribution on alloying,
and thermally induced magnetic transitions. Several alloys will be examined
including Cu-Au, Cu-Pd, Ni-Al, Fe-Rh and Fe-Ni. Principal experimental
techniques to be used are ultra-violet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies
using facilities on-site and at laboratories with synchrotron radiation sources
(e.g., at the NSLS and CAMD). The extensive theoretical and computational
program involves national and international collaboration. A number of the
properties of the alloys selected for study are controlled by the topology of
the Fermi surface and so the proposed program includes the visualization and
animation of these su rfaces using computer graphics. %%% In addition to the
fascinating intellectual challenges that the research promises, the results have
important implications for the design of alloys for specific applications.
