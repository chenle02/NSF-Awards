This RPG in the Organic Synthesis Program to Professor Mader of Grinnell College
will be used to elaborate the synthetic potential of alpha silylketone enolates.
Model systems for the preparations of diols, aminoalcohols, alcohols and amines
will be the initial targets. Subsequent studies will attempt to incorporate
chiral auxiliaries thereby generating the chiral analogues to the above types of
substrates. The ability to synthesize organic compounds using selective reagents
is a very significant methodology. In this proposal not only is the PI planning
to make compounds more efficiently, but also to prepare them as their optical
analogues. This is very significant regarding drug manufacturing and other
industrial processes.
