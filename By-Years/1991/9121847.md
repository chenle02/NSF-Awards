Dr. Kulsrud, at Princeton University, will investigate the origin and evolution
of the magnetic field in our Galaxy. The study has four parts: (1) To consider
the dynamo origin theory and the primordial theories on the assumption that the
Interstellar Medium (ISM) is homogeneous; (2) To consider the same two theories
on the basis of an inhomogeneous model of the ISM taking into account the
cloud/intercloud medium; (3) To consider the possibility that the primordial
field could arise from flux in jets from more active galaxies or quasars that
preceded the formation of our Galaxy; and (4) To make use of critical
observations such as cosmic ray lifetimes, the initial mass function at
different times and places, and the rotation measurements of quasars, to limit
the possible theories for magnetic field origin and evolution.
