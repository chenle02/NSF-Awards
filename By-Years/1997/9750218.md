Abstract DBI 9750218 Anne M. Bronikowski This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral
Research Fellowship in Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1997. This
fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain additional scientific
training beyond the doctoral degree and to pursue innovative and imaginative
into the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between organisms
and their environment at the molecular, cellular, organismal, population,
community and/or ecosystem level in any area of biology supported by the
Directorate for Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation. Each
fellowship supports a research and training plan to be carried out in a
sponsoring laboratory. The research and training plan for this fellowship is
entitled "Evolution of temperature adaptation by natural bacterial populations
in a reptile host." Repeated thermal niche evolution in the gut bacteria
Salmonella is being tested within a reptile host, the slider turtle, that
exhibits variable body temperatures across seasons and spatial scales. It is to
be determined if Salmonella are thermal generalists or specialists. The studies
will focus on the mechanisms of thermal specialization and how ambient
temperatures affect bacterial fitness within the host.
