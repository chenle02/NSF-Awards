The objectives of this research is to study superplastic flow in fine grained
metallic alloys. In particular, the effects of impurity atom segregation at the
grain boundaries on creep and cavitation in Zn-22%Al and Pb-62%Sn will be
investigated. Special attention will be given to delineating the mechanisms
responsible for the observed creep stress threshold, and to determining the
relationship between deformation and cavity growth in fine grain alloys. It is
anticipated that the results of this research program will enhance the
understanding of the role of impurity atoms in the deformation, formability, and
fracture of superplastic alloys.
