This Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) explores approaches
for computational analysis of narrative. Despite the ubiquitous nature of
narrative, computational linguists have shied away from research on narrative
since the 1970's, viewing analysis of stories and literature as too difficult.
The goal of this EAGER project is to show that analysis of narrative is now
possible and that its study can also be relevant to the development of
practical, web-based systems. The project features the development of a
declarative, symbolic representation of narrative, a method for manually
analyzing the content units of narrative using this representation, and a
computational approach for automatically processing a corpus of narratives to
derive structural and content-oriented patterns. For example, a learning model
may be developed to identify and describe dilemmas that a character faces or to
identify thematic similarity between stories. In the first 12 months of the
project, researchers are focusing on the development of the annotation
methodology, a collection project for annotations of short fables and parables,
and the development of learning algorithms. In the following six months, the
researchers plan to apply the work to a larger domain in order to show larger
impact -- namely, the processing of news text for tasks such as summarization.
The project features a collaboration between computer scientists and an expert
in literary theory in order to incorporate modes of analysis that are well-
grounded from the perspective of narratology. The researchers will provide a
range of resources for further work in the narratology and computational
linguistics communities, including the annotated corpus and annotation
methodology (called DramaBank) as well as software for annotation and automatic
analysis; these will enable both communities to continue a new line of research
on literature and other forms of narrative occurring on the web.
