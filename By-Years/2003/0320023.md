This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel, solid state, avalanche photodiode operated in Geiger mode as single
photon sensitive avalanche detector (SPAD). Phase I will experimentally confirm
the theory and quantitatively prove the suitability of a device structure and
materials choice. Phase II will optimize and implement a high performance SPAD.
The novel SPAD will have better single photon sensitivity, quantum efficiency,
and response speed than the best vacuum photomultiplier tube (PMT) or silicon
SPAD. The photodetector will be fabricated using novel large band gap compound
semiconductor materials, which exhibit exceptionally low dark count rates and
high materials quality. The novel materials promise a thermal generation rate 50
million times lower than that of the silicon commonly used for SPADs, and has
higher carrier velocities and a direct band gap. Together, these promise quantum
efficiencies above 50 percent, sub-nsec rise times, nsec reset times, and psec
jitter. The project will obsolesce the PMT and silicon SPAD for photon-starved
applications using them in biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, and remote
sensing. The project helps both research and
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to detect single photons with
high detection efficiency, low dark count rate, high sensitivity, high timing
resolution, and high duty cycle is a key requirement for many scientific
instruments and sensing/detecting applications. The development of a robust,
solid state, single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) will transform such
components from expensive laboratory curiosities requiring liquid nitrogen or
high voltage glass tubes into commonplace parts. New applications with small
markets today, such as single photon quantum communications and lab-on-a-chip,
could also benefit greatly.
