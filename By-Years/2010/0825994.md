The research objective of this award is to developrobust numerical methods in
coordination with experiments to predict the mechanical response of molecular
crystal particles at the micron and submicron scales.In pharmaceutical and food
industries,this type ofmaterialis subjected to mechanical milling during
manufacturing to reduce particle size. During this processmechanical stresses
produce structural changes in the crystal latticethatoften affect key properties
of drug products, such as stability and dissolution rates.The theory and
experiments proposed in this project will provide information about the
interaction of crystalline defects with surfaces due to the high surface to
volume ratio in microscopic particles and will be a step toward the integration
of microscopic mechanisms in the numerical modeling of crystalline materials in
general.The proposed research involves the following tasks, (1) Experimental
approach to detect disorder in milled materials using physical and chemical
analytical characterization techniques including spectroscopy, thermal, and
surface methods to better understand and control defects and interactions (2)
Mechanical testing (3) Numerical simulations of deformation of particles under
mechanical loading. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make important
contributions towardsthe understanding of the evolution of molecular crystals
during food and drug processing. If successful, the proposed numerical and
experimental effort will have an impact in the development of materials less
sensitive to detrimental changes during milling processingas well as in the
optimization of operational formulations and quality control in food and
pharmaceutical industries.The results of this work will be integrated into the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum in Engineering and Pharmaceutical Sciences
at Purdue and therefore, will influence the formation of new generations of
engineers and pharmaceutical scientistswith a multidisciplinary formation and
with the ability to successfully work in collaborative programs.&lt;br/&gt;
