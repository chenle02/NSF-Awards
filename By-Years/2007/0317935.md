Eukaryotic chromosomes are comprised of equal portions of the genetic material,
DNA, and nuclear proteins to form a complicated arrangement known as chromatin.
Chromatin serves to package the long DNA molecule in an orderly manner within
the small confines of the cell's nucleus. This packaging also affects critical
nuclear processes such as gene expression, duplication of the DNA, and DNA
repair. Therefore, understanding how chromatin is assembled, regulated and
copied is critical for defining the basis of a vast array of biological
processes. This research is designed to take advantage of techniques involving
chemical modification of chromatin proteins developed in this laboratory and the
unique properties of a slime mold known as Physarum. This organism has the
unusual ability to grow as a single giant cell, several centimeters across in a
petri dish. More importantly, this slime mold readily absorbs foreign proteins
whole into the cell from its upper surface. The PI has demonstrated that
chromatin proteins can be easily introduced into Physarum and has used this
property to study how these proteins are copied and chromatin re-assembled
during cell division. In this project, he will extend these studies to determine
how chromatin is reassembled after DNA repair and during gene expression and to
get some clues as to what enzymes or co-factors are required for chromatin
assembly in general. The results of this research will advance our understanding
how chromatin is assembled and maintained during cell division and other
critical periods in the cell division cycle.
