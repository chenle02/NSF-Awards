This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Summer School on Fractal Geometry and Complex Dimensions" that will be held
June 14-22, 2016, on the campus of the California Polytechnic State University-
San Luis Obispo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will offer three mini-
courses aimed at introducing nonexperts to the frontiers of a range of topics,
including the following: fractal geometry, dimension theory, complex dimensions,
distance and tube zeta functions, and analysis on fractals topics. The
organizers will lead a day of primer lectures and workshops (at an undergraduate
level) preparing nonspecialist participants for the plenary lectures and
aforementioned mini-courses. The selected topics include geometry of fractal
subsets of the real line and of higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, complex
dimensions and zeta functions, analytic number theory, and analysis on fractals
with connections to geometric measure theory, quasicrystals and noncommutative
geometry, stochastic processes, and thermodynamic formalism. The event allows
for plenary lectures (90 minutes) from well-known experts, short research
communications, poster sessions, and discussion sessions. The summer school will
place special emphasis on preparing undergraduate students for further research
in mathematics (independently or at later activities, like REUs).
