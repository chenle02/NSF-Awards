This study is to advance the understanding of engineering parameters of
polymeric materials formulated on the basis of lignin and lignin derivatives.
This proposal investigates the structive-property relationships of lignin-
derived structural materials. Three specific engineering parameters will be
investigated in this study; (1) an assessment of the effect of molecular weight
and molecular weight distributions; (2) an exploration of several optional
toughening mechanisms; and (3) an investigation of alternative network synthesis
techniques involving crosslinking agents other than diisocyanates.
