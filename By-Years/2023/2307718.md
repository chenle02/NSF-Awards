This project will enhance the foundational understanding of Dynamical Systems
through the development of theories, models, and techniques that could
potentially address a range of contemporary scientific and technological issues,
such as production of sustainable energy and space exploration. The main
objective of this research is to devise mechanisms to gain energy in mechanical
systems subject to dissipation and forcing. The project will study mathematical
models for energy harvesting devices, which convert external vibrations into
electrical energy, and will optimize their energy output. It will also
investigate the dynamics of comets, asteroids, and spacecraft, with applications
to the design of fuel-efficient space missions. Partial support will be provided
to graduate and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented
groups.

The project will open new research directions in the study of Hamiltonian
systems subject to general perturbations. It will advance the understanding of
the Arnold diffusion phenomenon, describing that integrable Hamiltonian systems
subject to small, generic, Hamiltonian perturbations, exhibit orbits along which
the energy changes by a significant amount. The project will investigate this
phenomenon in concrete systems, such as from celestial mechanics. It will also
explore the case of perturbations given by conformally symplectic vector fields,
which model the effect of dissipation. Additionally, the project will develop
novel methods to use natural perturbations of a system as controllers, in order
to drive the system from some given state to any desired state.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
