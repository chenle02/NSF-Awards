Recent concern over rising quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and
the accompanying "greenhouse effect" has prompted calls for caps on, or even
reductions in, the overall output of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels burned to
produce energy for the world economy. This project will investigate the effects
of modeling investment uncertainty in a global energy-economic interaction with
varying limits on carbon emissions in different regions of the world. The
project will develop a model that assumes long run economic growth maximizing
decisions are taken. The consistency of this objective with current economic
decisions will have implications for policies aimed at encouraging new
technology investment, exploration for undiscovered resources, and energy saving
substitutions. The overall goal will be to determine the effect that investment
with uncertain outcomes might play in limiting expected economic costs of carbon
emission policies. The model will be built as an extension of Manne and Richels'
Global 2100 model that has already considered economic effects of carbon limits
without explicit random investment effects. These effects will be incorporated
in the proposed model that will take the form of a stochastic nonlinear program.
The solution methodology will be a distributed decomposition scheme that runs on
a network of powerful computer workstations. New bounding techniques for
expectations with limited information will be developed to bound the value of
information and the value of solving the complex stochastic model.
