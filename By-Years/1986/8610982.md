The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of the duration and
frequency content of earthquake motions on the inelastic response of structures
and the importance of gravity loads (P- effects) and foundation flexibility
(soil structure interaction). Studies will be conducted on single-degree-of-
freedom systems with different force deformation relationships and multidegree
of freedom models representative of typical building structures.
