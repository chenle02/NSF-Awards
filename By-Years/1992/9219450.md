9219450 Diels Our preliminary measurements have shown that the two
counterpropgating beams of a ring laser are not coupled in frequency. The
implication is that the fs (femtosecond) ring laser is an exceptionally
sensitive detector for minute (less than 10-12 m) optical path difference
between the counterpropagating beams. Such path difference can be induced by
rotation rate), by electro-optic effect (a phase shift of the order of 10-6 can
be detected with fs temporal resolution), by motion (Fresnel drag measurements),
by magnetic fields (Faraday effect). We propose to explopit these unique
properties for various applications, such as detection of small motion, study of
the dynamics of ultrafast detectors and circuits, and coherent interactions with
3 level (A of V configuration) systems. We will also apply our understanding of
the absence of coupling between counterpropagating modes in the fs dye laser, to
develop mode-locked semiconductor ring laser with similar properties. *** j e j
