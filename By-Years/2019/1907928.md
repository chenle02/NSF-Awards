This research is devoted to understanding the effects of random perturbations on
behavior of complex systems. Stochasticity abounds in physics, applied science
and engineering, ranging from statistical mechanics, atmospheric science,
materials engineering, oceanography and so on. There are typically various
temporal or spatial scales involved in the system, and to understand the
propagation of stochasticity through these scales and to control its overall
impact is of crucial importance for many applications such as exploration
geophysics, materials design, meteorology and weather forecasting. The main
mathematical tool to model such multi-scale dynamical systems involving
stochasticity is through partial differential equations (PDE) with rough random
coefficients. The project aims at deriving simplified effective models of those
PDE with rough random coefficients and exhibiting some general features of the
mechanism of stochasticity propagation through complicated systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is in the areas of stochastic
homogenization, wave in random media, and stochastic PDE. The principle
investigator plans to study (i) the random fluctuations in stochastic
homogenization; (ii) the effective models of wave propagation in random media;
(iii) the convergence to stochastic PDE beyond the homogenization regime and the
statistical properties of some singular stochastic PDE. The study will involve
tools from analysis, probability and numerical methods. The educational program
includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection
of probability, analysis, and applications, and the goal is to introduce
students the analytic and probabilistic tools which are indispensable for both
the research and the STEM-related career development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
