This project studies women having at-home and jobs in traditional work places.
Comparisons will be drawn between women occupying the two types, in terms of
their attitudes, incomes, division of family and work responsibilities, and
movement between the types of jobs. The investigators will extend and test a
theoretical model which leads them to predict that at-home women will hold more
traditional gender role attitudes, receive lower wages and fewer benefits,
receive less job training and slower promotion rates, and spend greater time in
child care and other household responsibilities. Model testing uses data from
the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature women, the first nat-
ional data set providing information about at-home work.
