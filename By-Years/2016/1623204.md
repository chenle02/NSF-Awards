This award supports a two-day workshop for NSF-Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) Physics Site directors both to discuss effective practices
in the current REU programs as well as to learn more about effective practices
in programs outside of the NSF-REU Physics Sites. In particular, the
participants will learn about current results in assessment of undergraduate
research experiences and programs that have increased the diversity in
undergraduate research programs from other disciplines and discuss how to
adapt/adopt these ideas for Physics REU sites. Participants will discuss the
current challenges and opportunities they face in their individual programs as
well as challenges faced by the Physics REU-Site program as a whole and devise a
plan for addressing these issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program serves the
national interests by not only promoting the advancement of science carried out
at the REU Sites by research mentors and their undergraduate proteges, but by
training the next generation of science researchers. In addition, the report
developed as a part of this project will be a resource that all Physics
undergraduate research programs (not just NSF REU sites) can utilize to improve
their undergraduate research programs.
