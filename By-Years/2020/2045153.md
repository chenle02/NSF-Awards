The primary research goal of this project is to leverage recommendation
technology to support users in developing, exploring, and understanding their
preferences based on their long-term goals and ambitions. Recommender systems
provide their users with recommendations based on their expressed preferences,
but decision scientists have demonstrated that users' preferences are often
constructed on the fly and thereby focused on their immediate desires rather
than their longer-term goals. The recommendations, in turn, tend to reflect
these short-term likes, ignoring users' ambitions and long-term goals. This
proposal will take an important step towards escaping this vicious circle by
developing and testing two novel user-adaptive interaction mechanisms that
leverage recommendation algorithms to support unique new ways for users to
develop, discover, and understand their own preferences. This will turn the
users of these systems into confident consumers who are able to construct
preferences that focus on their broader long-term objectives. The decision-
support platform and the proposed interaction mechanisms will be made available
to academics to support their research on recommender systems and decision-
making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two innovative interaction mechanisms can advance
the field of recommender systems research as well as the field of decision
science by extending the reach of personalized decision-support tools beyond
"choice" towards preference construction: (1) Personalized preference profiles
that use recommendation algorithms to visualize users' preferences and highlight
surprising preference dynamics. These profiles will induce preference
construction by helping users understand their preferences, reflect upon their
long-term goals, and make better-informed decisions. (2) Preference-based
communities that use recommendation algorithms to automatically create ad-hoc
groups of users whose interests overlap enough to generate interesting
discussion, yet not so much that they turn into epistemic bubbles. These
communities seek to induce preference construction through discussion, thereby
reinstating the social and intellectual benefits of active advice-giving
practices. This project will integrate these interaction mechanisms into live
systems, supporting education and outreach activities where students of all ages
will use these systems to make decisions based on their preferences and life
goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
