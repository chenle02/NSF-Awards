The purpose of this project is to develop models and a modeling framework to
characterize the environmental performance of manufacturing processes. The
project will address eight different processes: milling, grinding, electrical
discharge machining, abrasive water jet machining, sand casting, die casting,
injection molding, and advanced composites autoclave processing. And, in seven
different impact categories: energy, wastes, recycling, hazardous materials, use
and contamination of water, emissions to air, and emissions to land, by
collecting data and inventories for each case. The centerpiece of this project
will be the development of "burdened" equipment level models, and life cycle
materials flow models for three key environmental indicators: energy, waste and
entropy, and toxic and hazardous materials. With the appropriate data, these
models will be able to compare the environmental performance of alternative
processes; alternative process plans, and propose new process developments. This
information is needed to more clearly focus attention on manufacturing process
development needs for a sustainable future. Furthermore, these models will be
adapted for use in product design to aid design for the environment.

The central theme of this work is to develop an alternative view of
manufacturing processes. In addition to being hugely important as value adding,
some processes could also be seen as the opposite: as potentially threatening
the environment by excessive energy and materials usage, and by mixing and
diluting materials such that they cannot be recaptured. This alternative view is
necessary to properly evaluate the "sustainability" of existing and future
processes. In addition, this work proposes the development of a new process
metric - the entropy change -- to assess the potential for recapturing and
recycling the materials used. The methodology builds on Shannon's information
theory, with several new results derived from a configurationally entropy
approach. The work plan involves eight undergraduate theses, under the
supervision of a senior graduate student and faculty advisor, and with the
collaboration of three additional faculty members with particular expertise in
machining processes, casting processes, and toxicity and hazardous materials.
The results will be made widely available to the public via a web page and
journal articles.
