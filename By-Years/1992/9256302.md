The principal objective of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research
Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of talented U.S. undergraduates
enrolling in doctoral programs in critical and emerging areas of science and
engineering. Proposals were solicited from institutions whose existing
facilities and staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.
programs of high quality. The program is also intended to contribute to
strengthening the Nation's human resource base across all geographic sectors and
among all under-represented groups. Graduate Research Traineeship awards are
packages of student support. The colleges and universities that receive the
awards are responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees, and
administration of traineeships. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will support
Ph.D. students in applied mathematics; the program addresses the following
concerns: (a) the academic need for applied mathematicians to provide academic
training of students, (b) the industrial need for applied mathematicians to
maintain U.S. industrial competitiveness, and (c) the need to increase the
number of women and minority Ph.D. applied mathematicians. Students in the
program will learn mathematical modeling, numerical computing, an outside (other
than mathematical) area, as well as a substantial background in the more
traditional areas of mathematics. The program includes student participation in
workshops and panels on mathematical problems in industry where students can
work with student-faculty teams to solve industrial problems. Current areas of
departmental research include physical mathematics and modeling, nonlinear
analysis, scientific computation, mathematical programming and operations
research, and applied geometry.
