Most plant viruses replicate in directly inoculated cells from a wide range of
plants, but show exquisite host specificity with respect to initiating cell-to-
cell and/or sustaining subsequent systemic spread through the plant. As a
foundation for molecular study of the individual and collective role of plant
virus genes in movement, systemic infection, and host specificity, the
investigators have produced and characterized complete, infectious cDNA clones
of several distinct bromoviruses of varying divergence in host range and genome
sequence, and demonstrated that designed exchange of selected genes and gene
segments between such viruses provides a powerful approach for identifying host
specificity determinants and characterizing their behavior. Building on these
tools and the strong general characterization of bromovirus molecular biology,
they will now: follow infection movement at the cellular level to define the
distinct stages at which systemic infection is blocked upon alteration of
different virus genes; map host specificity effects to specific functional
domains of several implicated virus genes and test a potentially powerful new
approach to RNA virus genetic mapping based on natural RNA recombination; test
preliminary indications that, contrary to the "gating " hypothesis, successful
systemic infection requires mutual adaptation between the 3a movement gene and
the 1a and 2a replication genes; determine whether the apparently post-
replication influence of the 1a and 2a genes on systemic infection is truly
independent of their known functions in RNA replication; and localize observed
host specificity determinants in noncoding sequences surrounding the 3a gene and
determine their possible influence on 3a gene expression. The results should
provide clarifying concepts regarding the plant's response to the infective
viruses.
