Lay abstract

Memory is generally believed to involve alterations in the ease with which
neurons communicate with one another across synapses. These alterations in turn
are made possible by the production of proteins under the guidance of genes. A
major impediment to the identification of the relevant genes is the lack of
information about which neurons and synapses are involved. In the case of memory
formed by fear conditioning, the crucial synapses are believed to be in the
lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Armed with this information, it should be
possible to use the recently developed microarray technique to screen genes that
are activated during memory formation. This approach, when combined with another
recently developed tool, laser captured microdissection, should provide a
powerful means for probing gene expression in specific cells in the amygdala
that change during memory formation. The findings may also be relevant to other
forms of memory subserved by other brain regions since existing data indicate
that common molecular pathways are involved in different forms of learning and
memory.
