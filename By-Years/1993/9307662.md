9307662 Mayer Fundamental materials science investigations of ion- and thermal-
induced transformations/reactions in III-V semiconductors and copper-silicon
systems will be conducted. It is proposed to investigate the reactions of
alloying elements in Cu and oxide formation in Cu3Si/Si. The study of alloying
elements in Cu will be an important factor in the use of Cu for integrated
circuit metallization for adhesion and formation of diffusion barriers. The
controlled formation of oxide layers at low process temperatures may offer a
method to form this oxide on silicon. Since electrical activation of Si-
implanted GaAs is a sensitive function of implantation dose-rate and substrate
temperature it is planned to investigate ion induced defect interaction by the
combined use of electron microscopy, electrical analysis and ion channeling. %%%
An understanding of dopant activation in ion-implanted GaAs is important to
integrated circuit applications. Research will be conducted on fundamental ion-
solid interactions as well as factors that influence the electronic and optical
properties of semiconductor material combinations with potential advantages in
electronics and photonics applications. The semiconductor material combinations
under study have wide applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices;
thus the research results are expected to provide the basis for continued
improvements in the performance of advanced devices and integrated circuits of
the type used in computing, information processing, and telecommunications. ***
