Dr. Aaron Parsons is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the University of
California-Berkeley (UCB). The research centers on the design and implementation
of the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), a low-
frequency interferometer that aims to detect the power spectrum of fluctuations
in the brightness temperature of redshifted 21-cm emission in the 120-200 MHz
band, corresponding to redshifts 11 > z > 6. Dr. Parsons will: (1) develop PAPER
instrumentation, including correlator research within UCB's Center for Astronomy
Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER), enabling PAPER's expansion
to 32-, 64-, and 128-antenna deployments over the next three years; (2) improve
calibration and imaging of PAPER data as part of an open-source software toolkit
for high dynamic-range imaging with low-frequency interferometers; and (3)
characterize interfering astrophysical foregrounds, optimizing antenna
configuration within the array for detecting the Epoch of Reionization signal
relative to these foregrounds, and setting increasingly sensitive bounds on the
21-cm fluctuations from cosmic reionization.

Dr. Parsons will also develop a cross-disciplinary undergraduate lab class
focusing on the principles of radios, signal processing and wireless
communications, and a public outreach exhibit using a broadband spectrometer to
monitor radio interference as part of an effort to raise awareness of "dark sky"
issues in radio astronomy.
