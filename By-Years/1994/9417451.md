9417451 Yakovenko The research involves the theory of quasi-one-dimensional
organic conductors with the emphasis on their behavior in strong magnetic
fields. These artificially synthesized conductors demonstrate metallic,
insulating, superconducting, charge- and spin-density wave, and Hubbard
paramagnetic insulator states. Their rich physical behavior, especially in
magnetic fields, and its relation to high temperature superconductors and the
quantum Hall effect makes these materials very desirable objects of study.
Proposed research includes the quantum Hall effect of a moving density wave,
"hot spots" on the Fermi surface, the fraction quantum Hall effect, localization
and the Hall effect in high magnetic fields, the structure of the spin density
wave order parameter, and the effects of superstructure produced by the
orientational ordering of anions. Close connection with experimental studies is
anticipated. %%% This work involves theoretically studying special large
molecules that are stacked over each other and form parallel chains which are
good conductors of electricity. These materials have a wide variety of
interesting properties, including superconductivity, and are therefore known as
exotic materials. Developing a theory of these materials has particular
advantages because of their chain-like character. The investigator is an expert
in these materials and is highly regarded in the community. He especially wants
to focus on the properties of these materials in a magnetic field and to connect
with experimental studies. Materials such as these often demonstrate completely
unexpected properties, so their study has the possibility of resulting in
applications which cannot currently be predicted. ***
