The main objective of this research is to explore the development of an
intelligent memory that can be trained to remember the previous control commands
for various trajectories of a robot manipulator. In contrast to the conventional
analytical approach, this technique will provide a real-time, learning, and
adaptive control which does not require any accurate models of the system. In
initial work, a simple three-degree-of-freedom manipulator resembling the
Stanford arm was used as a model to generate a thousand quantified trajectory
points for a training set, and a simple averaging interpolation formula was used
to estimate joint commands for other trajectories. A hierarchical (tree)
structure was explored for storing the configuration space joint data for the
training set.
