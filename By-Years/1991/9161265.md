Spire recently demonstrated bright visible light emission from Silicon quantum
wires. Silicon substrates were electrochemically etched to produce a porous
surface with nanometer size Si columns (quantum wires). When excited with a blue
laser beam, or UV light (photoluminescence), or when immersed in an H2O:NaC1
electrolyte under an electric field, the treated samples emitted very bright red
light. Moreover, we demonstrated that it is possible to tailor the emission
spectrum by anodizing Si-based alloys such as Si1-xGex or ion implanted Si
(e.g., Er+-implanted Si). If strong electroluminescence (EL) can be demonstrated
in this material then the driver electronics and light- emitting elements of a
flat panel display can be integrated into the same Si substrate. This
development would result in significant reduction of display panel fabrication
steps and cost. We believe that these recent findings, combined with mature Si
electronics technology, offer a rare opportunity for a major advance in
commercial flat-panel display technology. We propose a program to investigate
fabrication of monochrome or multi- color Si flat-panel displays. In Phase I, we
will optimize processing of Si quantum wires and study electroluminescent
behavior. Individual test structures will be fabricated and EL performance
demonstrated. In Phase II, we will fabricate multi-pixel monochrome Si EL
displays and explore fabrication of multi-color Si EL displays.
