Establish a model program for institutions of higher education that guides a
cohort of 36 female and ethnic minority students through the mathematics
department's calculus sequence. Pathways through Calculus provides the students
the scholastic and emotional support during the summer and during the academic
year to successfully complete this demanding sequence. Students receive
counseling as well as intensive problem solving workshops to help them grasp the
"mathematical method" needed to understand the calculus.
