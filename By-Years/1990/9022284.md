The P.I.'s propose to study spatial and temporal variations in the
distributions and particulate fluxes of a suite of naturally occurring
radioactive nuclides as part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) in the
equatorial Pacific. The radionuclides to be measured serve as ocean tracers that
yield fundamental information about the rates of biogeochemical processes that
govern the production and fate of biogenic particles in the oceanic water
column. The study is designed to test the hypothesis that the uptake and release
of soluble chemical species by particulate matter, and the formation and
destruction of particle aggregates in the oceanic water column occur at rates
that vary both spatially and temporally in response to variations in the rate of
plankton production at the sea surface and the flux of organic matter leaving
the surface layer. The data will be interpreted within the context of biological
rate measurements and other data to be collected within JGOFS and will be used
to test biogeochemical models.
