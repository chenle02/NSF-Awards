With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Loeser will develop a promising new, alternative method for
predicting the electronic structures and associated properties of large chemical
systems. The research will involve the further development and applications of
the dimensional continuation method. The applications fall into two areas.
First, recent work on the correlation energies of many electron atoms will be
extended. Second, work on electron correlation in metallic hydrogen will be used
to estimate the effects of correlation of the recently observed metallic
transition and on structural phase transitions within the metal. Some aspects of
the dynamics of electron correlation in this prototypical solid will also be
examined. The longer-range goal of the research is to develop a general
treatment of electron correlation in crystalline solids.
