The proposed research is aimed at developing a theory for predicting the dynamic
behavior of countercurrent mass-transfer columns. All previous models are aimed
at predicting the steady-state behavior. The theoretical development will begin
with a single component and with finite mass transfer rates to be followed by
multicomponent mixtures. Experiments will be conducted on countercurrent packed-
column extraction, with concentration disturbances. The effects of reflux on the
column dynamics and on the stability will then be analyzed. The dynamic analysis
results will be useful in process design and in the control of a host of
countercurrent mass-transfer operations, such as distillation, adsorption,
absorption, and extraction.
