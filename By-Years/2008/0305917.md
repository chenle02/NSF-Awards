ABSTRACT

Information Technology Workforce (ITWF) - FY03

Proposal ID: EIA-0305917 Investigator: Laurie Williams, Winser Alexander, Sarah
Berenson, and Mladen Vouk. Institution: North Carolina State University Title:
Collaboration through Agile Software Development Practices: A Means for
Improvement in Quality and Retention of IT Workers

North Carolina State University at Raleigh (NCSU), North Carolina A&T University
and Meredith College have been awarded an ITWF grant for a 3-year study of the
collaborative aspects of agile software development methodologies. The project's
objective is to perform extensive, longitudinal experimentation in advanced
undergraduate software engineering college classes at the three institutions to
examine student success and retention in the educational and training pipelines
when the classes utilize an agile software development model. The project will
also involve the development of agile software development materials for
software engineering classes.
