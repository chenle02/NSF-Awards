9628280 Miller The tectonic setting of the Cascades Core remains controversial,
particularly the manner in which the high grade rocks were loaded during te
development of the Cretaceous arc and the associated magmatic events. Several
models of magmatic processes in the deep crust of continental arcs have been
advanced, but the lack of deep crustal exposures have provided only limited
constraints for the applicability of these models. This project will focus on
the structural, metamorphic, plutonic and geochemical processes operating in the
Ten Peak pluton, which is the deepest exposed pluton of significant size in the
Cascades Core. Results are expected to clarify the role of mafic magmas in
generating the pluton, to provide insights into deep crustal emplacement
mechanisms and to allow a better understanding of the evolution and loading
history of the Cascade arc.
