This award supports US participants in the international conference "Practical
and Structural Model Theory" taking place at the University of Passau, Germany,
July 27-31, 2020. Model theory is the study of classes of mathematical
structures in the context of mathematical logic. This conference centers on the
topic of o-minimal structures in model theory. The meeting will be an
opportunity for young researchers to learn about and participate in some of most
exciting developments in model theory.

The conference is on the topic of o-minimality, the development of complex
analytic geometry in an o-minimal framework, and an o-minimal version of Chow's
theorem, which is an important current tool and arithmetic and algebraic
geometry and, more recently, combinatorics. The conference features
presentations from more than two dozen leading researchers. This award
facilitates the participation of US-based researchers and graduate students in
the meeting. The website of the conference is https://www.fim.uni-

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
