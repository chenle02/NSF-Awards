Number theory studies integers, prime numbers, and solutions of an equation in
integers or rational numbers. In the digital age, number theory has been
essential in algorithms, cryptography, and data security. Modern mathematics has
seen increasingly more interactions between number theory and other areas from a
unifying perspective. A primary example is the Langlands program, comprising a
vast web of conjectures and open-ended questions. Even partial progress has led
to striking consequences such as verification of Fermat's Last Theorem and
resolution of the Sato-Tate conjecture, the Serre conjecture, and more. This
project aims to broaden understanding of the Langlands program and related
questions.

The research focuses on the following topics: (1) new instances of the global
Langlands correspondence for the groups GSp(2n), GSO(2n), and SO(2n); (2) a full
stable trace formula for Igusa varieties and applications; (3) local harmonic
analysis questions on supercuspidal representations such as invariant
dimensions; and (4) a completion of the endoscopic classification for non-quasi-
split unitary groups. The results of this research will stimulate further
progress and inspire new investigations. Graduate students will be supported to
take part in these projects.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
