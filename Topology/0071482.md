DMS-0071482 Randy McCarthy (PI) Matthew Ando (co-PI)

A fundamental idea in algebraic topology is to study topological spaces by
attaching to them algebraic structures which are invariant under deformations. A
good structure will often produce profound relationships with other areas of
mathematics. Ando and McCarthy propose to investigate problems involving three
such structures, elliptic cohomology, algebraic K-theory, and the calculus of
functors.

Ando proposes several projects involving elliptic cohomology, which provides a
relationship between topology, algebraic geometry, and string theory. For
example, he proposes a new approach to the rigidity theorems for elliptic
genera, based on the algebraic theory of theta functions. McCarthy plans to
further pursue his already successful program of using the calculus of functors
to better understand algebraic K-theory. For example, he hopes that ideas from
the calculus of functors will clarify Neeman's K-theory of triangluated
categories. Ando and McCarthy also plan a joint project to investigate the role
of the calculus of functors in the new homotopy theory of schemes of Voevodsky
and others.
