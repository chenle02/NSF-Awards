Valparaiso University will host an REU program for 9 students in mathematics.
Students will be recruited nationwide. Minority students, students early in
their mathematical career and students from institutions with no Ph.D. program
will be given priority. The program will last 9 weeks and will provide the
participants with housing, $3,000 stipend and travel
reimbursement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students will work on research projects
in three small groups with a faculty mentor. The projects will be chosen from
topics in combinatorics, graph theory, analysis and topology. A graduate student
will serve as a consultant/mentor throughout the program. In addition to
conducting original research, the participants will have the opportunity to
visit graduate programs, listen to guest lectures and improve their oral and
written communication skills. Each research group will present their progress
weekly to all the participants, and each research project will close with a
written report. The participants will be encouraged to present their finding at
regional and national conferences. Participants will also be encouraged to
pursue the publication of their results.&lt;br/&gt;
