9453959 Bower To enable elementary school teachers to teach and assess hands-on,
inquiry-based science instruction effectively, this project will create and
pilot-test 4 Modules designed to improve and broaden teacher science content
knowledge. The proposed modules, to be developed and piloted by teams of
teachers from Pasadena, California and scientists from Caltech, will be field
tested by school system partnerships in Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio,
Highline, Washington, and Huntsville, Alabama. The modules will have several
distinct characteristics. First, each will be based on a science content common
to most kit-based curricula. Second, each module will be developed by a
collaboration of experienced teachers and scientists. Third, the modules will be
designed to be used by teacher-scientist teams leading groups of other teachers
in an inquiry-based learning community like that of an exemplary classroom.
Materials will initially be published with desktop publishing and then
disseminated via existing national networks of school systems engaged in
supporting inquiry science instruction at the elementary school level. The cost
sharing will be 10% of the NSF funds. ***
