How do Americans' attitudes toward social groups affect their attitudes about
political issues? Scholars have long known that issues can have a "group-
centric" basis. That is, people when people think of an issue, they think of the
group that issue would seem to most involve. Still two important questions
remain. What specific kinds of group-centric attitudes are relevant to the
formation of policy attitudes? Under what conditions do group-centric attitudes
predict policy attitudes? Via a 2012 survey, the investigator will assess
attitudes toward two social groups -African-Americans and Muslims- using a
variety of measures. Scholarly literature uses many such measures but does not
always consider which of them is more predictive of attitudes and why. The
survey will also contain a set of experiments that investigate three types of
conditions that may determine whether issues become group-centric in the
public's mind: who sponsors the policy, whether the policy directly targets a
group, and whether the policy is framed as implicating a group. By testing for
the individual and joint effects of these conditions, the investigator can
better determine how and why group-centrism affects political attitudes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have several important implications.
Questions about the impact of attitudes toward social groups, such as
stereotypes and prejudice, occur within political science, psychology,
sociology, and economics, among others. The impact of attitudes is also of
interest to educators, advocacy groups, political leaders, and others who seek
to mitigate such effects. Prejudice toward Muslims has been a particular
concern; one that still lacks thorough empirical assessment. The findings should
therefore interest scholars across several subfields as well as policymakers.
