This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Barry Friedman of
Sam Houston State University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Mahito
Kohmoto for eight months at the University of Tokyo. They will investigate
certain aspects of high temperature superconductivity in an attempt to increase
understanding of this phenomena. In the absence of any comprehensive theory for
the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity, the researchers will
address the general questions of similarities and differences between the
superconducting copper oxides and bismuth oxides, and differences between the
dynamic and static properties of vortices in high- and low-temperature
superconductors. Collaboration between Dr. Friedman, who has a background in the
area of conducting polymers, and Dr. Kohmoto's group at the Institute for Solid
State Physics should yield some insights into the basic principles of high-
temperature supercon- ductivity.
