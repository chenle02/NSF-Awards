Abstract Proposal No. 9714574 Proposal Type SGER Principal Investigator Charles
R. Martin Affiliation Colorado State University This grant is awarded through
the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial,
Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems
Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Charles Martin at Colorado State
University. The objective of the research is to develop molecular-recognition
membranes that are highly selective. The concept is to introduce apoenzymes
(enzymes without cofactors) into a membrane. The apoenzyme binds to specific
substrates and thereby increases the flux of the substrate species compared to
other species present in the system. The PI proposes to use this molecular
recognition concept to focus on enantiomeric separations, using both apoenzymes
and synthetic molecular recognition species. This proposal to develop
enantioselective membranes ha a high exploratory content. The research proposed
here has a potentially tremendous impact in the separation of chiral species.
The concepts of molecular recognition and selective separations form emerging
research areas in separations science and technology. If successful, the
research will have a significant impact on pharamaceuticals purification and
production scale-up.
