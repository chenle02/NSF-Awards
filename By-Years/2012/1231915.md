The objective of this program is to understand the effects of mechanical
stresses and perturbations on the electronic properties of single molecule
systems. By exploring the impacts of contact geometry, molecule-electrode
coupling strength, tensile and compressive forces, and electron-phonon
interactions on the charge transport properties of these devices this project
will provide new information about how the detailed, atomic-level configuration
of molecular systems affects the electronic properties.&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this proposal is that developing a comprehensive
understanding of the intricate interplay between the mechanical and electrical
properties of single-molecule systems will provide important information about
controlling charge transport in these systems and enable transformative progress
in the development of functional molecular-electronic systems. This includes the
exploration of new functional paradigms for electromechanical computational
schemes and transducers that can convert mechanical stimuli into electrical
signals for use in sensor systems.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that
knowledge about the interaction between mechanical structure and charge
transport will affect a variety of fields beyond molecular-scale electronics.
This includes biology and chemistry where these interactions are extremely
important for understanding protein systems like photosynthetic reactions
centers. This research will also impact the study of both bulk organic and
nanoscale electronics since controlling charge transport mechanically may allow
for novel sensors, devices, and applications. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary
research and educational program in this program will be three tiered with
efforts focused on exposing K-12 students to engineering disciplines,
undergraduate research opportunities, and graduate training and education.
