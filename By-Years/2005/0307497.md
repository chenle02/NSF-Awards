AST 0307497&lt;br/&gt;PI Richter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concentrates
on spectroscopic observations of pre-main-sequence and main-sequence stars in an
attempt to characterize disks at radii comparable to the orbits of terrestrial
and gas giant planets in our own solar system. By observing multiple transitions
of molecular hydrogen and other simple, gaseous molecules at high spectral
resolution, the research team will place constraints on properties such as the
temperature, the level of mixing between gas and dust, and the chemical state of
protoplanetary disks. Most of the observations will be carried out using the
Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph, a high-resolution, mid-infrared
spectrograph capable of sensitive, very high spectral resolution observations in
the 4 to 25 micrometer wavelength regions. Using this instrument, selected
sources will also be searched for water vapor, carbon monoxide, methane, and
ammonia transitions. Comparing emission lines at very different excitation
energies will help provide insight into the disk properties at varying
radii.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Because this research investigates
the origins of planetary systems and the evolution of pre-biotic molecules
within proto-planetary disks, any spectroscopic detection of forming planets and
information regarding water and simple organic species near such planets are of
interest to the general public. The investigator will continue to serve as the
point of contact for this instrument with the astronomical community, maintain
and improve the software he developed, conduct observations at the telescope,
and assist in the reduction and analysis of data. This research will include
graduate and undergraduate students in the project. The goal is to encourage the
development of future instrumentalists by involving students in a relatively
small research group that designs, builds, maintains, and uses forefront
astronomical instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
