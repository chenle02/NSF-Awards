9303945 Sanders This research is to image the attenuation structure of the
Alaska subduction zone and overlying mantle wedge by means of seismic
tomography. S-to-P amplitude ratios measured from earthquakes located in the
Alaska subduction zone and recorded by the Alaska Earthquake Information Center
seismic array will be inverted for three-dimensional attenuation structure using
an algebraic reconstruction algorithm. The resulting image will be used to test
hypotheses concerning metamorphic and thermal processes at and above the contact
zone between the subducted oceanic crust and the mantle lithosphere. In addition
to determining the thermal and petrologic structure of the subduction zone, the
study will constrain the importance of shear heating in subduction zones and
further our understanding of arc magma genesis. ***
