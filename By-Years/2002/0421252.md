With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Duquesne University will acquire a
Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Liquid-
Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety
of research projects, including studies on a) organic and inorganic synthesis
reactions; b) correlating specific proteins with defined genetic activity; c)
identifying and exploiting the bio-markers for discrete conditions or outcomes;
and d) quantitative characterization of various types of surface modifications,
from functionalized self assembled monolayers to fingerprints and genetic
material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
(MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for
obtaining accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over 300,000
daltons, with extremely high sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
has therefore become a standard technique, especially in studies involving
biomolecules. This research will have a significant impact in a number of areas,
especially biochemistry, medicinal chemistry and materials science. &lt;br/&gt;
