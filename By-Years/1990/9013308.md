A joint workshop is scheduled between U.S. and West German researchers on
"Downstream Processing of High-Value Proteins". The objective of this Workshop
is to provide the opportunity for the participants from the two countries to
present updated information on recent research developments in purification and
separation of high-value proteins. The Workshop will be for two days, May 11 and
12, 1990, and will be held at the Don Cesar Resort Hotel, St. Petersburg Beach,
Florida. This venue was selected to precede the Engineering Foundation
Conferences on "Recovery of Biological products V", to be held on May 13- 18,
1990, at the same site. This two-day Workshop, with participants from
universities and industry, will have formal presentations but allow ample
opportunity for discussions and interactions. The U.S. Chairman of the Workshop
will be Professor Daniel I.C. Wang, Director of the Biotechnology Process
Engineering Center at M.I.T. The West Germany Chairman will be Dr. Helmut
Hustedt, Gesellschaft fur Biotechnologische Forschung (GBF), D300 Braunschwig,
FRG.
