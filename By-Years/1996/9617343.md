ABSTRACT OPP-9617343 ROTHROCK, David University of Washington This project
involves the dual civilian-military use of a US Navy nuclear submarine for the
multi-agency project SCICEX (Science Experiment). SCICEX researchers will use an
upward looking sonar to examine the underside of the Arctic pack ice to
determine the thickness variability of the ice in the Beaufort Sea. The
thickness information will be gathered at the site of a large, interdisciplinary
research project, Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean. The
variability of the ice thickness in conjunction with the ice, atmosphere, ocean
measurements for SHEBA will be used to test a model that will allow the
prediction of sea ice thickness from satellite measurements so that the results
may be extrapolated to the entire Arctic Ocean. The project is a very important
contribution to a wide array of research efforts to determine if a proposed
global warming will affect the Arctic ice pack thickness and distribution.
Global Circulation Models suggest that the ice pack may not be a permanent
feature and this project will provide measurements that are necessary to
validate and improve the models.
