It is proposed to continue research on understanding the complex faulting
process at the source of an earthquake by constructing numerical models of three
dimensional spontaneous shear crack propagation. The results will be applied to
the physical interpretation of inferred earthquake source time functions. The
long term goal of this work is to develop a rational capability of predicting
disastrous earthquakes as well as predicting the expected strong ground motion
at a given site due to such an earthquake.
