A new site is to be planned at Oregon State University for the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for e-Design. The
I/UCRC for e-Design conducts research that supports a new design paradigm for
the development of engineered products and systems that allows customer driven
design and product realization and virtual simulation and prototyping that
encompasses the entire product life cycle. The planned Oregon State site will
complement the existing center?s activities through focus in the following
areas: 1) optimization of products and systems, 2) failure, reliability, and
robustness analysis; 3) early stage design theories and methodologies, 4)
manufacturing and lifecycle analysis, 5) cost and choice modeling; 6) design for
sustainability; 7) computational design; and 8) design innovation
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The e-Design center addresses an area central to
the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. The center site at Oregon State
University has the potential to further expand the diversity of member companies
in the overall center and expose all member firms to a broader base of discovery
in the e-Design area. Results of the site?s research efforts will be integrated
into the educational curriculum in design, modeling and simulation, decision
analysis, and optimization. Student engagement in center work will include
laboratory and field studies, attendance of and presentations at
interdisciplinary conferences and workshops, a design colloquium series,
participation in interdisciplinary activities and journal publications, as well
as training in the ethical conduct of research. The addition of Oregon State
University to the Center contributes to the diversity of the Center, with the
leadership team and 30% of participating faculty being women, typically
underrepresented in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
