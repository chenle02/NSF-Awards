This research concerns questions in the general area of arithmetic geometry
which involve or are applications of the theory of height functions. The
research will involve proofs of formulas for the number of points having height
less than a given bound on certain varieties, a precise formula for the
variation of the Neron-Tate height of points in an algebraic family of elliptic
curves, and a lower bound for the Neron-Tate height of points on certain abelian
varieties. This research is in the general area of algebraic arithmetic
geometry. This is a subject which concerns the integral points or integral
coordinates which lie on algebraic surfaces. In particular, this research
involves counting the number of integral points on curves of genus two.
