Akella This research is focused on developing a systematic approach for high-
level synthesis of self-timed circuits. The framework for the research is a set
of design tools (SHILPA) that produces macro cell based realizations of circuits
from behavioral descriptions. Research problems include the following: 1.
techniques for resource sharing based on flow analysis; 2. efficient
partitioning of a sequential specification into a set of communicating
sequential processes; 3. development of a tool for gate-level realizations of
asynchronous circuits in SHILPA; and 4. investigating graphical and VHDL
interfaces to SHILPA.
