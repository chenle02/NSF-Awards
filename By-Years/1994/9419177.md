9419177 Haws Experiments and computations can generate vast quantities of
numerical data which are difficult to interpret. Visualization techniques are
increasingly being applied by researchers to assist in this; for example to
assist the researcher to discover basic phenomena normally masked within these
large numerical data sets. While excellent visualization tools exist and are
being developed, there is little knowledge or use of these tools by researchers
in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The objective of this project is to
introduce researchers and practitioners in earthquake engineering to the wide
variety of visualization tools available today. Proper use of these tools
requires understanding simple concepts (such as the basic principles of visual
perception) as well as existing industry standards (such as broadcast video
formats for displaying information). This workshop will emphasize the use of
inexpensive (that is, microcomputer-based) computer platforms with a "hands-on"
approach, and will include appropriate documentation and dissemination of the
workshop materials to those who are not able to attend. It is expected that the
use of these visualization tools will lead to improved earthquake hazard
mitigation techniques. ***
