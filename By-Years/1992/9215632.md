Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are devices that are machined using bulk
and/or surface micromachining (lithography) or the LIGA process. The resulting
devices are small enough that surface morphology can have a significant impact
on system performance. This study will seek to characterize such surfaces by
means of an analytical, parsimonious model based on fratals. Fractals will be
evaluated for their potential to represent typical micromachined surfaces
reported in the literature. Then an attempt will be made to correlate the
parameters of the fractal representation to key fabrication steps and/or
settings. The objective of this research is to develop a predictive model for
MEMS surface morphologies that is suitable for use in MEMS design and in
analysis of MEMS devices.
