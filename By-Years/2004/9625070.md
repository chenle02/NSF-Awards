9625070 Mirmiran This is a CAREER Award. The research plan will focus on hybrid
construction with concrete and fiber composites in systems with pseudo-ductile
behavior with high stiffness and strength. The plan will include analytical and
experimental components. The education plan will synergize the research results
into the classroom teaching which will allow to the students and the faculty
person to be at the peaks of knowledge in a specific topic. ***
