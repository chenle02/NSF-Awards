Mating type control in the yeast S. cerevisiae provide a powerful genetic model
to understand both hormone/receptor/G protein signal transduction and the
transcriptional regulation that underlies cell type specificity. Our work has
shown that yeast STE12 protein plays a central role in both of these processes
by binding to the DNA sequence that mediates pheromone (hormone) induction in
yeast. STE12 may thus be the ultimate effector at the DNA level of the signal
transduction pathway triggered by the binding of pheromone. Our long term
objective is to understand the role of STE12 in cell-type-specific transcription
and its potential modification, in response to pheromone, which allows it to
increase the level of transcription. We plan: 1) a mutational analysis of STE12
to determine which amino acid residues are critical for binding to DNA, for
activating transcription and for responding to pheromone; 2) purification of
STE12 and characterization of its binding to DNA and its interactions with other
transcription factors; 3) analysis of STE12 after activation by pheromone; and
4) genetic approaches to identify other proteins with which STE12 acts. Given
the striking conservation between yeast and mammalian transcription processes,
and the central role of transcriptional activators in cellular differentiation,
transformation, and viral specificity, our studies on this yeast protein should
have broad implications for understanding the control of gene expression in
animal cells. The work in this proposal will increase our understanding of the
mechanisms by which cells turn on specific genes in response to signals from
their external environment.
