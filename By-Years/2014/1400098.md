This award will provide funds to support a two-day conference at the University
of Florida during March 24-25, 2014. The basic objective of the conference is to
bring together professors, post-docs, and graduate and undergraduate students
working on both algebraic and bijective combinatorics.

Algebraic combinatorics, that is, the application of algebraic tools to solve
combinatorial problems, has been a very popular area of research in the last 25
years. Its most frequently used tools include generating functions, symmetric
polynomials, Standard Young Tableaux, and the incidence algebra of a partially
ordered set. These high-powered algebraic tools often show that some classes of
remote-looking objects in fact have the same size. That is when bijective
combinatorics comes in the picture. If two classes of objects that seem to be
unrelated contain the same number of elements, then it is quite possible that
those classes are not unrelated after all, and there is a bijection between
them. These bijections are sometimes quite challenging to find, but once they
are found, they enhance our understanding of the classes at hand.
