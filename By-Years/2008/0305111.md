This project aims to investigate a newly observed electrical bistable behavior,
several orders of magnitude change in conductivity, in organic thin-film
devices. The bistability is facilitated by introducing a thin metal film in an
organic thin film device, which produces two metal/organic interfaces.
Understanding the role of the interfaces is considered a key factor in
elucidating the mechanism of such organic bistable devices. The overall goal of
the project is to gain fundamental understanding of the device operation
mechanism through materials, interface, and device investigations. Basic
understanding of interface electronic structure, possible chemical reactions and
interdiffusion, and energy level alignment and HOMO-LUMO positions, is sought
through use of surface analytical tools including x-ray and ultraviolet
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, UPS), and inverse photoemission spectroscopy
(IPES). Scanning probe microscopy, including atomic force microscopy (AFM),
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and related spectroscopies will be employed
to examine the film morphology, surfaces and interfaces, and device
characteristics in nanometer scale. FTIR and UV-Vis (both in the reflection mode
and transmission mode) will also be used to study aspects of organic and organo-
metallic complex films. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses
fundamental research issues associated with electronic/photonic materials having
technological relevance and emphasizes the integration of research and
education. A major focus of the project is on educating and training graduate
and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary field covering organic
electronic materials, devices, and surface and interface analysis.
