This research will improve mathematical models and numerical methods for
studying platelet aggregation during blood clotting and the flow of fluid-
particle suspensions. These are large- scale problems of considerable
complexity. Consequently, the research will involve a high degree of
computation, much of which will require use of a supercomputer. A new particle-
based algorithm for solving a multidimensional convection-dominated convection-
diffusion equation will be developed. The use of localized forces to represent
platelets and suspended particles will be extended to the representation of
blood vessel walls. This work should shed light on a central question in
aggregation: how the blood's local fluid dynamics and the geometry of the blood
vessel interact to influence the location, rate, and extent of aggregate
formation. It will aid in the design of nonthrombogenic artificial internal
organs.
