This award funds the research activities of Professor Xingang Chen at the
University of Texas at Dallas. In recent years, experiments and theoretical
studies have established a six-parameter Standard Model for the Big Bang
cosmology, and provided strong support for the existence of an inflationary
epoch as the origin of Big Bang. The details of this epoch are now being
explored. In addition, various tantalizing anomalies have been observed that can
potentially provide us the knowledge beyond the Standard Model. This project
will systematically study different beyond-Standard-Model signals in terms of
both the theoretical model-building and the interpretation of data. The primary
data comes from detailed studies of the cosmic microwave background(CMB) and of
the large scale structure (LSS) of the universe. This research motivates new
connections between theory and data, and facilitates discoveries of new physics.
In addition, this will provide training for undergraduates and graduate
students, and there will be an outreach program to high school students.

The PI will investigate and classify a variety of possible new phenomena in the
inflationary density perturbations, such as primordial anisotropies, features
and non-Gaussianities. He will systematically classify different types of
anisotropic pre-inflationary relic and study their effects on density
perturbations, will study different inflation models with oscillating spectator
massive fields and predict their effects on the CMB and LSS, and will extend
work on primordial non-Gaussiantiies and study the effects on the CMB and LSS.
He will emphasize important connections between the beyond-Standard-Model
signals and fundamental physics. Methods of model building, first-principle
derivation and data analyses are combined to effectively carry out this program.
