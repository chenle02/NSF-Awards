The interfacial science of the Langmuir-Blodgett deposition process is largely
unknown. Investigators will study the visco-elastic properties and structure of
monolayers that are prepared for deposition and during the deposition process.
This project will include building a forced capillary wave spectrometer that is
required for understanding the dynamic response of monolayers. It is suggested
that deposition depends strongly on the visco-elastic response of the monolayer;
small changes in surface pressure can lead to much larger changes in the film's
visco-elastic response. A new theory has been developed for the deposition
process that involves fluctuations in the monolayer as it is deposited.
Additional experimental data is required to guide and support the analysis. The
data needed is that of the viscoelastic response under process conditions.
