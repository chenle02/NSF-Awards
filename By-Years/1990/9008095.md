Professor Jackson's group is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program in a multifaceted investigation of ultraviolet multiphoton dissociation
processes in small polyatomic molecules. This work is attempting to characterize
some of the underlying basic processes that occur in such complex laser-induced
chemical environments. The molecules being investigated, such as acetylene,
allene, and methylacetylene, are being expanded in a pulsed molecular beam prior
to ultraviolet photodissociation. Product fragments are being analyzed by
various techniques. Quantum state distributions are determined by laser induced
fluorescence and time-resolved infrared emission measurements. The angular and
energy distributions of hydrogen atom fragments are being detected via resonant
two-photon pumping to Rydberg levels in the photodissociation zone, followed by
time-resolved detection at a distant ionization zone. Small diatomic fragments
can also be examined with these time-of-flight techniques.
