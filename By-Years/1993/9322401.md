9322401 Ram This award is for support for a three year project to complete
measurements of stratigraphy on the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice
core with laser-light scattering, using both a solid technique and a technqiue
that involves analysis of meltwater. At present, the resolution of the meltwater
measurements only allows annual layers larger than 3 cm to be distinguished, so
ice below 1900 m cannot be properly analyzed by scattering from meltwater. The
resolution of these measurements will be improved so that annual layers as small
as 1 cm will be able to be measured by this technique. Measurements using the
solid technique have, so far, only been applied to bubble-free ice. It will be
demonstrated that this technique can be extended to bubbly ice and this method
will be used to analyze all remaining sections of the ice core. The laser-light
scattering measurements will be calibrated so that they give the variation in
number of particles larger than 0.5 microns along the core, rather than just the
relative scattered light intensity. Finally, selected sections of the core will
be remeasured at regular time intervals to determine how the scattered signal
changes with time as bubbles reemerge. ***
