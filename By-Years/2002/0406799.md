AST-0406799&lt;br/&gt;Blackman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (LFQPOs) in microquasars remain an important and subtle
astrophysical puzzle. This project will investigate the theoretical possibility
that LFQPOs are the result of asymmetric engines, including spirals, hotspots
and warps. The accretion ejection instability has already been shown to produce
spiral waves and hotspots in magnetized disks, and provides a starting point for
this further study. Simulations will be used to develop synthetic spectra and
light curves. The development of analytic formulae for non-axisymmetric disk
surface profiles, including shadowing and time dependence, will allow practical
testing of the ideas, as will comparison of the time-dependent model spectra
with detailed diagnostics developed from an analysis of archived
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide significant undergraduate
research opportunities in X-ray data analysis, numerical simulation, and
analytical modeling. The investigators will also develop and supervise a weekly
astrophysics radio show, designed to be broadcast by undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;
