In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms
(CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Robert Levis of Temple
University and his graduate and undergraduate student researchers are doing
experimental and computational studies to study the chemical reactivity of
prototype molecules excited by ultrafast lasers. Prof. Levis and his group are
attempting to understand the reactivity of molecules whose structures place them
near so-called ?conical intersections?. These conical intersections are
ubiquitous in a wide number of chemical contexts, but they remain poorly-
understood except for the simplest chemical systems. These studies should help
scientists better understand an important class of chemical reactions. Student
researchers working on this project receive excellent training in experimental
and computational physical chemistry. This project benefits from the
collaboration with Dr. Spiridoula Matsika, a computational chemist at Temple
University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Levis and his research group are
conducting a series of experimental and modeling studies of the behavior of gas-
phase alkylphenones undergoing strong-field excitation. The specific experiments
to be carried out include: (1) spectroscopic studies of a series of alkylphenone
molecules with strong-field mass spectrometry as a function of the wavelength of
the excitation pulse; (2) investigations of the control of pre-ionized molecules
to facilitate higher fidelity chemical control; (3) studies of the dynamics of
alkylphenones in the vicinity of conical intersections using the radical cation
launch state and strong fields to dress and Stark shift the pertinent potential
surfaces; and (4) computational studies of the interaction of strong laser
fields with polyatomic molecules to model the observations of experiment.
Students working on this project receive excellent training in chemical physics
that prepares them to become globally-engaged members of the technical
workforce.
