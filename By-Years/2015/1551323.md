STEM mentoring research shows that positive mentoring experiences have a
significant impact on STEM retention and broadening participation of (e.g.,
underrepresented Minorities (URM), women and persons with disabilities) in STEM
fields. Engineering is currently at a crossroad and everything that can be done
to retain talented engineering students needs to be done. There are few studies
that focus solely on engineering mentoring and none of these studies include a
significant training component for the mentors. This project plans to use and
measure the impact of mentor training on engineering researchers. The EFRI
Research Experience and Mentoring (EFRI-REM) program will be used as a pilot
program to measure the success of inclusion of mentor training and the building
of an engineering focused mentoring community on outcomes of EFRI-REM students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the EFRI-REM research participants will be used to
pilot this program, the outcomes will have potentially far reaching impact
throughout the engineering research community. For example, the proposed ?train
the trainer? mentor training model will be broadly disseminated beyond the EFRI-
REM community. Faculty trained to facilitate mentor training will be encouraged
and supported to offer training to engineering faculty and students beyond the
EFRI-REM program, with potential impacts reaching the entire engineering
research spectrum. In addition, the developed online mentoring community will
provide continued support for engineering mentors to discuss best practices and
ongoing mentoring issues. The impact of well-mentored students could have large
potential positive impacts on retention of graduate students in engineering and
encourage undergraduate engineering students to pursue advanced degrees in
engineering.
