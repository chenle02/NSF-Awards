This project involves work in several different areas of algebra. One area to
be studied is the integral representations of Gl(n). Another area under
investigation is the representation theory of artin algebras and the theory of
lattices over higher dimensional orders, with special emphasis on Cohen-Macaulay
approximations. Work will also be done on commutative algebra and algebraic
geometry from the perspective of free resolutions and the theory of curves. The
research involved in this project has great breath and covers some of the most
significant areas of modern theoretical algebra. This includes commutative
algebra and the integral representations of the general linear group; the
structure theory of noncommutative rings and, in particular, the representation
theory of artin algebras; and commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. These
areas are of interest to many branches of mathematics.
