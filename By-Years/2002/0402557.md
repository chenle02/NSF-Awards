This award will help improve the accuracy of paleoclimate proxies via a spatial
perspective on modern climate conditions. The researcher and his colleagues will
examine the modern conditions, interactions, and sensitivities of glaciers to
climate-forcing factors and to examine the range of variability of parameters
measured in the cores (i.e., stable isotopes, dust concentration).

Ice cores from the tropics, mountain glaciers, and ice caps, provide high-
resolution records of environmental data. The two sites that are targeted by
this research, Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru and the Northern Ice Field of
Kilimanjaro in eastern Africa, have satellite-linked weather stations already
installed by the researchers. These stations measure a range of variables
required to model the exchange of energy and mass of snow and/or ice at high
elevations. The awarded funds will be used to continue operating the weather
stations and to expand the glacier mass balance research.

In general, the researcher aims to characterize local and regional-scale modern
climate, examine the variability at each site, and quantify exchanges of mass
and energy at each glacier through measurements and modeling. The research will
provide insight into how climate forcing mechanisms, interactions, and feedbacks
are reflected in tropical ice-core records. The analytical results will help
place modern conditions in the context of processes acting on longer time
scales.
