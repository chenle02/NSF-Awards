The overall purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to develop a model of
people's intuitive understanding of chemical risks and toxicological principles;
and (2) to compare this model with that of expert toxicologists and risk
assessors. Specific objectives of the study are (1) to develop a better
understanding of how laypersons and experts assess toxicological risks, (2) to
investigate differences in risk perceptions within the expert and lay
communities, and (3) to conduct empirical studies that examine the knowledge
base and conceptual frameworks used by experts and laypeople to assess chemical
risks. Despite the importance of understanding public perceptions of chemical
risks, little research has been directed toward this end. This innovative study
will provide information important to both risk analysts and decision makers.
Specifically, it will clarify the nature of the cognitive frameworks used by
laypersons and by experts to assess risks. It will also contribute to the
development of more effective risk communication about the risks and benefits of
chemical hazards.
