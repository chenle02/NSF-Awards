The focus of computational geometry is designing algorithms for solving
geometric problems. These arise in a number of application contexts, including
manufacturing, graph drawing, robotics, and graphics. The project's
concentrations touch on all these application areas. Research on shortest paths
and geodesics on polytopes is relevant to robotics and to texture mapping in
graphics. Folding and unfolding of research is connected to a variety of
manufacturing concerns. And visibility algorithms see use in graphics and graph
drawing. A collection of fundamental open problems in these areas will be
pursued, both theoretically and through experimentation with code. Progress on
geodesics, on folding, on floodlight illumination, and on visibility graphs can
be expected. Female undergraduate students will be engaged in all aspects of the
research, and all software developed will be freely distributed on the Internet.
