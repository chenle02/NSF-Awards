ABSTRACT CTS-9627899 William Haynes NIST As part of a seven month sabbatical
leave period, the investigator proposes to collaborate with the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) - Thermophysics Division in
defining improved theoretical and experimental methods to evaluate the physical
properties of dilute solutions, especially as applied to environmental parameter
evaluation and related applications. This type of data is essential in the
design of "clean" chemical manufacturing processes and prediction of pollutant
fate and transport. Unfortunately, little is currently being done to correct the
lack of reliable data in the dilute regime. In turn, the lack of carefully
measured experimental data impedes the development of robust and accurate
ostimation methods. In light of these deficiencies, filling this need has been
identified by NIST and the investigator as an area of significant national
importance for both industry and government.
