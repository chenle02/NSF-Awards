EINSTEIN is a series of three prime time television programs to be shown
nationally on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The series will present a
scientific biography of Albert Einstein. The series will treat the life of
Albert Einstein on several levels. The central narative thread will trace the
development and impact of Einstein's work in physics. The three programs will
examine Einstein's impact beyond physics -- as a muse for the arts; a dissident
voice in politics; a moral sensibility; ultimately as the greatest public symbol
of scientific accomplishment. With original texts (including newly identified
documents from the Einstein archives), historical footage, interviews,
documentary sequences, the most sophisticated computer animation available, and
other techniques as appropriate, EINSTEIN will present to its audience a unique
picture of the role of Albert Einstein in the making of the modern world. Beyond
its broadcast in 1992, the series also will receive wide educational
distribution in secondary schools and colleges and a large foreign audience.
