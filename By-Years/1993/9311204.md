grant that will complement and improve our characterization and research
facility in electro optics, nonlinear optics, and optical communication. The
requested instrumentation would cover the dynamic analysis and characterization
of the studied effects, devices, and systems. The equipment will enable faculty
members and students to carry out meaningful and cooperative research in the
high speed photonics area. In particular we intend to strengthen and complement
existing research activities in the following topics: Composite Cavity
Semiconductor Lasers for High Speed Communication. Laterally Coupled Cavity
Semiconductor Laser for Widely Tunable Single Longitudinal Mode Operation.
Coupled Periodic Waveguides for Integrated Optics Applications. Quenching of
Phase and Amplitude Noise Using Spherical Particles Resonance Interaction with
Semiconductor Lasers.
