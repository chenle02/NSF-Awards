Expert testimony is often a critical aspect of criminal and civil trials, in
part because of perceived objectivity of experts and their expertise. Yet,
individuals are susceptible to psychological biases that can compromise
objective judgment and decision making, even if they are unaware of their own
bias while recognizing it in others. If experts are similarly susceptible to
bias, then their compromised objectivity could influence the outcome of trials,
perhaps raising constitutional issues with respect to fair trials. This project
will measure and document experts' perception of their own biases, as well as
the consequences of their potential misperceptions of those biases. As a
consequence, this project has the potential to inform actors in the legal system
about ways to limit bias in expert decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will employ surveys and experiments designed to document biases of
experts, and their perception of those biases. Further, it will examine
differences that experts and non-experts have with respect to their biases. The
focus will be on experts in the legal field, including forensic mental health
and fingerprint identification experts. The project will test the hypothesis of
"bias blind spot," which is the tendency to recognize bias in others but not
oneself. Thus, the project is designed to compare any bias blind spots of
experts with that of non-experts. Surveys of experts and non-experts in various
fields will be utilized to document experts' and non-experts' bias blind spots.
Then, the project will employ experiments that measure experts' actual
susceptibility to various biases and their awareness of those susceptibilities.
The project also will investigate the consequences of exaggerated confidence in
experts' objectivity. De-identified data from the project will be made publicly
available.
