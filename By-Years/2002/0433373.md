This project aims to elevate human performance in the specific area of complex
problem solving. The proposed effort claims to contribute to several important
theoretical and operational advances in increasing strategic problem solving
abilities. The project is grounded in literatures of intellectual development
and case study problem solving in contexts with ill-structured problems in
dynamic, time dependent, and complex situations. The broader goals of the
project are to produce strategically capable problem solvers who can ably tackle
complex scenarios in the context of geospatial awareness and decision-making and
response to terrorist threats. The more limited goals are to develop a series of
realistic and complex scenarios that require a team of undergraduates up to two
to four hours to meaningfully solve over one to two weeks of classes. The
solutions will require either Geobase (a geospatial information management and
decision-making system) or VNSA, Violent Non-State Actor, which is a simulation
tool that models growth and behavior of terrorist networks-violent non-state
actors as tools for modeling scenarios. The research design involves measures of
intellectual development of the participating cadets at the beginning of the
term in which they solve these exercises, at the end of the term, and then one
year later with a control group comparison similarly assessed.
