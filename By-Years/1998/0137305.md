This project continues the work of the Show-Me Center. The center consists of a
Middle School Mathematics Center (University of Missouri) and four Curriculum
Satellite Centers (University of Wisconsin, Michigan State University,
University of Montana and the Education Development Center in Newton, MA. The
goals of the center are fourfold: 1) disseminate information supporting
awareness, examination and implementation of comprehensive, standards-based
middle school mathematics curricula; 2) develop a leadership infrastructure to
support curriculum reform utilizing Show-Me Regional Associates, experienced
teacher users of curricula (Show-Me Master Teachers) and district leadership
teams to carry the message and work at local levels; 3) provide professional
development and teacher renewal. Center staff help school districts design and
implement coherent and long-term professional development for teachers organized
around standards-based curriculum adoption; and 4) monitor the impact of
standards-based curricula on student learning. The Center initiates data
collection through the Show-Me Postdoctoral Fellow Program so that the extent
and quality of implementation and its effects on student learning and teacher
development are documented and disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
