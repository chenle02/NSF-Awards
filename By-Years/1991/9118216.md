The principal goal of this project is to characterize the chemical and kinetic
mechanism of 4-methoxybenzoate monooxygenase (4MBMO). This enzyme is an Fe-
Rieske enzyme, a class of enzyme which plays a prominent role in biodegradation
of aromatic species. Extensive characterization will aid in designing strategies
for use of bioremediation to remove hazardous chemicals from the environment.
This work will also add to our understanding of the possible modes of oxygen
activation. %%% This project will result in training both graduate and
undergraduate students in biochemical analysis of environmental problems In the
course of this project, the students will be trained in the tools of enzymology,
microbiology and physical biochemistry. The laboratory experience of the
undergraduate students(s) will be organized to train them to think critically
about experimental design and results and to educate them in the values and
methods of science. Graduate education in this program should train an
individual to be an independent professional; one of our goals is to increase
the pool of scientists trained to approach environmental and ecological
questions on a molecular level.
