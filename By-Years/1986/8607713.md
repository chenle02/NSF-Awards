This research effort is concerned with the quantification and control of cutter
tool path error for application in precision end milling operations. This error
degrades the precision of the machined parts. The cutter tool path error will be
quantifies, predicted, and controlled by use of a magnetically suspended
spindle. The machined parts used in this experimental work will be microwave
guides where part accuracy is important and where surface finish must be burr-
free to avoid microwave signal attenuation. A magnetic bearing spindle will be
purchased to enable this research.
