A 'horizontal ice core' was collected at the Mount Moulton blue ice field in
West Antarctica and preliminary analyses of the sample material suggests that a
~500 kyr climate record is preserved in the ice at this site. This award will
contribute to the understanding of the Mt Moulton record by assessing the
potential for ice-flow induced deformation of the stratigraphic profile. In
addition, this award builds on the recognition of blue ice areas as archives of
long climate records by conducting reconnaissance studies for a potential
horizontal ice core location at the Allan Hills in East Antarctica. The
objectives of this project are to contribute to the glaciological understanding
of blue ice areas in Antarctica. Ice flow conditions at the Mt Moulton blue ice
field will be studied to assess the possibility that the stratigraphic record
has been deformed and reconnaissance of a potential horizontal ice core site in
the Allan Hills blue ice field will also be accomplished. Short field programs
will be undertaken at each location to collect relevant measurements of ice flow
and subglacial topography, and to conduct sampling of material that will enable
the preservation of the stratigraphic sequences to be assessed.
