0129163 Raines This award supports Ronald Raines and students from the
University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Renate Ulbrich-Hofmann
of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of
Leipzig, Germany. The aim of the international project is to use intein-mediated
protein ligation to create semisynthetic variants of ribonuclease A. These
variants will be produced by the US group and studied with respect to their
thermodynamic and proteolytic stability by methods established in the German
group. The results will provide new insight into protein-folding pathways and
the fundamental basis for protein stability, and ultimately lead to the creation
of new proteins with desirable properties. The work plan provides for extensive
participation by graduate students in the international travel and research.
