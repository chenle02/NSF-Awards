Through a vertically integrated combination of research, training, and outreach
activities, the Research Training Group project aims to increase the number of
US citizens and residents who take part in research in mathematics at UCLA, with
geometry, topology, and related computational methods as a focus. The
researchers in the Geometry and Topology Group at UCLA work with a large cohort
of postdocs, graduate students, and undergrads. This Research Training Group
project aims to additionally support undergraduates, graduate students, and
postdoctoral scholars in connecting with programs at UCLA and in the broader
community that focus on K-12 education, on connecting with community colleges,
and on integrating social justice concerns with mathematics. The project
specifically seeks to support women and members of under-served groups in
mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three postdoctoral scholars and ten
graduate students will be supported by this grant; they will be trained by the
senior personnel in research topics such as algebraic topology, low-dimensional
topology, differential geometry, symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and
topological data analysis. Three research workshops will be conducted as part of
this program: algebraic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and applied
topology; the workshops, which will bring together experts in the field, aim to
lead to new research and collaborations. A new seminar series will be created to
create collaborations between pure and applied topologists. K-12 students will
be trained through the UCLA Olga Radko Endowed Math Circle. In addition,
expository mathematics articles will be written aimed at schoolchildren. A
yearly research experience for undergraduates will be conducted involving local
participants from the greater Los Angeles region, aiming to serve its large
minority population. Community support will be created for undergraduate
transfer students. Connections with nearby Cal State universities will be
strengthened, and mentoring will be provided to their students. New courses will
be created, including geometry and topology courses for lower division
undergraduates. RTG-supported postdocs and graduate students will participate in
many of these projects as mentors or docents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
