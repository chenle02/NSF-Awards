9614330 Fink The proposed research will combine field observations, theoretical
analyses, and laboratory simulations to characterize and quantify the physical
processes that accompany the interactions of lava flows and glacial ice. The
resulting models will be used to calculate the quantities, timing, and locations
of melt water likely to be generated by future eruptions of lava at the summits
and flanks of glaciated volcanoes. The initial application will be to Mount
Rainier, Washington, where the most probable eruptive activity would involve
lava flows in the vicinity of glacial ice and snow, and where concerted efforts
at hazards assessment by members of the U.S. Geological Survey and other
researchers are ongoing. Laboratory simulations will use polyethylene glycol wax
injected into cold water to reproduce the types of structures and textures
generated when lava solidifies in contact with ice. These models should allow
the textures and morphologies of the lava flows to be used to deduce their
eruption rates.
