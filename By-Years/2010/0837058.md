Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many universities, experiences in
designing and conducting research that address scientific questions are limited
to graduate students or upper-division undergraduates. This leaves many students
unfamiliar with methods of experimental design and the role of argumentation in
science, and presents a view of science that is inconsistent with practice.
These concerns are particularly troubling to future teachers. The project
develops a course for pre-service teachers using open-inquiry in science that
engages students in crafting and investigating their own scientific questions in
topics that span several disciplines. The coursework scaffolds students' inquiry
activities, requiring them to move beyond simple experiments and seek to find
correlations. The inquiry activities move students toward a deeper understanding
of investigation and experimentation as methodologies for evaluating scientific
arguments. Evaluations of the course assess the degree to which the course
supports students in developing a more sophisticated understanding of the nature
of science and improves their confidence in teaching scientific ideas and
inquiry. The project develops an instructor's guide to aid in the implementation
of open-inquiry courses at other institutions. The guide is patterned after
facilitation guides as described in social work literature, with careful
attention to fostering dialog and building community. The guide will aid faculty
in undergraduate sciences in promoting discussion and inquiry.
