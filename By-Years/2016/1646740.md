The Research at High Pressure Gordon Conference (HP-GRC) is one of the oldest
topical conferences held since the emergence of the field of high pressure and
has been held uninterrupted for over 60 years. The HP-GRC is a multidisciplinary
conference in the field of high pressure research, and this year?s HP-GRC
program consists of presentations on breakthrough results obtained using high-
pressure methods and new innovations for studying matter under extreme
conditions. This conference brings together experts from the dynamic and static
pressure communities across the world to present and discuss their new and
unpublished results. This proposal will provide support for registration fee
and/or travel support for participants, with preference given to post docs and
graduate students.
