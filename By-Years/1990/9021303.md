Research is proposed to calculate the statistics of the coherent lidar power for
a real monostatic lidar system, including the effects of refractive turbulence
and detector geometry. Analytic expressions for the average coherent lidar power
for an idealized lidar system operating in the atmospheric boundary layer will
be calculated to determine system performance. Various detector geometries will
be considered to investigate the performance of detector arrays and to test the
hypothesis that beam alignment methods based on the effects of refractive
turbulence are superior to present methods. The alignment constraints for a
monostatic system with refractive turbulence will be determined using analytic
techniques for idealized systems and numerical simulations for real systems. The
simulations will also produce an accurate statistical description of real laser
radar signal fluctuations. The different physical mechanisms of laser radar
performance will be investigated and the regime where simple analytic results
are valid will be determined. The calculations will emphasize the shorter
wavelengths of solid state lidar systems. This research will help design the
next generation of solid state lidars for remote sensing of the atmosphere.
