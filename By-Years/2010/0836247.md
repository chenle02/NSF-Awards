This proposal will cover participant costs for four graduate students and one
postdoctoral researcher to attend the International Summer School in Language
Documentation and Description in Lyon, France, June 23-July 4, 2008. The LDD
program is a special summer course in concepts and practices of language
description. Although this subfield of linguistics is traditionally concerned
with the preparation of grammars and dictionaries and language documentation, it
has increasingly become concerned with the compilation and preservation of
primary linguistic data and the inter-relationships between primary data and the
various types of analyses based on these data. The opportunity to attend LDD
will have both immediate and broader benefits. The students will benefit from
the training they receive, and their future research will inevitably be
improved. Moreover, the attendance of U.S. students at LDD is a very useful way
to build trans-Atlantic intellectual and practical cooperation in the growing
field of language description and documentation.
