Funding is requested for an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The instrument will
be used primarily to support research with 15N and 113C in the biological
science area, with major users from the ecological, plant, natural resource, and
soil sciences. IN the soil sicnece area, 15N will be used to study the effects
of below ground N cycling processes on N availability to plants and, together
with 13C, the dynamics of soil organic matter. Aquatic ecologists will use 15N
to study N fixation in awuatic systems and 15N and 113C to investigate
interations between aquatic community structure and nutrient cycling. Plant
physiologists propose to use 13C for measurement of water use efficiency and
root growth and respiration in trees subjected to environmental strees. Natural
resource scientists propose to use 15N in a bioassay of the N nutrient status of
trees, in studying the role of N allocation within plants on succession in
northern hardwood forests, and to trace transport and transformation of added N
in a forest ecosystem. Further, natural abundance 13C measurements will be used
to determine the influence of terrestrial liming on lake alkalinity.
