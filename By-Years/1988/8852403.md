High vacuum technology underlies much of current experimental science and "high
technology," and provides an excellent basis for training advanced
undergraduates. The Physics Department at Augsburg College will complete the
development of a high vacuum laboratory featuring four multipurpose vacuum
stands (medium high vacuum, gas analysis with mass spectrometry, gas mixing, and
ultra high vacuum), and to continue ongoing curriculum developments related to
this laboratory. Experiments will include topics in atomic and molecular
properties using mass spectroscopy, plasma physics, gas-surface interactions,
and vacuum technology. The equipment to be purchased includes a modern
quadrupole mass spectrometer, PC-based computer controllers and computer-
compatible sensors, and selected vacuum items needed to complete stand
fabrication. The vacuum laboratory will be used by both physics and chemistry
students in several upper division courses, and by technical employees in local
industry enrolled as part of an ongoing educational partnership. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-
Federal sources.
