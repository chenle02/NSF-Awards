Understanding the foundations of political liberalism has become one of most
critical issues of the past fifteen years. Countries that are not democracies or
that are in transition face global pressures to build moderate states via
independent, competent judiciaries, to permit the opening of civil society, and
to institute and protect core rights against state oppression. These elements of
political liberalism are also relevant for mature democracies as they confront
the growth of the administrative state, threats to their security, and potential
erosion of well-entrenched civil rights. This project seeks to understand the
impact of the legal complex (configurations of lawyers, judges, legal academics)
on advances towards or retreats from political liberalism over recent decades.
It does so in several ways: by examining their salience to contemporary
political transitions; by broadening the scope of countries to East Asia,
Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America; by juxtaposing mature
democracies with new democracies, transitional regimes, and illiberal regimes;
and by drawing the dynamics of lawyers, judges, and legal academics into the
same explanatory frame. The research enterprise brings together approximately
twenty specialists on law and politics for particular countries to produce case
studies of the legal complex and liberalism. The project is a collective effort
where participants will deliberate intensively in two conferences to compare and
contrast cases and to develop jointly new concepts and theory that can embrace
the diversity of cases. The project will produce one or more books and some
articles that are tightly integrated around the theoretical framework that is
developed collectively, and is intended as a stepping-stone more extensive and
systematic inquiry, including quantitative analysis, worldwide.
