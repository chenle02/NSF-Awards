Multichannel seismic data acquired during the SCREECH project will be analyzed
to further understand the rifting history of the Newfoundland Margin. These data
will be interpreted together with other existing MCS and magnetic data into a
regional framework. The basin-wide data compilation will then be integrated with
the results from upcoming ODP Leg 210 drilling. The combined analysis will be
extended for the full rift by comparison with the conjugate Iberia Margin. The
results should greatly improve our understanding of the evolution of nonvolcanic
rifted margins.
