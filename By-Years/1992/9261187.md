Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) films are attractive for coating wear parts because
of their hardness and oxidation resistance Its wide band gap and high thermal
conductivity make it a useful material for electronic applications. This work
will demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel Nonequilibrium Plasma Jet
(NEPJ), which is capable of depositing materials at high rates, for producing
c-BN films; if successful this process should be scalable to commercial
applications.
