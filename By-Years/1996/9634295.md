This project will analyze the process of translating scientific data into the
formation and execution of environmental policies. It takes the socio-political
responses and management of Chilean fisheries as a case study from which to
extract more general relationships of human adaptations to climate change. As a
result of the increase in the accuracy of predictive capabilities and the wider
distribution of probabilistic forecast efforts for El Ni(o Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) events, the interaction between scientists and policy makers has become
more direct. The project will provide a better understanding of the structural
and functional links involved in this process. This knowledge will contribute
valuable information to three key groups involved in the policy-making process:
(1) scientists involved in producing forecast products; (2) governmental and
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who have been mandated (e.g. U.N.
Conference on Environment and Development, 1992) to disseminate these forecast
tools; and (3) policy makers in sub-national, national and supra-national arenas
who use this information in planning mitigation and development strategies and
treatises. In collaboration with a US and Chilean research team representing
fisheries biology, environmental law and policy analysis and marine anthropology
(funded by NOAA-Office of Global Programs under the title `Adaptations of the
Fishing Sectors to the Impacts of El Ni(o Climate Variations: The Case of
Chile`), the project will analyze the relationships among the societies and
processes which result in decision making. This timely project will contribute
to a greater understanding of a range of information variables situated within a
framework of diverse political, economic and cultural norms and values.
