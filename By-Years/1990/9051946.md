This project establishes a computer information analysis laboratory in support
of upper-division courses in software engineering, information analysis, and
decision support systems - expert systems. Students are exposed to automated
analysis tools and learn project management by working in teams on real - world
assignments. The CASE technology provides a workbench for the planning and
design of systems through the use of structured techniques. This permits the
student to develop systems complete with totally machine-readable documentation
that are integrated and can be easily modified. The award is being matched by an
equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
