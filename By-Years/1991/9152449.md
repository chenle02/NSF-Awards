A grating UV-VIS spectrophotometer complete with computer interface, kinetic and
analytical software, and a thermostated sample holder will be used in three
undergraduate laboratories. The instrumentation will allow majors in
intermediate-level courses (organic, biochemistry, and instrumental analysis) to
observe and measure chemical and biochemical dynamics. During the summer months
the instrument will be used for undergraduate research in the training of Native
American undergraduates, Native American high school students, and area
teachers. This department anticipates heavy usage of this instrument during the
entire year. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
