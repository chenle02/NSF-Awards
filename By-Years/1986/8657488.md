Although one of the major properties of the cell membrane is to recognize and
respond to various signals with which it comes in contact, the cells of the
immune system have the additional ability to recognize substances which are
foreign and potentially harmful. Thus these cells bear receptors for interaction
with foreign substances (antigens). Regulation of an immune response involves
different cells and hormone-like molecules and their interactions also depend on
specific recognition molecules or receptors on the surface of these cells. James
Hildreth's research is directed at understanding the structure and function of
surface membrane molecules that serve in the recognition and regulation of
specific cellular interactions in immune functions. Dr. Hildreth is a young
investigator who has been making significant contributions in this area. To
pursue these studies he has been awarded a Presidential Young Investigator
award.
