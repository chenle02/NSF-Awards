This project seeks to develop a model for the improvement of physical science
education in grades 4-8 through the development of 15 kits of resources and
materials to be used in the training of teams of science educators who will, in
turn, use the kits to enhance the physical science background and classroom
methodology of teachers in their geographical regions. The project is a
cooperative endeavor of three universities in geographically distinct regions of
the nation: University of Rhode Island, Louisiana State University and San Diego
State University. The project involves three distinct activities: 1. the
development of the kits of resources and materials by teams of scientists,
science educators and teachers; 2. the training of 36 three member teams ( 12
from each region) in the use of the kits in their classrooms and to provide
inservice for their peers; and 3. the implementation of the inservice programs
with support from both the training staff and regional advisory committees
associated with each university site. If the model proves successful, future
initiatives will involve the dissemination of the model through the development
of more teams in a region or increasing the number of universities involved in
the model. The program has the potential to make a significant national impact.
The program is deserving of funding for the following reasons: an eminently
qualified staff representing scientists, science educators and exemplary
classroom teachers; focus on an area and level of science education often cited
as needing improvement; utilization of personnel and materials from a formerly
funded project which enjoys an excellent reputation; the utilization of a
"model" which has transferability to other populations and areas of science; and
the cooperation of several institutions and constituencies which provides
greater insurance of a significant impact and continuance beyond the time of NSF
funding.
