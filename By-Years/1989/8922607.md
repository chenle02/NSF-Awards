The research is concentrated in the areas of admissibility of decision rules
obtained from improper prior distributions, asymptotic distribution theory for
singular values of random matrices, and concentration inequalities with
applications in linear models. The evaluation and comparison of decision rules
obtained from improper prior distributions is the goal of the research on
admissibility. A technique will be developed to find the asymptotic distribution
of singular values of random matrices which is similar to a recently developed
technique for finding the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of
symmetric random matrices. Concentration inequalities are an important tool in
obtaining bounds on the operating characteristics of some statistical
procedures. New concentration inequalities will be developed which may be
applied in linear models.
