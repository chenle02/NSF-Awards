9400417 Golding The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at
Michigan State University provides a focal point for long-range university-based
research on materials and devices that have high potential for application in
automotive sensing systems. The MRSEC contains two strongly focused
interdisciplinary research groups. The group investigating chemically tailored
materials for automobile control and diagnostics integrates efforts in
chemistry, physics and engineering to develop chemically tailored materials that
can provide engineers with new devices and techniques for the development of
improved automobiles. The research targets specific sensing applications related
to engine performance, which is largely determined by the fuel composition
entering the engine and its turbulent mixing in the cylinder. A newly developed
technique, LIPA (laser induced photochemical anemometry) is used to provide
real-time maps of cylinder gas flows in test chambers or actual engines. The
group investigating materials used for physical sensing in automobiles
concentrates their studies on materials that are rugged, perform well in
extremely variable and harsh conditions, and can be manufactured reliably and
efficiently. The MRSEC supports a variety of shared facilities including a
lithographic facility, space and services in a chemistry laser laboratory, space
in the engine research and turbulent mixing laboratories, and the engineering
research laboratories for film growth and fabrication. There is active
industrial collaboration with Ford and General Motors. Educational plans for the
MRSEC involve K-12 students in urban and rural schools, science and engineering
undergraduates on campus, and interdisciplinary research participation by
advanced degree candidates. The center currently supports 13 senior
investigators, 2 postdocto ral research associates, 2 technical staff members,
12 graduate students, and 4 undergraduates. The MRSEC is directed by Professor
Brage Golding. ***
