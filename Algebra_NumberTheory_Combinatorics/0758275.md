The proposer aims to study various aspects of algebraic varieties. The first
part intends to establish a geometrically meaningful compactification of the
moduli of algebraic varieties, especially for varieties of general type. A key
problem is to understand the appropriate local deformation theory for varieties
whose canonical sheaf is not locally free. The other parts focus on various
special classes of algebraic varieties. Rationally connected varieties are the
simplest algebraic varieties from many points of view, but their behavior over
finite fields is still very poorly understood. The proposer aims to find on them
rational curves defined over finite fields. As an extension of his earlier work
on circle actions on links of singularities, the proposer will study how to
compute the integral homology of links by giving a geometric explanation to the
conjectures of Orlik.

In order to specify a sphere, one just needs to know 1 number: its radius. For
an ellipsoid, one needs to specify 3 numbers: the lengths of the 3 semi axes.
The theory of moduli of algebraic varieties aims to establish a similar pattern
for more complicated geometric objects that can be described by algebraic
equations. The proposer aims to study this question in general. The first
question is to describe the necessary parameters, how many one needs and how
these parameters relate to the underlying geometry. The main part of the
proposed research aims to understand the geometric transitions that occur when
one or more of the parameters become very large. For many applications, these
are the most interesting phenomena related to moduli theory.
