To study the formation and early development of planets around other stars
(known as "exoplanets"), this program will measure the properties of infant
exoplanets. Using new ways to make astronomical images at the world's largest
and most sensitive infrared wavelength telescope--the Large Binocular Telescope
at Mt. Graham, Arizona--this program will look at specific characteristics not
studied by other scientific programs that image exoplanets. These planned
observations can detect younger planets located very close to their host stars.
The observations will constrain the processes that form giant planets, and will
provide pictures of planets in their infancy. The Principal Investigator will
incorporate the results into public lectures in Tucson and into teaching
materials. University students will be involved with all aspects of the
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unusual and highly beneficial aspect of the
proposed work is the ability to probe simultaneously at high resolution
exoplanets and the environments in which they are forming. The investigators
will use non-redundant masking interferometry coupled with adaptive optics on
the telescope, which allows observations close to or within the diffraction
limit of their telescope system. Non-redundant masking provides high precision
measurements, and when used behind an adaptive optics system, can reach faint
targets and companions with contrast. This will provide information on the
boundary conditions for planet formation, including initial composition, while
at the same time constrain how planets are assembled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
