Dr. Melvin I. Dyer, of the University of Georgia, will spend his 15-month Mid-
Career Fellowship in Environmental Biology tenure at Kansas State University,
applying NASA's geographical information system known as FIFE (or First ISLSCP
Field Experiment) and its related satellite- and aircraft-based remote sensing
imagery to study ecological phenomena induced by mammalian grazing at the Konza
Prairie Research Natural Area, a Long-Term Ecological Research site. The goal of
the work is to identify grazer influences on local ecosystem processes, and then
to "scale-up" these influences to whole-site descriptions and even larger
regional landscape scales. Such work is of high priority for achieving
understanding of the determinants and effects of regional and global change
problems. Research will include an aspect of training which entails a month-long
residency at the University of Munich, Germany.
