ABSTRACT -- III-9320416 Orozco The proposed research focuses on a combined
analytical and experimental investigation into the possibility of the use of
metal foams as heat transfer enhancement devices. Experimental facilities have
been designed and fabricated to conduct the research and a third facility is in
the design stage. The theoretical portion of the investigation has focused on
the development of an analytical model of film boiling and condensation. The
proposal focuses on a new type of material that shows great potential for use in
augmentation applications in convection, boiling, and condensation.
