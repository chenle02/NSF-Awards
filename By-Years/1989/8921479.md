This project supports an anthropological study which will try to explain the
common statistical finding that female school attendance reduces the risk to
child survival in developing countries. Through a combination of methods in a
small town in a rural area of Mexico, (community surveys, tests of maternal
literacy, structured observations of mother-child interaction, archival
materials on child health and mother's education, participant observation) the
project will try to understand what factors in a mother's schooling translate
into better child care. This project is important because variation in
children's health is significant in the developing world, and better
understanding of what factors reduce risks to health can help policy makers
design programs to increase child health across the population.
