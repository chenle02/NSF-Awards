This project is to construct a convection tank filled with a fluid such as corn
syrup whose viscosity is very sensitive to temperature variations. It is to be
bounded below by a flat glass surface at constant temperature and bounded above
by a thin layer of relatively low viscosity immiscible fluid such as silicon oil
or kerosine. Above that layer is a flat glass surface at a constant colder
temperature than below. The breadth of the tank is to be at least five times the
depth so that many cells with large aspect ratio are possible. It is desired to
attain as high a Rayleigh number as possible within the physical limitations of
the fluids and tank. With this one can attain up to 20 cm depth of test fluid
that will lead to a Rayleigh number in excess of a million. We anticipate that
the above configuration will exhibit convection closer to that believed to exist
in the mantle, with columnar thermals of hot fluid rising from the bottom
boundary layer and with more sheetlike cold thermals descending from the top.
