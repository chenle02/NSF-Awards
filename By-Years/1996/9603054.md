INT 9603054 Gruendler This U.S-Slovak mathematics research project between Dr.
Joseph Gruendler of North Carolina A&amp;T State University and Dr. Michal
Feckan of Comenius University will feature an examination of chaos in
differential equations with a homoclinic orbit. Together, the researchers intend
to extend their collaboration to work on equations with a center manifold in
finite and infinite dimensions. In doing so, the corresponding scales of Banach
spaces techniques of Vanderbauwhede will be applied. Results for the finite-
dimensional dynamical systems are expected to be applicable to elastic beam
vibrations. This mathematics project fulfills the program objectives of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence. ??
