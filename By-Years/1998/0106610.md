This proposal requests support for a meeting on basic and applied aspects of
fish bioacoustics to be held in mid-2001 in Chicago. There are investigators
interested in basic issues of fish bioacoustics ( hearing, sound production,
etc.), others interested in use of sound to assay fish populations, and still
others are interested in the effects of intense sound on fish behavior and the
potential use of sound to control fish behavior. However, there has been very
little interaction or collaboration among these investigators. Each of these
groups has unique knowledge and approaches to questions, and these investigators
and their fields would benefit from interactions. Thus, the purpose of the
proposed meeting is to bring together investigators interested in all basic and
applied aspects of fish biocacoustics to present material, share ideas, and most
importantly, learn from, and develop an understanding of, the questions and
approaches taken by one another. The conference is designed to foster these
interactions and help investigators with widely different research interests get
to know one another. Long-term goals of the conference are to educate those in
the field who don't normally interact professionally, and to help establish
collaborations among investigators across disciplines and research fields
