The equipment purchased (thermal cycler, a tissue culture enclose and a
microcentrifuge) supports the use of PCR technology in a variety of laboratory
classes recently introduced within a newly instituted B.S. degree program in
Molecular Biology and Biotechnology. The program provides a link between the
worlds of research and secondary education. Classes affected include Genetics,
Biotechnology I and II and Immunology.
