Professor Hart will carry out numerical and theoretical modeling, as well as
further laboratory experiments, on the transition between various ordered and
chaotic states in a two- layer baroclinic rotating fluid. The numerical modeling
will address the extensive laboratory data sets on transitions between steady,
periodic, and chaotic (aperiodic) types of motion arising from baroclinic
instability on the f-plane, as well as on the polar B-plane. Of particular
interest is the role of the rigid sidewall boundary condition in the transition
process. Its presence leads to a horizontal shear of the basic flow, a
modification to the basic eigenfunctions of the linear free-slip problem, and
the possibility of flow separation. Theoretical and experimental studies will
focus on the processes that may destabilize the simple steady and vacillatory
regimes that are observed in laboratory experiments, and which are successfully
predicted by low-order (and/or weakly nonlinear) quasi-geostrophic theory. In
addition to the role of the viscous sidewall, two potentially destabilizing
mechanisms of interest in atmospheric and ocean sciences are periodic and
topographic forcing. The action of these physical effects on the B-plane finite-
amplitude baroclinic instability problem will be investigated through the use of
laboratory and numerical models.//
