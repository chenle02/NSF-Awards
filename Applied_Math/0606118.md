A systematic study of optimal control problems for anisotropic electromagnetic
media will be conducted. This project will focus on boundary controllability and
internal controllability as well as stabilizability. The evolution of the
electromagnetic field in a medium is governed by Maxwell's equations. These
equations relate the two electric field quantities, the displacement and the
electric field intensity, and the two magnetic field quantities, the magnetic
induction and the magnetic field intensity. A medium is electrically anisotropic
if the two electric field quantities point in different directions. The
mathematical analysis of the anisotropic Maxwell equations poses a number of
challenging problems. Contrary to the isotropic case, when the electric
quantities and the magnetic quantities point into the same direction, Maxwell's
equations cannot be reduced to the second order linear wave equation. Maxwell's
equations form a first order system of partial differential equations. Closely
connected with the study of optimal control properties is an ill-posed Cauchy
problem. Another objective of this project is the investigation of ill-posed
Cauchy problems for elliptic first order systems of partial differential
equations.

Problems arising optimal control are both mathematically challenging and of
practical relevance. For example, in the boundary control problem, the goal is
to construct a current flux in the boundary of the medium that will drive the
electromagnetic field to a desired target state. The significance of this
project lies in the importance of anisotropic electromagnetic materials.
Practically all metals and composite materials used in the production of
microchips are anisotropic materials. Further examples include synthetic
sapphire and some ceramics such as piezoelectric materials, which give off a
measurable electrical discharge when acted upon by a mechanical force and
stretch or bend when subjected to an electrical current. Most of the research
conducted will also be relevant to other systems of mathematical physics such as
the system of anisotropic elasticity, a problem of great importance in
geophysics.
