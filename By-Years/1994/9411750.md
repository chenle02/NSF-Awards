This project, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode, is a
preliminary exploration of autonomous cable-suspended mobile manipulators and
platforms. While there has been some work on automated cranes, there is a need
to develop a systematic approach to achieving a fundamental understanding of the
dynamics of such a setup, for potential uses in construction and other field
robotics settings, as well as in heavy manufacturing. The problems are
nontrivial, and this initial exploration will help to develop a convincing case
for a full-scale research effort in the future. The preliminary study will yield
an experimental testbed and preliminary results that should give the
investigators a better idea of what should be involved in a more systematic plan
of attack for developing position and orientation control of suspended
platforms.
