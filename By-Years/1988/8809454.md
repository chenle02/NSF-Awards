These experiments will probe neurotransmitter plasticity in cholinergic
neurons. The longterm goals of this research are to understand the cell lineage
decisions involved in aspects of neural crest cell differentiation. The
preliminary results have shown that cholinergic neurons derived from the ciliary
ganglion can acquire adrenergic properties when transplanted into the trunk
somites. This research will extend and further characterize this observation and
will examine the phenotypic plasticity of other types of neurons. The
experimental paradigm utilizes a new cell marking technique for selectively
labeling neurons by retrograde transport of flourescent latex microspheres.
After labeling, the neurons will then be microinjected onto neural crest
pathways in different regions of the embryo using an injection technique
developed in this laboratory. In this way, it is possible to introduce cells
into either normal or ectopic sites at a variety of developmental stages.
