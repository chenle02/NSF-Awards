The objectives of this study are to describe the scope and character of
engineering research and establish its significance to the nation's goals, and
to determine the role that engineering research is playing in advancing the
nation's productivity and maintaining its international competitiveness. Issues
that determine the health of the engineering disciplines, particularly in
academia, are identified. The study also identifies and highlights especially
active or emerging areas of engineering research that need early attention in
achieving national goals and international competitiveness. The project
determines if difficulties exist with the methods by which engineering research
is sponsored and stimulated, and determines incentives and procedures for
attracting the best young minds to graduate schools of engineering research.
Policy issues that need to be addressed regarding the conduct of the Federal
Government's activities in support of engineering research are identified by
examining the engineering research activities of concerned Federal Government
agencies (NSF, ONR, AFOSR, ARO, DOE, NASA, DARPA, etc.). Methods that can be
used to alleviate perceived problems are defined.
