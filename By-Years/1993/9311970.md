The Transducers '93 conference to be held in Yokohama, Japan is the continuation
of one of the most prestigious international conferences in the important areas
of MEMS, sensors, and actuators. This proposal is for funds to be used to assist
US academic researchers (particularly graduate students) with travel funds to
attend the Transducers '93 conference. Exposure of these students to the
international MEMS community is essential at this critical point of the
technology's development when increasing Japanese and European efforts in this
area threaten to position these communities to exploit this important technology
better than US companies. Student attendance at this conference will foster US-
International ties and increase US awareness of advanced in the technology by
the Japanese and European communities. ARPA are providing $20,000 through a MIPR
agreement to support this grant.
