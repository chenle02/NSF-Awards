This award supports Ronald Giachetti, a graduate student of Professor Robert
Young at North Carolina State University (NCSU), to spend six months carrying
out research at the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering of
the Technical University of Aachen, Germany, where the expertise and facilities
will greatly enhance his doctoral dissertation work. The goal of Mr. Young's
research (and that of the participating U.S. and German research groups) is to
design an approach to satisfy the huge information management requirements of
concurrent engineering. In particular, he is focusing on an approach for uniting
two different types of data management systems: the object-oriented database and
the constraint-based processing system. The Technical University of Aachen is in
the process of developing a large system to implement such an approach, building
on the German research group's expertise in object-oriented databases and their
application to the challenge of concurrent engineering. The research group at
NCSU headed by Professor Paul Young has developed substantial expertise in
constraint technology. Professor Young is currently spending a sabbatical visit
working with the German group. This award will enable Mr. Giachetti, a very
promising U.S. graduate student, to join him and gain valuable professional and
international experience. Concurrent engineering involves the simultaneous
consideration of the `life-cycle functions` of a product during the design
phase. The goal is to improve the design, reduce the cost of the product and
shorten the time to market. Each of these stages involves tremendous amounts of
information and, often, different or even conflicting goals. Managing this
enormous amount and variety of information is one of the main problems in
implementing concurrent engineering. This proposal addresses these information
requirements with an approach that combines state-of-the-art expertise from the
U.S. and Germany.
