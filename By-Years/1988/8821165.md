This research will formulate quantitative models that integrate equilibrium
models of exchange rates -- based on real disturbances in dynamic, stochastic,
general-equilibrium models with flexible prices -- with real business cycle
models -- dynamic stochastic models of the effects of real disturbances on
macroeconomic aggregates. It will involve the use of numerical methods to solve
models with parameters taken from historical data and microeconomic studies, and
to determine the properties of these models, their sensitivity to parameter
values, and their implications. The research will also study the use of
nonlinear statistical representations of exogenous disturbances. The results
will improve our understanding of the effects of real disturbances on exchange
rates, add new testable implications of dynamic general-equilibrium
macroeconomic models for open- economy variables such as the trade balance,
terms of trade, and relative price of non-traded goods, add to our knowledge of
the international transmission of exogenous disturbances and of government
policies, especially fiscal and international-trade policies, and improve our
understanding of the roles of sector- specific versus nation-specific
disturbances in aggregate fluctuations and of the effects of alternative
exchange-rate systems on macroeconomic and international-trade performance.
