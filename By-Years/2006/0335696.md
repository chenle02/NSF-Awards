Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QEM STEM Leadership Development Project for Tribal
Colleges and Universities &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Quality Education for
Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting a three-year grant from the
&lt;br/&gt;National Science Foundation in support of leadership development in
Science, Technology, &lt;br/&gt;Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at the
Nation.s Tribal Colleges. QEM.s proposed project is &lt;br/&gt;designed to
further the goals of the Foundation.s Tribal Colleges and Universities Program
(TCUP). &lt;br/&gt;Due to the special circumstances and needs of Tribal
Colleges, the proposed project.s activities &lt;br/&gt;focus on the Tribal
Colleges. However, all institutions eligible for TCUP will be invited to
participate &lt;br/&gt;in project activities. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;QEM.s STEM Leadership Development
Project will provide Proposal Development Workshops for &lt;br/&gt;prospective
TCUP applicants as well as Project Management Institutes to support current
multi-&lt;br/&gt;year grant recipients with project implementation. Professional
development activities for Tribal &lt;br/&gt;College faculty and a Visiting
Faculty Program will stimulate faculty growth and expand STEM
&lt;br/&gt;teaching capacity. Materials to be produced include a "Best
Practices" manual and a monograph &lt;br/&gt;on scholarly productivity.
Collectively, these activities provide an intensive level of support for Tribal
&lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities that support the goals of the TCUP program.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact &lt;br/&gt;The proposed STEM leadership
development activities are designed to help increase the quantity &lt;br/&gt;and
quality of TCUP proposals submitted by Tribal Colleges, and participating Alaska
Native and &lt;br/&gt;Native Hawaiian institutions. The project implementation
and professional development activities &lt;br/&gt;will benefit participants
well beyond the life of the grant through resource development and the
&lt;br/&gt;enhancement of STEM faculty. Since TCUP grants address substantive
educational areas such as &lt;br/&gt;faculty development, curriculum
enhancement, and undergraduate training and research &lt;br/&gt;experiences,
this project has the potential for considerable impact on STEM educational
&lt;br/&gt;experiences for Native American students nationwide. &lt;br/&gt;
