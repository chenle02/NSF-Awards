The ultimate goal of this research is to enable an engineer to completely
analyze problems to a prescribed level of accuracy at the push of a button. In
moving towards automated finite element analysis, it is necessary to subdivide
the geometry of an object into a valid finite element mesh. This effort will:
(1) investigate efficient adaptive, three-dimensional mesh control devices via a
solid modelling representation known as an octree, and (2) provide error
estimates.
