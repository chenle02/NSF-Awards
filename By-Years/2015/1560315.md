This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new
REU site focuses on cybersecurity at Wright State University. Each summer,
students will work with experienced faculty mentors state-of-the-art facilities
and emerging tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and
important. The challenges of cybersecurity research provide an exciting
opportunity for students to investigate fundamental principles and strategies to
develop real-world, secure systems that we can all trust. This project is co-
funded by the Cyber Corps (R): Scholarship for Service Program.

The project is led by an outstanding team offering modern facilities and
professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related
to cybersecurity. The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate
students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The
team will also seek to include veterans who are returning to pursue computing
degrees The students will participate in research and professional development
activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating
undergraduate students in computer fields, recruiting students from groups
traditionally under-represented in computing fields, developing students'
confidence and capabilities of conducting independent research, and motivating
students to pursue graduate programs.
