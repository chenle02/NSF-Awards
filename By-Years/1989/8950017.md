Appropriate use of the computers in the classroom with commercially available
programs improves the students understanding of mathematical concepts by
transforming complex equations into visual graphics and numerical examples. The
presenters have been using this technology for several years with great success.
A week long summer workshop is being held in the summer of 1989 for other
instructors from colleges and universities in the Southeastern Region. The
presenters are describing how to install computers in the classroom and how to
design computer enhanced lessons. It is anticipated that when the instructors
return home and the benefits of their techniques become clear, their colleagues
will also become involved in the implementation of the computer bases approach.
An electronic mail bulletin board for Computer Based Mathematics Education is
being established to share information among workshop participants and other
interested mathematicians. The colleges and universities of the participants are
also contributing to the program through support of the faculty who will attend.
