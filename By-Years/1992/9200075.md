This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. Beginning in 1992, twelve undergraduate students will spend ten
weeks each summer engaged in basic research under the direction of the faculty
members in the Chemistry Department. The focus of the REU project is to
stimulate an increase in the number of students pursuing research-oriented
careers in science, by reaching out to new populations of students, both outside
and inside the University, to provide the benefits of undergraduate research
experience, to inform students of the potential that chemistry holds as a
career, and to aid in their realization of full scientific potential. The
program includes ten weeks of research, academic credit, a seminar series,
housing, travel funds and social activities. The research projects of the
fourteen participating faculty span a wide range that includes organic and
inorganic synthesis, kinetic and mechanistic studies, computational chemistry,
analytical instrument design, environmental analytical chemistry,
crystallization methods, solid-state chemistry, and electrochemistry.
