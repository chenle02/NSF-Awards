The Center for Education's Board on Science Education (BOSE) of the National
Academies will plan and host a one-day planning meeting to examine the status of
research on learning science within informal education settings. This planning
meeting will help leaders in the field of informal learning think about the
current state of research and evaluation and help them conceptualize a synthesis
study on research in informal learning settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
