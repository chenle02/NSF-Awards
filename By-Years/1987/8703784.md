This proposal requests funds to equip a common-use facility of instruments for
research in cell and molecular biology in the Department of Biology. The
instrumentation will greatly enhance the research capabilities of eight new
young researchers who are actively involved in research on developmentally
programmed genomic rearrangements, molecular biology of photosynthesis,
regulation of prokaryotic gene families, genetics of mating type
interconversion, zygote development, and uniparental inheritance, protein
secretion from bacterial cells, and movement of molecules through plant cells
via clathrin-coated vesicles. The instrumentation, which will also be used in
training undergraduate, graduate, and posdoctoral students, will contribute to
the establishment of a center of excellence in cell and molecular biology at
Texas A&amp;M. //
