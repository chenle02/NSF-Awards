9601640 Mao Thin film characterization instruments will be acquired by the
Colorado School of Mines to complement existing thin film deposition facilities.
The new instrumentation includes an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared
spectrophotometer, a computer- controlled surface profilometer, an ellipsometer,
and a Hall effect and thermopower measurement station. These instruments will
support studies on polycrystalline compound semiconductor thin films for
photovoltaic solar cells, transparent conductive oxide thin films, thin metal
oxide barriers on photoconducting films for electrophotography applications,
polymeric thin films, metallic oxide catalysts, and electrogalvanized sheet
steels. %%% The new instruments will strengthen the thin films and coatings
research efforts at the university. The research involves the participation of
students and faculty from several departments through an interdisciplinary
materials science program, and capitalizes on collaborations with the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory. The new instrumentation will also benefit a new
masters degree program that is oriented towards the microelectronics industry.
