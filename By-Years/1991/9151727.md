This project affects laboratories in the areas of thermodynamics, fluid
mechanics and heat transfer. Through these courses students are exposed to the
area of alternative fuels and automotive engineering, and learn to optimize
engine performance and fuel economy. The instruments involved can measure the
concentration of exhaust gases such as CO, C02, 02, NOx and total HC. Students
learn to include environmental constraints throughout the design process, and
also learn important measurement techniques.
