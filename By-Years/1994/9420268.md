9420268 Specker Mammals lactate and birds produce crop sac milk to feed their
young. Fishes are known to guard their young in a nest or to brood them in their
mouth. Dr. Specker's finding of vitellogenin, the precursor for yolk proteins,
in the surface mucus of mouthbrooding cichlids suggests that some fish may be
supplying the young with nutritionally important molecules in addition to
protecting them from predators. She is examining aspects of reproduction in two
species of cichlids that exhibit parental care. The species differ in that one
is a maternal mouthbrooder and the other is a paternal mouthbrooder. The oral
cavity of these fish contains paired pharyngeal glands. She proposes to examine
the biochemistry of secretions from the glands. If it is found that the
pharyngeal glands in mouthbrooding tilapia are secreting highly nutritive
vitellogenins for ingestion by the offspring, then a major step toward changing
the conventional wisdom about the evolutionary significance of parental care in
this class of vertebrates may occur. Such biochemical and physiological
contributions would provoke additional debate about the evolution and
endocrinology of larval-parental relationships. ***
