Dr. Daniel L. Akins and other members of the Chemistry Department at City
College of CUNY are being supported by the Division of Chemistry to establish a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period
1997-99, eight undergraduate students will spend twelve weeks each summer
actively engaged in basic research projects within the Center for Analysis of
Structures and Interfaces, an NSF-supported Minority Research Center of
Excellence. The research is suitable for students majoring in chemistry,
physics, or chemical or electrical engineering. Recruitment efforts are nation-
wide, with particular attention given to large urban universities with
significant minority student population.
