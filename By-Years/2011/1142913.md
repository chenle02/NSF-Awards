This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
current barrier to performing extensive drug screening on primary cells.
Pharmaceutical researchers have long desired to screen drugs on primary cells
because they are freshly obtained from human or animal tissue and are considered
to have drug responses similar to cells in the human body. However, primary cell
samples are highly limited in cell number, and conventional assay technology
(based on microtiter plates) does not have the degree of miniaturization needed
to reduce cell usage to levels that enable extensive drug screening. This
project?s objective is to develop novel ultraminiaturized assays using
microfluidics that will allow high throughput drug screening on primary cells
and traditional cell lines.

The broader/commercial impacts of this research are both immediate and long-
term. Because primary cells are more biologically relevant than currently used
cell lines, adoption of the technology by the pharmaceutical industry will
improve their ability to identify drug candidates that are more likely to be
effective in humans and hence successful in clinical trials. This can reduce the
cost and risk associated with new drug development. Academic researchers can
also benefit greatly from using the technology to characterize precious or
difficult to culture cells, thus helping advance our scientific understanding of
biology in the long term. Finally, the miniaturization will result in
significant cost savings for academic and industrial clients stemming from
reduced usage of expensive biochemical reagents.
