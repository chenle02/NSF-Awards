9406740 Grodzicker Study of the biological bases of learning and memory is among
the most exciting fields in neuroscience. Progress is currently very rapid,
particularly at molecular, cellular and neural systems levels. Commonalities of
mechanisms appear to be emerging from studies of gene expression, synaptic
plasticity (LTP and LTD) and processes of memory storage in invertebrate and
vertebrate systems. This meeting is planned to bring together major laboratories
and practitioners in the field of learning and memory at molecular, cellular,
systems and behavioral levels. The participation of younger scientists will be
encouraged.
