9307666 Abrams The project will investigate the use of existing analytical
models for determining nonlinear dynamic response of precast concrete frame
systems with ductile connections. Computational models developed previously
within the PRESSS program will be verified by correlating computed response with
measured response of three reduced scale structures. Each of the reduced scale
frame systems will be constructed using frame connection details derived from
full scale PRESSS experiments. Test structures will be subjected to an array of
light, moderate and strong simulated earthquake motions using the Illinois
shaking table. Hysteresis relations for reduced scale frame connections will be
characterized for input to computational models based on results of a
supplemental series of proposed static tests. In addition to verifying numerical
models, dynamic response of the physical models will be used to suggest
simplified analytical procedures for calculating dynamic response. Results of
these simplified procedures will then be correlated with response computed with
more complex models for verification. In addition, response computed using
simplified models will be correlated with measured dynamic response of an actual
precast frame building subjected to an earthquake. Once developed, the
simplified analytical methods will be used to examine system response for
various frame systems in different U.S. seismic zones with different site
characteristics. This study will be h) 0*0*0* done with the purpose of
extrapolating large scale component test data to design of frame structural
systems across the nation. ***
