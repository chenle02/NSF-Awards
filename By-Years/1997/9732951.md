9732951 Bush This Career Proposal combines an exciting field research program
and innovative educational program focused on lowland tropical forests of
Amazonia. These ecosystems have long been of interest to ecologists and
conservation biologists but relatively little information is available on the
temporal patterns of biodiversity. Recent evidence suggests profound changes
have taken place in these lowland forests during the last 7,000 years and Dr.
Bush will focus on this problem. Using cores from mid-Holocene-aged lakes in
Amazonia, he will record changes over the last 7,000 years in forest diversity,
as evidenced through pollen composition at different strata in the cores. Using
other characteristics of these cores such as charcoal, paleomagnetic, and bulk
density he will attempt to reconstruct paleoclimate histories for this region.
Based on the careful selection of sites, it is anticipated that this research
will be able to evaluate the impact of human populations over the past 7,000
years on biodiversity of lowland tropical forests of Amazonia. Professor Bush
has already demonstrated a marked commitment to undergraduate education by his
recently published textbook "Ecology of a Changing Planet." Through this Career
Proposal he will expand on the ideas in that book, integrating real-life
experiences from his research program into courses currently being designed. In
particular his plans include use of geographic information systems to allow
students a closer look at landscape level changes and their impact on
biodiversity.
