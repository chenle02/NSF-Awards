The objective of this project is to give our students experience with state-of-
the-art computer equipment and to increase their familiarity with quantitative
physics. To address these issues, we have equipped our physics laboratory with
12 computer-interfaced data acquisition stations to be used with traditional
laboratory equipment for measurements of heat, light, sound, electricity,
magnetism and motion. These data acquisition systems, supported by the
appropriate software, are capable of data storage, analysis, manipulation and
retrieval and are therefore more advanced than the traditional methods used to
perform analysis of physics data. Also, the simulation capabilities of the
computer are being exploited for visualization of equations as well as the
modeling of physical systems. Mastery of this equipment provides the students
with backgrounds for understanding the operation principles of other types of
equipment using the sensor/transducer/amplifier/recorder component series. The
simulation experience helps students bridge the conceptual gap between theory
and experiment and it is hoped that this process will lead the student to an
increase in critical thinking regarding phenomena in the physical world.
