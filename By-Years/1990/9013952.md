The LSU group will continue operation of their sensitive cryogenic bar gravity
wave antenna, running in coincidence with other operational detectors worldwide.
Data collected will be analyzed to set limits on the flux of gravitational waves
bathing the Earth. In addition, improvements to transducers and amplifiers will
be carried out to further increase the sensitivity of this detector. Some small-
scale studies will explore alternatives for a more advanced cryogenic receiver.
