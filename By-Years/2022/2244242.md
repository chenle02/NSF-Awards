This is a renewal of a 10-week summer REU (Research Experiences for
Undergraduates) Site program serving 8 student interns per year at the
University of California-Berkeley SETI Research Center (BSRC). Research topics
are drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, electrical and mechanical engineering,
and computational science and unified under the aegis of Breakthrough Listen, a
10-year, $100 million project to dramatically expand the search for intelligent
life beyond Earth. Participants will attend weekly one-hour lunch meetings that
will address communication and outreach skills, job prospects, interview skills,
and strategies for research success, including the mitigation of stereotype
threat and imposter syndrome. The project has an external assessment program for
continuous monitoring and evaluation of project milestones, including regular
feedback from the evaluation study on the extent to which the project is meeting
its goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will recruit participants from
minority serving institutions (MSI) nationwide and will strengthen connections
to the California Community College system, including Berkeley City College and
Laney College in Oakland. They will actively recruit women, first generation
college students, and underrepresented minorities (URM). Applications will be
considered holistically, giving appropriate emphasis to enthusiasm and
dedication rather than judging on GPA alone. The project will make efforts to
ensure that interns feel welcome and integrated into the BSRC
team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
