This award supports student travel to the Numerical Relativity and Data Analysis
Conference (NRDA 2008) held at Syracuse University, August 11 - 14, 2008. The
focus of the NRDA 2008 conference will be gravitational-wave science of binaries
consisting of compact objects (black holes and neutron stars) in ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. Topics that will be covered include: black hole
simulations, searches for gravitational waves from bursts, compact binaries and
ringdowns, simulations of neutron star-black hole and double neutron star
binaries, errors, calibration and accuracies in detection and parameter
estimation, comparison of post-Newtonian theory with results from results from
numerical relativity and a summary of the status of the Numerical INJection
Analysis (NINJA) project.
