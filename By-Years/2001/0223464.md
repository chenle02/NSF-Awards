This project involves a three-year research program to study the exchanges of
carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, and the
processes that govern them. Spatial and temporal variations of isotopic tracers
in the atmosphere that contain information about the sources and sinks of carbon
dioxide are being investigated. The effort involves the use of the Simple
Biosphere model that describes these processes on land and has been successful
at predicting variations in carbon dioxide on local, regional, and global scales
when coupled to an atmospheric model. New inversion methods to estimate carbon
fluxes are being developed and tested using synthetic data produced by the
Community Climate System Mode at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
The sensitivity to transport is being investigated using a suite of transport
model response functions produced in a model intercomparison study.
