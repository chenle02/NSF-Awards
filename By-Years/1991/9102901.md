Foreign policy decisions are influenced to a considerable extent by the nature
of the information available to the decision maker and by the way that
information is analyzed and processed. A long tradition of previous research
demonstrates that the way decisions makers perceive and respond to information
depends significantly on their prior beliefs. To date, however, the complexity
of these beliefs has made them very difficult to study systematically using
standard empirical methods. This project uses computational modeling techniques,
including expert system technology, to more systematically examine the impact of
complex belief systems on the processing of foreign policy information.
Specifically, this research continues development of a large expert system
model, called POLI, of U.S. foreign policy making in Asia. Prior work with this
model has focussed on the 1950s and has proven highly successful in reproducing
U.S. responses to Asia during that decade. This project will attempt to validate
and refine the model by extending its analysis of foreign policy in Asia from
1960 through the present. When completed this project not only should provide a
better understanding of the processes through which U.S. foreign policy is made
but should provide a powerful tool that can be used by policy makers to improve
decision making.
