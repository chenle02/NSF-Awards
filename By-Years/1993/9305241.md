The NSF-owned Research Vessel OCEANUS, operated under a charter party agreement
by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, has operated continuously for 17
years. The average projected life of a research vessel is 30 years. This project
will make major modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the
second half of her operational life. The viability of an oceanographic research
vessel to conduct the changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with
time. The modifications and upgrades will modernize the OCEANUS and equip her to
be as effective and reliable as when she was originally delivered for service in
1975. The improvements focus on three major areas. Improvements to increase and
enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean science research; upgrades to
improve the day to day operation and maintainability of the ship; and
refinements to improve the habitability of the ship. Attention to all these
areas will result in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing
tradition of good service to the community of ocean science research.
