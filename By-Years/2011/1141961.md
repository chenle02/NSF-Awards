The dayside magnetosphere plays a crucial role in controlling the mass and
energy in-flow from the solar wind (ionized plasma blown from the Sun). NASA's
THEMIS spacecraft were launched into favorable orbits to study the interaction
of solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. These spacecraft are often
positioned so that geomagnetic field lines connect them to the upper atmospheric
regions in view of the ground-based observing stations. Relating the satellite
data to their auroral footprints has revolutionized abilities to study dynamic
processes in the solar wind and geospace. During winter times the high-latitude
regions can be permanently in dark permitting optical observations of the aurora
even at magnetic midday. As two-dimensional dynamic images of the aurora are
signatures of plasma processes operating on the flux tube at some distance above
the Earth, the joint studies of the THEMIS plasma data and optical instruments
deployed at the South Pole and Automatic Geophysical Observatories in the
Antarctic provide a unique opportunity to answer four specific questions: (1) Do
existing geomagnetic field models accurately map the dayside magnetospheric
boundaries? (2) Are the dayside soft aurora "footprints" of the magnetospheric
cusp and whether they occur on open field lines? (3) When do latitudinal motions
of the dayside aurora represent in-out motion of the Earth's magnetopause? (4)
What is the mechanism responsible for the production of the frequently observed
Poleward Moving Auroral Forms? The Antarctic optical observations provide a
high-resolution dynamic view of the auroral context related to the in situ
satellite measurements; such coordinated data exists from the austral winter of
2007 to today. This research also contributes to the training and education of
both the graduate and undergraduate students.
