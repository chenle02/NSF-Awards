Numerical modeling tools have been used in the liquid crystal arena for several
years. They are typically used interactively to explore effects and to optimize
the performance of devices with respect to controllable material and device
parameters. Until recently, satisfactory results could be achieved by using one-
dimensional (1-D) models, which treat the transverse dimensions of the
structures as infinite and uniform. Current developments (smaller feature sizes,
new technologies) are forcing more realistic 2-D and 3-D modeling. The numerical
algorithms utilized in current modeling tools require several minutes on
contemporary platforms to analyze a 2-D device; for 3-D, they take several
hours. Significant improvements in the numerical approaches are needed to
produce acceptable performance in these higher dimensional settings. The
principal investigator will work with device-modeling physicists and experts in
the applied mathematics and numerical analysis communities to adapt and develop
the advanced numerical methods necessary to model realistic optical devices
based upon liquid crystal materials. Modern numerical algorithms hold the
promise of enabling 3-D modeling in times that are comparable to the current
generation of 1-D tools (seconds). These tools are expected to have a
significant impact on the development of liquid crystal optics technologies.

This project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical
modeling tools for devices based on liquid crystal materials. Liquid crystals
are important in technology because they can be used to control light. Numerous
applications exist (e.g., lap-top and flat-panel displays), and new ones are
being developed, including tablet document readers (e-books, electronic
newspapers) and beam-steering devices (for soft, programmable, non-mechanical
applications in communications and switching). Modern numerical algorithms hold
the promise of enabling full modeling of liquid crystal devices in a matter of
seconds. Such tools will be of immense practical utility and can be expected to
have a big impact in the development of technologies in this and related areas.
