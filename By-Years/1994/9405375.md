9405375 Stott The transition from Paleocene to Eocene time was one of the most
important environmental and biological transitions in Earth history. PI, in
collaboration with European colleagues, will continue to delineate the
Paleocene/Eocene boundary, by its postulated carbon isotope excursion, in
classic marine and non- marine sections. This boundary marks an important
paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic and paleobiologic shift, currently the focus of
interest for a large, international group of investigators. Detailed sampling of
sections in Paris and London basins will be followed by isotopic analyses of
soil carbonates, marine micro- and macrofossils. These data will be correlated
with DSDP Site 550 (and 549), which provides a carbon isotope reference section,
and other classic Paleocene/Eocene sites, e.g., in Wyoming.
