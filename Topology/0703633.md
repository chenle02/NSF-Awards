This project will partially fund a major international conference to be held at
Princeton University June 7-11, 2007. The conference will feature distinguished
speakers from a broad array of fields representing many of the areas that
William Thurston produced major theorems. These fields include 3-dimensional
topology, differential geometry, foliations, contact structures, geometric group
theory, dynamics, computer science and education. This conference will not only
discuss some of the recent dramatic developments in many of these fields but
will introduce graduate students and researchers young and old to various new
fields of mathematics. In addition to the research lectures there will be an
evening public lecture by Jeffrey Weeks titled "Geometry for children of all
ages".

There is a long history in mathematics of important breakthroughs occurring as
a result of ideas from seemingly disparate areas being combined to provide new
insights. Sometimes they arise from the creation of a geometric or physical
context in which the similarities become readily apparent. It is this latter
process that characterizes the revolutionary work of William Thurston over the
last several decades. We expect that this conference will plant seeds for future
synergistic efforts.
