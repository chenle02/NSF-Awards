This award provides funds to help purchase equipment which will improve the
education of undergraduate students, both majors and non-majors, at the
University of Washington in organismic biology, with primary emphasis on courses
focusing on the biology of marine invertebrates. The specific equipment
requested is a modern video microscopy system, including mobile workstation with
two compound and stereo microscopes, high resolution solid-state cameras,
instructor and classroom color monitors, and video cassette recorder. This
equipment will permit all students in the laboratory to participate
simultaneously and interactively in the same microscopy exercises and to address
particular problems by live video presentations. It will also permit storage and
recall of images including those of phenomena that can only rarely be captured.
The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
