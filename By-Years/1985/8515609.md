An exchange of information and perspectives on earthquake engineering between
U.S. and French researchers would be mutually beneficial. Such and exchange will
take place at a workshop to be held in France on February 2-5, 1986. A small
group of invited participants from the U.S. will be joined at the workshop by
French researchers and engineers representing diverse organizations engaged in
seismic research. The workshop will consist of state-of-the-art sessions where
surveys will be presented, reports on research activities in the U.S. and France
will be made, and discussions on quality guidelines for earthquake engineering
will be held. The workshop will provide a basis for both countries to assess
their research programs in earthquake engineering and to develop future research
plans.
