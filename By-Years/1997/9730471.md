9730471 Dickey Renewed support is provided for the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM)
project. The BTM project deploys and maintains for community use, a deep-sea
mooring which is available for long-term testing of oceanographic sensors and
systems. The project is has three major complementary facets: 1) technology
development, 2) facilitation of the BTM for other groups developing and testing
new technologies, and 3) scientific studies. The premise is that newly developed
technology and instrumentation should be synergistic with scientific
applications. Interdisciplinary time-series data collected from the mooring may
be compared, calibrated, and interpreted using comprehensive shipboard data sets
routinely collected near the site. Many of the sensors and systems developed and
tested on the BTM will be suitable for deployment on other platforms such as
drifters, autonomous underwater vehicles, and offshore structures. BTM is
deployed near the Bermuda Time Series (BATS) station, a site that has been
sampled continuously for over 15 years and provides a rich historic data base at
the location. The mooring was first deployed in June, 1994 and has been used by
a variety of scientists since its first deployment, as evidenced by numerous
letters of support. In addition to maintaining the mooring as a testbed
facility, two new instrument systems, SAFIRE and HiROS will be tested. SAFIRE
measures spectral fluorescence and absorption and will be useful for optically
characterizing and discriminating particulate components and dissolved organic
constituents. The HiROS system will allow high resolution characterization and
quantification of inherent optical properties. A new real-time data telemetry
system under development will be tested as well. The PIs will continue to
solicit new BTM users, to facilitate the usage of the BTM for all investigators,
and to provide baseline interdisciplinary measurements.
