The research will focus on the determination of physical characteristics of
asphalt cement including viscosity, penetration, and ductility. The chemical
composition will be determined by using a high pressure gel permeation
chromatography. The objective is to determine whether the physical properties of
the asphalt cement from a selected source vary with times. The results will
provide valuable data on the variability of asphalt cements supplied from a
given source and the effect on asphaltic concrete mixtures.
