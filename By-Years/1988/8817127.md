The research addresses the effects of fluorine on alkali diffusion in alkali
feldspar. It is expected that fluorine will substitute readily for oxygen in the
feldspar structure disrupting the silicate framework and introducing vacancies
in the cation istes, and will thereby increase the rate of alkali diffusion.
Alkali diffusion will be studied over a temperature range of about 500-1000oC
and pressures from 1 bar to 15 kilobars. Early experiments will be anhydrous,
but water will be added later to check the combined effects of the two
volatiles. Results will be analyzed by either electron microprobe or
transmission electron microscopy, as appropriate, to determine the alkali
diffusion rates. The isolated effects of temperature, pressure, and fluorine
fugacity will be measured. The results will be applied to determination of the
time required for specific geologic events to take place.
