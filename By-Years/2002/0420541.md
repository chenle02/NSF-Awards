Title: CREST Center for Forest Ecosystems
Assessment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alabama A&amp;M
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRD - 0420541&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI - Rory
Fraser&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support, Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU)
will establish the Center for Forest Ecosystems Assessment (CFEA). Two major
goals of the Center are to strengthen integrative, multi-disciplinary research
for improved understanding of forest ecosystems, and increase the number of
trained professionals, especially African-Americans, engaged in research,
teaching and management of renewable natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Center will pursue five research subprojects: (1) assess productivity changes in
the response of the herbaceous, shrub, mid-story and over-story layers; (2)
assess the structure and dynamics of a macro invertebrate and a small vertebrate
community after disturbance; (3) assess the effect of disturbances in the
rhizosphere on the nutrient dynamics and their relationship to the flora; (4)
use nuclear and chloroplast DNA markers to determine the extent of inter- and
intra-specific introgression in oak and confirm existence and validity of known
hybrids; and ( 5) address questions about the human actors and social choices
that are influenced by forest ecosystem processes and
policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed
Activity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alabama A&amp;M University CREST Center will
contribute to the knowledge of forest ecosystems by in-depth analysis of
additive and confounding effects of anthropogenic and natural interventions in
the forest. The Center provides an excellent multidisciplinary venue for not
only carrying out pertinent research regarding the impact of disturbance regimes
on biodiversity in forests, but also of the additive and confounding effects of
anthropogenic and natural interventions in ecosystem dynamics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact of the Proposed
Activity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center integrates collaborative research,
curriculum development, student training and mentoring, outreach, collaboration
and program evaluation. The Center will yield an enhanced research base,
enhanced graduate student training, curricula and faculty development, and
development of research facilities and resources through planned synchrony in
multi-disciplinary research and training.&lt;br/&gt;
