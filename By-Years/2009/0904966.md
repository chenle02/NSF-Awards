This award was funded through the Social and Behavioral Dimensions of National
Security, Conflict, and Cooperation competition, a joint venture between NSF and
the Department of Defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenges posed by
insurgencies and the threat of terrorism require a new generation of academic
and professional leaders who embrace a multidisciplinary, cross-boundary
approach. In particular, these future leaders need to develop approaches that
combine security provisions (by U.S. forces and allies), economic development
and political development. A binding constraint on such research has been a lack
of trained young scholars to evaluate interventions and develop theory. This
project will organize and lead a six-day multidisciplinary training workshop on
the political economy of terrorism and insurgency. The workshop will be aimed at
Ph.D. students and early career faculty, but will also include US AID personnel
and officers drawn from the U.S. military. The operating premise for this
workshop is simple and demonstrable: the most fruitful way to communicate new
insights from research on the political economy of terrorism is by engaging the
next generation of researchers in an intense, multidisciplinary learning
environment. The specific goal of the workshop is to equip a cohort of young
researchers and practitioners with the theoretical tools, background, data and
contacts to conduct fresh research on the political economy of terrorism and
insurgency.
