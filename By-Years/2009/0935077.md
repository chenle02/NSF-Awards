This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Purdue University will employ researchers to develop a deeper
understanding of key skills required by future engineers as well as assessment
tools to measure these skills. Service-learning, which presents enormous
pedagogical potential in engineering education, is used as the context of this
study. The major outcome of this project will be a theoretically grounded
understanding of the development of human-centered approaches in design. The
comparison of service-learning experience and other design courses will inform
universities decisions about including service learning opportunities as
curricular or extra-curricular experiences. The results of the project will also
inform design curricula to potentially capitalize on the benefits of the service
learning experience. The findings of this research will have impact across
design education and enhance the ability of faculty to create experiences that
meet the attributes being called for by engineering accreditation boards, the
National Academy of Engineering, and industry leaders in today's global economy.
