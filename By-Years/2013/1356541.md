Ocean-atmosphere scientists have for many years been studying how bubbles in
ocean whitecaps influence the exchange of gases across the air-sea interface.
Bubbles provide greater contact surface area between air and water, and the
over-pressure of gases in submerged bubbles forces their dissolution. Sea spray
droplets likewise increase the effective surface area of the atmosphere-ocean
interface, yet little is known of their role in air-sea gas exchange, or their
effectiveness compared to bubbles. Understanding the exchange of atmospheric
green-house gases such as CO2 into the global ocean is important to global
warming and ocean acidification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use a
microphysical model and knowledge of the rate at which spray droplets are
produced to evaluate the role of sea spray in enhancing air-sea gas exchange,
and compare this to other sea-air gas exchange rates, and mechanisms.
