It is well-established that a wide variety of organisms, including humans, have
internal, biological clocks that are instrumental in allowing them to maintain
synchrony to both daily (i.e. circadian) and annual cycles of environmental
change. Most mammals are exposed, on a daily basis, to environmental cues such
as sunrise and sunset or day/night temperature fluctuations. These cues are used
to synchronize their internal clocks to local environmental time. To understand
the biological time keeping systems used by mammals, Dr. Goldman examines
animals in hibernation. He will determine the hormonal and neural mechanisms
that these animals use to time and coordinate the end of hibernation. Dr.
Goldman's work will provide significant insights into understanding how the
internal clocks continue to function in an environment where the animals remain
sheltered for a significant period from most environmental cues. These results
will increase our understanding of the physiological mechanisms regulating the
maintenance of internal clocks and, therefore, may contribute to the development
of treatments which would reduce the detrimental consequences associated with
jetlag.
