9316314 Klemperer Following the successful completion in the summer of 1992 of a
pilot study (INDEPTH I) of deep seismic profiling in Tibet, the next phase of
the study (INDEPTH II) involves the acquisition and analysis of some 200 km of
deep seismic reflection profile, together with complementary wide-angle and off-
line (sparse 3-D) reflection data, and surface geological information, along a
traverse extending across the northern Tethyan Himalaya, Indus- Tsangpo suture
zone, and Gangdese batholith in southern Tibet. The acquired data will provide
new and possibly fundamental insight into the mechanism by which continental
crust is deformed and thickened within the Himalaya/Tibet plateau collision
zone-the type example of active continent/continent collision on Earth. The
project will be undertaken collaboratively with the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources of China (MGMR) on the principle of equal cost sharing, and
will use an MGMR seismic reflection crew for data acquisition and to provide the
seismic source for wide-angle and off-line recording. On the U.S. side, the
program will involve direct grants to Cornell and Syracuse Universities for
overall project coordination and data acquisition/processing, and to Stanford
University for wide- angle/off-line recording. Investigators from Columbia
University and the State University of New York at Albany will also be involved
in data interpretation, coordination with MGMR, and acquisition of surface
geological data along the transect. ***
