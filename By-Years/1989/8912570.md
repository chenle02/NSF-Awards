An important topic in the general area of engineering design is the optimum
setting of engineering tolerances. The current approaches to setting tolerances
recognize the designers subjective attitudes in specifying such tolerances, but
fail to exploit the formal groundwork for developing a Bayesian scheme for
specifying tolerances and for updating such tolerances in the light of new
information, such as data from a manufacturing process. Thus, the focus of the
proposed work can be viewed as foundational research and impact would result in
improved processes through an improved understanding of fundamental issues.
