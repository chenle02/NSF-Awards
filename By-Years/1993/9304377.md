The uplift and exhumation of high pressure rocks in orogenic zones is a long-
standing problem. A new hypothesis for the uplift and exhumation of blueschists
and eclogites has been developed in this project on the basis of structural
analysis of Late Cretaceous subduction complex in eastern Venezuela. The
observation that these rocks had undergone large extensional strains parallel to
the arcuate trend of the subduction zone and the volcanic arc led to a model in
which oblique plate convergence changes required large arc-parallel extension
and considerable forearc thinning. This renewal will test several aspects of
this new model by dating the deformation sequence and determine the pressure-
temperature history of particularly the lower grade rocks of the complex, and
compare the results to the predictions of the model. Results are expected to
test this possible mechanism of returning high pressure rocks to the earth's
surface.
