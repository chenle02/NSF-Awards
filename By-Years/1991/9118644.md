This project will integrate isotopic, whole-rock major and trace element, and
mineral chemistry data from basalts and xenoliths collected along a 500-km-long
transect across the southern Baikal Rift. The transect extends from Proterozoic-
Paleozoic lithosphere in the southeast across the suture onto the Archean craton
in the northwest. The Baikal Rift offers an excellent opportunity to test two
major hypotheses: 1) whether the spatial and temporal evolution of basalt
geochemistry can be related to interaction of asthenospheric derived melts and
contrasting lithospheric columns across the strike of the rift. 2) Is the
unradiogenic Pb isotopic character of the basalts related to an unradiogenic
sub-Asian OIB mantle source (Allegre et al., 1987) or to widespread crustal
contamination. The project is an outgrowth of the U.S.-U.S.S.R comparative rift
workshop on the Rio Grande and Baikal rifts sponsored jointly by the U.S.
National Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. It will
involve field work as well as extensive chemical analyses to be done at MIT.
