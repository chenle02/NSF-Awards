This project will support the purchase of equipment which will enable
instructors of undergraduate mathematics courses to integrate computer
demonstrations into their lectures. It is being funded under the Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of supporting
projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory
courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation and
Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support for the instrumentation
necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements at U.S. colleges
and universities. In particular, the main objective of this project is to enable
instructors to show more realistic examples and demonstrate the use of the
programs and languages they expect their students to use. The part of the
curriculum targeted for improvement in this project is a group of courses with
an applications emphasis designed for science and engineering majors. The
courses to be affected include differential equations, Fourier analysis, linear
algebra, numerical analysis, linear programming, combinatorics, and number
theory.
