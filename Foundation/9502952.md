Mauldin 9502952 Our project consists of three sections. In the first section we
propose to deal with infinite systems of conformal maps, investigating the
topological and geometric structure of the corresponding limit set. We intend to
study and to compare conformal, invariant, harmonic, Hausdorff and packing
measures in a general setting as well as in the case of some special systems
primarily given by irregular systems, continued fractions with restricted
entries and apollonian packings. We also plan to explore the problem of
conjugacies of such systems, to study random systems and invariant continua for
attractors and repellors. In the second section we plan to deal with the phase
transitions of pressure on Julia sets and integral means of Riemann maps of a
simply connected basin of attraction to a periodic stable point or rationally
indifferent periodic point. We intend to provide appropriate definitions of
pressure, to establish relations between pressure and integral means and to
investigate the phenomenon of phase transitions by means of dynamical systems
and thermodynamic formalism. We also want to explore the geometry and dynamics
of equilibrium states of Holder continuous functions. In particular we are
interested in the asymptotic behavior of of iterates of the Perron-Frobenius
operator and the sequence of random variables generated by Holder continuous
functions. In the last section we propose to deal with geometry and dynamics of
rational functions with no recurrent critical points in the Julia sets and
Collet-Eckmann maps, exploring the problems of Hausdorff and box dimension and
the influence of critical points on finiteness of sigma-finite invariant
measures. We also plan to study harmonic measures, beginning with Holder
continuity of their Jacobians. We propose research involving measures and
dimensions of various kinds, for example Hausdorff, packing, conformal, and ha
rmonic. These measures are natural notions of "volume" in the spaces and objects
we study. Such spaces and objects may be given by some algorithm which allows us
to approximate the final object and volume step by step. These spaces also have
some natural "motion" or dynamics acting on them. Our research involves
developing techniques which allow us to study both geometric and dynamic
features of our system. The specific problems of this proposal arise from many
contexts and their solutions will involve a mixture of techniques from various
areas: complex analysis, continua theory, dynamics, functional analysis-theory
of positive operators of the Perron-Frobenius type, measure theory and
probability, statistical physics-equilibrium states, phase transitions and
thermodynamic formalism. ***
