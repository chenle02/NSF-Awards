In order to provide a high-quality user experience, cellular service providers
periodically upgrade their network software to introduce new features, fix
software bugs, enhance quality of experience to users, or patch security
vulnerabilities. The rollout of these upgrades need to be carefully managed, as
tens of millions of customers rely on these networks for their daily activities
(including emergency, navigation, and alert notifications). This project will
develop techniques to manage cellular upgrades to minimize network disruption
and improve user experience across the nation. Through collaboration with
industry, the project will follow a fast track to technology transfer. The
researchers will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, with a focus on
actively recruiting female and other under-represented minority
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to deploying a software upgrade fully over
cellular network, field evaluations are conducted on a limited scale over a
selected subset of base-stations. These field evaluations are typically
cumbersome and can be time consuming; however, if done correctly they can help
alleviate a lot of the deployment issues in terms of service quality
degradation. Carefully selecting the specific base-stations to test, as well as
the number of base-stations that are tested, is important -- too few could lead
to problems during large-scale rollouts, and too many would be prohibitive in
terms of cost. This project aims to develop learning-based approaches to
automatically determine how many to select and where to conduct the upgrade
field tests, where the learning methods are optimized to detect those base-
station settings that could lead to failure of the upgrade. The researchers will
evaluate the effectiveness of their approach using both real traces from major
cellular networks as well as synthetic traces.
