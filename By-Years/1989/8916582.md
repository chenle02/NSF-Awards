Recently it has become possible to transform a paralyzed radial spoke mutant of
the bi-flagellate alga Chlamydomonas with the wild-type flagellar radial spoke
gene, thereby restoring flagellar motility. This transformation system will
permit the study of many aspects of flagellar protein synthesis, assembly and
function. Before carrying out these studies, however, it will be necessary
thoroughly to describe the transformation of Chlamydomonas with flagellar genes.
These initial studies will be done using the gene for radial spoke-3 (RSP-3) and
the paralyzed flagella mutant, pf-14 in which this gene is defective, causing
the lack of radial spokes. Using both genetic and molecular procedures it will
be determined how many copies of the gene are present, whether the genes are
integrated into the chromosomes and, if so, where the integration occurs. An
effort will be made to optimize the targeting of the transforming gene to its
homologue in the cell (homologous recombination). This will then make it
possible to obtain mutants in radial spoke proteins by gene disruption. Finally,
because the efficiency of transformation of Chlamydomonas is relatively high,
additional flagellar genes will be cloned by complementation. Radial spokes,
composed of 17 individual proteins are structural components of flagella, the
organelles by which the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas, swims. Each of
these proteins is essential for normal flagellar beating. Certain mutations
affecting these proteins result in flagella that lack radial spokes and are
immotile. Newly developed techniques for genetically transforming Chlamydomonas
now make it possible to study in detail the roles of the individual proteins in
flagellar motility. The proposed research represents the first step toward such
studies. Flagellar beating is one of the mechanisms by which cells move.
Understanding the structure, function, and interactions of flagellar proteins is
fundamental to our understanding of this form of cellular motility.
