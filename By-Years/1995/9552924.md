9552924 Farley Virginia Commonwealth University will initiate a 3-week, commuter
Young Scholars project during the summers of 1996 and 1997. The project will
serve 30 students entering seventh grade each year. The disciplinary focus of
the project is on mathematics, biology, and physics. Honors topics instruction
will be provided by university faculty and by pre-college faculty who are
members of the Mathematics Teacher Professional Network. Student interest in
mathematics and science will be nurtured as students report on small group
interactions with industry and academic researchers. Students will conduct an
report on small scale research projects. Academic year follow-up includes
regular contact with mentors and group activities through the Richmond Area
Mathematics and Science Center.
