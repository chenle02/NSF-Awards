The object of this project is to consider the optimal planning and control of
complex stochastic inventory systems where batch ordering must be used to
exploit the economies of scale. The research consists of problems that include
analyses of basic single-item inventory systems and general multi-product multi-
echelon systems, and optimization of generalized (s,S) systems. For basic
single-item inventory systems, the research is focused on sensitivity analysis,
which is designed to pave the path to effective research on more complex
systems. For multi-product multi-level systems, the research is focused on
performance analysis of practical inventory control policies. Since optimal
control of these systems is extremely difficult, the goal is to develop
practical inventory control policies with guaranteed worst case performance.
This research addresses fundamental issues arising from planning complex
stochastic inventory systems. The anticipated results will improve the
understanding of complex inventory systems, and add significantly to inventory
theory literature.
