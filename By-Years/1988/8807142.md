That the midlatitude atmosphere affects and, in turn, is affected by the
tropics is well known, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well
understood. The objective of this research project is to expand our
understanding of the atmospheric dynamics of the interactions between the
tropics and midlatitudes. The research involves three major topics. The first is
a study of heating over the Tibetan Plateau. Dr. Yanai and his colleagues intend
to determine the seasonal heating patterns over the Plateau and the surrounding
regions, the mechanisms responsible for that heating, and the effect of the
heating on the Asian monsoon. The second broad area involves studies of
equatorial waves and the so-called 30-50 day oscillation. The group is focusing
on the roles of cumulus convection and midlatitude disturbances in initiation
and/or maintaining these two phenomena. Finally, the group is investigating the
statistical representation of cumulus cloud ensembles and how downdrafts and
mesoscale convective organization affect the ensemble characteristics. This work
should significantly advance our understanding of the large-scale atmosphere.
The last topic also has important implications for the representation of
physical processes in numerical models of the atmosphere.
