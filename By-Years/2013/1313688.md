This project will expand a widely used simulation model to study how natural
processes interact with changing social and economic pressures to determine the
sustainability of forests. Researchers will examine patterns and causes of land
use and forest conversion in one of the major remaining forests of the U.S., the
woods of northern New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Two main
questions are how changes in land ownership affect management decisions, and
whether decisions based on short-term economic interests increase the
vulnerability of forest to natural disturbances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The woods
of the far northeastern U.S. are a nationally important source of forest
products and recreation. This project will help managers anticipate the long-
term consequences of alternative policies and better maintain our domestic
access to timber and paper. Outcomes will be disseminated to policy makers and
land managers via publication in a policy review, a U.S. Forest Service
symposium, and the model user group. The project will also train an
undergraduate.
