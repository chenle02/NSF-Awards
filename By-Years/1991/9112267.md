Existing computational models of structure-from-motion are based on variations
of optical flow or feature point correspondences within the interior of single
objects. This project investigates a new, boundary-based cue for determining
motion and shape. An approach is outlined for determining that an object is
rotating in depth. Only simple, qualitative computations are required, avoiding
the need to accurately determine how flow patterns are varying over the surface
of interest. Generalizations involving integration of boundary and surface cues
will be explored. Ultimately, the approach will be extended to other types of
motion such as translation of a wide field-of-view cameras.To support this
boundary-based analysis improved methods will be evaluated for estimating
optical flow in the presence of flow discontinuities. The proposed algorithm
integrates flow/surface analysis with the structure-from-motion determination
while addressing certain deficiencies in previously proposed techniques. Results
from this study should provide more general reliable, and economical methods for
dealing with the important problems involved in analyzing visual motion.
