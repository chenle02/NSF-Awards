This project explores the use of intramolecular nitrene insertions for the
preparation of amino sugars. Primary carbamates tethered within the sugar
framework are the precursors of metal-complexed nitrenes for insertion into
proximal carbon-carbon double bonds. Nucleophilic opening of the resulting
aziridines provides a means for stereocontrolled glycosylation. This work
focuses on how the stereochemical, conformational, and electronic properties of
the glycal and pseudoglycal carbamate substrates influence the nitrene insertion
event and the subsequent nucleophilic addition. A deeper understanding of these
factors will permit application of the methodology to a wide variety of sugar
carbamates and glycosyl acceptors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of this
award from the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Christian Rojas of the
Department of Chemistry at Barnard College will explore synthetic methods for
the preparation of amino sugars. Amino sugars play key roles in biological
systems and in medicinal chemistry. For example, many cell-surface proteins are
linked to amino sugar-containing fragments that serve as recognition elements
for processes such as immune response. In addition, certain amino sugars act as
potent inhibitors of enzyme action, others play important bio-structural roles,
and some are therapeutically valuable antibiotics. Innovative synthetic methods
for the preparation of amino sugars have the potential to open new avenues for
the study of their biological properties and pharmacology. In addition, these
synthetic studies will improve fundamental chemical understanding of routes to
incorporate nitrogen atoms within complex organic molecules. Undergraduate
students at Barnard, a liberal arts college for women, will be involved in all
aspects of the project. They will contribute to the state of the art in organic
chemical synthesis while receiving training that will enable them to pursue
further study and careers in science, medicine, and technology.
