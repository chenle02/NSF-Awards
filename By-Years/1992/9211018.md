Research is proposed for the study of optical waveguides fabricated by low-
energy electron irradiation of silica-based glasses. Recent work has
demonstrated that the refractive index increase resulting from irradiation may
be used to fabricate low-loss optical waveguides. The objectives of this
research will be the characterization of structural changes in the glass,
measurement of optical properties of the irradiated material, and application of
the technology to the fabrication of active and passive waveguide components.
