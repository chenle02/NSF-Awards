The laboratory provided by this grant allows and encourages the distribution of
parallel processing throughout a Computer Science curriculum where it is already
established. Parallel processing is being used as a tool as well as an object of
study. In addition, it is being used to support term projects and independent
student research. Through this project, seven additional courses can include
parallel processing. The laboratory provided by this grant includes a SIMD
parallel processor that is ideally suited for many of the assignments and
projects in areas such as image processing, speech and language processing, and
neural networks. In addition, a MIMD processor is being used in some Artificial
Intelligence courses, such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning,
and in Graphics courses. Students from disciplines such as physics and
mathematics have access to the parallel processing lab for research. This
project can demonstrate the feasibility of using parallel processing on a large
scale in the undergraduate computer science curriculum.
