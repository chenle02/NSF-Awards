This award provides one-half the funds necessary for the acquisition of a
controlled-magnetic field high-temperature oven for programmed heat treatment of
magnetic rock samples. The oven is to be operated and housed in the Department
of Geology at Occidental College. The award is made under the guidelines of the
NSF program for Research in Undergraduate Institutions, and the equipment will
be integrated into the undergraduate training program at Occidental College. The
Principal Investigator of the project requires the heat treatment oven for his
research which aimed at documenting and explaining the important phenomenon of
reversal of the Earth's magnetic field every few hundred thousand years.
