Stress-inversion methods, used by structural geologists to estimate a regional
stress tensor from populations of faults that contain slickenlines, rely on the
basic assumptions that (1) the regional stress field is homogeneous in space and
time, and (2) slip on each fault plane occurs in the direction of resolved
regional shear stress. These assumptions ignore the effects of fault shape, the
earth's surface, frictional anisotropy, and the proximity to nearby faults, any
of which could result in a significant difference between the direction of
resolved shear stress and the direction of fault slip. Mechanical modeling of
common fault geometries using existing computer code DIS3D provides a means to
evaluate the magnitude of this difference. The goal is to distinguish those
geological circumstances under which existing stress-inversion techniques are
reliable, from those that give unreliable answers. The results will provide new
and important insights concerning fault behavior.
