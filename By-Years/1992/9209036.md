This research is directed towards understanding how auditory information is
processed and coded by nerve cells in the cochlear nucleus, a portion of the
brain pathways that are involved in hearing. The auditory environment provides a
rich and complex array of information from a myriad of sounds from different
sources. Some of this information, such as speech sounds, is highly relevant to
us, while much of it is disregarded as extraneous noise. The auditory central
nervous system converts auditory information into neural signals which are later
analyzed at different levels in the brain. In order to understand how auditory
information processing occurs, this research is being conducted to determine
what aspects of auditory information are being coded by individual types of
nerve cells in the cochlear nucleus as well as where cochlear neurons send this
information in the brain. The activity of single nerve cells is recorded and
analyzed using microelectrodes inserted into single neurons, the response to
auditory stimulation is recorded, and a dye is injected into the nerve cell in
order to identify it using histological techniques. By locating and analyzing
this labelled neuron using both light and electron microscopy, it is possible to
answer a number of basic questions which include: (1) Do certain types of cells
encode specific parts of the auditory signal? (2) What part of the brain do
these cells relay information to? (3) What are the interactions between
individual types of neurons? These studies are essential to understanding how
such a complex sensory system provides us with the experience of hearing that is
so crucial to perception and cognitive experience.
