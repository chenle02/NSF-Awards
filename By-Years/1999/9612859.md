The investigators will combine coincident ground-based optical and radar data to
simultaneously specify the average energy and energy flux of precipitating
electrons and the resulting changes in the atomic oxygen concentration. The
investigators will use data from past experimental campaigns at Sondre
Stromfjord, Greenland, including electron densities measured by the incoherent
scatter radar, zenith intensities of key emission features measured by multi-
channel photometers, winds inferred from Fabry-Perot interferometer
measurements, images from an all-sky camera, magnetic field variations from a
chain of ground-based magnetometers, and data from polar-orbiting satellites.
They will correlate time variations in atomic oxygen with the particle and Joule
heating rates, estimated from models and coincident satellite and ground-based
magnetometer data. These data will be used to study the thermospheric response
to particle and Joule heating, plasma characteristics of pre-energized auroral
electrons, production and loss associated with observed optical emission
features, and populations and relative transition rates also associated with
these emission features.
