In modeling scientific discovery. Over the last several years, this group has
developed several computer programs that automate important aspects of
scientific discovery in biology, chemistry, physics, and also general
experimental science. They have identified promising discovery tasks by studying
primary sources such as scientific articles, talking with a broad array of
scientists, and even doing "field work" in some science. Automation methods have
included the concepts and techniques of heuristic search, of algorithms and
optimization, and a elementary mathematics and statistics. Concrete results in
various fields back up the hypothesis that a significant fraction of scientific
inference can be automated today. There is, however, the hypothesis that mush of
scientific inference consists of generic tasks that are quite specific, but that
- in their computational essence - are common to multiple sciences. The concept
of generic scientific task is a new way to view computing in biology,
computational chemistry, and so on. This research explore the concept of
"generic scientific task" by investigating whether it leads to practical results
(powerful discovery tools for scientists), and how this can provide a more
systematic understanding os scientific inference.
