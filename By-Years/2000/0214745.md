This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
manufacturing of very-large-area flexible displays. It is critical to develop a
low-cost manufacturing process that enables very-large-area flexible displays to
be manufactured for the military as well as the consumer. Recent technical
innovations in the area of very-large-area lithography and fluidic self-assembly
offer a unique process for low-cost high-volume flexible display manufacturing.
Anvik Corporation has developed a breakthrough lithography technology that
enables high-throughput, cost-effective production of very large displays (20 to
120 inches diagonal) on flexible substrates, which may be either loaded as
discrete sheets or fed continuously in a roll-to-roll configuration. Anvil's
very-large-area lithography technology represents a significant breakthrough in
display manufacturing. In this proposal, we present a program for developing a
production-worthy lithography system for high-throughput, low-cost fabrication
of flexible, high-resolution displays of sizes up to 60-inch diagonal.

This lithography process are that it is compatible with fluidic self-assembly
manufacturing techniques will potentially result in higher performance and lower
cost displays.
