Biological Sciences (61) This project is focused on developing methods to
improve the education of students in rapidly changing areas of the biosciences.
The objective is to improve the problem solving skills of bioscience majors
through the use of inquiry-based science education. Wireless laptop technology
and the integration of computational biology methods, including bioinformatics,
are being integrated into courses for biology majors. These biology courses
combine lecture/discussion and laboratory in the same classroom, an organization
that has many pedagogical advantages. In this environment, community college
bioscience majors in three courses (Principles of Biology I &amp; II and
Genetics) are using investigative laboratory simulations, including Bioquest,
Microbes Count, Virtual Fly Lab, etc., to study topics that cannot be easily
addressed in the traditional laboratory setting. Student groups, or
"collaboratories," can continue group work on problems outside of class time
because the software is also on the campus network. The project helps students
appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of current approaches to research, as
well as the important role of the computer as a research tool.
