9523517 Hwang Cardiovascular studies are important to the growing prosthetic
heart implant and valve industry. Research in this area can have a major impact
on improving artificial hearts and valves and at the same time reducing health
costs. This planning study is determining the potential to develop a research
program that will support an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
Cardiovascular Engineering. The planned Center is to have two research sites,
one at the University of Miami and the other at the University of Memphis. The
Co-Principal Investigators and their colleagues are recognized experts in their
fields and are well qualified to run a planning meeting for a Center. This
project has been coordinated with Dr. Gilbert Devey, Program Director,
Biomedical Engineering &amp; Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities, Division
of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems. The Program Manager recommends the
University of Miami be awarded $15,000 for three months for this planning
meeting.
