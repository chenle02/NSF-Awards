This research will address critical issues through a collective research effort
to develop new algorithms and high-performance software development for data
analysis. With the deployment of petascale computing systems, these problems can
for the first time be addressed at scale. Nuclear genomes such as Drosophila
will serve as the primary source of data to assess models and methods developed
and this research leverages past work on the Genome Rearrangement Analysis
through Parsimony and other Phylogenetic Algorithms software suite.
