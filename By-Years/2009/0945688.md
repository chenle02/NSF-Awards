This SBIR Phase I project will develop a 100 micron long lab-on-a-chip
spectrometer to detect benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) and
other compounds in contaminated ground water and methane and nitrous oxides in
air emissions. The project will develop a photonic crystal slot waveguide device
which will combine slow light effect in photonic crystal waveguides with large
optical field intensity in a low index slot at the center of the photonic
crystal waveguide. This will allow exact identification of analyte through
spectroscopic signatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of
the project will be realized with the successful demonstration of this
technology that will permit this chip to be adapted to a wide range of
contaminants in water and air media, and hence, could be very useful to
activities in the environmental field.&lt;br/&gt;
