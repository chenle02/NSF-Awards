Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Little is known about ornate box turtles in South
Dakota and further research linked directly to defining effective conservation
programs are critically needed. This research implements an integrative
conservation approach to achieve the following objectives: 1) Assist South
Dakota Game, Fish and Parks (SDGFP) in implementing the South Dakota Wildlife
Action Plan, 2) Estimate the home range and the geographic range of ornate box
turtles in South Dakota through the use of ecological niche modeling, 3)
Document macro- and microhabitat use, 4) Describe movements and document daily
and seasonal activity periods, and 5) Estimate gene flow among local populations
using a landscape genetics approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening
Participation&lt;br/&gt;This research will improve the research experience for
Native American undergraduate students at Oglala Lakota College(OLC) by
providing training in ecological field research delivering hands-on, place-based
STEM instruction and will facilitate the advancement of Native American student
education by bridging OLC undergraduate students interested in Conservation
Biology to the Master of Science in Integrative Genomics (MSIG) at the Black
Hill State University(BHSU).
