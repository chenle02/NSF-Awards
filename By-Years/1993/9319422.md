9319422 Rutherford The issues to be studied are the impacts of mitigation
measures taken by governmental agencies and the judicial decisions on land use
and building regulations of coastal areas subjected to the risk of hurricanes.
The project will: assemble macrogeographic and fiscal information of federal
assistance in the major recent hurricane disasters; analyze relevant statutes
and case law including the United States Supreme Court decision in Lucas vs.
South Carolina Coastal Council to determine the scope of federal legal authority
in hazards mitigation; and examine the influence of federal actions on the
recovery process. The objective of the study is to identify areas of mutual
reinforcement, areas of contradiction and of opportunities for better use of
federal resources in hazards mitigation vis a vis coastal development. The
results of this research, with specific recommendations for policy improvements,
will benefit other researchers, and the public and private sectors involved in
natural hazards mitigation. ***
