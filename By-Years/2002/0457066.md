This research is aimed at using mathematical optimization to solve a wide range
of problems, including improving internet routing protocols, devising efficient
methods of pricing telecommunications bandwidth, and inferring traffic flows in
real-time from anonymous cell phone data. The most common intra-domain internet
routing protocol requires creating fictitious "costs" for each link in the
network. The standard heuristic method for doing that may lead to unnecessary
network congestion. Observations of the bandwidth market show that there is
often inefficiency in pricing, which allows arbitrage: clever purchasers can
often construct more valuable connectivity than they pay for. A National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration study estimated that 3% of American drivers are
talking on cell phones at any given time; by anonymously tracking the
progression of each call from one cell tower to another, it may be possible to
estimate traffic patterns in the area without violating any individual caller's
privacy.&lt;br/&gt;Although seemingly unrelated, these problems all have similar
underlying mathematical structure. The shared mathematical structure of these
optimization problems will be investigated and the knowledge gained will be used
to develop ways of obtaining better solutions to each of these problems, as well
as others which share the same properties. Practical outcomes include a decrease
in network congestion, increased efficiency in the bandwidth marketplace, and
real-time methods for deducing and responding to roadway congestion.&lt;br/&gt;
