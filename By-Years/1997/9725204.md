This grant will support studies using the DO detector at the FERMILAB Tevatron.
At the Tevatron protons and anti- protons are collided at the highest energies
currently available in the world. These products of these collisions are studied
using the DO detector. The experimenters hope to find evidence of new types of
particles not previously seen. One such particle the experimenters will search
for is the Higgs. This particle is predicted to exist by the Standard Model of
particle physics and is a remnant of the mechanism which gives particles mass.
The experimenters may also find evidence for supersymmetric particles.
