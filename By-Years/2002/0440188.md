Many modern plate boundaries involve convergence between the tectonic plates at
highly oblique angles. These obliquely convergent systems produce
transpressional orogenic belts where faulting and rock deformation occurs by a
combination of shortening perpendicular to the plate boundary and shear parallel
to the boundary. In transpressional orogens, rock packages typically show highly
variable pressure-temperature-time paths adjacent to a central strike-slip fault
zone. This project is focused on the determining the deformation and exhumation
histories of deep crustal rocks in the Kaoko zone, which is the northern branch
of the ca. 500 million year old Damera Orogen in Nambia. The Kaoko zone is a
classic transpressional orogen that is deeply eroded so that the rock
deformation processes and thermal histories of the lower and middle crust can be
assessed at the surface. The kinematic and thermal history of the Kaoko zone
gives insights into the tectonic processes occurring at depth along modern
transpressional systems like the San Andreas Fault, California and the Alpine
Fault in New Zealand.
