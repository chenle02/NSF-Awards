The addition of fully automated scanning electron microscopy to the
undergraduate biology laboratories at North Hennepin Community College (NHCC)
will make possible a level of science instruction at the lower-division that
was, before this time, reserved only for upper-division and graduate students.
Using an older, manually operated Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM), a pilot
project with SEM applications for lower-division college students has
demonstrated that SEM lab experiences generate a greater interest in and
understanding of science subjects. A fully automated, user friendly SEM will
permit the following changes to be made in the Biology Department: (1) A new
course focusing on techniques in structual biology that includes a student
research componen will be added; (2) students studying cell and molecular
biology will have enhanced hands-on lab experience in the examination of
cellular and tissue structure; (3) all students in introductory biology will
have an opportunity for firsthand operation of a SEM -The experience itself and
the micrographs produced will supplement other laboratory and lecture materials
used for the study of intricate structures; and (4) laboratory demonstrations
for visiting secondary school students and opportunities for research projects
by visiting college and secondary school educators will increase.
