9727055 Davis The objective of this investigation is to make Global Positioning
System (GPS) measurements of 3-dimensional crustal deformation in the
northeastern U.S., combined with absolute gravity and tide gauge measurements,
to infer the viscosity of the lower mantle and thus improve current models of
glacial isostatic adjustment. This will allow the PIs to determine the relative
roles of crustal motion and sea level rise in this region, and also develop an
improved estimate of global mean sea level rise from the global tide gauge data
set. They will install 6 new permanent GPS sites along the northeastern coast of
the U.S., which will supplement the current sites in the Continuously Operating
Reference System (CORS), which will also be evaluated for use in this
investigation. A related objective of the investigation is to develop improved
methods of GPS vertical positioning, including modeling vertical motions
associated with pressure loading, tidal loading, etc. The PIs anticipate this
investigation will result in an improved understanding of sea level change in
the northeastern U.S., an improved model of glacial isostatic adjustment, and an
improved estimate of global sea level change through the application of this
model to the global tide gauge data. ***
