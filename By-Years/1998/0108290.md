How we can use the power of technology to promote meaningful learning in math
and science? PFSMETE research project consists of testing the hypothesis that
rich experiential environments and reflective interactions are both necessary
conditions for effective educational technology. To promote experiential
cognition, students should be exposed to realistic and varied experiences in
order to ensure the ability to use what they have learned to understand new and
ecologically valid situations. To promote active learning through reflection,
students should be asked to reflect as new concepts are being introduced in the
lesson with the help, for example, of a pedagogical agent or by self-evaluation.

The proposed studies set out to test the main hypothesis in two different
domains (science and math), for two different student populations (elementary
and college students), and with the primary dependent measure being the number
of acceptable solutions that students generate for divergent problem-solving
questions.
