The 7th International Conference on Expansive Soils will take place on August
3-5, 1992, in Dallas, Texas and will address the behavior of expansive soils and
other types of unsaturated soils. Theoretical and technological solutions to
problems presented by these soils; the relationship between climate and
environment, and the subsequent effect on constructed facilities; remedial
measures and effective construction techniques; prediction methodology; and
other concerns will be some of the topics broached during the conference. The
present award will facilitate the assistance of graduate students to the
meeting, and the production of high quality proceedings in which the state-of-
the-art as well as future research needs in the field of expansive soils will be
described.
