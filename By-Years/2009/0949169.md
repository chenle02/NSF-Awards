This project will investigate the taxonomy of species from the charismatic
tropical plant genus Columnea. Members of this genus are pollinated by
hummingbirds, and are a conspicuous component of most cloud forests in Central
and South America. Identification of most species is difficult to impossible
even for the species that are already named since there is no unified treatment.
This project will create a unified taxonomic treatment that brings together
illustrations, descriptions, tools for identifying species, photographs, and
distribution maps - provided both in print and via on-line access to all. A
revised classification for the entire genus will be generated using DNA
sequences as a means of uncovering traits that define taxonomic
groups.&lt;br/&gt; Training will be provided to numerous undergraduates and one
graduate student. Students will learn all aspects of systematics research from
formulating hypotheses and fieldwork to presenting results at meetings. Their
training and education will be an integral part of this proposal and contribute
toward training the next generation of plant systematists. The results will be
presented to both the scientific community and to the general public by
publishing papers and developing web-based resources for the genus.
