With food sourced from every part of the country and from around the world, food
supply chains are extremely complex pathways from farm to the table.
Unfortunately, up to 20-30% of the fresh food is spoiled by the time it reaches
the customer in US, and a similar amount is further thrown away by the customers
at least partly due to lack of freshness. Thus, understanding food networks and
devising mechanisms to reduce losses can have huge economic and environmental
impact. The purpose of this project is to understand and improve food
distribution networks by applying and extending techniques from the science of
computer networking, which can handle tremendous amounts of complexity beyond
the scales seen in food networks. The unique characteristics of food networks
will require significant innovations beyond the state of the art in computer
networking and thus will provide valuable results for novel and emerging complex
computer networks as well. The design and optimization of a "food network" poses
many challenges and requires innovations that are expected to benefit both food
networks and computer networks. In particular, food network involve unique
'rotting packets' (continuous decrease in quality of the package contents), a
demand-driven and quality-centric delivery and distribution, in-network
bundling/unbundling of 'packets', mixing of a large variety of 'payloads', and
dynamic changes to packet sources and types. The purpose of this proposal is to
address these challenges and lay the foundation for a systematic design and
operation of food networks. Since many of these challenges are relevant to
computer networks as well, the proposed work will consider them in that context
as well. In particular, the research will examine issues relating to in-network
bundling/unbundling of packets, content based (rather than address based)
routing/distribution, QoS aware forwarding of multi-modal data, and disruption
tolerant operation. The research will also allow for better management of the
food networks in the face of emerging trends in maximal utilization of seasonal
and local foods which requires significant flexibility and dynamic
configurability in the food sourcing and distribution networks.
