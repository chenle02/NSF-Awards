9710313 Saltzman The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to synthesize
polymeric materials with a selected range of chemical and structural features,
and use these materials to examine the mechanisms for cell migration and cell
growth. The PI will study changes in cell behavior for human leukocytes and
nervous tissue cells dispersed within the synthetic polymers in which the pore
architecture as well as the chemical composition is systematically changed. By
using a variety of polymeric materials, the PI will test the hypothesis that
optimal cell migration requires environments possessing physicochemical features
(pore size, adhesion, deformability) within a restricted and definable range.
