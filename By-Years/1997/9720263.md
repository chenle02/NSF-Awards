AST-9720263 ABSTRACT - J. Weatherall and J. Eilek MAGNETIZED STRONG PLASMA
TURBULENCE AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION A new study of strong plasma turbulence
combines theoretical and computational tools to address two important questions.
One is the dynamics of magnetized strong turbulence. This study addresses the
connection of large-scale Alfvenic turbulence to small-scale lower hybrid
turbulence via the coupling of modes in strong turbulence processes. The second
question is the role of turbulence in the energization of relativistic
particles. This other study analyzes the dissipation of magnetized turbulence
through transit-time damping. Such damping should be an effective accelerator of
a high energy component of the plasma to relativistic energies. The research is
particularly relevant to the area of particle acceleration in astrophysical
plasmas, where the role of strong plasma turbulence has not been studied. The
results of the research may lead to essential new physics for the energization
of relativistic particles in clusters of galaxies. The program of research
addresses basic issues of turbulent structure in magnetized plasmas,
relativistic plasmas, and cosmic plasmas.
