It has become possible to heat the ionosphere by irradiating it with powerful
radio waves from a ground based transmitter. Such energy absorption also
produces instabilities in the ionospheric plasma, optical emission, and high
energy electrons. These experiments provide an opportunity to study the physics
oflow density plasmas with more control on the perturbing processes than by
observing natural processes in the ionosphere. A collaboration between a
theoretician and an experimentalist using the NSF heater facility at Arecibo
Puerto Rico is proposed, to allow testing of theoretical descriptions of
ionospheric heating.
