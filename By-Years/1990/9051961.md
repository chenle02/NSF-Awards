The curriculum in biology is being enhanced through the acquisition of an
ultracentrifuge and kinetic microplate reader. The equipment is being used in
the Genetics, Immunology and Microbiology courses to introduce new exercises
which employ modern techniques and principles of critical thinking. The
equipment increases the variety of projects students may undertake in the
Methods in Research course and in undergraduate student research projects. The
ultracentrifuge enables students to purify plasmic DNA for restriction
endonuclease double digestion mapping and gene cloning, and to purify
prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomic DNA and RNA for Southern and Northern blot
analyses with non-radioactive labeled probes. The kinetic microplate reader is
used by students for performing the ELISA immunoassay, for cell proliferation
studies using the MTT assay, for monoclonal antibody analyses, for the Lowry
protein assay and for the screning of sera and cultured supernatants for the
presence of antibody following immunological in vivo or in vitro stimulation
procedures, respectively. The equipment improves the biology program being
offered to students majoring in biology or allied health, many of whom are
women. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
