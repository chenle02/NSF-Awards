Abstract ATMP-9706921 Mayewski, Paul A., and Meeker, Loren D. University of New
Hampshire History of forcing Significance of GISP2 Record There is growing
recognition of the special "window on the past" provided by ice cores. In
particular, completion of deep drilling at Summit Greenland has presented
paleoclimatologists with a well-dated, high resolution, multi-parameter record
which is providing an unprecedented view of climate change over the last
glacial/interglacial cycle. This award supports a project focused on: (1)
developing even more robust descriptions of paleoclimate utilizing the
multivariate (e.g., isotopes, particles, chemistry) GISP2 record; (2) utilizing
the GISP2 as a framework for comparison with other paleoclimate records; (3)
developing proxy records for atmospheric circulation systems in order to
investigate seasonal-to-interannual and decadal-to centennial scale variability;
(4) investigating and interpreting changes in the sources and production rates
of the chemical species recorded in the GISP2 record in order to contribute to
our understanding of biogeochemical cycling; (5) enhancing our understanding of
the complex behavior of Holocene climate through the detailing of Holocene
climate change (e.g., changes in atmospheric circulation, aridity, biological
activity) and forcing; (6) investigating analogs for near-Holocene climate
including interstadials, Eem and transitions into and out of stadials to further
elucidate Holocene climate response and forcing; (7) investigating global
phasing of climate change events; (8) investigating natural versus anthropogenic
forcing of climate to enhance prediction of future climate and; (9) interpreting
the preceding in light of the human dimensions of climatic change.
