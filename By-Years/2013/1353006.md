1353006&lt;br/&gt;Emami-Neyestanak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus
on mechanically and electrically adaptive and modular designs that conform to
the tissue. Instead of having one large chip connected to a dense electrode
array via a cable, many tiny low-cost chips that form a complete system are
distributed over a foldable substrate. Specified regions of the substrate willt
be arranged to establish relations in the final folded form. New patterns will
be developed that can be tiled into pixel arrays and provide 3D positioning of
the components mounted upon the substrate. The reconfigurable chips will have
novel proximity sensors and communication circuits to form a complete system
suitable for the origami structure and deployment. Micromechanical latches will
be used for fixation and tuning of the structure. Different module "types" will
be developed that can be elegantly tiled into arrays and result in 3D shapes
that match the contour of the tissue. The reconfigurable chips will have novel
proximity sensors, communication and power delivery circuits to form a complete
system with the proposed modular structure.
