The phosphorylation of cellular targets by protein kinases is used by eukaryotes
to transmit developmental and environmental signals to cellular targets. This
proposal focuses on the role of protein kinases in the biology of the spores of
Phytophthora infestans, the potato late blight pathogen. This species is a
member of the group of microbial eukaryotes known as oomycetes. These include
many plant and animal pathogens that are current and potential threats to crop
production and food security. Prior work by the Judelson laboratory showed that
spores require protein kinases to function normally, and identified several
kinases expressed specifically during spore formation and germination. Using a
combination of molecular and biochemical approaches, the research planned will
identify proteins that interact with these kinases, including both regulators of
the kinases and proteins phosphorylated by the kinases. The functions of
selected kinases and their interactors in the biology of Phytophthora will also
be assessed by making mutants. Spores are important to Phytophthora and related
species since they are the main structures used to disseminate such pathogens,
and since penetration of their plant and animal hosts usually involves
specialized structures formed by germinated spores. Understanding the biology of
spores should therefore lead to effective and environmentally safe strategies
for preventing disease. This research will also be synergistic with existing NSF
initiatives in Phytophthora genomics and biology, and contribute to student
training at a Postsecondary Minority
Institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
