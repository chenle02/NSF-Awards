This is for a second year of our ACCESS program, the purpose of which is to
establish a pipeline starting in the local high schools which will conduct
qualified young women into careers in the physical sciences. The technique is to
select highly motivated participants in their first collegiate year, and after
15 months of special instruction and training, place them as active participants
in selected research projects. In addition, each year three high school teachers
are selected to participate in the summer course and laboratory rotations. At
the end of each summer, these teachers organize (with supervision) workshops for
20 other secondary school teachers on methods of teaching from (rather than to)
problems, and strategies to neutralize cultural gender bias. During their
sophomore year, the students work in selected laboratories and participate in a
weekly seminar organized by the Utah Math/Science Network (this is an
organization of women in scientific professions dedicated to encouraging young
women in science and mathematics). The Director of the University's
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program matches the students to research
projects. A full-time graduate assistant acts as liaison between the
participants and the faculty.
