Computers are inherently vulnerable to so-called side-channel security attacks
that correlate their operating characteristics (e.g., power consumption) with
secret information stored in them (e.g., cryptographic keys). Previous
approaches aimed at addressing this vulnerability are hampered by prohibitively-
high power, area, and performance overheads. This research project explores
technologies for designing secure computers, using technologies that have the
potential to yield computing devices that are significantly more secure than
conventional computing hardware with little-or-no sacrifice in performance,
area, and energy efficiency. This research effort also includes the development
of projects for advanced undergraduate-level design courses, and the engagement
of high-school students through a variety of outreach
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore novel hardware design
technologies that are inherently resistant to side-channel attacks while
achieving performance, area, and power levels that compare favorably with
mainstream design technologies. Specifically, it will explore circuit topologies
that recycle the energy used for their operation, yielding superior energy
efficiency and a flat power consumption profile that is immune to side-channel
attacks. It will also explore pipeline architectures with area-efficient logic
families and a flat power consumption profile that can resist side-channel
attacks. The proposed technologies will be evaluated through the design,
fabrication, and experimental evaluation of silicon
prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
