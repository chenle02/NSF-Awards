This project is to support a two and one-half day conference aimed at
establishing a national platform for stimulating the life sciences community to
play a more active and sustained role in science education. Specific goals to be
addressed by the conference are to remedy increasing shortages of qualified life
scientists, to increase scientific literacy in the general population, and to
enhance the commitment of private as well as public funding resources to life
science education. The report resulting from the conference is expected to help
set a national agenda based on the participation of previously unrelated
professional societies.
