9254491 Kubota The Washington Initiative in Science Education - Science Teacher
Enhancement Project (WISE-STEP) the pilot for a statewide, five- institute,
multi-district collaborative project that addresses a pressing challenge- how to
align professional development experiences with a systemic change effort that
reflects both emerging research on teacher change and empowerment and research
on student learning. The project proposes to improve science education through
the collaborative efforts of teachers, school and district administrators,
scientists, community representatives, and university faculty. Through a series
of summer institutes and academic year follow-up activities WISE- STEP will: 1.
directly assist approximately 40 teachers to expand their understanding and
appreciation of science and to become leaders in their buildings and districts;
work with approximately 20 schools in 2 school districts to develop the
infrastructure needed to support quality science education in the elementary
grades; collaborate with institute participants and school officials on the
adoption of high-quality science programs in their districts; and collaborate
with other scientists, teachers, and education faculty so that the institute
model can be expanded to the entire State of Washington. ***
