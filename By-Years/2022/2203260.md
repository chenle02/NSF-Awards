The meeting 'IX Cell Wall Research Conference 2022 (IXCWRC): Cell wall research
for new fundamental discoveries and applications in plant biology' will be held
in East Lansing, Michigan on June 13-17, 2022. The meeting will focus on the
plant cell wall, which makes up most of the plant biomass, interfaces with the
external environment, and supports the growth of the entire organism.
Understanding the cellular and extracellular processes necessary to build and
maintain the plant cell wall is important because cell wall biosynthesis and
remodeling during growth and disease are largely uncharacterized processes, and
because of the relevance of the cell wall for food, fiber, fuel, and other
materials that are indispensable to humans. A better understanding of how the
cell wall is synthesized, deposited, and maintained during plant growth and in
response to the environment can inform and improve biotechnological processes
for increasing plant yield and resilience. Acquiring such knowledge requires the
exchange of new ideas and results as well as the development and application of
new technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IXCWRC aims to provide an open forum
to discuss new ideas and theories, develop collaborations for scientists across
the globe in a diverse and supportive environment, in addition to promoting and
training the next generation of scientists through tailored workshops and
activities. The NSF award will be used to develop an exciting program,
particularly by broadening the participation of early career investigators to
the meeting, facilitating their networking and fostering the foundations of an
inclusive community in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
