Stable isotope analysis is potentially one of the most exciting techniques that
has emerged in recent years. While the use of stable isotopes in ecology and the
need for such studies have expanded rapidly, stable isotope ratio measurements
require complex and costly equipment. However, the use of stable isotopes in
animal and plant physiological ecology and ecosystem ecology are among the few
areas in ecology where the rate of progress has been limited by the availability
of instrumentation. The full extent to which stable isotope analyses will be
used to solve problems in ecological research is yet to be determined. In this
proposal, we are requesting funds to purchase an isotope ration mass
spectrometer and the necessary preparation devices to process biological tissues
and fluids. As a part of recent facility developments, Boston University has
designed space for a stable isotope laboratory in its new (under construction)
Biology Research Laboratories. This facility is conceived as a multi-user
isotopes of particular interest to animal and plant physiological ecologists,
and ecosystem ecologists.
