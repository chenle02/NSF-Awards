This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucleotide substitution is an important
mechanism by which genomes change over evolutionary time. This project seeks to
improve our understanding of nucleotide substitution by focusing on an aspect
that is currently poorly characterized: how the context of neighboring
nucleotides biases substitution. At present the best described bias effects are
those due to immediately adjacent nucleotides. However, it is known that more
distant nucleotides also affect substitution. The goal of the project is to
develop and apply a method to systematically characterize more distant context
effects. The information obtained can later be used to improve models of
nucleotide substitution. Such improvements could potentially contribute to areas
such as reconstructing phylogeny and inferring which parts of the genome are
functional. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the training of
biologists with strong quantitative backgrounds. It will be carried out by
undergraduate students at Harvey Mudd College (HMC), a selective liberal arts
college focused on science and engineering. Students at the college receive
unusually broad training in the physical sciences, mathematics and computer
science as part of the college's core curriculum. Such students have a great
deal to offer biology. Molecular evolution and computational biology are natural
areas for them to apply their skills. This project helps introduce students to
these disciplines through research opportunities and connections with
coursework. Because 25% of HMC's graduates receive a Ph.D. within nine years of
graduation, the project work will contribute to the training of a new generation
of biological researchers with strong quantitative skills. An additional impact
is that the software developed for this project will be distributed freely on
the web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
