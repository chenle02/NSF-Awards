On August 20, 2023, the first tropical storm to hit California since the 1930’s
traversed Death Valley National Park. Total of 2.2 inches of rain fell over the
park in a single day, setting a new record equivalent to the park’s average
annual rainfall. This led to unprecedented flooding and landscape change, the
extent of which is still being determined. During normal conditions, Death
Valley is among the most arid places in the world with landscape change driven
by wind and infrequent alluvial and fluvial activity. In the aftermath of
Hurricane Hilary, widespread flash flooding and debris flows carved deep
channels will fundamentally alter the landscape providing an unprecedented
opportunity to learn about the rates and drivers of landscape change following
extreme events.

This work will identify meter- to hundred-meter-scale changes caused by the
storm and quantitatively document the post-storm landscape state. The immediate
results of debris flows, flooding, and associated erosion define the boundary
condition for future landscape development and recovery. This baseline landscape
state is actively decaying and must be rapidly documented to address scientific
questions related to landscape change in the wake of extreme events including
What are the timescales of landscape re-equilibration at meter- to hundred-meter
scales? How do extreme events redistribute or create new sources and sinks of
sediment? How does vegetation recover in the wake of an extreme event? Exploring
these questions requires the proposed baseline dataset that will be collected in
this effort.
