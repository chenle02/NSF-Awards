The project entails the fundamental study of condensation phase change on
nanoengineered surfaces, covered with an ultrathin hydrophobic or super-
hydrophobic coating. A significant outcome of the project is the possibility of
engineering or "designing" better (more resilient) surfaces. The study has
potential to impact several industries, such as power utilities, heating
ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, electronic devices, and desalination
systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main objective is to determine the surface
coating defects formation, degradation and nucleation dynamics during
condensation, which is key to enhancing longevity and heat transfer
effectiveness of the surface. A new advanced scanning probe microscopy technique
will be utilized for process visualization. Educational effort is very broad,
involving research experience activities for k-12 teachers and students, new
laboratory activities for undergraduate engineering students, and a new graduate
course.
