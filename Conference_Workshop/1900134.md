This award provides funding for US participation in the joint conferences "Young
Mathematicians in C*-Algebras" and "Young Women in C*-Algebras" that will be
held August 5-10, 2019 at the University of Copenhagen. This joint conference
focuses on recent developments in operator algebras (both von Neumann and
C*-algebras), noncommutative geometry, and related areas of mathematical
analysis, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between operator algebras
and the fields of geometric group theory, logic, and dynamical systems.

Young Mathematicians in C*-Algebras and Young Women in C*-Algebras are organized
for and by master/Ph.D.-students and postdocs in operator algebras and related
areas, with the goal of fostering scientific and social interaction between
young researchers. The conference will feature three mini-courses by established
researchers (Cornelia Drutu, Ilijas Farah, and Ian Putnam) alongside many
contributed talks by participants, as well as mentoring activities designed to
increase retention of underrepresented groups in operator algebras. This award
gives US-based early career researchers and members of underrepresented groups
an opportunity to attend and participate in this conference. The organizing
committee will strive to make this funding opportunity known to target groups
via advertising in a variety of venues. More information will be made available
at: https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2019/ymcstara2019/.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
