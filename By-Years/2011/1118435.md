Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging component of computer science
education. A common characteristic of successful efforts to introduce CT is the
presence of a context to which students can relate. This project builds upon
previous efforts that have shown music to be a context that engages students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A sample of student activities include writing computer
programs to play music, developing web pages that incorporate music, and
developing data structures and databases to catalog sounds. Upper level courses
in computing and music are synchronized by students working on collaborative
projects across the disciplines. An alternative format is to offer a hybrid
course co-taught by faculty from both disciplines. Expected outcomes include
course materials and approaches for measuring CT gains. Course materials include
lecture notes, class activities, code examples and homework
assignments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional development workshops provide
expertise for faculty to adopt new education approaches and to participate in a
community of like-minded educators. Attendees are interdisciplinary two-person
teams with expertise in computing as well as music. Three summer workshops are
expected to attract one hundred faculty from fifty
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort leverages a natural relationship
between music and computing to teach CT concepts to undergraduates in all
disciplines. Materials are being developed for interdisciplinary general
education courses and discipline-specific music and computing courses at more
advanced levels.
