The National Academy of Sciences is provided with support for the Board on Earth
Sciences and Resources and its Activities. The work will be conducted by the
Division on Earth and Life Studies, Board on Earth Sciences and Resources. The
Board on Earth Sciences and Resources provides the focal point for National
Research Council activities related to the Earth sciences. Through its
committees, panels, and working groups, it provides independent advice on a wide
range of Earth science issues, including those involving basic and applied
research, the environment, natural hazards, resources, data (from acquisition
and archiving to dissemination and management) and education. It also provides
guidance on U.S. participation in international Earth science programs.
