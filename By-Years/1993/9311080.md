9311080 Able, K. The Rutgers University Marine Field Station is located near
Tuckerton, New Jersey, at the mouth of the Mullica River - Great Bay Estuary.
The entire watershed of this estuary is protected within the New Jersey National
Pinelands Reserve. The station provides easy access to extensive salt marsh and
estuarine habitats in the cleanest estuary on the northeast coast, and to a site
at 15 m depth on the continental shelf where studies on hydrodynamic processes,
sediment resuspension and transport, larval and juvenile settlement and
recruitment of commercial species of fish and invertebrates, and bottom boundary
layer prosses affecting benthic communities are being conducted. A Long-Term
Ecosystem Observatory has been established at this site to track episodic and
long-term changes in important environmental parameters. This project will 1)
enhance the ability to transport and maintain invertebrates and fishes from the
estray and continental shelf under controlled temperatures, and 2) improve data
collection at the site on environmental factors fundamental to a number of the
studies there, e.g., additional components for an existing meteorological
station, a salinometer and a fluorometer. ***
