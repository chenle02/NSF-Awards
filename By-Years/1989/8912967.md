The climate system responds linearly to Milankovitch forcing at the
precessional and obliquity periods of earth's orbit. But the dominant
periodicity of the climate system is in the eccentricity band, where little
forcing is apparent. Thus the response of climate at these time scales is highly
nonlinear and probably involves the complex interaction of feedbacks between
various components of the earth-ocean-atmosphere- cryosphere system. This
proposal requests continued support to develop and test multi-component climate
models. The PI wishes to: 1) develop a coupled atmosphere-ocean model which has
components which are sufficiently simple that their stability in the climate
system can be investigated; and 2) to utilize high- quality oxygen isotopic
records to test the general properties of slow response, ice sheet models. The
objective of this study is to differentiate the trends in the Pleistocene
climate records which are due to internal nonlinear response from those which
are the direct result of Milankovitch external forcing. This research is
important because it has a direct bearing on our understanding of the complex
linkages between the various components of the climate system.
