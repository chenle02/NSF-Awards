9622541 GOAD The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN during 1996
as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.
The LAURENTIAN is an 80' general research vessel constructed in 1974 and owned
by the University of Michigan. The ship is scheduled for 60 operating days in
1993, of which 42 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship
operates primarily in the Great Lakes. This vessel is part of a fleet used by
the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country. The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the
work proposed. The program considers the ship important part of the fleet due to
its location. The Laurentian is the only UNOLS vessel that operates in the Great
Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve usage of
the vessel.
