This research plan involves the investigation of a closely related set of
variants of the enzyme Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) in complexes with
inhibitors and substrates. These studies are aimed at determining the details of
the structural and dynamical correlates of the enzymatic reaction. These studies
will utilize a new type of SNase, SNase, n which the solvent accessible and
disordered loop has been deleted. Preliminary studies suggest that (i) the
deletion of the loop does not have large structural consequences; (ii) by random
mutation of residues 50 & 51 a series of proteins can be generated which have
continuum of structures and activities; (iii) the residue at position 43 can be
varied in conjunction with random mutation at positions 50 & 51 to investigate
the structure-function correlates of basic catalysis; (iv) the comparison of the
inhibitor and substrate binding of loop containing and sNase could offer
important information about the details of active site interactions and (v) the
comparison of the flexibility of loop containing and SNAse may offer information
about the role of active site flexibility on the catalytic reaction. the major
technique to be used in these studies in NMR.
