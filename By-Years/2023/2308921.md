Present particle accelerator technology is at a crossroads -- new discovery
science and application opportunities lie ahead, yet the particle accelerators
needed to realize them have become too large and expensive. This project
explores the physics underlying a new approach to particle acceleration by using
plasmas to accelerate particles thousands of times faster than can be done using
conventional accelerators. The goal is to make plasma-based accelerators
thousands of times smaller and less expensive than their conventional
counterparts. This project addresses two current challenges in plasma-based
particle acceleration research: (1) generating energetic particle bunches
frequently, hundreds of times per second; and (2) accelerating anti-matter
particles such as positrons. The project will train early career scientists
including two Ph.D. students and an undergraduate student, and will help pave
the way for creating new accelerator technology for industry and medicine.

This award supports execution of the experiment E-324 “Optical visualization of
beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators” at the 2nd generation SLAC Facility
for Advanced Accelerator Science and Experimental Tests (FACET-II). Specific
scientific goals of the experiment are: (1) to observe and understand the
recovery time of a plasma following plasma wakefield excitation, which limits
collider repetition rate and luminosity; (2) to observe a sharp on-axis ion-
density peak predicted by computer simulations to form as a result of a strongly
nonlinear electron wake after it breaks; and (3) to observe the original beam-
driven electron wake at delays less than 1 picosecond for the first time. These
studies will pave the way for plasma-based positron accelerators, an essential
component of future electron-positron colliders. They will also enable
development of reliable tabletop plasma-based accelerators which provide compact
coherent x-ray sources for biological, chemical, and materials research,
injectors for conventional accelerators, and medical accelerators.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
