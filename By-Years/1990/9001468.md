This award supports a program of research to study sediment accumulation rates
in five transects of sediment cores that cross today's primary flow path of
Arctic bound Atlantic water (e.g., the West Spitsbergen Current). Because the
Wets Spitsbergen Current). Because the West Spitsbergen Current is the primary
importer of ocean heat to the High Arctic, and is responsible for maintaining
the sea-ice free conditions in the Norwegian Sea, detailed knowledge of the
history of this current is critical to a complete understanding of the
transition form the last glaciation to the present warm, interglacial climate
state. Thermohaline processes on the broad Arctic margin shelves play an
important role in the thermohaline circulation of the Arctic Seas. This project
will examine whether the West Spitsbergen Continental Shelf was glaciated during
the Last Glacial Maximum (approximately 18 thousand years ago). Ship time is
provided at no charge to this proposal by the Norwegian Polar Research
Institute.
