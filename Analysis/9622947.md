Abstract Quinto Professor Quinto will pursue problems in tomography and the
mathematical analysis of Radon transforms. Professor Quinto will develop
algorithms for limited data tomography. He will continue refining his own
algorithm (ERA) for the exterior Radon transform. His tests on real data from
industrial objects have been encouraging, but refinements are needed to detect
certain specific defects. He plans to develop a hybrid algorithm using his ERA
and a singularity detection algorithm. He will test these on rockets. Professor
Quinto will continue his research on finding effective dose plans for cancer
radiation therapy. His algorithm will utilize inversion of a dual Radon
transform and either projection onto convex sets or optimization. This applied
research uses ideas from Professor Quinto's pure mathematical expertise as well
as numerical methods. Using techniques including microlocal analysis, he will
prove limited data theorems for transforms with real analytic measures on real
analytic submanifolds including transforms on curves and surfaces in Euclidean
space and on geodesic spheres and general hypersurfaces in manifolds. He will
use these results to prove theorems in approximation theory, PDE, and complex
analysis. Computed tomography is used to detect defects in industrial objects.
Professor Quinto will develop and refine algorithms for industrial computed
tomography and test them on real CT data of rockets. The goal is to detect
cracks in rocket bodies, air pockets in rocket fuel, and delaminations in rocket
exit cones. His current algorithm works quite well but it does not detect some
types of rocket defects well enough. So, he will develop other algorithms that
will work in conjunction with his algorithm to get optimal reconstructions. He
will develop pure mathematics that will show how well the algorithms work and
where their limitations could show up. These pure mathematical underpinnings are
required to ensure that his (or any other) reconstruct ions are correct and are
not lucky guesses. In cancer radiation therapy, doctors irradiate tumors with
radiation from different directions. Professor Quinto will continue developing
mathematical algorithms that will tell doctors how to irradiate tumors,
depending on their location and other medical constraints. Here, too, pure
mathematics will be used to help determine good plans. This same pure
mathematics that provides the underpinnings of tomography is intriguing in its
own right, and the principal investigator will pursue some pure mathematical
questions for their theoretical importance. Such pure research has led to new
insights about applied problems.
