Commensal and parasitic protozoa will be identified from Dendrobates auratus
and Dendrobates pumilio, both wild caught in Costa Rica and captive bred.
Prevalence and density of infections will be recorded, and the fauna compared
between species under both wild caught and captive bred conditions. Protozoa,
(particularly the hemoflagellates and ciliates, opalinids and flagellates in the
rectum), will be identified to genus and species using light microscopy
(especially protargol impregnation), and scanning and transmission electron
microscopy. Protozoa will also be examined in histological sections. Little is
known of the protozoan fauna of threatened poison arrow frogs, and the project
results will: increase knowledge of their biology; enable their fauna to be
compared with that of other anuran families, increasing understanding of their
evolution; and allow more effective care and treatment of captive dendrobatids.
Descriptions of several new species of protozoans are anticipated, of particular
interest being the potentially pathogenic and poorly described diplomonads. The
project also furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for women
to advance their careers in science or engineering through research, and to
encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas through the
investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses. In this
project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second objective
include: participating in an outreach program, targeting high school minority
women interested in pursuing a career in life sciences; teaching an
undergraduate course in basic parasitology, emphasizing the impact of parasites
on human health; and teaching a graduate course on parasites of aquatic animals.
