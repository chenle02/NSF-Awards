*** ABSTRACT 9660214 Kumar This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project evaluates the feasibility of creating a generic, user-friendly optimal
robotic trajectory planning software that is robust, fully automated, and
capable of multi-degree-of-freedom optimization with path constraints.
Currently, no commercial software exists which can solve generic robot
optimization problems in a turn-key fashion. A differential inclusions technique
recently developed at Analytical Mechanics Associates (AMA) is ideally suited to
solve the robot trajectory optimization problem because the controls appear
linearly. Proving concept feasibility implies: (a) construction of a generalized
symbolic algorithm that creates the equations of motion of multi-degree-of-
freedom manipulators from user-provided mass and geometry data; (b)
representation of above equations in the differential inclusion format; (c)
evaluation of analytical partial derivatives of the resulting hodograph,
boundary, and path constraints with respect to the generalized states; (d)
evaluation of convergence robustness of the differential inclusion approach for
the entire class of open-chain manipulators and comparison to classical
variational and collocation techniques; and (e) obtaining optimal solutions for
high-degree-of-freedom manipulators via a special dense-sparse discretization
approach. Commercial applications include performance enhancement of
manufacturing processes such as spot welding, painting, and assembly, where
minimizing time and energy requirements map into millions of dollars saved in
direct manufacturing costs. ***
