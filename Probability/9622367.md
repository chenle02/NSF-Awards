9622367 Golden We propose to develop new analytical and numerical techniques
for investigating the behavior of a number of percolation models arising in the
study of high contrast composite materials. Some of the directions for
development include: (i) exploring the critical behavior of the random resistor
network in light of a new, direct correspondence with the Ising model, (ii)
analysis of continuum percolation models for porous media and matrix-particle
composites, (iii) developing a diagnostic method for non-destructively telling
whether one phase in a composite percolates or not, which could have
applications to the detection of material failure or quality control for
composite manufacturing, and (iv) modeling the transport of heat and brine
through sea ice, a porous medium. %%% A broad range of problems in materials
science involve composites which can be characterized by a high contrast in the
properties of the components. For such media, the effective behavior is often
dominated by the connectedness, or percolation properties of a particular phase.
Examples include porous media, doped semiconductors, smart materials such as
piezoresistors and thermistors, thin metal films (used in solar energy
production), oil bearing sandstones, fracture patterns in rocks and metals, many
structures in the human body, and sea ice (which plays a major role in climate
and is an indicator of global change). In the proposed work we will study
mathematical models of such materials. We anticipate that this project will
further our capabilities to predict the effective behavior of naturally
occurring or artificially made complex random materials, as well as aid the
development of composites designed to achieve novel or optimal properties. ***
