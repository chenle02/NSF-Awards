9724198 Stebbins This award provides partial (58%) funding for the acquisition
of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer that will be installed and
operated in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.
Stanford University is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for
the acquisition of the instrument. The NMR technique is uniquely capable of
yielding data on the local, molecular scale structure of material surfaces and
amorphous solids and liquids. The principal investigator, colleagues, and
graduate students at Stanford will use the new NMR spectrometer in a wide
variety of research projects including investigations of the structure and
dynamics of silicate and other oxide melts and glasses, the study of surface and
interface properties of ceramic materials, catalysts, electronic materials,
biomolecules, and organic polymers. This award is funded by NSF's Major
Instrumentation Program and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities. ***
