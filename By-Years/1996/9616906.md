Passaic County Community College requests support from NSF to connect it's
campus to the Internet. The College is a publicly supported associate degree
institution with a student body of 4000. The College intends to connect to the
Internet through Bell Atlantic, a local Internet service provider. The campus
needs the Internet connection to be able to access information resources
throughout the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the
faculty, staff students of this institution as well as the community in general.
The award provides partial support of the project for two years.
