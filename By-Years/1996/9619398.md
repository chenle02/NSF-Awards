Barnes/Abstract The objective of this research is the evolution of cumulus
convection as observed by research aircraft in two previous field experiments
(CaPE, 1991; CCOPE, 1981). Particular emphasis will be devoted to vertical
momentum transport during the cloud's life cycle and how the cloud, in turn,
modifies its near environment abouve the boundary layer. The results should
benefit those attepting to develop theories of cumulus convection.
