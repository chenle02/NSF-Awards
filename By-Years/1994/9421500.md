9421500 Cline Research will be carried out in nuclear structure and reactions
using low energy heavy ions, and in relativistic heavy ion physics exploring
quark-gluon degrees of freedom. The low energy experiments will focus on studies
of rotational and vibrational collective excitations, properties of deformed and
superdeformed nuclei, and the role and nature of the pairing interaction which
controls the behavior of systems at high angular momentum. Use will be made of
the new high-multiplicity gamma ray detector, Gammasphere, for some of the
measurements. Other experiments will continue the search for anomalous decay
lines in the spectra of electrons and positrons emitted during low energy
collisions of the heaviest nuclei (uranium plus uranium), which would be a
signature for physics beyond conventional and currently understood nuclear and
electrodynamical processes. In addition, a new program of detector development
will be started aimed at exploring the production of a quark-gluon plasma in
relativistic heavy ion collisions at the RHIC accelerator. This and related
experiments will test our understanding of the conditions under which confined
quarks are liberated and how these quarks and gluons interact to form hadrons.
All these activities are of high, current scientific interest within the nuclear
physics community. Development and construction of state-of-the-art detectors is
integral to this activity. Education of graduate students and postdocs is a
strong component of this grant to the University of Rochester Nuclear Physics
Group. ***
