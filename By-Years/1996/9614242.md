AST-9614242 Donald N. B. Hall Robert D. Joseph This award supports a portion of
the cost incurred by visiting astronomers conducting observations at the NASA
3-meter Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The IRTF is
operated as a national facility by the University of Hawaii's Institute for
Astronomy under a contract with NASA. By agreement between NASA and NSF, visitor
support costs are shared between the two agencies. The NSF portion is primarily
for support of visitors doing non-solar system research. Visitor support covers
accommodation and food service at the mid-level facility, cryogens, local
transportation, and partial publication costs.
