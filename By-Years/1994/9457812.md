In this project the work is focused on the design and implementation of
advanced set constraint based program analysis algorithms, and their application
to program optimization for a wide variety of programming languages. The basic
theory, key algorithms, implementation techniques, and applications of the areas
are simultaneously explored. Within the teaching plan, the constraint-based
program analysis system is further developed and disseminated in support of the
graduate programs. Work at the undergraduate level focuses on preparing students
to work in the software industry.
