Most primary producers synthesize fatty acids, which are essential in the diet
of many animals. Interest in the vital nutritional role of essential fatty acids
has drawn the attention of diverse fields such as agriculture, aquaculture, and
medical science. The human health benefits of essential polyunsaturated fatty
acids ('fish oils') have made headlines in the popular press. Still, the
potential influence of fatty acids on community and ecosystem ecology is
relatively understudied. This project will conduct experiments utilizing a model
aquatic food web to investigate two potential ways that fatty acids can
contribute to our understanding of food web processes. First, food rich in
essential fatty acids should promote higher growth and physiological condition
of consumers and thus support a higher trophic transfer efficiency than a system
dominated by primary producers low in these essential compounds.
&lt;br/&gt;Second, this project will rigorously test the potential for using
fatty acids as food web tracers. The proposed experiments will simultaneously
quantify both the effects of essential fatty acids on trophic transfer
efficiency and the potential utility of specific fatty acids as trophic markers
across three trophic levels: from algal primary producers, to herbivores, and to
predators. This project will also train two graduate students at the interface
of ecology and chemistry. At least one undergraduate student from an
underrepresented group will participate in this project each year.&lt;br/&gt;
