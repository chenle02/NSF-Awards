Electron spin resonance experiments with a JEOL RE-1X instrument will be
incorporated in an innovative project-based laboratory program. Students will
investigate the structure and reactivity of unstable chemical species having odd
numbers of electrons - free radicals and radical anions and cations - that are
implicated in many chemical and biochemical reactions. The project will upgrade
the research-style ESR projects for students in their junior and senior years.
It will replace a 30-year old vacuum tube instrument with a solid-state
spectrometer that is 100 times more sensitive and much easier to operate. The
combination of enhanced spectrometer sensitivity and easy operation will permit
all chemistry majors to study free radical species of chemical and biochemical
importance.
