Pagurus is a genus of shell-dwelling crustaceans, commonly known as "hermit
crabs". They are diverse and abundant around the world, and they have been the
subject of countless studies by ecologists and population biologists. The fact
that hermit crabs inhabit snail shells has probably directed the evolution of
their carapaces and appendages along certain narrow pathways, and this
phenomenon of convergence has produced a tangled taxonomy and classification for
the group. Dr. Patsy McLaughlin proposes an ambitious study of the 147 described
species of hermit crabs, in which she will describe larval, juvenile, and adult
characteristics. Rearing protocols will provide a wealth of new data on the
developmental pathways of individual species. The resulting data will form the
foundation for future analyses of evolutionary relationships within this group.
The proposed research will have a wide audience beyond the community of hermit
crab systematists. Marine ecologists and zoogeographers, functional
morphologists, developmental biologists, and a variety of other disciplines will
use the resulting evolutionary relationships as a framework for future
comparative studies. Evolutionary biologists will appreciate this study's focus
on how mechanical constraints of growth and function can channel the path of
evolution.
