This project aims at the synthesis of structurally stereochemically and
topologically well-characterized vinyl polymers using principally anionic
polymerization. The synthesis of stereoregular polymers involves the use of
Lewis acid type and other additives such as aluminum alkyls, lithium alkoxides
and cuprates that show promise in the stereoregulation process. They will also
explore the polymerization of sterically hindered monomers with the aim of a
better understanding of the role of monomer conformation and carbanion geometry
in the stereoregulation process. They also anticipate that polymers of this type
will exhibit interesting conformational properties including helicity. The
second part of this research deals with the synthesis of macrocyclic homo- and
block copolymers including well-characterized macrocyclic polystyrene using
capping methods designed to minimize side reactions occurring at extremely low
carbanion concentrations. These macrocyclic polymers will be characterized by
several methods including: 1H and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and the
corresponding T1 relaxation measurements, Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC),
viscometry, and light scattering. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
measurements are of special interest since they have shown that the molecular
weight vs glass- transition temperature profiles are completely different for
linear and cyclic poly(2-vinylpyridines). Collaborative efforts with several
investigators will center on structure-property relationships for physical
properties such as melt viscosity and electron microscopy.
