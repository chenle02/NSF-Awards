The research of the planned I/UCRC for Sensory Sciences and Innovation aims to
support basic and applied research in several areas across the spectrum of
chemosensory science, providing a focal point for industry-university
collaboration. The planned center targets new understanding through multi-
disciplinary, cross-cutting research of such topics as how flavors and
fragrances influence memory, cognitive function and mood; the full range of
benefits of flavors and fragrances in fighting infection (e.g., citral),
supporting immune function and protecting food against spoilage (e.g. rosemary
oil). The center vision seeks to transform the sensory sciences by integrating
the discovery and characterization of taste and flavor molecules, with the study
of their physiological and psychological mechanisms, to ultimately understand
their effects on human behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flavor and fragrance
industry represent a $ 23 B sector of the U.S. economy and is a critical driver
of innovation across a broad range of consumer and industrial products from
foods, beverages, and medicines, to personal care, home care and cosmetics. The
planned I/UCRC?s holistic approach will likely lead to greater insights than the
?piecemeal? approach that is typically practiced in this field. Moreover, in
cooperation with industry partners, the Center will establish a blueprint for
training students and workers as multi-disciplinary sensory scientists.
Partnering with industry will foster the rapid translation of this new knowledge
into the next generation of innovative goods and services, resulting in broad
societal impacts.&lt;br/&gt;
