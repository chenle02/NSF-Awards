This award from the Synthesis Program will support a "Workshop on Organic
Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry." This workshop has the dual purpose of
providing an effective forum for informal discussion among young academic and
industrial scientists on current research in topical areas of organic synthesis
and natural products, and assisting the Program staff in identifying emerging
areas and researchers. This process, in turn, will aid the Program in long-range
planning. The specific goals of the workshop include: 1) Providing an
environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis, natural
products, and bioorganic chemistry. 2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation
among individuals working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative
efforts. 3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods in
synthetic and natural products chemistry. 4) Improving awareness of potentially
valuable applications of new methods and strategies in synthesis. 5) Increasing
diversity at high-level meetings. 6) Creating an atmosphere in which the
scientific and social interaction among participants will be both stimulating
and pleasant.
