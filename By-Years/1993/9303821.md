Experimental research is being pursued on transient effects dealing with the
transport of current and heat pulses in magnetized plasmas and turbulence
studies dealing with coherent structures in fluctuating magnetic fields. These
processes address fundamental plasma properties which are essential for
understanding transport in plasmas, and they are of broad interest in inertial
and magnetic fusion, pulsed power, and for active experiments in space plasmas.
The proposed work will be performed in a large, controlled laboratory plasma
with excellent diagnostic capabilities. Pulsed currents are imposed with
electrodes, particle beams and induced by magnetic antennas. The transport of
these currents by electromagnetic waves such as kinetic Alfven waves, whistlers
and beam modes will be studied. Heat pulses are generated with pulsed, intense
rf fields of magnetic antennas. The heat transport in nearly collisionless
plasmas cannot be described by classical diffusion models but may involve double
layers and non- Maxwellian distributions. Using directional velocity analyzers,
emissive electric field probes and vector magnetic field probes moveable in 3
dimensions will yield a detailed picture of fields and particles. Magnetic
turbulence will be investigated from the thermal level to that of the ambient
field. It is excited by current fluctuations in particle beams forming coherent
rf structures at cyclotron harmonic frequencies or by instabilities such as
beam-generating whistlers and lower hybrid turbulence in high-beta plasmas.
Using conditional averaging, a special statistical technique employing digital
oscilloscopes, coherent magnetic structure can be resolved in a turbulent field.
Fields and particles in such "islands" will be mapped so as to study transport
processes on a microscopic scale. Refined plasma diagnostic tools and techniques
will be developed. Such detailed experiments are expected to advance the
knowledge of basic plasma properties, have i mplications to the various uses of
plasmas, and train students in modern experimental plasma physics.
