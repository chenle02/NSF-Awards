9320103 Sarikaya The objective of this symposium is to explore the present and
future ways of determining physical and chemical properties of complex
nanostructured materials at spatial dimensions at scale less than 100 nm. This
is accomplished by convening an international group of experts from widely
different areas of science into a common platform. The characterization means
include light, X-rays, and electron imaging, diffraction, and spectroscopy
techniques, scanning probe microscopies, and other techniques that probe the
samples at a nanometer scale. A specific aspect of the symposium is its
multidisciplinary character covering widely differing fields of materials
science, including solid state physics, chemistry, and biology, and its
international array of researchers working on metals, intermetallics, ceramics,
polymers, composites, biological materials, semiconductors, superconductors, and
other electronic, magnetic, and optical materials. %%% Processing materials to
produce nanoscale structures offers the possibility of developing unique
properties in a wide range of materials. This symposium addresses the
characterization of these materials, which is important to understanding their
processing, quality and behavior. ***
