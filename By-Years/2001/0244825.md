This proposal from the University of Washington group discusses a program of
continuing work on two hadron collider experiments: D0 at the Tevatron at the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC), CERN, Geneva. The focus on the D0 experiment is on the physics analysis
including Standard Model (SM) physics of top quark and W boson studies, bottom
quark (b) physics including rare decay measurements and the search for the Higgs
particle. With studies for physics beyond the SM, the group will be working on
searches for light Supersymmetric Particles. The group will also work on the
design, fabrication and installation of the Run 2b Silicon Tracker Detector. On
ATLAS, the group has already manufactured a large number of drift tubes for the
Forward Muon Chamber system and will work on the fabrication and installation of
the tubes at CERN. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group maintains an
education/outreach involvement with teachers, participating in both the QuarkNet
and WALTA programs. The group has been successful in recruiting underrepresented
minority undergraduates for technical projects and is committed to continuing
this effort.&lt;br/&gt;
