9217413 Giedroc The collective research interests of the primary investigators
concern the study of peptide and protein structure and molecular recognition.
The mode of metal coordination and overall structure of two gene regulatory zinc
metalloproteins (zinc-finger proteins) which interact with nucleic acids will be
determined. Conformational studies of bound substrates and structural changes
which result in autophosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human
insulin receptor are proposed to study catalysis by this class of enzymes. NMR
structural studies of nucleated -sheets and model -sandwich proteins are planned
to understand the fundamental rules that govern the formation of -sheet
secondary structures in proteins. Finally, structural studies of synthetic
conformationally constrained peptidomimetics of bio-active peptides, e.g.,
opiate antagonists and active site peptides as candidates for viral protease
inhibitors, are proposed. The request NMR instrumentation will be a component of
the Center for Macromolecular Design of the Institute of Biosciences and
Technology at Texas A&M University. As a major goal of the Center is the
recruitment, support, and teaching of outstanding undergraduate, graduate, and
postgraduate students, the proposed instrumentation will be used to enhance and
expand their educational experience in the area of protein structure.
