This Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models training award affords the
student the opportunity to take a year of additional course work at Stanford
University in formal and empirical training. The funding is for nine Ph.D. level
classes in three different methodologies: game theory, experimentation, and
computational modeling. The course work will strengthen the student's research
skills as he undertakes research on his dissertation on the diffusion and
perseverance of false ideas (the condition of confidently holding false beliefs)
about public affairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award has the broader social
value of enhancing understanding of the perseverance of misinformation. It also
strengthens the research and teaching skills of this future member of the
professorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
