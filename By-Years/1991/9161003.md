The steadily increasing consumption of seafood and the relative decline in
harvest from the capture fishery is expected to lead to increased importance of
aquaculture production of edible fish in the U.S. and throughout the world.
However, increased production of marine finfish will require improvements in
hatchery production of larvae, which is currently hampered by an inadequate
supply of larval food. The rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, is an important food
for larval fish. Specialized nutritional requirements of rotifers and fish
larvae increase their production costs. The difficulty in supplying sufficient
quantities and qualities of rotifers is a major impediment to larval fish
production. This research is to develop low cost, high quality feeds for the
mass production of rotifers by using heterotrophically grown microalgae. the
development of these feeds should significantly decrease costs of producing
rotifers, while at the same time improve the larval fish survival rates and
overall of finfish production.
