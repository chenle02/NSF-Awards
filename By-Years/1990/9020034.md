The evolutionary transition from reptiles to mammals took place during the
Triassic Period, and higher vertebrate fossils of this age are studied
intensively. Dr. A.W. Crompton has the unprecedented opportunity to study
Triassic fossils of early mammals and mammal-like reptiles from the People's
Republic of China. The specimens will be taken on loan to Harvard University
where closely-spaced sections through the skulls will be cut and recorded on a
computer-based image analysis system. The sections will be integrated by the
computer into a three- dimensional reconstruction, revealing new morphological
features of the cranial interiors. The data to be gathered during this study
will have direct impact on the several competing hypotheses that seek to explain
the origin (or origins) of mammals from reptiles. Evolutionary biologist,
vertebrate anatomists, and paleontologists will find the results of this study
of interest. The project will also improve scientific collaboration and exchange
between the U.S. and China.
