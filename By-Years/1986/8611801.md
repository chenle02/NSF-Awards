The goal of this research is to determine fundamental bounds on estimating the
shape and acoustic properties of a given medium by using acoustic sensors. This
research has applications in the imaging of biological tissue and nondestructive
evaluation and robotics. Included in the research is the development of a 3-d
model, a study of the dominant effects of diagnostic transducer arrays on
paramenter estimates, and the application of 2-d transducer arrays. This
research renews previous research conducted under grant no. ECS-8307782.
