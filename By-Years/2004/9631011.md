9631011 Anderson This research involves an in-depth analysis of public opinion
during the 1996 Nicaraguan national election. In the last Nicaraguan election of
1990 voters defeated the socialist Sandinista incumbent who had governed the
nation since the 1979 revolution and installed Violeta Chamorro and UNO, an
administration committed to a capitalist, democratic regime. Analysis of survey
data from 1990 demonstrates that voters based their decision not only on
concerns present in established , democratic elections, such as the candidates,
the economy, and the issues - but also on an assessment of the governing
legitimacy of the Sandinista regime. the continuing instability and polarization
of Nicaraguan politics in the 1990s, much of which surrounds the creation of a
new Constitution, indicates that the 1996 election may also focus upon questions
of regime legitimacy as well as on candidates, the economy, and specific issues.
The upcoming election thus offers a chance for extensive examination of vote
choice in a transitional democracy where regime legitimacy has already proven to
be a significant electoral issue in deposing an entrenched government. The
election also offers an intriguing opportunity to contrast voters' concerns
about the legitimacy of a capitalist democratic regime in 1996 with the types of
concerns raised with respect to a socialist democratic regime in 1990. The
research pursues this broad contrast and numerous more specific concerns by
collecting new public opinion data prior to and immediately following the 1996
election and comparing its results with the 1990 data. At a broader and more
comparative level, the findings of the project point toward critical questions
that will prevail in comparative politics over the next generation of research:
Do voters judge and interpret regime legitimacy and the role of the state
differently in capitalist versus socialist democracy? What concerns predominate
in new post-socialist democracies and in new post-authoritaria n democracies and
how do these compare with concerns in established democracies? In its transition
process and in the contrast between 1996 and 1990 Nicaragua offers one of the
first opportunities to study the electoral dynamics that may define politics in
other new democracies over the next decade. ***
