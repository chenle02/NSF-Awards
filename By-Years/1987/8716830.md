This proposal requests funds from the National Science Foundation to purchase
equipment for computer and information science and engineering research in the
Department of Electrical Engineering at Virginia Tech. The requested equipment
will provide researchers with a high quality integrated circuit design system.
The three principal ivestigators have recently joined the faculty and wish to
initiate computer engineering research that requires such a VLSI design system.
The capability is presently not available to the researchers. The requested
equipment is a VLSI design system consisting of workstation hardware and design
automation software. The equipment will be used initially by four projects that
span a range for research areas. Two projects will use the system to design
circuits for use in development, analysis, verification, and empirical studies
of design for testability and test generation techniques. The third project
ivestigates to use of digital and analog processing on a single chip for a
biomedical computing application. The remaining project involves the design of a
communications processor for use in multicomputers. The equipment will provide
capabilities to allow the investigators to contribute to the university and the
national technology base. The equipment will significantly increase the capacity
for research in the areas of VLSI design, computer-aided design and test, and
systems architecture.
