In this project a graduate student in anthropology will conduct ethnographic
research in Bogota, Columbia. The researcher will interview street vendors,
observe street vending, and get information from government agencies and vendor
organizations. The project will investigate the nature of the relationships
between street vendors (the "informal" economy) and public and private officials
and others in the "formal" economy. The research will seek to explain how street
vending persists and flourishes through its relationships with complementary
economic institutions, and how vendors are able to amass capital. The research
will analyze how social position, access to resources, and the use of
personalized relationships favor capital accumulation by vendors. Vendors will
be chosen from three districts of the city: a central location, a contraband
market in a poorer section, and a middle-class market for luxuries. This project
is important because the relation between the formal and informal economies of
societies is a critical issue of modern development. The informal sector is
growing and dynamic in most countries of the world, yet most economic theory
pertains to formal sector activity. This project should help us understand these
relationships in one developing country.
