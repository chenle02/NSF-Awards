9313345 Zwier This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University
in the purchase of a Raman/fluorescence instrument. This new instrumentation
will enhance the research in a number of areas including the following: Pump-
probe studies of radical reaction dynamics under tribological conditions, time-
resolved Raman spectroscopy of intermediates in inorganic electron transfer
reactions, transient Raman studies of porphyrin-DNA exciplexes, and waveguide
Raman spectroscopy as a probe of orientational order during and after corona
poling of molecularly doped and functionalized polymer films. The spectrometer
will also be used to collect dispersed fluorescence spectra of molecular
clusters in a supersonic jet and for Raman studies of zeolite anchored
bimetallic complexes for catalytic applications. %%% A Raman laser spectrometer
can provide important information about molecular structure, molecular
interactions and molecular dynamics in solution and on surfaces. This sort of
information is necessary for a basic understanding of chemical reactions.
