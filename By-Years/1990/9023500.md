This research investigates problems of bioremediation (trichloroethylene
degradation by methane-utilizing bacteria) and trace gas cycling (utilization of
the greenhouse gases methane and methyl halides by methylotrophs). Laboratory
experiments to study substrate utilization kinetics and regulation will be
coupled with studies of field samples to assess the methylotrophic populations
(with gene probes), compare the substrate utilization kinetics, and determine
how the natural populations respond to perturbations such as changes in growth
rate or nutrient concentrations. Predictive models will be generated from the
laboratory data, tested with field samples (soil and water), then refined by
further laboratory work and retesting. This comprehensive approach will define
how these activities are expressed in natural samples and result in
mechanistically-based predictive models with immediate applications to
bioremediation and global trace gas modeling.
