The PI will study measurable orbit spaces. What is common to these spaces is
that they are probability spaces; the points (or states) of such a space are
linked into classes which one calls "orbits" and these orbits have a large-scale
geometric or combinatorial structure. This structure could be the structure of
the orbit of a countable or continuous group action or could be the structure of
a binary tree of inverse images of some finite to one endomorphism. This
structure could take the form of a topology or more strongly a metric on the
orbits or could be a tree or graph structure with the states as nodes of the
graph. The PI has developed a range of methods to investigate large-scale
statistical properties on such spaces of orbits and to study notions of
equivalence of these structures that allow for distortion or rearrangement of
the orbits. The goal of this study is to extend these methods to as broad a
perspective as possible and to apply them to answer interesting and significant
questions. These methods have a significant history. They have allowed one to
extend the Ornstein Isomorphism theory for Bernoulli automorphisms to
endomorphisms (joint work with C. Hoffman) and give a tool for lifting large
parts of the theory of actions of Z to actions of general discrete amenable
groups (joint work with B. Weiss) via an orbit transference method. This
proposal suggests an array of natural directions to proceed. The generalization
to trees of inverse images of endomorphisms can be pushed to a study of trees or
graphs in general and various geometric notions of similarity of such trees.
Recent work indicates ways to effectively generalize to non-singular and even
singular dynamics. One can also generalize both the labeling space and the index
space to be continua, leading to a study of Brownian motion as the continuous
analogue of a uniform endomorphism. Work to date, and the work proposed will
continue to advance our understanding of measurable dynamics and of measurable
orbit structures more generally. Such structures are common in mathematics and
other hard sciences.

Ergodic theory and measurable dynamics have their roots in thermodynamics,
celestial mechanics, probability theory, and functional analysis. They have
applications within mathematics to algebra, combinatorics, and number theory
geometry, probability and statistics. Outside of mathematics, there are
applications in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering and genetics. The
training of graduate students is central to this proposal as well. The PI, the
Department and the University of Maryland have demonstrated a strong commitment
to diversity and to the proper training and mentoring of students. 1
