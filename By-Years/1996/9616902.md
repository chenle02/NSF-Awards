9616902 Santamarina Wave emission is the sudden release of energy in the form of
transient waves. Electromagnetic and mechanical waves provide different and
complimentary information about source mechanisms and material properties
inherent to the medium. The emission of electromagnetic waves is supported by
the principle of energy conservation, Le Chatelier's principle, and energy
coupling phenomena. Preliminary tests conducted on intact rock specimens showed
evidence of electromagnetic emissions. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
explores the significance of energy coupling and electromagnetic emissions in
selected rocks and soils. Experimental materials will be selected to isolate or
highlight specific emission requirements. Results will be interpreted within the
context of hypothesized emission mechanisms, fulfilling energy balance. Emphasis
will be placed on coupling mechanisms that justify emissions in the radio-
frequencies so that waves have significant penetration depth through
geomaterials to allow for remote detection (including piezoelectricity, charge
separation, and double layer polarization. Complementary research tasks include
the enhancement and calibration of the monitoring system, and the
characterization of signatures from pure failure modes in rock. ***
