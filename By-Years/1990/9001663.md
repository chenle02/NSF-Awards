The principal investigator will continue his important work on the partial
differential equations that arise in various areas of continuum mechanics. In
particular, he will apply advanced mathematical tools to study the general
theory of multiphase thermomechanics as it relates to interfacial dynamics and
phenomena involving melting and freezing. He will also investigate some unusual
partial differential equations that are found in flows through porous media and
in biological dispersal. The work of the principal investigator concerns the
development and study of mathematical models that attempt to describe such
complicated physical phenomena as the growth of crystals with facets and
corners, the evolution of a melting-freezing wave, and more generally the
creation of ordered structures in media through the action of curved fronts that
move through the media. As an example, think of trying to describe
quantitatively what happens if you draw a hot wire through a block of ice. It is
a complicated process involving melting and re-freezing, which is difficult to
study because the boundary between the melted and unmelted ice is so sensitive
to the temperature of the wire and other factors.
