Support is provided for the DIMACS workshop "Data depth: Robust multivariate
analysis, computational geometry and applications" at Rutgers University. The
workshop brings together theoretical and applied statisticians and computer
scientists to promote and further the use and development of depth functions in
nonparametric multivariate analysis. Data depth has applications in and
connections with a number of different research areas, such as aviation safety,
data compression, image analysis, data mining and analysis of genetic data.

The workshop addresses significant open conceptual issues and establishes
perspective on applications. It also sets primary directions for further
research, emphasizing the role of computational geometry in understanding
concepts of and developing algorithms for data depth.
