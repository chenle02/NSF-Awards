The proposed project seeks financial support to support students participation
in the International Nanotechnology Conference on Communication and Cooperation
(INC) to be held at the Hilton Fukuoka Sea Hawk in Fukuoka-city, Fukuoka, Japan,
on May 11-13, 2015. The event will address research areas in nanotechnology,
nano-optics and nanoelectronics. Academics and industry leaders will be able to
interact on the latest issues in nanotechnology and the links with related
areas, such as biotechnology, advanced materials development, microsystems and
photonics will be explored. The conference's broader impact will be on
applications and products in the areas of computers, communication and consumer
industries. The conference will contribute in overcoming fundamental limits of
nanotechnology and will promote international collaboration in nanotechnologies
between Europe, Japan and the United States.
