&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will target Focus area I by examining
preschooler's acquisition of the emergent literacy skills that provide the
foundation for skilled reading in elementary school. Children from low-income
backgrounds and families in which Standard English is not their first language
face particularly high hurdles as they transition into early reading
instruction. Moreover, teachers' understanding of the developmental processes
involved in learning to read are critical for successful implementation of
literacy curricula and successful use of formative assessment to tailor
instructional strategies to children. Following on these needs this project will
provide teachers with state of the art research based knowledge about how
emergent literacy skills are directly linked to, and form the foundation for,
skilled reading in the elementary school. Additionally, the project will provide
important data on the validity of assessment procedures used to inform
curricula.&lt;br/&gt;
