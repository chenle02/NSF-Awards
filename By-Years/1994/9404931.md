9404931 Taqqu The engineering of circuit switched networks is well understood
because it is based on over 70 years of practical experience. The
telecommunication industry, however, is moving rapidly toward widespread
deployment of high speed networks and there is considerably less experience in
the engineering and operation of these networks. We will investigate models for
packet traffic in high-speed networks that exhibit characteristics which have
gone unnoticed in the teletraffic literature in the past. These models will be
based on an in-depth statistical analyses of actual traffic measurements from a
number of existing packet networks. Moreover, high speed networks produce
enormous amounts of data. Statistical techniques that can characterize such data
sets will be developed. ***
