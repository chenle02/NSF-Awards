CCR-0215394 GC: A merger of the workshops on Generative and Component-based
Software Engineering (GCSE) and on the Semantics, Applications and
Implementation of Program Generation (SAIG) Walid M. Taha, Yale University, P.I.

This document requests funding in the amount of $9K for a pilot joint event of
two previously independent workshops called GCSE and SAIG. Both GCSE and SAIG
are forums for publishing research generative techniques. GCSE focuses on
generative techniques from the software engineering point of view, and SAIG from
the formal and programming languages point of view. The pilot joint event,
called the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Generators and Components (GC'02)
will be held in October 2002, in Pittsburgh, PA. The event will replace GCSE and
SAIG this year. If this experiment is successful, the result will be a regular,
three-day joint conference bringing the two communities in one consolidated
forum.
