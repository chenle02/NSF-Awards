The objective of the study is to develop the science base required for
succesful plasma sintering of ceramics. The approach taken is to explore the
plasma parameters-RF vs. microwave, gases, dopants, steady-state vs. pulsed
power input, etc., the interaction of the plasma with the material surface and
the sintering kinetics as functions of the plasma parameters, specimen
composition, heating rates, etc. The potential of plasma sintering could be
extremely great, and this technique could be very important to the global
economic competitive position of the United States, if it can be developed for
ceramics of technical interest such as aluminun oxide, zirconium oxide, etc. It
offers the potential for extremely high sintering rates for certain geometry
products-i.e., thin walled tubes, small diameter rods, leading to very high
production rates and possibly unique microstructures, as a result of the rapid
sintering process.
