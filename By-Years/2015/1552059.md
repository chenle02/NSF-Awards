The goal of this workshop is to bring together American and Brazilian cyber
security researchers to discuss the main challenges of the field, and to promote
cross-collaboration and the building of ties among the attendees. The workshop
will be organized in two meetings, one in Brazil in the fall of 2015, and one in
the US in the spring of 2016. The attendees will be comprised of about 35
American and Brazilian researchers in cyber security and privacy in universities
in the US and in Brazil.

This workshop promotes innovation in solving cyber security and privacy
problems, by having the top researchers from both countries, from several sub-
fields sharing their research and brainstorming solutions for open problems in
the area. Having a scientific discussion on cyber security and privacy with
Brazilian academics can increase the visibility and applicability of American
technology in other countries, and increase the diversity of students applying
to undergraduate and graduate programs in the US. Brazil is a large a diverse
democracy with significant scientific strengths, and this proposal helps improve
connections between the two countries. Additionally, this workshop will
strengthen the US-Brazil Bilateral Cooperation on Education, which includes the
Brazil Scientific Mobility program, which has funded almost 30,000 Brazilian
students at various levels in American educational institutions.
