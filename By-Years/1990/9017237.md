The PI will investigate ductile deformation of polymineralic rocks with
emphasis on evaluating inter and intragrain heterogeneities. Among polycrystal
plasticity theories used to model deformation, the viscoplastic self-consistent
theory is particularly attractive for anisotropic rocks. As a model system the
PI plans to investigate first quartz in quartzo feldspathic rocks and use the
development of preferred orientation as an indicative parameter in comparisons
of models with experiments and naturally deformed rocks.
