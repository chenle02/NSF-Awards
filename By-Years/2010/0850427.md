The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Polar-orbiting
Operational Environmental Satellite System Integrated Program Office (NPOESS
IPO) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S.
Department of Commerce (DOC), have entered into an interagency Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) for the purpose of establishing direct reception at McMurdo
Station, Antarctica, of environmental operational satellite data from the future
NPOESS polar-orbiting satellite fleet and from related international
collaborator satellites.

NSF and NPOESS IPO have agreed that each agency benefits from increased
bandwidth and data transmission from McMurdo Station, Antarctica to the United
States. Provisioning occurs in two major phases: (a) Phase 1 ? implementation of
10 Mb/s symmetric bi-directional satellite transmission service for exclusive
NSF use and (2) Phase 2 ? implementation of 60Mb/s / 20 Mb/s (outbound/inbound)
asymmetric bi-directional services. Phase 1 allows NSF earth station resources
to be reconfigured for Phase 2 service while maintaining continuity of NSF
mission communications. This funding action addresses services delivered and
managed by NPOESS IPO to NSF during Phase 1, with service description, terms,
conditions, and pricing addressed in a Program Service Level Agreement.

Responsibilities and funding arrangements required for Phase 1 and Phase 2
implementation are documented in an Implementation Plan, which is a requirement
of the MOA.

NPOESS IPO has agreed to an annual Phase 1 services cost of $1,000,000. Service
commenced on 1 January, 2008 for Fiscal Year 2008. The pro rata cost for the
period 1 Jan 2008 ? 30 Sep 2008 is $750,000.

The proposed annual funding totaling $750,000 is recommended for award to NPOESS
IPO. There are no prior awards from NSF to NPOESS IPO under the MOA for this
activity. The annual award under a new interagency agreement will start the
cumulative tracking at the recommended award funding of $750,000.
