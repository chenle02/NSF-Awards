Technical Narrative: This proposed workshop, organized by the American
Meteorological Society in conjunction with the African Academy of Sciences, is
scheduled for 11-14 December 1992 in Nairobi, Kenya. This workshop immediately
follows the First International Conference of the African Meteorological Society
to be held 07-11 December. As the focus of the Nairobi conference is the Africa
drought, attendance will provide an invaluable resource for the workshop
participants toward the formulation of the drought research agenda. This
proposal supports the attendance of 16 scientists from the U.S. and Africa
(eight each from the U.S. and Africa). This workshop to plan future
collaborative research activities fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Africa
to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence.
