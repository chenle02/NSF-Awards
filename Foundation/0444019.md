We are proposing a conference in mathematical logic to be held in October 8-10,
2004 at te University of North Texas. This will be during a two year period of
special focus in logic by the mathematics department at UNT. We anticipate a
conference of a fairly inclusive nature covering a variety of fields within
mathematical logic.
