This SBIR Phase II research addresses a computational environment for optimal
dimensional management of components and assemblies. The approach couples a
genetic optimization method with a Monte Carlo based tolerance test. Both
tolerance ranges and nominal dimensions are included as design variables. The
goal is to generate the minimum cost assembly which meets all design and
manufacturing considerations, which may be formed as constraints or as multiple
objectives. Successful application of the technology will dramatically reduce
product development times and manufacturing cost. Current tolerance analysis
software does not allocate tolerances or modify nominal dimensions in an optimal
fashion. Traditional nonlinear programming methods are insufficiently robust to
solve the highly nonlinear, multimodal problem resulting from the consideration
of a "real" component or assembly. The combination of the genetic algorithm with
a tolerance analysis package has the advantage of efficient operation on a
parallel or distributed computing network. This research is directed toward
increasing algorithmic efficiency and reliability for both the genetic optimized
and the tolerance model simulation.
