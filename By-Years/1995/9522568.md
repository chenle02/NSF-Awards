9522568 Campins A unique opportunity to study a particularly interesting comet,
2060 Chiron, is at hand. Comet Chiron is now near perihelion (February 1996) and
will be at its brightest in 51 years. Simultaneously, the European Space
Agency's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), which is scheduled for launch in
September 1995, will be making observations of Chiron during its 18-month
mission. A coordinated ground-based and space-based study of Chiron, and two
other comets, will be carried out. The combination of frequent ground-based, and
high sensitivity space-based, infrared wavelength observations, will yield
extensive information about these three comets. The ISO observing time for these
comets has already been assigned to the team. The following items describe the
main goals of the research. 1. Characterization of Chiron's variability in the
infrared wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The usefulness of
ground-based observations in support of ISO arises mostly because the time
assigned on the ISO satellite to observe Chiron (and most other targets) is not
sufficiently long to characterize their infrared variability, and observing time
by the ISO satellite will be spent mainly obtaining observations which are not
possible using ground-based telescopes. 2. Theoretical thermal models of
Chiron's nucleus will be tested. a.) Thermal-infrared observations of Chiron's
nucleus before and after opposition can reveal which of those geometries
presents the cooler morning terminator, and hence distinguish between prograde
and retrograde rotation by detecting temperature changes. b.) Frequent
observations before and after perihelion can be used as a diagnostic of a number
of nuclear characteristics, including the pole orientation. 3. Observations of
secondary targets. Similar, but necessarily less detailed studies of Comets
d'Arrest and Kopff, will be carried out. These two comets will also be observed
by ISO, and will b e well placed for observations in 1995-1996.
