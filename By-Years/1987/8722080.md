Experiments will be carried out by Professor Van Harlingen to determine noise
sources in ultrasmall area tunnel junctions and macroscopic quantum dynamics in
Josephson superconductor devices. Superconductor devices have served important
functions as sensitive detectors and amplifiers for research. Equally important,
superconductor devices and thin film structures have proven to be valuable test
systems for studying a wide range of important physical phenomena in condensed
matter systems including quantum effects, localization, non-linear dynamics,
chaos, phase transitions, and fluctuations. Two problems in particular will be
studied, discreet charge trapping fluctuations, which are a major source of low
frequency noise and will allow investigation of the kinetics and interactions of
localized defect traps in amorphous materials, and quantum dynamics of
macroscopic systems, which study will encompass the effect of dissipation on the
evolution of quantum states and the validity of quantum mechanics and quantum
measurement theory to complex physical systems.
