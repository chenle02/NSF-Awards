Minorities are significantly underrepresented in science and engineering fields
in the United States. To attract and retain capable minority students requires
the development of programs which motivate and encourage them toward science and
engineering. This project is designed to involve students in hands-on research
activities in the NAPI (Navajo Agricultural Product Industry) under the guidance
of professionals. The project has the following distinctive objectives:
Increasing the understanding and effectiveness of problem-solving, information
processing and decision-making analysis related to water, land, human resources
and environmental protection for irrigated agricultural systems. Training and
encouraging Native American, Hispanic and other minority students, as well as
women, to complete graduate work and pursue engineering and agricultural
economic careers in the development and application of technology to improve
resource management. Implementing a teamwork learning environment that includes
undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and an outside corporation
(NAPI). Collaborating institutions and organizations, in addition to Colorado
State University, are the Navajo Agricultural Product Industry, Fort Lewis
College College, and the University of Souther Colorado.
