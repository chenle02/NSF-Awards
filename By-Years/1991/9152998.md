A local area network of graphic-oriented microcomputers, a database server
machine, document scanning and printing devices, and software is being
configured as a laboratory model of a small office system together with
capabilities for software development. The laboratory supports instruction of
computer science in three areas: (i) office system development: hands-on
experience using and developing systems for a "real" office environment; (ii)
software engineering: use of graphic CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering)
tools including prototyping tools; and (iii) human-machine interaction:
development of software using visual forms and direct- manipulation, input and
processing of forms, pictures, and voice data, and use and development of
systems for collaborative work. The laboratory supports junior and senior level
laboratory-oriented courses in the three subject areas for majors in computing
and information sciences, and electrical and computer engineering. Students in
the office automation laboratory serve as "users" of software for the software
development laboratories. Office software includes desktop publishing,
electronic messaging, and a shared information system for personnel and
accounting data. This laboratory provides undergraduate computing science
experience from program development to information systems development.
