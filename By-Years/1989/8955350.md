The Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, OH and the Science and
Technology Interactive Center in Naperville, IL collaboratively plan to develop
a series of interactive exhibits on nuclear and particle physics that will
convey to a wide audience an understanding of the fundamental nature of the
universe and of the basic rules that underlie that universe. The purpose is to
lead the visitors from the perceived complexities of our surroundings to an
unperceived simpler features of the subnuclear world. The collaborators propose
to develop two duplicate copies of eight exhibits, with one copy for display at
each of the two institutions. They also look to making the plans available to
other science centers inexpensively and on a copyright-free basis. An added
feature of the project is the collaboration between the Center of Science and
Industry, an established science center, and the Science and Technology
Interactive Center, an emerging one.
