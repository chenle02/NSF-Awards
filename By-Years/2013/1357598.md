The project seeks to develop new methods for modeling, estimation, and inference
in panel data models with a factor error or approximate factor error structure.
This error structure has roots in economics and finance, and the usual additive
individual effects and time effects are special cases of this structure.
Explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved factors and factor
loadings.

Ignoring this correlation leads to inconsistent estimates. The PI will develop a
generalized Mundlak projection that is an alternative to the traditional
Mundlak-Chamberlin projection for dealing with this correlation. The generalized
projection is an improvement on the traditional method, and the result may be
improvements in how to handle correlations between explanatory variables and
unobserved effects.

The broader impacts of this research are largely from the potential use of these
methods in more applied settings; panel data are widely used for policy
evaluation.
