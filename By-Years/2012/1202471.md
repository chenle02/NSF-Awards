The objective of this program is to transform the observed 2-3 orders-of-
magnitude enhancement of two-photon absorption (2PA) in direct bandgap
semiconductors using extremely non-degenerate (END) frequencies into photonics
device technologies. In the proposed research, radically new device ideas for
optical detection and switching will be explored that are made possible by this
new discovery. This research is transformative in that the enhanced 2PA results
in improved performance, and the types of devices made possible are new and
unique. END 2PA greatly decreases the required irradiances needed for such
devices. The combination of huge enhancements in 2PA and nonlinear refraction
opens up a new realm of possibilities for photonic
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The intellectual merit is that using END
nonlinearities for photonic device applications allows a large reduction in the
irradiances needed for nonlinear optical devices. This opens up a new realm of
2PA-based devices as well as great potential for improvement on existing
2-photon based devices. This research will help determine the ultimate limits
for these types of nonlinear photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader
impacts are, besides funding the training of two Ph.D. students who will benefit
from the rigorous graduate curriculum in Optics and Photonics at CREOL, that the
large increase in nonlinear response enabled by END configurations has the
potential to impact several fields beyond nonlinear optics, including detection
and imaging, telecommunications and semiconductor lasers. The PIs also aim to
increase the number of students from under-represented groups making use of the
many connections and programs offered by our university.
