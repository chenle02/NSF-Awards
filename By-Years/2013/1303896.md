Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI will collect samples to extend the
magneto-stratigraphic record of late Cretaceous sediments of the James Ross
Basin, Antarctica. RAPID support will allow him to take advantage of an
invitation from the Instituto Antartico Argentino (IAA) to participate on an
excursion to James Ross Island in the Antarctic Peninsula. The PI hopes to
collect samples that will refine the position of several geomagnetic reversals
between the end of the Cretaceous long normal Chron and the lower portion of
Chron 31R. The Brandy Bay locality targeted by this expedition is the best place
in the basin for calibrating the biostratigraphic position of the top of the
Cretaceous Long Normal Chron, which is one of the most reliable correlation
horizons in the entire Geological Time Scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The top of the Cretaceous long normal Chron is not properly
correlated to southern hemisphere biostratigraphy. Locating this event will be a
major addition to understanding geological time. This expedition will provide
opportunities for an undergraduate student. This project is based on a
productive collaboration with an Argentine scientist.
