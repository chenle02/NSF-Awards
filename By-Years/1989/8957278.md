Hill The long range focus of this research is on the performance evaluation and
implementation of multiprocessors that are easy to program, provide orders of
magnitude more computing power, and can be implemented cost effectively. The
principal thrust of this work is on the design of cache memories, with specific
tasks on the development of multiprocessor compilers, the implementation and
semantics of address translation, the implementation of coherent shared memory
in systems with multiple caches, the interaction between cache design and
implementation factors, and the future effectiveness of cache hierarchies. The
focus of the research during this period is on the completion of the study of
cooperative shared memory, the continuation of the work on the Wisconsin Wind
Tunnel, and the study of operating system modifications to take advantage of
variable page sizes.
