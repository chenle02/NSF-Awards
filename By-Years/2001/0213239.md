EAR-0213139&lt;br/&gt;Feigenson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of
Geological Sciences at Rutgers University will purchase a new multicollector
mass spectrometer with funds provided jointly by the National Science Foundation
and Rutgers University. This instrumentation is crucial for isotopic analyses
required in three major projects currently supported by NSF: Central American
volcanism (Continental Dynamics/MARGINS/Subduction Factory), New Jersey drilling
(Continental Dynamics and ODP), and Biocomplexity (Ocean Sciences). The new
facility for radiogenic isotope analysis will complement recently acquired
stable isotope and noble gas mass spectrometers in the department. It will also
replace the currently operating, aging TIMS, a VG Sector single collector, which
was put into operation in 1986 and has served its purpose well over the past 15
years. The ongoing research projects in Central American volcanism and Late
Cretaceous to Holocene sea-level and global climate change will be greatly
augmented by the new instrumentation, and will allow a significant increase in
the number of samples analyzed. The Central American studies will enhance our
understanding of volcanic processes in an active arc system, and in the future
may increase our ability to predict volcanic eruptions. The New Jersey drilling
program and the biocomplexity research focus significantly on global climate
change, and thus have direct impact on an important scientific, social and
political problem.&lt;br/&gt;***
