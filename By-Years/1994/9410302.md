9410302 Kerk This Research Initiation Award involves the application of
biomechanical models in the field of ergonomics toward the goal of reducing
human pain and suffering, reducing costs associated with work-related accidents
and overexertion injuries, and reducing production costs by improving work place
design. The specific objectives are to: complete the theoretical development of
the three-dimensional, static, biomechanical model combining the comprehensive
effects of strength capability, stability, and coefficient of friction, develop
the computer software to evaluate the model by mathematical programming methods
to deliver numerical solution, perform bench top evaluation of the model, and
facilitate industry interaction and classroom evaluation of the model to assure
the relevancy of the research. This research has potential utility for any
situation in which humans exert forces on an external environment. Potential
settings will be found in industry, aiding the disabled, rehabilitating injured
workers, and athletic performance. ***
