The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research
and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) have entered into an agreement to have CRREL
provide engineering consultation for Antarctic operations. The purpose of this
award is to provide funding for 3 members of CRREL to make a site visit to
Antarctica to assess Antarctic conditions and advise NSF management in the
following three areas: * Life Expectancy Prediction for South Pole * Feasibility
Study on Hard-Surface Runway for McMurdo and South Pole Stations. * Waste
Management Study for Antarctic Stations. Upon completion of the site visits,
CRREL will submit a new proposal to NSF for additional funding. The acting
program manager recommends funding of this action.
