9457206 Doumanidis The research addresses the issue of simultaneous, real-time
regulation of part geometry and thermal field, in thermal rapid prototyping, by
redesigning the process arrangement and implementing a scanned thermal
actuation. In thermal rapid prototyping, both the material supply, by a wire
feeder or spray, and heat transfer, by a plasma or laser source, need to be
modulated during the process as successive layers of material are deposited or
removed from the part surface. The layer profile geometry and thermal
distribution on the product surface will be measured by a laser vision system,
and an infrared camera respectively, and used for feedback to the thermo-
geometrical controller. This will adjust the material and heat source intensity
and guide their motion on dynamic trajectories to the areas where their action
is needed most, so as to obtain the desired geometric tolerances, the material
structure and properties, and stress effects in the part. The calibrated
controller will be implemented experimentally on several rapid prototyping
techniques, i.e. laminated object manufacturing, laser milling, fused material
deposition and thermal spray deposition. The research will also be coupled to
supportive teaching activities, enriching the thermal manufacturing curriculum
at the university. These include the establishment of a graduate manufacturing
automation seminar with guest lectures and industrial sponsorship. A series of
motivating introductory courses will also be developed, with multidisciplinary
manufacturing content and hands-on prototyping projects, in the laboratory.
