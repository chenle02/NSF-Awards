This mathematical research project will develop and apply theoretical and
computational tools to systematically search for extreme behavior in solutions
of some of the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. The goal is to derive
precise predictions of physically significant quantities from first principles
and understand the underlying nonlinear dynamical mechanisms. The work
capitalizes on recent developments of the Principal Investigator, collaborators,
and other scientists to implement ideas from optimal control theory and the
calculus of variations to find flows achieving maximal mixing, optimal
transport, or other extreme dissipation. Transport, mixing, and dissipation are
among the most fundamental features of fluid flows and they are of foundational
significance for important applications ranging from microfluidics engineering
to climate science and astrophysics. The control and optimization techniques
adopted here constitute novel computationally aided analysis approaches to these
problems. This project directly involves advanced training for graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers under the Principal Investigator?s direction at the
University of Michigan.

The research is centered on studies of qualitative and quantitative properties
of solutions of partial differential equations in fluid mechanics including the
Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion equations. The investigator employs modern
applied analysis and scientific computation in collaboration with graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Michigan, and with
other researchers elsewhere. The four major components of the work are: (1) to
study qualitative and quantitative properties of solutions to advection-
diffusion equations and determine limits on mixing in terms of features of the
stirring flows with an ultimate goal of understanding mixing effectiveness of
turbulence; (2) to utilize new optimization schemes to investigate extreme time
averages in nonlinear dynamical systems and investigate their implications for
classical models of Rayleigh-B?nard convection; (3) to implement computational
optimal control methods to search for maximal enstrophy production in the three-
dimensional Navier-Stokes equations; and (4) to apply the analysis and
computation techniques to other nonlinear and/or stochastic dynamical models
from interdisciplinary applications in biology, chemistry and physics.
