1254754&lt;br/&gt;Contreras&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes establishing
new approaches for understanding and "reprogramming" RNA-mediated regulatory
circuits in vivo. These not well defined networks are essential for the
coordination of cellular processes in response to changes in environmental
inputs and are vital for survival under high-stress conditions. It is proposed
to map and characterize a regulatory network in Zymomonas mobilis using a method
developed in the PI's laboratory and to investigate a model regulatory RNA that
was found to differentially express based on oxygen levels. The proposed
research is scientifically significant because it will provide new fundamental
insight into how large-scale molecular networks that involve both RNAs and
proteins operate in the context of the cellular machinery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI will focus educational efforts on
attracting and retaining underrepresented students to engineering by (i)
creating a "Raising Future Scientist" program for students and their families,
(ii) developing a new course to present bioengineering in the context of
significant world problems, and (iii) continuing commitment to the existing
undergraduate research program.
