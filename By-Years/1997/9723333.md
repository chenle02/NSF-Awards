9723333 Weeks The primary goal of the research is to elucidate components and
mechanisms of regulation of the carbon concentration mechanism in this alga. The
work originates from the detection of gene CAH3 through genomic complementation
of a high CO2-requiring mutant strain. Additional genes are being isolated
following this screen. A C02-responsive promoter will be used to construct a
gene cassette that allows screening for a selectable marker in another approach
to defining mutants in the signal transduction chain leading from CO2 sensing to
gene expression. These mutants will be characterized.
