The manner in which the growth of each of the component parts of the human
skull--the face, neurocranium, and basicranium--interrelates and affects each
other has been a problem in physical anthropology which has alluded complete
understanding for a long time. A variety of experimental techniques has been
used on laboratory animals, but knowledge gained has not always been applicable
to humans because of unique features in human growth. This study will
investigate a so- called natural experiment--the intentional binding of the
cranial vault by various groups of American Indians--to determine whether
intentional binding, which retards growth of the bound part, affects the growth
of the other components of the skull. Although artificial cranial deformation
has been studied in the past, conclusive answers to this question have not been
forthcoming due in part to the use of inadequate measuring techniques. This
study will utilize a relatively new analytical technique, finite element
scaling, to measure and evaluate differences between deformed and non-deformed
crania from the same skeletal series. The data obtained in this study will be
important in evaluating various hypotheses about the relationships of the
cranial components.
