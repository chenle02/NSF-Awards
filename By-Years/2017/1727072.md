This award will be used to acquire a high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV)
system for conducting state-of-the-art fluid imaging at San Jose State
University. High-speed PIV is an advanced technique that uses a combination of
laser light and cameras with high frame rate to map the flow field. The system
includes stereoscopic PIV for measuring three-dimensional velocity components
and two-color microscale PIV for imaging two-phase microfluidic systems. This
advanced instrumentation will facilitate innovative research on wide-ranging
critical applications, including biomedical devices, biochemical analysis, and
sustainable heating, ventilation and air conditioning technologies. In addition,
the PIV system will be integrated into educational activities and student
projects at both undergraduate and graduate levels to enhance hands-on student
learning in microfluidics and computational fluid dynamics courses. Sharing the
PIV system with interested researchers on campus and other regional
organizations will foster scienti&amp;#64257;c
collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The high-speed PIV system will enable high-
impact experimental research in biofluid mechanics, turbulence and
microfluidics. Examples of research projects enabled by the proposed instrument
are as follows. (1) Investigation of the hemodynamic performance of novel
trileaflet mechanical aortic valves for improving the design of next-generation
prosthetic aortic valves. (2) Study on turbulence in natural ventilation and
effects of naturally-occurring wind turbulence on the exchange rate of air in
buildings. (3) Study on stent thrombosis to understand the relationship between
wall shear stress near stent struts and thrombus formation. (4) Investigation of
micro-droplet stability in constricted channels using two-color microscale PIV.
(5) Study of particle mobility through porous media for the development of
electrophoretic ink technology. The success of these research projects will rely
on the acquisition of the proposed high-speed PIV system.
