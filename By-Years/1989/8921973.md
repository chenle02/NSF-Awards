This award will support an interaction between: 1) glacial response, 2) sea-
level variations, and 3) climate, around the margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet
in the vicinity of Hudson Strait and Frobisher Bay, Eastern Canadian Arctic. The
focus for the investigation includes two major moraine forming intervals, the
Hall and Frobisher Bay moraines, that are C-14 dated at greater than 10.3 and
ca. 8.4 thousands years respectively. The former may be coeval with the Younger
Dryas stadial of NW Europe; the latter is a major event (Cockburn Substage)
around the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet. Studies on mass physical properties,
texture, pollen, and diatoms will be undertaken on a series of lake cores. One
of the critical problems in arctic lake studies is C-14 dating of sediments with
very low organic contents. This problem will be investigated by: 1) comparisons
between AMS dates on macrofossils and bulk sediment dates; and 2) studies to
document the C-14 inventory of two small lake basins which include sampling
soils, raised marine sediments, water, and lake sediments.
