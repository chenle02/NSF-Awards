This research will contribute to the development of an instantaneous algorithm
for active structures that include viscoelastic dampers and active bracing
devices (hybrid structures). Nonlinear behavior of the structural members shall
be considered. The research will show whether the hybrid active structure
reduces the demand on the magnitude of active control forces. The objectives of
the research include the investigation of active control forces at three stages:
(a) for an elastic structure with the hybrid system before structural
optimization, (b) for a nonlinear structure with the hybrid system before
structural optimization, and (c) for a nonlinear structure with the hybrid
system after structural optimization.
