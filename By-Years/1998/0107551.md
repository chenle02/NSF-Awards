This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the
Effects of Hurricane and Fire Disturbances on the Population Dynamics of South
Florida Slash Pine." Fires and hurricanes are frequent disturbances affecting
community structure and dynamics of pine forests in the southeastern US. This
research is developing spatially explicit, individual-based models of pine
population dynamics, parameterized from empirical data that include hurricane
and fire disturbances. The models are to be used to predict how pine populations
will respond to hypothetical disturbance regimes associated with global change.
