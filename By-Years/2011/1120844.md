The applicant proposes to perform experiments on the brains of lungfishes that
will determine if they are the closest living relative to the ancestor of all
land vertebrates, including humans. Brain organization, particularly the
organization of the forebrain, provides valuable clues to the biology of an
animal and to taxonomic relationships among animals. Further data on brain
organization in lobe-finned fishes is critical, as some early member of the
lobe-finned fishes gave rise to the first land vertebrates. Living lobe-finned
fishes include the coelacanth and the lungfishes; most are relatively rare,
almost all are threatened; and coelacanths are impossible to obtain on demand.
Experimental studies comparing coelacanth brains are therefore not feasible.
Current opinion holds that lungfish brains are highly aberrant, but the
applicant has generated a new model of forebrain organization in the African
lungfish. This model suggests that forebrain organization in lungfishes is far
more similar to that in land vertebrates than has been recognized. He now
proposes to test three hypotheses inherent in this model by using biological
tracers to reveal certain features of lungfish brains. He will compare these
features with those in amphibians (the first land vertebrates). If his
hypotheses are valid, then lungfishes are the living lobe-finned fishes most
closely related to the ancestor of all land vertebrates, and their forebrain
organization can be used to infer forebrain organization in the common ancestor
of lungfishes and land vertebrates. This work will provide insights into how
vertebrate nervous systems have subserved new mechanisms of behavior and change.
Data from the project are expected to reveal a robust adaptive strategy for the
central nervous system, extending back to the earliest land vertebrates. The
data will also provide valuable new information about the first land animals for
neurobiologists, evolutionary biologists, paleontologists and general vertebrate
biologists.
