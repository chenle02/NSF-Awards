The XVIIth International Congress of Genetics provides a major opportunity for
a unique, broadly based, large group of scientists who work on all aspects of
genetics to meet. The remarkable technical explosion that has occurred in
genetics in the last few years has had an enormous impact on both basic and
applied aspects of the field. Tremendous strides have been made in understanding
the structure of genomes from the level of DNA sequence and topology through
chromosome organization and nuclear architecture. The roles genes play in whole
organisms to produce unique patterns, determine sex and organize and regulate
function in neural systems will be explored. The explosion in information
concerning mechanisms has been paralleled by a geometric rise in the number of
known genes. In a similar fashion, areas of understanding in population genetics
and evolution have dramatically increased often by the application of molecular
techniques to classical problems and the use of computer modeling systems.
Finally, the new industry of biotechnology has been spawned by the advances in
basic genetics. %%% The theme of the Congress will be "Genetics and the
Understanding of Life". Papers will be presented on the structure, behavior,
evolution, pathology and engineering of genomes al all levels of biological and
phylogenetic organization. There will also be sessions on the historical,
philosophical and social aspects of genetics. This meeting , the first in five
years, will provide a unique setting for the synthesis of general concepts
arrived at in a broad set of diverse organisms and systems.
