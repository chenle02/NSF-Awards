The purpose of this research is to use a "state of the art" instrument for
fluorescence spectroscopy. Such instruments are widely used in biomedical
research to study ligand binding to macromolecules, protein adsorption,
association of different proteins, protein denaturation, and macromolecular
conformation and dynamics. This instrument will be used by the Department of
Bioengineering and the Center for Biopolymers. Seven principle investigators
have formed a cooperative to use this equipment is a wide range of projects such
as studies of: blood-material compatibility, materials for soft lens,
biomaterials and devices for cardiac research. This instrument will be easily
accessible and available to all researchers in the College of Engineering.
