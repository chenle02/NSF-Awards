Efforts will be made to correct various deficiencies in our knowledge of
transition metal hydride complexes. The question of whether H-H distances
intermediate between the short (dihydrogen) and long (classical hydrides) are
possible will be addressed experimentally. Relative reactivities of the three
types of hydrides will be examined with respect to deprotonation, loss of
hydrogen, and fluxional exchange with terminal hydrogens. Synthetic efforts
aimed at stabilizing the theoretically predicted trihydrogen complex will be
initiated. Studies of strong X-H and X-X interactions within the coordination
sphere of the complex, fluxionality mechanisms, and preparative studies will be
continued. %%% In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Robert H. Crabtree of Yale
University will continue studies of transition metal hydride complexes. These
complexes are very likely important intermediates in catalytic hydrogenation
reactions. The knowledge gained through these studies may have implications in
the important areas of catalysis and energy storage.
