9631786 Tahernezhadi This proposal involves hardware and software design
projects for undergraduate electrical engineering students with the aim of
helping persons with disabilities. The projects will benefit individuals with
communicative impairment, including speech disorders, phonetic disorders, and
inability to communicate due to motor disabilities. Among the devices to be
developed are a software system allowing a child to practice pronunciation of
word lists with minimum adult supervision; a voice communicator to be used in
emergency situations without the need of American Sign Language or a TTY device;
and wireless communication devices permitting a child to summon help when the
caretaker is unavailable. Through their work, the students will gain valuable
engineering problem-solving skills, learn to appreciate their educational
experience which enabled them to assist persons with disabilities, be encouraged
to continue their education in the field, and be better prepared for the
competitive job market. Before the actual hardware implementation, computer
simulations will be carried out by students to validate their designs. These
computer programs will be used to demonstrate the projects to potential
engineering students and high school graduates at events such as National
Engineers' Week and college open houses. Such demonstrations will attract new
students into engineering and will allow the public to have a better
understanding of how engineering schools are serving the local community. ***
