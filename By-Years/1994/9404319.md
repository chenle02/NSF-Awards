A low-temperature and high-magnetic field facility is requested for combination
with existing optical and quasi- optical measurement configurations to enable
the exploration of electrodynamics of various novel electron states of solids.
The facility is a He3 system combined with a 9T magnetic field which is provided
by a split ring magnet. A conventional He3 system will be employed (together
with coaxial cable and wave guide access configuration) in the radio to
millimeter wave spectral range. In addition, optical access (provided by
specially designed optical windows) will be provided for spectrometers operating
at submillimeter wave to infrared frequencies. The facility will be used to
measure the frequency dependent complex conductivity under circumstances when
the energy related to the applied ac field hw , the thermal energy kT and the
energy associated with the magnetic field BH can be varied over substantial
ranges. Experiments will be conducted on interacting electron systems mainly in
their broken symmetry ground states. %%% This research has developed a variety
of measurement techniques which allow the exploration of electrodynamics of
solids in an extremely broad spectral range, from audio to infrared frequencies.
In this proposal, funds are requested to acquire a low-temperature and high-
magnetic field facility in order to expand measurement in region and to a host
of phenomenon that cannot be studied previously for metals. These facilities are
used to study the properties of various novel materials having
