Professor Branka Ladanyi is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of solvent
effects on chemical reactions. This research will help to provide a deeper
theoretical understanding of the factors which influence and enhance chemical
reactions in solution. Professor Ladanyi plans to use a combination of integral
equation approaches and computer simulations to study solvent effects on the
rates of chemical reactions. The work will focus on three specific topics: 1)
solvent effects on the activation barrier for torsional isomerization; 2)
solvent effects on the transition state for bimolecular reactions of ions and/or
polar molecules in polar solvent mixtures; and 3) dynamic solvation, i.e., the
transient response of the solvent to a charge transfer electronic transition of
a probe molecule.
