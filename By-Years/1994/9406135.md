9406135 Bebout This award provides three years of support for a technician who
will be dedicated to assisting operations in the stable isotope and noble gas
geochronology laboratories in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences
at Lehigh university. The technician will assist in the maintenance and
operation of the two laboratories, will assist visiting researchers and students
who have limited experience in the use of the instruments, and will assist the
Principal Investigator in developing new geochemical analytical applications of
mass spectrometry. Research and teaching in the two laboratories include studies
of mass and energy transfer in the Earth's crust, with a focus on shallow
crustal environmental and on problems of the deeper- seated tectonic settings of
metamorphic and igneous petrology. ***
