The PI proposes to test a new acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) which has
the potential, for the first time, to provide real-time monitoring of currents
throughout the entire ~1500 m of water column that overlies Axial caldera. If
successful, this instrument will be of broad use to the community with important
applications spanning quantification of rising methane-and biologically-rich
plumes at sites of gas hydrates, to monitoring changes in currents along
continental margins impacted by ocean acidification and anoxia
events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
