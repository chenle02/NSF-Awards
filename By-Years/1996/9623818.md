9623818 Jacobsen This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
refine the CVD processing window for beaded fiber, and develop the window for
crenulation free fiber. The resulting products will be used to fabricate various
composites, which will then be tested relative to their normal crenulated fiber
counterparts. Crenulation-free fiber is expected to impart improved and more
reliable thermal and electrical transport properties to its composites. The
beaded morphology is expected to give composites improved mechanical
reinforcement, with reduced crack propagation, and greater flexibility in matrix
choice due to its ability to physically interlock, rather than chemically bond,
with a matrix. This research effort seeks to define manufacturing process
variables for the control of vapor-grown carbon fiber (VGCF) morphology.
Previous efforts demonstrated that the properties of individual fibers depend on
the degree to which they exhibit a morphological feature called crenulation.
Further, it has been shown that the severity of crenulation can be increased by
certain modifications in the manufacturing process. In the extreme, mild
crenulations give way to a novel morphology with well-defined beads, scattered
along the fiber's length. The VGCF morphologies under development would
mechanically reinforce composites, and provide improved thermal and electrical
properties. Such composites would be employed in the automotive and aerospace
industries, where their low densities give them a very high weight adjusted
figure of merit. They would also be used in the electronics industry. The fiber
is also being studied specifically for use in low-friction bearings, and as a
reinforcement to tire rubber.
