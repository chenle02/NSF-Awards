Research on a novel parallel computer memory accessing scheme is proposed in
answer to the computer industries drastic need for an accessing mechanism which
allows an unlimited number of processors to simultaneously read and write to a
central memory in fractions of a microsecond per cycle. The proposed system
consists of a business parallel architecture which will allow simultaneous
parallel communications between an unlimited number of processors and/or a
global memory. The proposed system will provide a significant leap in technology
and will prove crucial to the international race to build the next generation
computer. The key structural element of the accessing scheme will be modeled,
fabricated, and tested to determine significant operating parameters. The
results of the tests will be used to determine commercial viability.
