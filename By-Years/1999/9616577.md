w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9616577 Cummins This experimental project will
advance the fundamental understanding of phase transitions, and critically test
theoretical models, using advanced methods of laser light scattering
spectroscopy. Specifically, the liquid-glass transition will be studied, with
emphasis on the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the physical mechanism
underlying the liquid-glass transition. The quantitative comparison of the
measurements with theory will focus on, but not be limited to, the Mode Coupling
Theory, which provides a detailed set of predictions for the dynamics of
supercooled liquids and their evolution with temperature. The critical
evaluation of the several theories will include, in addition to the light
scattering data, data from collaborating groups using neutron scattering,
dielectric susceptibility, and molecular dynamics techniques. %%% This project
