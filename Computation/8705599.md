An interdisciplinary research group will be established at New York University
devoted to the development of new numerical methods for the study of quantum
field theory (primarily lattice gauge theories) and critical phenomena. The
group will consist initially of Professors Jonathan Goodman, Alan Sokal and
Daniel Zwanziger, a post-doctoral fellow, and two graduate students. A special
strength of the group will be the cross-fertilization between the three
disciplines represented by the researchers: numerical analysis, quantum field
theory, and statistical mechanics. This collaboration has led to the development
of the multi-grid Monte Carlo method, which shows great promise for radically
improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo method. The major project of the group
will be to continue the investigation of this method. A second project will be
to develop new algorithms for computing the fermion propagator in a background
gauge field; this is a key step in numerical studies of lattice gauge theory
with fermions. In addition, the group plans to continue its investigations of
algorithms for dynamical fermions, for the random-resistor problem, and for the
self- avoiding random walk.
