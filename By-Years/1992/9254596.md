The Harvard Graduate School of Education seeks funding to establish the
Mathematics Case Development Project: Converting Barriers to Bridges(MCDP) - The
objective of this project is to develop teacher preparation materials in the
form of teaching cases and teaching notes that will enable prospective teachers
to explore important mathematical concepts in depth while encouraging the
development of desirable teaching practices. The project also will offer
seminars and specific dissemination activities for mathematics educators to
learn about this approach. The 2 1/2 year project will produce 18 written
teaching cases and accompanying teaching notes on a range of 5-12 mathematical
concepts identified by researchers and practicing teachers as particularly
difficult to teach -- including especially those areas where human intuition
often fails the mathematics student. Teams comprised of teacher educators and
mathematicians from Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts, Boston
and the University of New Hampshire and practicing teachers will join to
develop, pilot and revise the case materials. The (MCDP) Project will have a
potential impact on novice mathematics teachers, with a possible extension to
experienced mathematicians and mathematics teacher educators, and the larger
teacher education community.
