Abstract ATM-9529109 Crowley, Thomas J. Texas A &amp; M University Title:
Comparative Study of Phanerozoic Glaciations In order to develop a proper
understanding of glacial periods, it is necessary to examine in parallel all the
well known glacial periods in Earth history. Because we are at different levels
of understanding with respect to each of the four glacial periods of the last
billion years, different problems have to be addressed foe each of the glacial
periods. This award supports the examination of the following problems: (1)
Pleistocene - effect of vegetation and aerosols on land-sea temperature
differences during the last glacial maximum and modeling the penultimate glacial
maximum; (2) Carboniferous - modeling the response to changes in orbital
insolation forcing to determine whether there is an abrupt transition in the
amount of simulated snowcover; (3) Ordovician -- modeling the effects of
geography as the Gondwanan supercontinent migrates across the paleo South Pole;
and (4) late Precambrian -- coupling an ice sheet model with a energy balance
model to determine whether large decreases in solar luminosity can cause
glaciation in low latitudes. These exercises will help clarify a number of
important climate questions and ultimately help lead to development of an
uniform theory for glacial periods in Early history.
