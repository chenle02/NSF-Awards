The BD Hubs foster regional networks of stakeholders and cooperate nationally on
US priorities of importance to a region and to the nation. The activities of the
BD Hubs contribute to a vibrant national data innovation ecosystem. The
Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub serves as a uniquely neutral entity within
this ecosystem, harnessing the data revolution by building strategic
partnerships that advance innovative solutions to a broad range of societal,
scientific, and industry challenges. This vision is empowered and strengthened
through the Hub's collaboration with a diverse community of partners, including
underserved populations, world-class institutions, and people of all backgrounds
who rely on or are impacted by big data.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Leveraging the
distinctive characteristics and challenges of the northeastern United States,
the Northeast Hub will design and facilitate multi-disciplinary, community-led
activities and initiatives such as: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Aggregating and
helping to develop best practices for responsible data science; &lt;br/&gt;-
Creating frameworks for data fluency; &lt;br/&gt;- Fostering better management
of data security and privacy; &lt;br/&gt;- Integrating health data from
traditional and novel sources; &lt;br/&gt;- Improving education through big
data; and &lt;br/&gt;- Reducing barriers for data sharing within and between
different sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
