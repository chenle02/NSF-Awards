This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project will
create a new salmonella sensor combining two established tools in biodetection:
hydrodynamic chromatography and magnetic nanoparticle (MP) conjugation. The
proposed sensor will be significantly less expensive and provide faster
detection time with equivalent sensitivity compared to current techniques. The
project will develop this sensor by exploiting the connection between the MP
magnetic orientation, fluid behavior and volume characteristics. Functionally
coated MPs will be combined with a salmonella aptamer biomarker in a
microfluidic channel. A magnetic profile of the solution will be measured using
ultrasensitive giant magnetoresistance sensors. The MP magnetic profile will
change in the presence of the biomarker due to modification of the MPs?
hydrodynamic volume. The goal of the Phase I program will be to demonstrate this
difference in magnetic profiles. Successful completion of the program will
result in a prototype sensor for food safety applications in the Phase II
effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential
of this project could include food safety and medical applications. In the
sizeable food processing industry the sensor is a highly efficient contamination
monitor leading to dramatic improvements in food safety by preventing
distribution of contaminated products. While the initial sensor will be designed
for salmonella, the sensor is also extensible to other biomarkers and could be
envisioned as a critical point-of-care sensor in the medical industry. The
National Science Foundation?s mission will also be carried out by having
graduate students and postdoctoral researchers participate in the program,
exposing them to industry while developing new knowledge and honing their
research skills.
