This award will allow the acquisition of analog and digital recording and
monitoring equipment which will be used in the University of Wisconsin Modeling,
Information Processing and Control (MIPAC) Facility. The purpose of this
equipment is to develop and improve mathematical modeling and control techniques
through studies which combine mathematical analysis, development of computer-
based simulation, and comparison of data taken from laboratory models developed
in the MIPAC Facility's Model Development Unit with comparable data derived from
computer models.
