This award supports Southeastern Regional Yeast Meeting (SERYM) to be held March
9-11, 2018 on the campus of Rhodes College in Memphis, TN. SERYM provides a
forum for discussion of topics in yeast molecular and cellular biology, such as
transcription and RNA processing, signal transduction and growth control,
chromatin remodeling and epigenetics, chromosome dynamics, telomere biology,
genome integrity, DNA transactions, damage and repair, RNA metabolism, and cell
cycle regulation. A multi-level perspective is provided by also including
posters and presentations on yeast molecular ecology and evolutionary
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The regional meetings in a compact setting, with
small overall participation (&lt; 125 expected) and high attendance by
undergraduate researchers, many from the EPSCoR states or from predominantly
undergraduate institutions, offer an excellent opportunity for student
researchers to report their findings and exchange scientific ideas with more
senior scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
