The research has two parts: systems software and applications. In the systems
software area, the inherent complexity and cost of communication and
synchronization between distributed processors is studied. This work includes
advanced implementations of communication software in experimental parallel
architectures, including tools for generating specially-tailored communication
mechanisms for particular parallel applications. The goal is to understand how
best to support communication in future systems. Collaboration with researchers
in other scientific fields to develop application programs that effectively use
the capabilities of today's high-performance parallel computers is the goal of
the applications aspects of this project.
