This research aims to expand and redefine the role of prediction-based
techniques for parallel and distributed systems. First, we reduce barrier
synchronization overhead by predicting the final producer of a&lt;br/&gt;value
before the barrier. This producer identification allows the consumer to
speculatively proceed past the barrier, only waiting on the actual production as
needed. Second, we introduce the slipstream&lt;br/&gt;paradigm to multiprocessor
systems. A redundant version of each parallel thread runs concurrently, its
execution reduced by speculatively removing long-latency events, such as shared
memory writes. The reduced thread dynamically detects sharing patterns, which
are used by the original thread to optimize its coherence and synchronization
actions, improving overall performance. Finally, we investigate the use of
producer-validated message prediction to reduce traffic in a message-passing
environment. Both the producer and the consumer of a message predict its
contents, using redundant prediction histories. Since the producer knows the
results of the consumer's prediction, it need only send those data that were not
correctly&lt;br/&gt;predicted. This traffic reduction is significant in
environments in which communication is much more costly than computation, such
as networked embedded systems. These three avenues of research represent an
excursion into new frontiers of prediction-based technology, resulting in
parallel systems that scale to new levels of availability and
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
