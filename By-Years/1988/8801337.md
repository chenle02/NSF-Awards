This award will support Prof. J. P. Draayer of Louisiana State University in
collaboration with Prof. O. Castanos of the Universidad Nacional de Mexico
(UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico. The objective of the research is to develop a
microscopic picture of collective modes that characterize nuclei. The
researchers intend to pursue: 1) the development of a shell-model theory for a
collective model of potential energy surface phenomenology; 2) a study of the
expansion and contraction mechanisms of Lie algebras and how they can be used to
gain a better understanding of the microscopic-macroscopic duality that nuclei
display; and 3) the development of a many-particle theory of strongly deformed
odd-A nuclei, that is, a shell-model theory that reproduces Nilsson model
phenomenology and perhaps more. The researchers have had a previous history of
successful collaboration. This joint effort combines the strengths of the
Mexican research group in theoretical physics with the LSU expertise in the use
of group methods in applications to physically interesting (experimental)
phenomena. The planned research should help to bolster one to the relatively few
groups in the U.S. doing theoretical low-energy nuclear structure work.
