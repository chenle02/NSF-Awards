The research is aimed at using high resolution and microsampling techniques for
isotopic studies of two types of ore deposits with which the PIs have extensive
experience - MVT-type deposits of the North Pennine orefield and the Cornubian
base metal province. Emphasis will be placed on developing the analytical
technology to use isotopic methods as a means of under- standing the scale,
timing, and causes of hydrothermal fluid circulation in the continental
lithosphere and the role of fluids in effecting mass transfer and intracrustal
differentiation. Integration of (a) multi-isotopic (Nd, Sr, Pb, O, H, N, Ar, S,
C) studies of individual minerals, (b) Sm-Nd dating of key minerals, (c) Ar-Ar
dating of small, fine grained minerals, and (d) Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr dating of fluid
inclusions. The goal is to determine source reservoirs of hydrothermal fluids
and their interactions with crustal rocks and their role in mineralization. The
strength of the proposal lies in the integration of so many different isotopic
systems, which to date has been limited by lack of technological developments.
The Michigan lab is well equipped for most of the proposed work.
