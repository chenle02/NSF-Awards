Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organizing a
workshop for faculty members and other professionals to discuss pedagogical
practices and instructional strategies for teaching engineering leadership
courses. The workshop is focusing on curriculum content as well as strategies of
instruction to enable students to learn the key principles associated with
engineering leadership. Workshop discussions include strategies for: 1)
developing inquiry skills on the part of the student; 2) developing ways to
ensure self-explanation or self generated elaboration by students; and 3)
creating experiences either simulated or real, which will motivate problem
solving, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge generation and construction by
students; and (4) developing good reasoning and discovery learning on the part
of engineering students. Strategies for evaluating and assessing engineering
programs are also being addressed in the workshop. Dissemination efforts include
publishing online materials that can be posted to various websites (e. g., the
NSDL, the Center for Engineering Leadership and Learning site, and the NAE CASEE
sites) and presentations and publications at the American Society of Engineering
Education and Frontiers in Education Conferences.&lt;br/&gt;
