Two research areas will be investigated for this effort. The first research area
comprises studies related to the design of homogeneous aerosol reactors in which
small particles are generated in a gas under controlled conditions. In
particular, the principal investigator will conduct studies of aerosol formation
by mixing gases containing chemically reacting components, and will study the
scale-up aerosol reactors, with particular reference to temperature effects. The
second research area comprises investigations of heterogeneous reactors in which
catalytically active particles react at surfaces. The principal investigator
will complete experimental studies of reactions of soot particles deposited on
filter fibers and will develop suitable theoretical mechanisms to explain the
experimental results.
