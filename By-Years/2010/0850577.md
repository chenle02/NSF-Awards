In the Williams College SMALL REU program, for nine weeks each summer, about 23
undergraduates will work in groups of about four on original research with about
6 faculty, for the summers 2009-2013. Topics of research include stick knots,
topology of particle collisions, multivariable continued fractions, completions
of local rings, random matrix theory, manifolds with density and isoperimetric
problems, class groups of global fields, ergodic theory, and eigenvalue
distribution of various classes of random matrices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this REU is to introduce undergraduates to the excitement and challenge
of doing original research in mathematics. In the process, students naturally
learn lots of background and are encouraged to present as well as publish their
work, all invaluable for graduate school. The variety of mathematical activities
provides a rich intellectual environment. Our nation needs a wider appreciation
and understanding of mathematics, and cannot afford to leave anyone out. We have
increased the numbers of women and minorities participating in the program over
the last five years, and we are continuing to look for new and better ways to
encourage applications from women, minorities, first generation college
students, and other underrepresented groups. The PI for this proposal is a woman
and the co-PI is Hispanic. Students, faculty and the broader mathematics
community will benefit from the presentation and publication of original
research. Students will develop a lifetime network of peers and many of them
will pursue graduate studies, partially because of their REU experience.
