NSF undergraduate education programs, particularly TUES (Trnasforming
Undergraduate Education in STEM), provide support for curricular innovations,
basic education research, and also support applications in STEM education
pedagogy, faculty development, and improvement of education assessment methods,
yet few proposals for these funds are submitted in psychology. The present
proposal is designed to address this problem through a workshop about NSF
education programs and a showcase of projects in psychology supported by TUES.
This project is centered on an invited session at the 25th annual convention of
the Association for Psychological Science (APS) in Washington, DC (May 23-25).
APS is the foremost disciplinary association for psychological science. This
session will showcase projects that have been supported by the TUES program and
function as a workshop that identifies EHR funding opportunities of possible
interest to participants.
