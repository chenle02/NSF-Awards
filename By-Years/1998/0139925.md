&lt;br/&gt;In this project, jointly funded by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry
Program of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences of the Directorate for
Geosciences, Baer will conduct research on the morphology and chemistry of
individual aerosol particles. A unique aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer
has been developed for this purpose. Individual aerosol particles will be
vaporized by an IR laser, and ionized by a VUV laser to allow a quantitative
determination of chemical composition, coating thickness, and reaction depth.
The data obtained will be of use to researchers in physical chemistry and
atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a novel instrument
will be developed and used for the investigation of the chemistry and morphology
of individual aerosol particles. Significant improvements over existing methods
are envisioned. The results of this research will be of value to scientists
working in physical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry. The results will
contribute to a better understanding of the role played by aerosols in the
environment and atmospheric pollution. Students and post doctoral research
associates will participate in this research.&lt;br/&gt;
