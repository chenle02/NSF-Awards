The prior study by the principal investgator indicates the importance of short-
range order in determining the properties of polymer glasses. To confirm this
and obtain further information about the short-range order in polymer liquids
and glasses, the following three lines of approach will be pursued. First, the
investgator will perform X-ray scattering measurements on glassy polymer samples
subject to different mechanical and thermal histories. He will empoly the
technique of the intermediate- angle scattering measurement he had developed
earlier, as well as the technique of energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction.
Second, he will perform neutron-scattering measurement with four types of
polystyrene - - ordinary polystyrene, perdeuteriated polystyrene, polystyrene
deuteriated on aliphatic groups only, and polystyrene deuteriated on aromatic
rings only. The results can provide more detailed information about the types of
atomic pairs responsible for the short-rang order present. Third, molecular
dynamics simulation of models of realistic bulk polystyrene will be performed
and the result will be analyzed to aid the interpretation of the X-ray and
neutron-scattering results.
