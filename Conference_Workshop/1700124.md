This award provides funding for US participation in the workshop/conference
"Workshop: Probabilistic Perspectives in Nonlinear Partial Differential
Equations" that will be held at the International Centre for Mathematical
Sciences (Edinburgh, UK) from June 5-9, 2017. The conference focuses on recent
developments in Analysis, especially in the fields of probability, stochastic
processes, and nonlinear partial differential equations. A number of
distinguished mathematicians have agreed to attend and speak at this conference.
This award gives early career researchers, members of underrepresented groups,
researchers not funded by NSF and the like an opportunity to attend and
participate in this conference. The organizing committee will strive to make
this funding opportunity known to target groups through a number of different
activities. More information will be made available at:
