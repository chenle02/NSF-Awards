AST-0437519&lt;br/&gt;Merritt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the
dynamics and evolution of galactic nuclei, from their formation through to the
present day, with an emphasis on mergers and the influence of binary black
holes. Questions about the influence of black holes on the structure of nuclei,
the longevity of binaries, the cumulative effect of hierarchical merging,
possible roles for triple or multiple black hole systems, the rate of encounters
and predicted gravitational wave event rates, and whether black holes are ever
ejected from galaxies, will be tackled with a variety of numerical approaches.
The models will be compared with observations of nearby
galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many subfields of astrophysics are concerned with
single and binary supermassive black holes, and this work will be particularly
important in providing an astrophysical grounding for estimates of gravitational
wave event rates. Additional broader impact comes from interactions with
students and faculty at non-PhD-granting and minority-serving institutions, the
development of next-generation instrumentation, and dissemination of computer
algorithms to the scientific community.
