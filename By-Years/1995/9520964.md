9520964 Schutt-Aine The electrical performance of high-speed integrated circuit
and digital networks strongly depends on the electromagnetic performance of
interconnects between components of a system. In recent years, packaging has
become a critical area in the design of high-speed communications systems and
fast computers. The purpose of this research is to provide the technology
necessary to design aggressive packaging schemes in the areas of design,
modeling, testing, measurement and circuit simulation. This objective will be
achieved using electromagnetic theory as an analysis tool to yield a better
understanding of interconnect problems. The implementation of computer-aided
design tools for this simulation of packages and interconnects will be achieved.
New design ideas will be studied and evaluated and solutions will be proposed
for current system level integration problems. The complete effort is aimed at
facilitating the task of circuit designers and reducing cost and time associated
with the testing and evaluation of a given interconnect scheme. ***
