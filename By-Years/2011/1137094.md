This award from the Chemical Synthesis Program will support a "Workshop on
Synthetic Chemistry." This workshop has the dual purpose of providing an
effective forum for informal discussion among young academic and industrial
scientists on current research in topical areas of Chemical Synthesis, and
assisting the Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers. This
process, in turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning. The specific
goals of the workshop include: 1) Providing an environment for the dynamic
exchange of ideas in organic synthesis, organometallic chemistry, inorganic
synthesis, natural products, bio-organic and bio-inorganic chemistry with a
synthetic emphasis; 2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals
working in related areas, and thereby avoiding duplicative efforts; 3)
Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods in synthetic
chemistry; 4) Improving awareness of potentially valuable applications of new
methods and strategies in synthesis; 5) Increasing diversity at high-level
meetings; 6) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and social
interaction among participants will be both stimulating and pleasant; 7)
Creating a constructive environment that fosters mentoring relationships among
participants.
