The University of Kansas, Lawrence Campus, will initiate a five- week,
residential Young Scholars project in Life Science and Mathematics for 25
students entering grade 12. Class activities will integrate studies of genetics,
statistics, writing and bioethics to encourage in students an understanding of
the relationship among genetics, technology and society. Students will be
assigned to various task-centered groups to facilitate cooperative learning.
Group activities will include solving genetics and statistics problems, working
on interactive computer exercises and developing a bioethics project to be
presented as a follow-up activity in the students' high schools. Hands-on
laboratory experiments in genetics will help the students to experience the joys
of scientific discovery.
