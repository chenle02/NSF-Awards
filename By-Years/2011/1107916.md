The DIG-Maps project is increasing the number of minority students pursuing
undergraduate degrees in geoscience by leveraging a strong existing partnership
between North Carolina State University and Wake Tech Community College, both
located in Raleigh, NC. Collaboration between faculty from NC State's Department
of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Wake Tech's Geology faculty is
developing enhanced introductory geology courses, summer and regular term
research opportunities for undergraduate students, career and academic advising,
and creating a learning community for program participants from Wake Tech, who
will be able to continue their education at NC State. A distance education
lecture and laboratory course that incorporates research-based pedagogy and
field components is extending opportunities to those unable to attend regular
classes. Outreach to high schools through The Science House and a summer camp
are being used to attract high school students to the program. Evaluation
results are being used to establish the project as a model for collaboration
between research universities and area community colleges. As an additional
broader impact, the large number of participants taking the introductory
geoscience course at Wake Tech are gaining valuable knowledge about Earth
Systems that will make them better prepared citizens.
