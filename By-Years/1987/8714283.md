The principal investigator requests funds to purchase a protein microsequencer,
a peptide synthesizer, a microbore HPLC, and an oligonucleotide synthesizer for
a new Protein and Nucleic Acid facility in the School of Medicine. The
instrumentation will be used by researchers involved in studies of proteins and
genes of biologial interest. The instrumentation will permit sequencing of micro
quantities of proteins from 2-D gel spots, or from other purification
procedures, and will allow production of antipeptide antibodies to defined
regions of proteins and the synthesis of oligonucleotide probes. This
instrumentation, along with a protein data base comnputerized workstation for
analysis of 2- dimensional gels already set up in the Department of Biochemistry
and Biophysics, will contribute to the development of a fully integrated protein
and nucleic acid purification and microanalytical capability at the University
of Pennsylvania.
