Project Calc, developed through an NSF grant to Duke University, is being
implemented at the University of Mississippi. Materials are being adapted for
the implementation at this institution, including the use of alternative
software. These materials will be made available for other institutions, as well
as types and levels of support necessary for faculty and graduate assistants to
effectively use these materials and approaches. In addition to providing a model
for implementation at a comprehensive state institution, this project will serve
as a test site for the Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation.
