This research is to address the well known problems of social choice in
environments more realistic than those normally considered. In particular, the
researcher will alter the requirements of universal domain, binary-ness, and
transitivity commonly assumed in work on social choice. These requirements are
among the most basic for researchers working within the general framework
established by Kenneth Arrow in 1951. This study will adopt choice axioms shaped
by the exigencies for real world computation and develop algorithms generating a
member of the set of best outcomes to allow for more latitude in the choice of a
computational procedure. This is because society may wish to sacrifice some
computational efficiency to open the door to a social choice rule that has more
desirable ethical properties than a more efficient algorithm would permit. The
goal is to examine the possibility of defining an efficient, nonbinary, social
choice correspondence that can be used to settle the kinds of distributional
welfare questions that typically confronted economists. This important study
represents a move toward greater realism in the basic models, and permits a much
better fit between social choice theory and standard economic models.
