Multiterminal (MT) video coding considers the problem of separate compression
and joint decompression of multiple correlated video sources. Driven by a host
of emerging applications (e.g., in network communications, distributed video
sensor networks and camera arrays, and distributed inference), MT video coding
has become a very active area of research in the past ten
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses both the theory of MT source
coding and practice of MT video coding, with the aim of using the theory to
guide practice. It involves: 1) identifying new classes of problems of quadratic
Gaussian MT source coding with tight sum-rate bound or giving sufficient
conditions for sum-rate tightness; 2) taking an approximation approach when sum-
rate tightness cannot be proved; 3) performing MT source code constructions
based on Slepian-Wolf coded quantization for random coding and hybrid random-
structured coding; and 4) spearheading the practical application of MT video
coding for camera arrays and distributed video sensor networks, with focus on
depth camera assisted MT video coding.
