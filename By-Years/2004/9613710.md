9613710 Hovis The proposed research will focus on several important questions
concerning the energies of mineral and rock processes. The energetics of water-
bearing magmatic systems will be investigated by measuring the enthalpies of
solution of hydrous rhyolite, andesite and basalt glasses. In a second project,
the enthalpies of mixing for simple alkali-silica glasses will be investigate.
In a third project, heats of solution will be used to energetically characterize
the remnant structures of decompressed amorphous materials. Other projects
relate to enthalpies associated with strain in coherently exsolved minerals and
with highly precise thermodynamic mixing in feldspars and other mineral systems.
The principal techniques to be utilized for these studies include hydrofluoric
acid solution calorimetry, room temperature/pressure and high-pressure x-ray
powder diffraction, and nuclear magnetic resonance plus other spectroscopies.
