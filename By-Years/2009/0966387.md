This project is a) increasing the number of students pursuing degrees in STEM
areas, b) increasing the retention and academic success of S-STEM scholars, c)
enriching their learning environment and d) facilitating the transfer of S-STEM
scholars to appropriate baccalaureate institutions. The project is partnering
with existing outreach programs at Centralia College to induce more middle and
high school students to choose STEM careers. S-STEM scholars are working with
peer and faculty mentors, visiting labs and field sites of STEM professionals,
pursuing independent research opportunities and attending regional scientific
conferences, visiting potential transfer institutions, and meeting with
financial aid / admissions experts to ensure academic success. This project is
increasing the visibility of STEM careers in a rural area that lacks role models
in these areas. Many project activities are open to all Centralia College
students, lifting the academic achievement of not only the S-STEM scholars, but
also their classmates. The investment in S-STEM scholars is having a spillover
effect on their classmates, on the visibility of STEM careers and education
programs at the college, and on the viability of STEM careers to students in the
community who might otherwise not attempt this path.
