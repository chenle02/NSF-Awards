9361414 Hilliard The useful life of engine oil is known to be highly dependent
on formulation and the engine operating mode. Consequently, an oil- change
interval based on miles traveled or engine operating hours does not necessarily
define the in-service quality of the oil. One problem in particular for diesel
engines is that oil dispersancy can fail very rapidly, this enables the
suspended soot particles to "gel" the oil even when the actual suspended soot
particles are only present at a 1% to 2% (w/v) concentration. The result of
gelling is increased viscosity, poor cold-start protection, more soot abrasion
wear and loss of lubricity. Dispersancy of an oil can be lost when all other oil
properties, eg. oxidative resistance, are still 90% intact. Some engine
operating schedules - notably high-load to low-load excursions - can lead to
total dispersancy loss in less than 100 hours of operation. The proposed Phase 1
research is directed at using scattering of intra-red radiation as a means of
detecting the transition from well-dispersed particles to the agglomerates that
form as dispersancy fails. The wavelength source is chosen to match the
effective scattering diameter of the particles and agglomerates in such a way
that the transition can be detected as a deviation from classical Rayleigh
scattering behavior. ***
