This research consists of two parts. E. K. Riedel will extend his analytical and
numerical studies of quantum coherence and transport phenomena in small
mesoscopic structures. The initial focus will be on persistent currents in non-
superconducting rings and related static and dynamic mesoscopic phenomena. The
goal is the elucidation of unusual quantum coherence and statistical mechanical
effects that occur in the electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties of
submicron sized structures. He will also look at the competition between
surface-roughening and surface-melting phase transitions in solids. M. den Nijs
will extend his present work on two-dimensional critical phenomena and phase
transitions and on the ground state properties of one-dimensional quantum
systems. This can be characterized by the following four closely related topics:
1. interrelations between surface roughening and surface reconstruction; 2.
development and applications of numerical Monte Carlo finite size scaling of
interface free energies; 3. further development and applications of extended
scaling and conformal invariance; 4. novel fluid states with long range order in
one-dimensional quantum spin chains.
