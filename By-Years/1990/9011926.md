The primary mechanism by which steroids exert their widespread effects is by
altering the rate of synthesis of proteins within target cells. Testosterone,
the major androgenic steroid, is secreted by the testes into the blood stream
and readily enters cells by diffusion. Specific protein receptors are located in
hormone responsive cells, such as hypothalamic neurons in the brain. Once the
testosterone enters a target neuron, the receptors bind the hormone. The steroid
receptor complexes then act on its genes to alter the expression of proteins.
Dr. McGinnis will identify the proteins that are increased or decreased by
testosterone within specific brain regions. In addition, she will determine how
the altered neuronal properties produce behavioral and physiological changes.
The results of these studies will be useful in devising molecular approaches to
understanding androgen.regulated functions. Moreover, the findings may have
clinical ramifications since they may prove useful in providing insight into the
treatments of hormone dependent tumors, neurologic diseases influenced by
androgens as well as male sterility.
