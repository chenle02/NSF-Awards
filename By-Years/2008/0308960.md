This project will assess relationships among population and community response
variables and thermal stress gradients. It will also examine the relationship
between population and physiological response variables. Since thermal stress is
a function of intensity and duration of heating, the mathematical models will be
developed more explicitly in terms of partial differential equations. The
measured dependent variables will be expressed as a function of intensity and
duration of thermal stress using for example, degree- heating weeks as
independent variable. Functional response will be compared at the population and
community levels, and at the population and physiology levels. The independent
variable will be explored further, and cross correlations will be re-examined
using other independent variables such as, effective degree-heating weeks which
maybe considered as the integration of degree-heating weeks, water flow regimes
and irradiance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the models will also include
the assessment of questions involving thermal stress scenarios such as, how many
habitats support species i, and how many species are supported at site k.
Finally, the models will predict the future climates, in return, these
predictions will allow us to examine potential population changes over time
given different climatic scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS
project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
