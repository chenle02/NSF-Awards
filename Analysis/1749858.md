This research project concerns eigenvalues, which represent the characteristic
frequencies of oscillation of physical systems, as well as resonances, which are
complex numbers generalizing eigenvalues that represent systems where energy can
escape and thus oscillation is accompanied by decay. An example of the resonance
phenomenon is the sound we hear after striking a bell: it has a frequency of
oscillation (the tone) and a rate of decay (how soon we stop hearing the sound),
which both depend on the shape of the bell. The frequency and the decay rate
that we hear correspond to the real and imaginary part of the least-decaying
resonance of the bell. Eigenvalues and resonances have innumerable applications
in physics and engineering. A major goal of this project is to understand how
the distribution of eigenvalues and resonances depends on the system (for
example, how the shape of the bell determines how long it will sound); while
this topic has seen recent progress, there remain many important open questions.
The project includes research projects for graduate students and numerical
experiments for undergraduate students.

The project employs microlocal analysis, which is the mathematical theory
explaining the classical/quantum, or particle/wave, correspondence. For
instance, the high-energy distribution of resonances in the simplest model of a
bell is related to the classical dynamical system of billiard ball trajectories
inside the bell: for bounded times, waves approximately propagate along billiard
ball trajectories. However, for long times this approximation becomes worse and
eventually breaks down. An especially interesting situation is when the
classical system has chaotic behavior; the implications for eigenfunctions and
resonances are studied in the field of quantum chaos. Part of the project is
centered around the fractal uncertainty principle, which is a new tool beyond
the classical/quantum correspondence, established through use of harmonic
analysis, fractal geometry, and combinatorics. The fractal uncertainty principle
has already seen several applications, including progress towards the conjecture
that all strongly chaotic open systems have exponential wave decay. Another part
of the project is the study of classical, or Pollicott-Ruelle, resonances, using
microlocal methods -- a rare example of the reversal of the classical/quantum
correspondence.
