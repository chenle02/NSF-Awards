This research seeks to improve the resolution of microphotographic systems by
developing algorithms for the introduction of modifications in masks to
compensate for distortions introduced by optical systems. Applications of such
work include microfilming, laser printing, microlithography for IC fabrication,
and design of aids for the visually impaired. This work will develop techniques
for finding masks and testing obtained resolutions using computer-generated
holograms. This research renews previous research conducted under grant no.
