Measurements of isotope ratios in igneous and metamorphic rocks and
determinations of trace element concentrations will be used in conjunction with
petrographic studies and theoretical studies to improve current understanding of
important fluxes of the geochemical cycles of the solid earth. Emphasis will be
placed on Ca isotopic studies of igneous rocks from island arcs and mid- ocean
ridges and granitic rocks from continental areas. The objectives are to put new
constraints on the major element composition of the lower continental crust and
to evaluate the cycling of Ca through island arc-subduction zone systems. The PI
is developing a new isotope laboratory and this award will be critical to its
initial successful operation.
