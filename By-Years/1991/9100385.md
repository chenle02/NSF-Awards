This proposal seeks to evaluate the kinetics of cell growth, and the synthesis
of macromolecules in single eukaryotic cells with theoretical and experimental
tools that have been developed during a previous award. These tools will
continue to be developed, and will permit the mapping of the dynamic patterns of
eukaryotic cell populations under a variety of environmental conditions at the
single cell level. The engineering benefit of this study will be kinetic models
that have a much better predictive value than conventional non-segregated
models.
