ABSTRACT CTS-9520920 The objective of this effort is to synthesize site-
localized organic molecules such as conjugated aldehydes and ketones, imines,
acetals, cyanohydrins, and chloroketones, at the acid sites in zeolites.
Aldehydes and ketones are adsorbed and exposed to reactive vapors. Surface
species are analyzed with carbon-13 magic-angle nuclear magnetic resonance and
infrared spectroscopy. Zeolite catalysts are synthesized and characterized with
silicon-29 and aluminum-27 nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction, and
sorption uptake measurements. The compounds formed in this study are typical
chemical intermediates that are presently produced using liquid acid catalysts.
Environmental considerations are forcing producers to shift to solid acid
catalysts, such as those used in this study. ***
