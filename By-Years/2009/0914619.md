This exploratory project involves development and initial field testing of a new
instrument employing the LOng Path Absorption Photometry (LOPAP) method to
measure nitrous and nitric acids in air. Both acids are oxidation products of
nitrogen oxides. Nitrous acid is thought to be, under some conditions, a
significant source of hydroxyl radical, the most important atmospheric oxidant.
Deposition of nitric acid is responsible for much of the removal of oxidized
inorganic nitrogen from the troposphere. Field testing during a multi-
investigator study focusing on biogenic emissions and their effects on
atmospheric chemistry in Blodgett Forest, California in summer 2009 (BEARPEX-09)
will include investigation of potential interferences in the measurements via
side-by-side comparison with a method based on a different principle. Previous
field intercomparisons of nitrous acid measurement methods in high-altitude and
polar environments yielded differing results, suggesting that measurement
artifacts exist and that they may be site dependent. The large array of data for
other trace gases and aerosol composition to be obtained during BEARPEX will
allow detailed examination of possible HONO measurement artifacts and their
causes in the very different forest environment. Broader impacts will include
better understanding of the chemistry of these two acids and, in turn, better
understanding of atmospheric oxidation chemistry and radical budgets. One
graduate and two undergraduate students will be trained through participation in
the project. This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
