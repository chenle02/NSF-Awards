The meeting supported by this grant aims to bring together specialists on
stellar pulsation and those astronomers who use the pulsating stars to study
stellar evolution, galactic morphology and evolution, and the cosmic distance
scale. Many aging stars pulsate regularly. Their pulsation has been valuable for
establishing and checking models of stellar evolution. Pulsating stars have also
provided an important method for determining astronomical distances within our
Galaxy and to the nearer other galaxies. But this information is only as
accurate as are the models of stellar pulsation used to interpret the data. This
conference will bring together experts on all these subjects so that they can
jointly determine the accomplishments, uncertainties, and opportunities in this
subject.
