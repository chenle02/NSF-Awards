Dr. Mark A. Berg is supported by a Presidential Young Investigator award from
the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study ultra-fast processes in
disordered condensed matter. These measurements provide valuable insight into
chemical energy flow and re-distribution as well as insight into the time scale
of various chemical reactions. The influence of the solvent on the product
energy distribution following a chemical reaction will be accomplished through
the use of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy to monitor the vibrational and
orientational states of product fragments following small molecule
dissociations. Comparisons with the detailed information available for gas-phase
reactions will directly reveal the role of the solvent in the final-state
interactions of the reaction.
