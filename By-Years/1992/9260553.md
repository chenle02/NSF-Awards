Thermoplastics are not widely used in polar regions because they embrittle and
may lose 70% of their fracture toughness at low temperature. MCF Foam structure
is created by induced thermodynamic instability in plastics supersaturated with
inert gas (non-CFC). The resulting cell structure incorporates 109 to 1015 void
per cm3, at a size of 0.3 to 20 microns. MCF thermoplastics have shown better
fracture toughness, impact strength and fatigue in tests at room temperature.
The research will focus in three areas. Morphology and physical properties will
be quantified for several polymers under varying process parameters, including
supersaturation, nucleation, skin thickness and cell size. If feasibility is
demonstrated, MCF thermoplastics could replace metals and composites in polar
region construction where low-cost, light-weight, rigid structural materials are
required.
