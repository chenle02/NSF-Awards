The physical electronics at low temperatures of semiconductor materials and
devices will be studied. Included is a combined theoretical and experimental
investigation of carrier freezeout for various semiconductor devices as a
function of material, impurity type (n or p) and specie, impurity concentration
and temperature. The temperature dependence of the operating characteristics of
GaAs MESFET's, Si MOSFET's, and CRYOFET's will be investigated. A CRYOFET has
structure much like that of a MOSFET but has substrate of the same conductivity
type Source and Drain. While it is a low linear resistance at room temperature
it functions much like a MOSFET at temperatures below that for carrier freezeout
(e.g. 4.2 K).
