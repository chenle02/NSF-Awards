This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
program, continues research that focuses on developing a thorough understanding
of multi-electron reactions with emphasis on the energetics and kinetics of the
processes. Conducted by Dr. Dennis Evans and his group at the University of
Delaware, the project includes several parts. One part uses the behavior of
certain molecules to study potential inversion, the phenomenon where the
insertion or removal of the second electron in a two electron process occurs
more easily than does removal of the first electron. Fast scan cyclic
voltammetry is then used to identify the point at which the structural changes
associated with potential inversion occurs. Another part of the project develops
an improved fundamental understanding of the mechanism of electrode reactions.
This improved understanding is used to investigate and improve procedures for
the electrochemical generation of acids. Using a novel electric-field promoted
hydrolysis, protic acids are produced by oxidation of hydrogen and a palladium
membrane-based cell for acid generation is constructed and tested.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental understanding of multi-electron-transfer
reactions that this research develops will help demonstrate the efficacy of
electrochemical synthesis, which in turn could lead to more environmentally
friendly processes in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
