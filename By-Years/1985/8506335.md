This grant provides equipment for the modernization and upgrade of computer
facilities at the Digital Image Analysis Laboratory (DIAL) at the University of
Arizona. The DIAL, established as an interdisciplinary research service lab, has
been a major component of many engineering research projects since 1976. The
DIAL has been able to provide and maintain a central resource for sophisticated
image processing software and hardware that could not be purchased with
individual research grants. In nearly all cases, this research would not have
been conducted in the absence of a facility such as DIAL. The central hose
computer and some of the associated disk and tape peripherals in DIAL are in
need of upgrading to continue to function as an important research facility.
