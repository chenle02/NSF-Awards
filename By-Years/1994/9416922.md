Abstract Medical Center of Delaware - G. W. Keever Connection to NSFNET Proposal
No. NCR-9416922 The Medical Center of Delaware's Wide Area Network links five
main campuses, as well as several satellite primary care and home healthcare
facilities throughout the state. With an Internet connection at the Center,
pharmacists will be able to exchange protocols for new drugs, scientists can
query their colleagues at other institutions on specific research questions,
legal data bases and case studies, and physicians participating in clinical
trials can log patient-care information and receive updates without leaving
their offices. The Center will purchase and install the gateway hardware
necessary to make an SMDS connection to the Internet by connecting to PREPnet,
the closet mid-level network . Because of the Center's ever expanding
involvement in research and other areas, the requirements for connectivity are
no longer met by dial-up facilities. Providing a direct connection to the NSFNET
has become increasingly important to meet the Center's existing and future
needs.
