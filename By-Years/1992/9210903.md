This is a proposal to create a nationally representative Public Use Sample of
the 1850 census of the free inhabitants of the United States. Public use samples
already exist for the census years 1880, 1900, 1910, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and
1980. The 1850 census is the first census of the United States which reported
the characteristics of individuals rather than households. The 1850 census file
will not only constitute an invaluable resource in its own right, but will
enhance the value of the other public use samples. Used in combination, the nine
data sets spanning 130 years will comprise a most valuable resource for the
study of social change.
