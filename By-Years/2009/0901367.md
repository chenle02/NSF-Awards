If a polynomial ring admits a symmetric group action, it is natural to consider
alternating polynomials, that is, polynomials which change sign when acted on by
any transposition. In natural situations, the families of alternating
polynomials and related spaces have found themselves to be fundamental objects
in commutative algebra, algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry,
representation theory, and approximation theory. The goal of this project is to
investigate their computational, combinatorial, algebraic, and geometric
aspects. In particular, q,t-Catalan numbers, Hilbert schemes, minimal free
resolutions, multiplier ideals and jumping numbers will be considered. The study
of q,t-Catalan numbers, which were introduced by Garsia, Haiman and
collaborators, has been stimulated by the theory of Macdonald symmetric
polynomials. The PI will explore them further in collaboration with Li. The main
object of this project will be the ideals generated by alternating polynomials
in two or more sets of variables, and their various invariants.

Commutative algebra studies systems of polynomial equations in many variables.
Among polynomial equations, symmetric polynomials and alternating polynomials
naturally occur in many branches of science including combinatorics,
representation theory, and particle physics. The project on their systems and
solutions will lead to new conjectures and theorems which may benefit quantum
algebra, cryptography, and coding theory as well as the areas mentioned above.
