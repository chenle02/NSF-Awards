This grant will support some preliminary investigations of economic models,
public policy and local government initiatives in obtaining broadband services
for areas (e.g. rural) where private companies do not provide services due to
lack of profit. As broadband (high speed) access becomes more and more critical
as necessary community infrastructure in the future, these situations will
become more and more common. This grant will support a literature survey, some
beginning data collection and choice of case studies.
