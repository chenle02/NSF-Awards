OIA-0342159&lt;br/&gt;Haak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to the
National Academy of Science (NAS) Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public
Policy and the Board on Higher Education and the Workforce to undertake a broad
examination of the current status and role of international graduate students
and post-doc scholars in the United States, a national science and technology
policy concern. The committee will address several topics, including the desire
to recruit the best domestic and international talent, examine the influence of
international students on the Nation's labor force, economy and the science and
engineering community. Results from this undertaking will help the committee
formulate principles that should guide national policy regarding international
students and provide a better understanding of the impact these students have on
the STEM graduate education pipeline. This study could help NSF, other federal
agencies and private STEM foundations better plan for the Nation's science and
engineering future and national security.&lt;br/&gt;
