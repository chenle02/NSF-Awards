This research focuses on developing techniques for space multiplexing on an
optical bus, which supports parallel transmission of messages. Based on previous
results on a distributed control mechanism and its analysis of worst-case
performance, research is being carried out on a extensive simulation study for
analyzing the average bus performance under realistic assumptions regarding
load, traffic patterns and memory contention. A technique called coincident
pulse selection and developed by the principal investigators is being studied
for the optical bus architecture. Comparisons to well-known multiprocessor
interconnection structures and the impact on fundamental parallel algorithms are
being carried out. The gradual maturity of electro-optic device technology has
made possible the construction of electronic-optical computers. The
interconnection network is an important component in conventional multiprocessor
system and is often a bottleneck in performance. The exploratory study on
applying optical technologies to the design of multiprocessor interconnection
network will have significant payoff and impact in the future. Results developed
may lead to new architectures and algorithms in computer systems. Support of
this innovative exploratory research is strongly recommended.
