One of the outstanding frontiers of contemporary stellar evolution theory is
that brief period of binary star evolution known as the "common envelope phase."
Prior to this phase, orbiting stars are attracted closer and closer to one
another by the exchange of mass between them as one of them, then a "red giant"
expands until the two stars coalesce, becoming a common "star" within which two
nuclei orbit. It is thought that the common envelope is eventually ejected,
leaving behind two distinct stars once again. The Principal Investigator (PI)
intends to build on previous NSF- supported work on the origins of common
envelope systems and now plans to study the mechanism(s) by which the envelope
can be expelled. His models will include effects of circulation and cooling
(recombination of H, He atoms) of an envelope matter through extensive two-
dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. This project is expected to give
additional understanding to the formation of low mass x-ray binaries and closely
orbiting neutron stars and pulsars, and is thus of interest to a potentially
wide segment of the astronomical community.
