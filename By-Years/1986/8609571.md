Much new information is being produced by the earthquake hazard reduction
research community and novel approaches are needed to facilitate its
dissemination and utilization by practitioners and researchers. This project
will design, develop, and produce a prototype data storage and retrieval system
which will accomodate pages of text, line drawings, and continuous tone images.
The system will accept search requests in the form of a sequence of keywords
which can be associated with one another using logical connectives such as
"and", "or", "but not", etc. and will produce, in response to each request, a
list of the accession numbers, or possible page and word numbers, of those
documents satisfying the request. The reading system will then present to the
user, on a high resolution display, an image of the required documents, a page
at a time, for review. Those pages which appear to be of interest can then be
printed on a suitable printer.
