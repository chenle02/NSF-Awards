The principal investigator will focus on the Precambrian-Cambrian transition
and on the Cambrian explosion of life. Particular aspects of this research
include: 1. study of the biogeochemistry of Ediacaran fauna fossils from
Namibia, with the goal of clarifying the biological affinities of these
organisms; 2. study of the biostratigraphy in the Precambrian-Cambrian
sedimentary sequence of Sonora, Mexico. 3. analysis of geochemical shifts and
nutrient changes on land and in the sea during the Precambrian-Cambrian
interval.
