The FCC is an element of the Building Research Board (BRB), Commission on
Engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), National Research Council (NRC). The
FCC has provided federal agencies having an interest in construction with a
mechanism for jointly identifying and addressing mutual problems and concerns.
The proposed FCC program for calendar year 1992 includes advisory studies,
coordination activates, and hoc information studies, and base activities. The
