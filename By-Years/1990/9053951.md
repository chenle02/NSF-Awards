Abstract: This project represents a coalition of Howard University, the
University of the District of Columbia, the DC Public Schools (DCPS), several
corporations and community organizations. The goal of the project is to
facilitate system-wide assessment and intervention programs for students and
teachers in the DCPS in science and mathematics at all grade levels. A unique
methodology in the program is the adaptation of learning styles to cultural
background. Each member of the Center is already substantially involved,
formally or informally, in relationships with the DC Public School system. The
superintendent has affirmed that the goals of the Center are consonant with the
long range plans of the school system. The presidents of the universities have
committed their instructors to support and sustain the Center's activities. The
program components will be three types: academics, teacher- training, and
community-based; the latter includes technical assistance to organization for
in-school and after-school science and mathematics activities, tutoring, forums,
apprenticeships, and peer- liaison.
