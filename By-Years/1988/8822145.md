Santa Clara University will host and jointly organize with Howard University the
2nd International Conference on Amorphous and Crystalline Silicon Carbide and
Related Materials (ICACSC). It follows the successful 1st ICACSC at Howard
University organized jointly by these two universities in December 1987. The
primary sponsors are the National Science Foundation, the Electrochemical
Society, and the IEEE Electron Devices Society-Santa Clara Valley Chapter. This
conference brings together distinguished American and foreign researchers in an
international forum for discussion and exchange of ideas and data concerning the
current state of research on SiC and related materials. It is the intent of the
organizers to encourage and promote further research on the fundamental
properties of these materials and their applications.
