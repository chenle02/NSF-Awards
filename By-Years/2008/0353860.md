The central focus of this research is the weak decay of the b quarks and the c
quarks. The Standard Model of electroweak interactions has been very successful
explaining current data, but there are many reasons to believe that the model is
incomplete, e.g., the model cannot explain the different quark or lepton masses
or the different couplings between the quarks. There is a hierarchy problem that
arises from the desire to connect gravity with the other forces, which can occur
only at a very high fundamental scale, many times larger than weak interaction
scale. Connecting the two scales so different in magnitude defines the hierarchy
problem. Study of phenomena in b and c decays may help to understand this
hierarchy and could reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model. One of the
most important measurements concerns CP violation or the asymmetry between
matter and anti-matter. There are four independent CP violating angles that must
be measured. These require large data samples and precise detection techniques
in order to look for deviations in the data from the model. The CLEO experiment
at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), which collides electrons with
positrons, has been at the forefront of studies of both the b and c quarks. The
Bo, B+ and Ds mesons, were discovered by CLEO. Recently, CESR has lowered its
energy to perform precision studies of charm physics and psi spectroscopy. At
the lower center-of-mass energy, weak decays of charm mesons can be studied in
way that drastically reduces systematic errors and provides a crucial check on
theoretical calculations necessary to interpret b decay data. The Syracuse group
proposes to build the particle identification device, called a Ring Imaging
Cherenkov detector for the CLEO upgrade. Group members were also involved with
the CLEO Electromagnetic Calorimeter and the Muon detector for CLEO II.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fermilab Tevatron collides protons with anti-protons.
These collisions produce very high rates of b and c quarks at rates about 1,000
- 10,000 times those produced at CESR or other e+e colliders. The BTeV
experiment will use the Tevatron to extend the physics reach well beyond what
can be done at e+e colliders. BTeV expects to find important new phenomena in
the areas of rare decays and CP violation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal
provides broader impact through education outreach by continuing efforts in
K-12, undergraduate and graduate education. Group members have been active in
elementary school science clubs and have been interacting with High School
teachers. The group has a website devoted to answering questions about particle
physics and science in general, called "Ask a Particle Physicist." &lt;br/&gt;
