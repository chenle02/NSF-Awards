This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site that will host a total of ten students during ten weeks of summer
research. Students will be working with researchers at the University of
Delaware's College of Marine Studies (CMS) located in Lewes, DE. Students will
also participate in a series of seminars and workshops exploring issues related
to marine science, career options, and graduate education. The program recruits
juniors and senior undergraduate students nationwide. These students are able to
pursue research in a broad range of marine science, environmental science and
marine engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has an excellent
record of success with past groups of students and contains all the important
elements of a good REU program, including a thorough orientation program, a
well-designed lecture series, a research cruise, an ethics program, and required
oral and written presentations. Past publication rates by students have been
excellent. The number of scientists involved in the program and potential
research projects for students is excellent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal
is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective
methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young
researchers. It will advance students' awareness concerning important
environmental issues. Students selected for participation in this program gain a
significant appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in
a scientific field. Matching funding provided by the University includes
approximately one month of salary for the PIs.&lt;br/&gt;
