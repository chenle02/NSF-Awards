A Survey of the Sharks and Rays of Borneo and their Metazoan
Parasites&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a collaborative effort involving parasite and
elasmobranch taxonomists&lt;br/&gt;from eight different institutions in the US,
Australia and Malaysia, this&lt;br/&gt;project will focus on the elasmobranchs
(sharks and rays) and their metazoan&lt;br/&gt;parasites of the inshore and
freshwater habitats of East Malaysia on the&lt;br/&gt;island of Borneo.
Preliminary surveys suggest that this region is home to well&lt;br/&gt;over 100
species of sharks and rays, many of which are poorly known, and
at&lt;br/&gt;least some of which are likely to be new to science. At
present,&lt;br/&gt;essentially no records of metazoan parasites exist for sharks
and rays of this&lt;br/&gt;geographic region. It is anticipated that the project
will yield an&lt;br/&gt;extensive diversity of metazoan parasites belonging to
at least four animal&lt;br/&gt;phyla, including all four major groups of
platyhelminths, as well as annelids,&lt;br/&gt;nematodes and perhaps as many as
five major groups of arthropods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metazoan parasite
diversity in sharks and rays generated from data collected in
a&lt;br/&gt;previous survey conducted elsewhere will be tested. These data lead
to the&lt;br/&gt;prediction that this region may yield between 500 and 1,000
species of&lt;br/&gt;metazoan parasites, well over 50% of which are likely to be
new to science.&lt;br/&gt;This survey will provide essential baseline taxonomic
data to facilitate the&lt;br/&gt;development of a resource management plan in
East Malaysia. It will also do &lt;br/&gt;much to begin to fill in an enormous
gap in our knowledge of parasites of&lt;br/&gt;sharks and rays.&lt;br/&gt;
