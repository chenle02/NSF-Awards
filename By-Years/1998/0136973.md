0136973 Fine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project to estimate the
uncertainties for individual tracer ages, and to associate differences in the
magnitude of these uncertainties with known circulation phenomena. The focus is
on thermocline and intermediate water masses, using World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) chlorofluorocarbon and tritium/helium-3 data that have
recently become available. Tracer ages are a measure of the ocean's ability to
transport atmospheric constituents into the interior. Isopycnal mixing rates
will be calculated for regions of the subtropical gyres where isopycnal mixing
can significantly alter tracer ages. Errors in tracer ages arise from
analytical, source function, and other factors. Here a differentiation will be
made between errors in tracer ages and distributions. The effect of errors on
tracer age distributions is small compared with effects of oceanic processes.
Depending on the extent and pathways of mixing, a tracer can exhibit a broad
distribution of ages within a given water mass. Mixing, therefore, compromises
the ability to interpret tracer ages; i.e., the elapsed time since a water
parcel was in contact with the atmosphere. Mixing histories will be assessed by
analyzing distributions of tracer ages with an accepted theoretical framework.
Isopycnal mixing rates and Peclet numbers will be calculated for sub-regions of
the subtropical gyres. These values will be compared to tracer age distributions
and non-linear mixing terms. The work will be extended using a high resolution
numerical model of the North Atlantic with an assumed stationary circulation.
This will permit analysis of simulated CFC and ideal ages, their distributions,
comparison with observations, and assessment of ventilation and mixing in the
model. Results from the proposed multiple tracer approach will contribute toward
quantifying the rate at which the ocean takes up atmospheric gases, for example,
CO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
