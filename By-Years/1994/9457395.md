In this project, aggressive instruction scheduling techniques for instruction-
level parallel (ILP) processors are investigated. ILP processors, such as
superscalar and VLIW processors, are used effectively in both general purpose
and scientific computer systems. For general purpose systems, the high frequency
of branch instructions creates the need for aggressive global scheduling
techniques that support speculatively and conditionally executed instructions.
For scientific systems, cyclic scheduling techniques such as software pipelining
have been developed to aggressively schedule inner loops. The four areas that
are explored in this project are: (1) Investigate issues associated with the
software pipelining technique and Modulo scheduling. These include scheduling
while loops, handling loops with cross- iter\-ation dependencies and removing
the uniform initiation interval restriction; (2) Formalize an operation-level
intermediate program representation that allows the application of well-known
local scheduling techniques to achieve globally scheduled code. This approach
has been successfully applied to Modulo Scheduling and is extended to acyclic
scheduling; (3) Develop a task granularity adjustment methodology, similar in
concept to vectorization, for software pipelining in a superscalar/VLIW based
multiple processor system; and (4) Analyze the control architectures for
superscalar implementations of existing processors by studying the hardware and
compiler design complexities associated with scheduling multi-way branching and
partial predication architectures.
