This is an award to provide support for research to be initiated by this
Presidential Young Investigator who was nominated under conditions contained in
the Program Announcement NSF 89-58. The broad goals of this investigator's
research are concerned with understanding the underlying mechanisms that affect
physical and chemical processes used to treat water and wastewater. She is
particularly interested in to the role of particle chemistry and physics in
coagulation, filtration, adsorption and disinfection and in the use of ozone as
a destabilization agent and disinfectant in dilute aqueous systems. Results of
this research are likely to be utilized in engineering design of processes and
systems for removal of contaminants from municipal and industrial water
supplies. The results are also potentially applicable to formulating models that
track particles suspended in water as they move through groundwater aquifers.
