This award is for renewed support for the National Research Council's Committee
on Natural Disasters (CND) which was established to maintain readiness for
conducting postdisaster reconnaissance studies. Such studies include documenting
perishable information valuable to researchers, planners, designers,
practitioners, and building officials, as well as to emergency preparedness
officials, for their use in mitigating future natural disasters. The committee
also conducts separate studies, meetings, seminars, or symposia in the interests
of (a) implementing recommendations of the quick-response teams, and (b)
improving our ability to cope with future natural disasters. Long-term issues
regarding non-earthquake types of natural disasters and multiple-hazards issues
also are routinely a part of the committee's agenda.
