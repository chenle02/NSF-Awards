*** Trower 9510000 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
optimize the scintillation characteristics of cerium-doped yttrium aluminum
perovskite (YAP) by perfecting the firm's horizontal crystallization technology
with which it is produced. This optimization will continue phenomenological
efforts to model the scintillation processes in rare earth-doped complex single
crystal oxide scintillators. Concurrently, prototype YAP detectors systems will
be developed for two nuclear applications -- soft gamma-ray/x-ray spectroscopy
with emphasis on Mossbauer measurements and for alpha-particle spectroscopy.
High quality YAP scintillators could be used in about 10% of sodium iodide
applications. Grain-based alpha-particle detectors have potential in high
resolution alpha-particle spectroscopy. Soft gamma-ray/x-ray detector systems
have several spectroscopic applications particularly high-rate Mossbauer
measurements. ***
