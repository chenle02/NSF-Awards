0229026&lt;br/&gt;Tepper&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a
new kind of gas-phase biosensor to simultaneously detect chemical and biological
warfare agents entirely in the gas phase and in real time. Recent studies have
demonstrated that biological pathogens emit volatile chemical metabolites that
potentially can be utilized as a unique gas-phase signature. Therefore, the
volatile chemical agents will be detected directly while the biological species,
such as bacteria, will be detected through their volatile metabolites. The PIs
will develop nanoparticles possessing synthetic receptor sites targeted to the
volatile chemical metabolites of particular biological pathogens. The imprinted
particles will be interfaced with a microfabricated transducer and the resulting
biochip will be tested under exposure to a variety of vapors including the
metabolites. This technology has the potential to reduce or eliminate the
costly, labor intensive and time consuming practice of current air sampling and
analysis techniques. If successful, a portable, hand-held, gas phase biosensor
could be deployed at various high-risk locations to provide real-time monitoring
for biological and chemical agents.
