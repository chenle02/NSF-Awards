The research will be a continuation of studies of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies,
its local supercluster, and related galaxy systems. The proposed work is largely
observational, using the Arecibo telescope to observe the 21 centimeter spectral
line of neutral hydrogen (HI) to study the gas content and internal dynamics of
dwarf galaxies in Virgo, in low density regions behind Virgo and toward the
supercluster pole, and around groups of galaxies within the local supercluster.
The global HI properties of these galaxies will allow a critical comparison of
these observations with N-body simulations which should resolve questions
concerning mass segregation, recent theories of biased galaxy formation, and
various mechanisms of morphological segregation and HI deficiencies. The new HI
data, along with data from other sources, will extend the Tully-Fisher
correlation between the blue color magnitude (luminosity) and HI profile width
of the spectral line to the quite small dwarf galaxies which constitute the
dominant population of most galaxy groups. Undergraduate students will be
directly involved in the research.
