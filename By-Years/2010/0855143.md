This CRI planning grant uses the theory of conceptual metaphor to
plan&lt;br/&gt;the creation of an on-line metaphor resource that covers
multiple&lt;br/&gt;types of language and corpora. Metaphor is pervasive in human
language&lt;br/&gt;and thought and is crucial for both linguistic expression and
human&lt;br/&gt;reasoning. Conventionalized as well as novel metaphorical
expressions&lt;br/&gt;can be routinely encountered in everyday life
conversations, in&lt;br/&gt;newspapers, and in many other text types including
scientific,&lt;br/&gt;technical, and literary writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this planning effort is to resolve issues related to&lt;br/&gt;corpus
selection and preparation, and to incorporate community
wide&lt;br/&gt;evaluative feedback in the iterative design and implementation
of&lt;br/&gt;metaphor annotations. Towards the end of the planning work, there
will&lt;br/&gt;be a workshop to evaluate the approach, to build support for
the&lt;br/&gt;corpus creation enterprise, and to establish a user community.
This&lt;br/&gt;corpus selection and metaphor annotation effort is also
being&lt;br/&gt;coordinated with the companion SGER effort underway (NSF IIS
grant&lt;br/&gt;0843275) that is exploring issues related to scalable
metaphor&lt;br/&gt;modeling and inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-layer
annotations will include conceptual relations and&lt;br/&gt;metaphor domains,
linguistic expressions and frame annotations of the&lt;br/&gt;relevant lexical
targets, and syntactic relations that obtain in the&lt;br/&gt;annotated target
text. The result will be the design of a&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive, richly
annotated resource of metaphoric languge.The&lt;br/&gt;combination of this work,
along with parallel efforts in semantic&lt;br/&gt;analysis and inference should
permit the development and testing of&lt;br/&gt;large-scale systems capable of
figurative language processing within a&lt;br/&gt;few
years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
