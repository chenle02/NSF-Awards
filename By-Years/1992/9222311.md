The goal of this project is to identify and explain cross-language patterns in
ways Native American languages have named new objects or concepts encountered in
contact situations with Europeans. This will be achieved by surveying words for
77 items of Occidental culture (e.g., hen, horse, paper, rice, and soap) in
vocabularies of 600 to 700 American Indian languages and dialects. Such words
are either loanwords (e.g., from Portuguese into Brazilian Indian languages) or
terms manufactured from native vocabulary (e.g., "little maggots" for rice in
many North American Indian languages). Preliminary research suggests, for
example, that languages that are heavy adopters of European loans for these
items have histories involving significant bilingualism of speakers, while
languages that show considerable use of native terms for such items do not have
such histories. Another preliminary finding is that some items of acculturation,
such as the hen, tend strongly to be labeled by native terms across languages,
while other items, such as the horse, tend to be labeled by loanwords. This
finding indicates that words for items such as horse may have been used in
interactions with donors in the past to a greater extent than have words for
items such as hen. Eludications and explanation of these and other findings will
contribute to several areas of anthropological interest including
sociolinguistics, ethnobiology, language universals, language and culture
change, areal phenomena, and social histories of individual Native American
groups.
