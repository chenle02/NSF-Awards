This project aims to develop new stochastic models and a probabilistic
description for the complete shapes of generally multi-packed continuous-time
flood realizations. First, a point stochastic model of the generally multi-
station precipitation process, as observed at the available gaging stations over
a watershed, will be developed. Usingprecipitation as the driving process of
floods, a three-dimensional point stochastic (3-DPS) model for flood starting
times, times to peaks, and peak magnitudes will be obtained. Then a stochastic
model for the continuous-time flood realizations will be developed as an
extension of the 3-DPS model. Finally, a probabilistic description of the
continuous-time, generallymulti- peaked flood hydrograph realizations will be
obtained from the above models in terms of a joint probability density function.
