The intellectual merit resulting from the proposed research of the Stony Brook
NSF supported particle physics group, Experimental Studies of Fundamental
Symmetries, will be the provision of new understanding of underlying causes for
the breaking of the symmetry in the fundamental forces of nature. The symmetry
between the electromagnetic and weak forces is observed to occur above the 100
GeV scale, but is broken at low energy. The Standard Model (SM) of fundamental
interactions and constituents of matter posits the Higgs mechanism, resulting in
an observable new particle (the Higgs boson), which induces the symmetry
breaking, and gives mass to all observed quarks, leptons and gauge bosons.
Though logically consistent, this mechanism is widely believed to be an
incomplete and a probably flawed explanation. New phenomena are likely to exist
which could point the way to further unification of forces and identify a
candidate for the dark matter in the universe. New experimental data are
essential to discover how Nature has chosen to extend the SM. These questions
will be explored in two experimental programs, one at the ATLAS experiment at
the CERN and the other being DÃ˜ research at the Fermilab Tevatron.
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the program touches several areas. The group
will develop improved training programs for high school physics teachers,
support the Mariachi Project that installs detectors to sense high energy cosmic
ray showers in high school classrooms across the region, allowing students to
collaborate through a computer grid in measuring their properties and to learn
experimental skills, and to continue to give talks on physics research,
accelerators and technological spinoffs to general audiences.
