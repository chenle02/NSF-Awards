Rodents in the genus Peromyscus have become ideal models for studying the
genetic and other factors responsible for reproductive isolation and speciation,
as well as those factors enabling adaptive responses by organisms to changing
environmental conditions, including parasites and to other species. An award is
made to the Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center to provide a reliable source of live
Peromyscus animals (of seven species) and related materials to the national
scientific and educational communities. The Stock Center also functions as a
clearing house for information regarding this group of animals by sponsoring an
internet database, maintaining a reference collection of journal reprints, and
hosting a Peromyscus discussion blog. These resources are widely used in the
U.S. and elsewhere including numerous NSF-Bio supported researchers.

To date the Stock Center has supplied about 27,000 animals, providing the basis
for about 300 research articles spanning most areas of biology. Recently, the
Stock Center has contributed to numerous high impact discoveries that were
featured in the popular media. The Center also supports onsite research by
visiting scientists, hosting many such visitors each year. A substantial number
of graduate and undergraduate students conduct their research within the Center,
producing several Honors Theses and Ph.D. dissertations. Additional outreach
involves providing animals to zoos and participation of the Center's staff in
K-12 educational programs. More information on the Stock Center and its programs
