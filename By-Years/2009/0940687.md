&lt;br/&gt;The 1st Sino-USA Summer School in Vision, Learning and Pattern
Recognition (VLPR2009) is the first NSF-sponsored summer school in China that
brings together leading American and Chinese researchers and students in the
field of computer vision and machine learning for a week of educational and
cultural exchange program. The summer school will be held on the campus of
Peking University in Beijing, China. This award will provide travel support for
American researchers and students to attend the summer school. The summer school
provides a forum for not only technical interactions but also culture exchanges
among researchers and students from two countries.&lt;br/&gt;
