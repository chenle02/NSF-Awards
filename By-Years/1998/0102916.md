Partial funding is requested for a FASEB Summer Research Conference, " The
calpain gene family in health and disease" to be held June 30th to July 5th,
2001, at Big Mountain Resort, Whitefish, Montana. The conference will comprise
30 minutes oral presentations by 25 to 30 experts on various aspects of the
calpain family of intracellular proteases, as well as poster presentations from
graduate students and post-doctoral trainees. It will draw participants from a
wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds, since calpains are involved in many
physiologic and pathologic processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Half-day speaker
sessions will cover the following topics: calpain structure/function studies;
novel calpain genes; non-mammalian calpains; molecular and cellular aspects of
calpain regulation; physiologic functions of the calpains; genetic
calpainopathies, and other pathologies associated with
calpains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While focussing on the calpains, the meeting will
attract a broad range of investigators, allowing input from many perspectives.
From example, studies on model systems (C. elegans, Drosophila) may provide
insights on calpain functions in mammalian cells, and the effects of its loss in
calpainopathesis ( muscular dystrophy type 2A, type II
diabetes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the second FASEB Summer Conference on
Calpains. The first conference, held in 1999, was attended by over 110
participants. All talks and posters were well attended, and the conferees
overwhelmingly voted to have another meeting in 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
