Lamkang is one of approximately 30 Tibeto-Burman minority languages spoken in
Manipur State, India. Lamkang and all of the languages most closely related to
it are endangered due to intermarriage which prevents inter-generational
transmission. This project will create a free downloadable lexical database and
online dictionary of Lamkang which, in addition to its obvious benefits to
speakers (for example, standardization of orthography), will be useful to the
linguistic community in fostering a better understanding of the position of
Lamkang in its areal context, its genetic relationships, and its typological
connections. For example, the morphological complexity of Lamkang is striking
when compared to other Northeast Indian Tibeto-Burman languages which tend to be
of average morphological complexity. While related languages have either
suffixal or prefixal agreement markers, Lamkang combines prefixal and suffixal
agreement morphologies. The Lamkang language clearly has an interesting story to
tell in terms of its morphological development.
