This project, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, is in the
area of gas phase chemical kinetics. It involves the study of the reactions of
polyatomic free radicals with halogen containing diatomic molecules, such as HI,
HBr, and I2. The reactions will be studied using a heated tubular quartz reactor
coupled to a photoionization mass spectrometer. Excimer laser photolysis will be
employed to produce the polyatomic free radicals. This research will provide new
knowledge of the dynamics of important elementary reactions and provide more
accurate determinations of the thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpies of
formation, of the free radicals studied. This information will be of great
interest for the modeling of combustion processes, for the reliable prediction
of the thermochemical properties of reactive species, and for determining
plausible reaction mechanisms where knowledge of the potential energy along
competing reaction paths is essential.
