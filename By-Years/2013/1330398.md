Autism diagnosis is increasing worldwide. This ethnographic study of the
diagnosis and care of autistic children in China, a country in which the
emphasis since the 1980s has been on producing small numbers of high quality
children, and in which children are valued for the care they will be able to
offer their parents as adults, asks how a western medical category is taken up
and changed in a very different social setting. Bringing together
anthropological and STS concepts and literatures, this study is innovative in
its focus on families, organizations and the state in China.

This research will result in a dissertation and the production of a scholar
well-trained in Chinese language and society. A better understanding of how the
Chinese conceptualize and treat autism will provide a worthwhile comparison to
the more "biological" understanding of autism prevalent in the United States and
could provide a useful model for patient advocates in the US working to reduce
the stigma of autism.
