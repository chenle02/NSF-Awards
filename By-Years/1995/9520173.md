9520173 Hellawell This research effort is directed towards improved capability
for predicting the properties of manufactured items from the microstructure of
the base material and the processing path that was used in production. To
accomplish this it is necessary to describe the microstructure in quantitative
terms; accordingly, image analysis systems and the interpretation of acquired
microstructural information are examined to numerically describe microstructural
assemblies. A majority of metal alloy microstructures, such as those derived
from solidification and casting, are not easily described in terms of Euclidean
geometry. For these cases fractal analysis can be employed to make numerical
statements about the microstructure, however chaotic it may be. The feasibility
of this approach has been shown for distributions of graphite in graphitic cast
irons and should apply to many other complex microstructures which presently
defy quantitative numerical assessment. The research involves model alloy
systems and actual industrial products, starting with cast irons and aluminum-
based engine castings. Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation view
this research as an important area of pre-competitive technology and are
providing significant contributions to the program. %%% While this program is
academically stimulating, it has considerable industrial potential for
predictive automation of manufacturing processes. ***
