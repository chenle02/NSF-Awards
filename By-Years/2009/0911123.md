KDO (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid) is an unusual 8-carbon acidic
sugar that is essential for the growth of many pathogenic bacteria affecting
plants and animals. For example, in Gram-negative bacteria such as Brucella,
which causes severe infections in humans and lifestock KDO is a crucial part of
the Lipid A-based lipopolysaccharides. KDO has also been discovered in plants
and green algae, although its biological roles in these organisms are still
unclear. The high cost of this sugar coupled with the challenge of making it by
chemical synthesis has limited basic scientific studies of the synthetic
chemistry of KDO, its biological roles, and the development of antibiotics based
on inhibiting KDO-based pathways. This project aims to 1) optimize engineering
efforts to obtain KDO in gram quantities from a bacterial source, 2) investigate
chemical methods to link KDO to other structures, 3) explore protocols to use
KDO building blocks in an automated solution-phase oligosaccharide synthesis
platform to incorporate this sugar into larger bioactive structures, and 4) test
the binding of KDO to a range of plant carbohydrate-binding proteins called
lectins to discover potential binding partners of this pathogen-associated
sugar. Broader Impact: This interdisciplinary project will broaden the
participation of underrepresented groups by inclusion of students from
underrepresented groups as participants in the proposed research and education
activities; advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching,
training, and learning by inclusion of graduate and undergraduate students as
participants and the encouragement of their participation at national and
international scientific meetings; and develop the first fermentation-based
production processes and new chemistry of an unusual sugar key to bacterial
infectiousness of plants and animals to help unravel the infection processes and
ultimately inhibit these infections.
