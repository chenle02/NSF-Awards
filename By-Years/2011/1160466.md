The aim of this project is to investigate some instances of the theory of
derived categories of coherent sheaves. In particular, the P.I. has three main
objectives: (1) To study the geometry of moduli spaces of complexes for the
projective plane, K3 surfaces and cubic 4-folds. (2) To realize ``classical''
questions and conjectures in enumerative geometry as wall-crossing phenomena in
derived category, the starting example being the total space of the canonical
bundle over the projective plane. (3) To give a complete description of
equivalences between the derived categories of K3 surfaces and of their
deformations.

The broader context of this project is the area of algebraic geometry. Starting
as a pure mathematical subject, in the recent years algebraic geometry has seen
many interactions with other areas of science. The present project is motivated
and inspired precisely by connections, envisioned by the Fields Medal winner M.
Kontsevich almost twenty years ago, with theoretical physics and string theory.
In particular, by bringing intuition and techniques from physics to tackle
classical problems in pure mathematics and, vice versa, to provide mathematical
rigorous foundations to physics constructions.
