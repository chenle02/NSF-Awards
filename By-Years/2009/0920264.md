The use of case-studies to engage students and promote higher order thinking is
well-documented in education. The National Center for Case Study Teaching in
Science (NCCSTS) has pioneered the use of case studies in large classes using
clicker technology, "an audience response system". In this new project they are
studying the educational benefits of different types of clicker questions
embedded in a case study, and also the educational effect of utilizing an
emotional storyline. Ten faculty at different institutions are teaching the same
case in two different biology classes, except the clicker questions differ. In
one section, the questions concentrate on factual knowledge while, in the other,
higher order thinking is emphasized (synthesis, analysis, evaluation, etc.).
Also, half of the cases designed for the study have protagonists engaged in
emotional situations while the other half do not. Assessment of the students'
performance is done via the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal inventory,
a multiple choice exam, and a short-essay exam.
