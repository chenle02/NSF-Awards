This three-year project seeks to develop and test materials that will enable
upper elementary and middle school teachers to carry out research activities
concerning students' use of Logo. The goal is to develop and assess a
professional development model that will assist teachers in becoming more
knowledgeable, reflective, and diagnostic in their use of Logo, so that the
potential of Logo to promote students' mathematical development will be more
fully realized. The project consists of two cycles. In the first, ten teachers
from the Boston area will participate in an academic-year seminar involving
research on their own students' use of Logo. During the second cycle, six
teachers will be trained as seminar leaders who will, with the assistance of the
project staff, conduct the academic-year seminar for their colleagues. Thirty
teachers from schools near Boston, as well as thirty other teachers from three
more distant districts, will be involved in the second cycle. The participating
school districts are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to 7% of the
NSF award.
