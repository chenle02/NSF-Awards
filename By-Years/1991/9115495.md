This research project will use national longitudinal data sets of scientists
and engineers between 1982 and 1989, supplemented with newly collected and
constructed data measures of occupational depreciation and transferability of
skills, to generate new estimates of occupational exit and reentry of scientists
and engineers. The research will draw on existing theoretical models of
occupational choice and occupational switching to develop econometric models of
exit and reentry. Empirical techniques such as hazard rate and competing risks
models will be used to estimate parameters of the models that will be used to
refine projections of supply of scientists and engineers. //
