This award supports travel of US participants in the 14th international
conference on Finite Fields and their Applications (Fq14) which will be held in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada June 3-7 2019 at the Simon Fraser University
Harbour Centre. As the name indicates, this conference is the 14th in a biannual
series, and it is the premier international conference on the topic of finite
fields, an important research area at the crossroads of algebra, number theory
and combinatorics.

Topics to be discussed at the conference include the structure of finite fields,
perfect non-linear functions, algorithms and complexity, algebraic coding
theory, cryptography and quantum information theory among others. The website
for this conference can be found at https://www.sfu.ca/math/news---

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
