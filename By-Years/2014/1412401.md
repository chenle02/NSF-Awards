The long term goal of this project is to address one of the grand challenges in
the chemical sciences: How to design and perfect the atom- and energy-efficient
synthesis of new forms of matter with tailored properties. To this end, Dr. Amar
H. Flood at Indiana University seeks knowledge of how to design star-shaped
molecules bearing holes in their centers to recognize and hold unique classes of
negatively charged anions that were once considered too large to catch. By doing
so, this research and these molecules can have impacts in removing toxic anions
from contaminated water or manipulating anions important for human health. In
addition, his research team investigates how star-shaped structures can be
designed to self-assemble and fit together to form larger assemblies, e.g.,
nanometer-sized, soccer-ball shaped architectures. He aims to unfold the rules
of their self-assembly because molecules cannot be picked and placed together
like a lego set. Such materials could have impacts in compartmentalized chemical
catalysis and for gated drug delivery. Broader impact activities of the project
include training of graduate and undergraduate students, using 3D printing to
teach principles of self-assembly, and developing strategies to increase the
participation and visibility of under-represented minorities and women at
conferences organized by Dr. Flood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the support of
the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of NSF, Dr. Flood
seeks to develop the syntheses of polycyanostilbene macrocycles called
"cyanostars" for binding anions (e.g., biorelevant phosphates), and understand
fundamentally how non-covalent interactions (such as CH H-bonding) and
solvophobic effects influence anion binding. Furthermore, he explores the use of
cyanostars in rotaxanes that can switch between states and in novel self-
assembled architectures that stem from anion templation and 5-fold symmetry.
