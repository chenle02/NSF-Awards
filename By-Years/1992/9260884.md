This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has as its
purpose the development of interactive multimedia software for teaching science
to K-12 students. The software will enable students to search for evidence,
sharpen their analytical skills, consult with national experts, and invoke
strengths in writing and creative expression to stimulate their interest in
science. In particular, the software will provide students with a toolkit for
(1) searching video recordings of scientific and natural phenomena for usable
data, (2) extracting, organizing, and analyzing the data, and (3) preparing
written, audio, and video presentations on the computer. Students will also be
able to add their own video events for analysis and be able to compare their
results with the comments and findings of scientific experts. In the creation of
the software, special attention will be paid to female and minority students.
