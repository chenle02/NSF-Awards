This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop new
implantable electrodes for use in neurological sensing and stimulation.
Neuroprostheses have been traditionally fabricated from metals such as stainless
steel. The effectiveness of metallic implant devices can be compromised by
exposure to the corrosive physiologic environment. Material property mismatches
between body tissues and metals can also reduce the tolerability of these
devices, especially of those used around muscle tissue. Plastics are finding
increasing application in implants due to their more natural stress transfer
properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. The proposed research
objective is to develop a novel molecularly ordered silicone elastomer that
offers tailorable mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility,
physiological stability and high electrical conductivity. Conducting polymers
will be incorporated in a polysiloxane matrix to yield ordered structures for
maximizing conductivity while preserving the desired elastomer properties.
Conductive composites will be prepared and tested for electrical conductivity,
mechanical properties, physiological durability and suitability for implantable
devices.

The principal commercial application of this project is in the neuroprosthesis
device market. Successful development of non-metallic electrodes having high
electrical conductivity and improved biomechanical properties will have
significant potential in this market. Other potential product areas include
anticorrosion coatings and electrical shielding materials.
