The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was
established to provide support to strengthen the research environments and
capabilities of predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have
substantial minority student populations. Eligible institutions must also have
graduate programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for
faculty research in fields of science and engineering supported by the
Foundation and for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Jackson State
University will use RIMI support to study senescence (process of becoming old)
and the use of parasexuality as a new tool in the control of insect pests. Under
the broad heading of genetics and cell biology, the Jackson State research group
will use one study to search for unique proteins during senescence by using two-
dimensional gel electrophoresis. In another project, the group will expose
conidia from fungi isolates to ultraviolet light to obtain mutants. These
mutants and prototropic somatic diploids will be tested for virulence. This
project will further the institution's goal of establishing a Molecular Biology
Research Institute at Jackson State University. The principal investigator of
this project is a well-trained plant pathologist and entomologist who has
published extensively in refereed journals. The Foundation has supported this
project because more opportunities will be available for minority faculty and
students to participate in meritorious research in molecular biology.
