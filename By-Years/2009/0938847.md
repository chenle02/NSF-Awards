The question of how the internal climate dynamical state will interact with
climate change is of great theoretical and practical importance. This study
explores the disconcerting possibility that the response of the climate system
to a radiative perturbation of a given magnitude may depend strongly upon the
climate state itself. The underlying process, referred to here as feedback
drift, has been documented in one coupled ocean-atmosphere model, a state-of-
the-art, full physics climate model. This work is an effort to understand the
physical mechanism underlying this feedback drift using both empirical studies
and simplified, explanatory models, in order to assess the possibility that such
feedback drift might occur in other fully resolved climate models, and to
develop the necessary empirical understanding and diagnostic techniques to
determine whether such a process might be occurring in
nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If indeed climate feedback drifts significantly
with respect to the underlying climate dynamical state, our understanding of
climate change thresholds, the perception of supposed "safe" levels of
anthropogenic greenhouse gasses, and our understanding of the overall role of
climate variability in the climate system will necessarily be altered. Thus,
while exploratory, this research is potentially of great practical
importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the training of
a Ph.D. student in the area of cloud/climate interactions. The work will help
quantify a potential risk factor in future climate change that is of intrinsic
interest to decision makers responsible for implementing emission scenarios that
"target" a given level of climate change.
