This project aims to serve the national interest by improving understanding of
the social, cultural, educational, and institutional parameters affecting
matriculation of Latina engineering students into graduate engineering programs.
The work will improve understanding of the complex psycho-social processes
contributing to the persistent underrepresentation of Latinx and Hispanic
students across STEM fields and the existence of a gender gap that is larger
than found in the general population. Latinx and Hispanic students in STEM come
from the fastest growing ethnic minority in the United States. However, they are
extremely underrepresented in terms of STEM degrees, especially at the graduate
level. This research helps correct this situation, by providing critically
needed insights to draw more Latina students into STEM graduate programs and
eventually into the professorial ranks.

This project will improve understanding of the complex factors affecting the
career decisions of Latina engineering students and their likelihood to enter
graduate engineering study. Two research questions are posed: RQ1: How do Latina
engineering students describe the factors related to their decision, decision
processes, or intentions to enter graduate school and/or engineering career
pathways? RQ2: How do Latina engineering students describe the social, cultural,
educational, and institutional experiences that impact their decision, decision
process, or intentions to enter graduate school and/or engineering career
pathways? An explanatory sequential mixed methods approach will be employed.
Phase 1 is quantitative with an emphasis on institutional integration using the
modified Collegiate Achievement Model. Results from phase 1 are used to inform
the qualitative phase 2 which shifts the theoretical framework to the Community
Cultural Wealth Model to center the complexities and assets of the participantsâ€™
lived experiences. This is done specifically to provide broader, richer insights
into both the institutional integration issues and the cultural and social
perspectives behind the factors and experiences impacting Latina engineering
student graduate study and career pathway decisions.
