This research uses modeling tools to improve the understanding of the emissions
and lifetimes in the atmosphere of a broad range of halocarbons, including
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), and fully fluorinated compounds such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF-6) and
cycloinulohexaose (CF-6). Emissions of halocarbons, including CFCs and HCFCs,
contribute to both global climate change and ozone loss, while those of the HFCs
and perfluorinated gases contribute to climate change. The results of this
research will be relevant to future international assessments of ozone, climate,
and chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three components of this project
include: (1) Improved studies of the banks, emissions, lifetimes, and their
respective uncertainties for an expanded range of halocarbon gases, using a
probabilistic Bayesian model developed and applied previously for CFC-11, -12
and -13; (2) Efforts to examine the potential influence of the ocean and its
variability over time on lifetimes, emissions, and regional atmospheric
concentrations for a range of halocarbon gases, building on recent modelling
work of the significant effects of the ocean on the lifetime of CFC-11; and (3)
Research on the interannual dynamical variations in the atmospheric lifetimes,
stratospheric-tropospheric exchange, and tropospheric concentrations of
halocarbons using a global atmospheric model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
