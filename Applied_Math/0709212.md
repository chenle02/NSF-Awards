This project focuses on modeling synchronization and coherent behavior in
realistic networks with complex structure. As an emerging field, the study of
synchronization in complex networks has so far not seen sufficiently strong
connections between theory and the actual behavior of real systems. The first
objective of the proposed research is the empirical analysis of collective
dynamics in complex systems in the technological, social, and biological
domains. This will be achieved by developing methods for data analysis of the
dynamics of three types of systems: power grids, human communities, and
biochemical reaction systems. The second objective is to extend the current
theoretical framework for analyzing the synchronized and coherent dynamics in
such systems. The final objective is to combine the empirical observations and
the theoretical development in the modeling of these complex systems as networks
of simple dynamical units. This approach will be used to investigate how the
collective dynamics is influenced by the underlying network structure and the
properties of the individual dynamical units.

The study of synchronization in power grids is important to assess and reduce
the influence of voltage phenomena in triggering large blackouts. The study of
coherent dynamics in human communities is relevant to help build more efficient
strategies for the allocation of services and resources and for the assessment
and management of risks. The study of synchronization in biochemical reaction
systems is important to advance our understanding of large biochemical networks
in living organisms. The planned research activities are interdisciplinary and
will involve the training of undergraduate students, including students from
under-represented minorities, and one graduate student. Outreach activities are
also planned in the form of individual research advising and public lectures at
a local high school, allowing our research results to be presented to a large
and diverse public.
