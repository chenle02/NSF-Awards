This is a two year project to develop and deploy measurement tools across the
Internet to measure Internet Service Provider (ISP) performance, and to share
the resulting statistics. It is being conducted by Advanced Network & Services
(ANS), a nonprofit networking corporation, and the Common Solutions Group (CSG),
an informal coalition of 22 major research universities and several other
organizations located around the United States. ANS and the CSG are coordinating
closely with three other Internet measurement projects being funded by NSF:
Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), National Internet
Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI), and Internet Performance Measurement and
Analysis.
