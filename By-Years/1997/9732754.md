The research focuses on two topics in Applied Cryptography: efficient generation
of shared RSA keys and the bit security of the Diffie-Hellman secret. To protect
a high security private key one may wish to share it among a few sites. If a
small number of sites are compromised no harm is done. An obvious question is
who generates the shared key? Traditionally, a "trusted dealer" generates an RSA
key pair and then splits the private key among the sites. This project studies
various protocols for enabling three or more parties to efficiently generate a
shared RSA key WITHOUT a trusted dealer. At the end of the computation the
participants have an RSA modulus N=pq. They are all convinced that N is the
product of two large distinct primes; however no proper coalition knows the
factorization of N. The protocols should be appropriate for small, low bandwidth
devices such as smartcards or Personal Digital Assistants (PDA's). The project's
second topic is the bit security of the Diffie- Hellman secret. The Diffie-
Hellman protocol enables two parties to exchange a secret. Although an adversary
may not be able to compute the entire secret, she may be able to infer certain
information about it. The proposed research will provide bounds on the amount of
information an adversary can infer. To do so one shows that if an adversary can
recover certain bits of the Diffie-Hellman secret then she can also break the
entire protocol. The techniques needed for such reductions involve lattices and
the LLL algorithm.
