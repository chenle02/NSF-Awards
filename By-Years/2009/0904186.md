In all cellular organisms the genetic information contained in DNA (chromosomes)
is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then serves as a template for
translation of the genetic code into protein. Thus, the primary function of mRNA
is to serve as a template for protein synthesis. Recently, the applicant
discovered a novel structural function of the Veg T mRNA in frog (Xenopus
laevis) germ cells (oocytes). It was found that VegT mRNA also has a role in
maintaining the integrity of the cytokeratin cytoskeleton of the cell.
Experimental removal of this mRNA from oocytes results in the disruption of the
cytoskeleton and leads to the abnormal development of embryos. These findings
suggest that mRNA has, in addition to initiating protein synthesis, a structural
function in the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. The applicant will
map the regions on the VegT mRNA, which are required for maintaining structural
integrity of the cytoskeleton by using mutagenesis and X-ray
microscopy/tomography imaging techniques. X-ray microscopy/tomography techniques
allow much better resolution than light microscopy, and are not subject to the
artifacts encountered with conventional electron microscopy. This conceptually
novel discovery of a role for mRNA in maintaining the structural integrity of
the cellular cytoskeleton establishes a new paradigm, and should open new
frontiers in the study of RNA function. The involvement of high school,
undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in this project,
with the focus on the involvement of minority students, will ensure that these
novel scientific concepts and methodologies will be disseminated among
apprentices.
