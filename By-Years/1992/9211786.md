This proposal seeks funding for the 5th Van Der Ziel Symposium on Quantum 1/f
Noise and Other Low Frequency Fluctuations in Electronic Devices to be held at
the University of Missouri on May 22-23, 1992. Like the previous symposia
organized by the PI in October 1985, October 1986, April 1988 and May 1990, this
conference will bring together researchers from universities, industrial and
governmental research laboratories, and the industry, working in the field of
Quantum 1/f Noise and other low frequency fluctuations. To explain why funding
this Symposium makes sense, this proposal focuses on the description of the
present state and of the research directions in the field of Quantum 1/f Noise,
although other low frequency fluctuations are also included (as in 1988 and
1990), in order to widen the scope of the Symposium and the pool of
participants.
