To facilitate scientific advances and crop improvement, the thousands of maize
genes being discovered during the maize genome sequencing project must be
ordered relative to a genetic map. This project builds on prior NSF investments
in maize genomics to genetically map 4,500 genes. The resulting high-density
transcript map will enhance our understanding of the organization and evolution
of the maize genome. These thousands of mapped genes will also provide the
necessary sequence-based cross-links to facilitate the alignment of the rice
physical map with the maize genetic map. This resource will provide a means to
determine the linear order on maize chromosomes of maize genes. One thousand co-
dominant genetic markers (Insertion Deletion Polymorphisms [IDP]s) suitable for
use in a wide variety of genetic experiments will also be generated and
distributed to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan provides
numerous, interdisciplinary training opportunities for a diverse group of
undergraduate and graduate students at the interface between molecular and
computational genomics. The project will use a variety of mechanisms to involve
undergraduate students from a research university, an undergraduate college and
underserved institutions. These trainees will be provided with intensive
mentored research experiences. To help prepare them for scientific careers in a
global environment, undergraduate students will visit to the International Maize
and Wheat Improvement Center (Spanish acronym CIMMYT) in Mexico. Trainees will
also be encouraged to return to the high schools from which they graduated to
make short presentations regarding their research activities. Other outreach
activities will include a program conducted in partnership with the Reiman
Gardens at Iowa State University (http://www.reimangardens.iastate.edu) to
expose elementary school students to plant
biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deliverables:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4,500 mapped
genes and 1000 co-dominant genetic markers (Insertion Deletion Polymorphisms
[IDP]s) will be generated and distributed to the public via the project database
&lt;br/&gt;
(http://pslab.agron.iastate.edu/research/genomics/htp_est/idps.shtml) as well as
public databases such as PlantGDB (http://www.zmdb.iastate.edu/PlantGDB/),
MaizeGDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/), and Gramene
(http://www.gramene.org/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
