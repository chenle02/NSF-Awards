Abstract 9613966 Persson This award provides funding for a two-year phaseout of
the NSF/Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Energetic Materials
and support of an undergraduate student to participate in the research of the
Center. This Center will provide an ongoing research and development
organization for work on the safety of energetic materials, particularly those
which are now increasingly stored, transported, and used in large quantities and
which have relevance to RCEMOs member companies. The main research focus of the
projects being undertaken is directed towards reducing the environmental effects
of large explosions, fire hazards, and increasing the safety in processing of
energetic materials. The Center will continue to collaborate with its corporate
and government sponsors and it is expected that this support will grow.
