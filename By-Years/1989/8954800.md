The Mathematical Association of America will conduct a four-year project
titled, "Building Multimedia Instructional Materials to Nationally Promote the
Use of Calculator Technology in Mathematics Classes". The proposal is included
in the special solicitation, "Projects to Promote the Effective Use of
Technology in the Teaching of Science and Mathematics". Each kit will feature a
20-minute videotape on the use of graphing or symbol manipulating calculators to
teach principles and techniques of mathematics. Two school districts in Texas
will participate to become models in the use of calculators in implementing the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards. The NCTM will
provide expertise in reviewing the products in the development stage. The
project team produced the successful video, "Math: You Can Count on It", and
features a number of prominent figures in mathematics education. This project
has the potential for great significance, since it represents a key step in the
drive for national acceptance of calculators in mathematics education. The
Mathematical Association of America, Texas Instruments, and the two
participating school districts are contributing an amount equal to 42% of the
National Science Foundation request.
