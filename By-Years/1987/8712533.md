Increased fluxes of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) have recently occurred in
Antarctica as a result of an annual seasonal depletion of stratospheric ozone.
Karentz will conduct initial photobiological investigations for the evaluation
of the impact of increased UVR exposures on Antarctic ecosystems. The mutagenic
potential of incident UVR during and after the spring maximum of ozone depletion
will be quantified using a plasmid vector and Escherichia coli B-galactosidase
mutation screening. DNA repair capabilities of species will be evaluated by the
method of unscheduled DNA synthesis, and UVR-tolerance characteristics will be
assessed by observations of UVR dose-dependent responses of growth and
photosynthesis. The data collected will provide information for the evaluation
of the possible repercussions of UVR-initiated changes in the taxonomic
structure of Antarctic communities relative to primary productivity and trophic-
level interactions. This award is a Research Opportunities for Women award.
