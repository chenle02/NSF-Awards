The combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a
powerful instrumental technique for separating and identifying the components of
complex mixtures such as those encountered in investigations in chemistry and
biology. This project introduces a new half-course early in the curriculum to
educate chemistry and biology majors in the theory and applications of this
technique. The instrument also will be used in advanced courses and in
independent research projects. The grantee will match the NSF grant from non-
Federal sources.
