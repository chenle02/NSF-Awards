Prop ID: DMS-0531839 PI: Fan, Jianqing Institution: Princeton University Title:
Workshop on Frontiers of Statistics: Nonparametric Modeling of Complex Data

This is an extremely well conceived worshop that will bring together some of
the The frontiers of statistics are dynamic and vibrant. The aim of this
proposal is to organize a workshop on the frontiers of statistics that involve
large and complex data. The conference will focus on data-analytic nonparametric
techniques in diverse fields of disciplines such as computational biology,
financial econometrics, machine learning, and industrial engineering. It will
also include various topics on statistical theory and methods. A distinguished
feature of the conference is that it addresses emerging statistical problems
that arise from various frontiers of science. It will be very helpful for
shaping the future directions of statistical research.

The purpose of this proposal is to bring together top and junior researchers to
define and expand these research frontiers of statistics. The workshop provides
a focal venue for top and junior researchers to gather, interact and present
their new research findings, to discuss and outline emerging problems in their
fields, and to lay the groundwork for fruitful future collaborations. Moreover,
it will provide an overview for graduate students who are interested in seeking
for an interesting area to work. The workshop focuses on various nonparametric
statistical problems from various frontiers of science and engineering such as
computational biology, financial econometrics, machine learning, and industrial
engineering. It will be very helpful for shaping the future directions of
statistical research that addresses problems of high societal impact.
