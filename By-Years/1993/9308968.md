9308968 Barry The Principal Investigator is analyzing the potential of diffuse
infrared radiation as a technique for use in short-range wireless communication
links providing network access to portable communicators and portable computers.
The researcher is investigating the fundamental limitations on the speed of
diffuse wireless links using infrared radiation, and determining which
modulation and equalization techniques are best able to support high-speed
communications. The award provides support for three years.
