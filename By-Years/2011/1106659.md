This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) of the National Science
Foundation, with additional support from the National Institutes of Health
(National Institute of General Medical Sciences) supports Terri Taylor and
colleagues at the American Chemical Society in their development of educational
materials to teach members of the public about chemistry, and its ubiquity in
everyday life. The award activities will include engagement with the public at
Science Festivals as well as through more formal interaction with teachers. The
work includes the development of Challenge Kits for distribution to upper
elementary and middle schools, clubs, and other interested members of the
general public. The award coincides with the International Year of
Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work like that of Terri Taylor and her
colleagues is aimed at introducing a broad cross-section of American society to
this exciting area of research. In addition, connecting young people with
current areas of science enables the Foundation to more effectively encourage
young people to pursue careers in the science and technology sectors.
