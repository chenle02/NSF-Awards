The objective of this program is to develop an adaptive optics (AO) system for
the MMT Observatory on Mt. Hopkins Arizona for the observation and
characterization of planets orbiting stars other than the sun (exoplanets). The
system is abbreviated as MAPS. Broader impacts of the work include training of
students and postdocs in astronomical instrumentation. The MAPS team will
develop an annual winter school focused on training and academic development for
undergraduate and graduate students, complemented by advanced high school
students identified through UA's existing Astronomy Camp. The week-long school
will directly engage MAPS investigators, local astronomy facilities, and
authentic data sets relevant to exoplanet
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support technology
development for an upgraded adaptive secondary telescope mirror to improve the
adaptive optics performance while preserving the desired low backgrounds for
long wavelength (infrared) observations. The ultimate goal of MAPS is to develop
the capabilities for (1) high spatial resolution to resolve the planets and
disks; (2) high spectral resolution to begin understanding the components of
other systems; and (3) broad wavelength coverage to probe systems at the range
of wavelengths crucial for thorough study.
