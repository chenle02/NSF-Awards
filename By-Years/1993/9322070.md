9322070 Hatcher This award provides support for a group of six undergraduate
researchers in the mathematical sciences working at Texas Christian University.
Students will work on individual research projects applying computational group
theoretic methods to problems arising from variations of sliding block
configurations. Three faculty advisors will work with students, who will be
divided into groups according to their interests. Computers using GAP software
will be available for experimentation and exploration. Students will be expected
to make oral presentations and write up the results of their efforts at the end
of the program in the form of research papers. They will be encouraged to
participate in professional meetings as well. The program will run for a period
of eight weeks. Optional housing on campus is available. Recruiting will be done
on a regional basis, with particular emphasis placed on alerting students in
underrepresented groups of the REU opportunity. ***
