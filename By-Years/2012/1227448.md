This research project involves developing new estimation and inference tools for
continuous-time semimartingale models sampled at high frequency. The
semimartingale model is the most general model for asset prices that precludes
arbitrage opportunities and, as a result, has been the workhorse model in modern
asset pricing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Semimartingales have different components: a
stochastic drift capturing the smooth movement of the asset price, a continuous
martingale part modeling diffusive volatility and a jump part capturing abrupt
movements of the asset price. While each component plays a distinct role in
applications, it is statistically nontrivial to disentangle one component from
the others. The objective of this project is to develop a novel statistical
estimation and inference procedure for the jump component of the semimartingale.
Compared with the existing methods, the new procedure will be more robust,
especially when price jumps are difficult to identify from the
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the motivating examples in the proposed
activity are those of financial models, the methods developed in this project
are valid for generic semimartingales. Semimartingales play a central role in
the general theory of stochastic processes and stochastic calculus. Besides
economics and finance, semimartingales have also been used in biological,
chemical, and electrical applications. The econometric and statistical methods
developed here may find applications in these fields provided that observations
are available at high frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates
research and education by working closely with graduate students in the form of
research assistantships. The proposed methodologies involve new implementation
procedures whose code will be made publicly available. The results will be
disseminated broadly through publications and presentations at seminars,
conferences and professional association meetings.
