The city-sized, rapidly rotating, neutron stars known as pulsars are revealed to
astronomers primarily through their radio-frequency emission beams, which sweep
past the Earth much like lighthouse beacons. These trains of radio "flashes"
exhibit a rich variety of phenomena, reflecting complex processes in the pulsar
magnetosphere that in turn reflect exotic physical conditions above the stellar
surface. Pulsars thus provide uniquely important opportunities to extend and
test our basic understanding of physics in extreme conditions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here, the mechanism of pulsar emission will be studied by
focusing on two closely connected issues: their predominant core emission in
single pulses will be investigated for the first time; and the orientation of
its orthogonally polarized modes relative to the magnetic field will be
determined, thereby providing important new opportunities to assess, model, and
develop appropriate physical theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The observational,
analytical and theoretical work will be conducted by a skilled and experienced
international team which will include Dr. Rankin, a graduate student,
undergraduates, and collaborators in India and Europe. Dr. Rankin will also
continue her public talks on pulsars to K-12 schools and the general public.
