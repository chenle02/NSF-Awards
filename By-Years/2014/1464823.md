This award will provide support for students and young postdoctoral scientists
to attend the 24th International Workshop on Vertex Detectors in Santa Fe, New
Mexico,June 1-5, 2015. This conference will review existing and proposed future
semiconductor detectors,&lt;br/&gt;new technologies, radiation hardness,
simulation, tracking alignment, electronics, triggering, and applications to
medical and other fields. Attendance by junior members of the instrumentation
community is a priority for this meeting. Accelerators play a critical role in
future advances in a number of scientific disciplines, as well as a number of
technologies, including materials processing and medical imaging. Training of a
cadre of junior scientists in the development of new detectors is especially
important, both for the role they play in making new discoveries as well as
supporting the broad commercial use of accelerator and detector technology.
