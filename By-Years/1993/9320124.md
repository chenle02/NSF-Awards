9320124 Bodenschatz Technical abstract: The investigation is concerned with the
thermal convection of pressurized gases in an inclined layer. This system has
been chosen since it is ideally suited for the study of multiparameter
bifurcations in anisotropic pattern-forming systems. An experiment in convection
of pressurized gases, opposed to, for example, electroconvection of liquid
crystals (EC), has the major advantage that the fundamental equations describing
the fluid flow are well understood. Pressurized gases allow experiments
(similarly to EC) in large systems, where boundary effects are weak and much of
the spatial degrees of freedom are retained. In addition, by changing the
temperature and pressure a wide range in parameters can be achieved. The weakly
nonlinear region will be investigated and quantitatively compared with recent
theoretical investigations. Non-technical abstract: The aim of this research is
th experimental investigation of nonlinear, non-equilibrium pattern- forming
phenomena. As a paradigm buoyancy-driven convective flow in a fluid layer which
is inclined with respect to the horizontal will be studied. This system is of
great interest from a physics point of view as well as of major importance in
heating and cooling technology. By using pressurized gases at ambient
temperatures as working fluids convection cells with unprecedented large system
sizes under well controlled boundary conditions can be realized. It is expected
that boundary effects will be weak and much of the spatial degrees of freedom
will be retained. The research will allow a detailed quantitative comparison
with recent theoretical investigations. ***
