This award funds three conferences that will stimulate new research in the
interdisciplinary area of cliometrics, which combines economics, statistics,
history, demography, sociology, anthropology, anatomy, and climatology as well
as other disciplines to examine core questions about economic theory and the
development of modern economies. The conferences bring together young scholars,
including graduate students, with a group of excellent senior scholars to engage
in workshop sessions that give intensive commentary on early research results.
The goal is to improve research quality, promote graduate training, and allow
young scholars to build deeper research networks. The result is better
scientific knowledge about the evolution and structural dynamics of the U.S.
economy and the international economy. The conferences advance science, promote
the training of U.S. students in this area, and shed valuable light on how
government and business decisions can affect the U.S. economic competitiveness.
