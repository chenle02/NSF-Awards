This renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Florida
International University focuses on research in secured sensor technologies. The
theme presents an opportunity for undergraduates to participate in research with
broad impact in mobile health, vehicle platooning, cybersecurity, mobile crowd-
sensing, and data analytics. Through firsthand-experience in an
interdisciplinary, collaborative environment, students will participate in
scientific research through focused activities, building research skills and
knowledge on innovative, emerging technologies. Planned activities foster
collaborative communication among participants, enhance their research skills,
promote learning, and provide motivation to consider research careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduates will work with research faculty to explore
new technologies and solutions utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSN), as well
as software/hardware solutions essential to the advancement and practical
application of new technologies. The research includes a range of projects,
including privacy-preserving blockchain for WSN, information-centric networking
with augmented reality, security and privacy for flying ad-hoc networks, trusted
crowdsourcing schemes in mobile sensor networks, and Li-FI sensor networks.
Diverse groups of undergraduates will explore these topics to better prepare
them for graduate studies, ultimately building human capacity while increasing
workforce diversity. Additional broader impacts include providing
scientific/cross-cultural experiences to members of underrepresented
undergraduate groups, including minorities, women, and persons with
disabilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
