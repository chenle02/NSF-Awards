This grant will develop a computational model of the solar wind, capable of
forecasting solar wind conditions based on remote observations of the Sun. The
PI will develop a comprehensive three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
model capable of computing solutions for the solar wind from its genesis at the
Sun to beyond Earth orbit. Based on a robust MHD code already used in 3-D
calculations of the corona and solar wind, this instrument has produced
agreeable calculations with coronal and heliospheric observations. Key
improvements to the code will be inclusion of important dynamic and
thermodynamic effects, including a transition region, radiation, thermal
conduction, coronal heating and Alfven wave acceleration. The project relates to
implementing the 1-D formalism into a 3-D MHD model, and parameterizing the
important effects via comparison to Helios, WIND, and Ulysses solar wind data.
The grant's end result: a unique computational tool capable of predicting the
evolving structure of the solar corona and inner heliosphere.
