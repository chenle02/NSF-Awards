There is a growing body of literature suggesting that cells use mechanical
forces to transmit information and guide the assembly of multi-cellular
structures. For example, during development, wound healing, and the creation of
engineered tissues, cells exert mechanical forces that remodel their local
environment by reorganizing the extracellular matrix (ECM) and result in
cellular motion and organization. The research objective of this award is to
couple experiments and computational simulations to develop a quantitative
understanding of how cells use mechanical forces to signal and organize.
Experimental studies will focus on observing the motion of cells and their
surrounding extracellular matrix in several in vitro models of tissue
morphogesesis. With these data, image-based finite element models and cellular
automaton simulations will be used to determine the relative contribution of
differential adhesion and stress propagation through ECM in the formation of
multi-cellular structures.

The formation of multi-cellular structures is essential in all except the
simplest life forms. If successful, the results of this research will provide an
improved understanding of the role of mechanical forces in this important
process. The specific model systems studied in this work (i.e., islet-like cell
clusters and microvascular networks) are closed related to efforts to engineer a
number of tissues, including islets for type-I diabetics. The broader impact of
our multi-disciplinary approach to integrating experiment with computations in
mechanobiology research will present new opportunities to explore innovative
undergraduate- and graduate-level educational initiatives within the newly-
formed Department of Biomedical Engineering at OSU. In addition, high school
students participating in the ongoing summer programs at the Ohio Supercomputing
Center will be introduced to computational simulations using hands-on activities
based on models developed as part of the proposed research.
