This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
renovate four wet synthetic laboratories (ca. 7300 sq. ft.) at the University of
North Carolina Chapel Hill. These laboratories provide research space to five
faculty members in inorganic chemistry. The renovation entails replacement of
all current lab benches, fume hoods, and student carrels. Each laboratory will
be upgraded to the maximum number of fume hoods allowable by the capacity of the
existing HVAC system. Due to the age of the facility (constructed in 1971),
asbestos and mercury abatement will be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The five
faculty members affected by the upgrade are highly renowned researchers, with
two of them being members of the National Academy of Sciences. They have
significant levels of extramural funding and currently work on NSF-funded
projects including mechanistic studies of proton coupled electron transfer,
metal-catalyzed diene and olefin polymerizations, finding and exploiting new
four-electron donor ligands, chiral porous materials for enantioselective
catalysis and separations, and the interrelationship between electronic
structure, molecular structure and redox potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project will enhance infrastructure for research. The Department boasts a large
number of chemistry majors (635) and a significant percentage of students from
underrepresented minorities. The group has about 45 graduate students and
postdocs, and 10 undergraduate students. The training of all of the students
engaged in these programs will benefit from the upgraded facilities.
