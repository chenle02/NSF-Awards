Jordan 9703820 Bruce Jordan proposes to study applications of p-adic
uniformization to arithmetic. This theme runs throughout some of the great
accomplishments of the last decade, but it is just now being isolated and its
role recognized. As one example, it is the key to Ribet's proof of Serre's
Conjecture Epsilon and a crucial ingredient to Taylor and Wiles's subsequent
proof of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves. For
arithmetic over the rational numbers (which is the setting for the Ribet and
Taylor/Wiles result), the point is that by Cerednik/Drinfeld Shimura curves are
p-adically uniformized and this enables one to simultaneously study both the
Hecke structure and the action of inertia for a prime of bad reduction on the
points of finite order on their jacobians. The various theorems proved here
should all generalize to any setting where one has an analogous p-adic
uniformization, even to cases of higher dimension. Jordan wants to study these
cases in increasing order of complexity: Shimura curves over totally real
fields, quaternionic Hilbert modular varieties over totally real fields, and
finally Shimura varieties uniformized by unitary groups. This project falls into
the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the
oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has
proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
