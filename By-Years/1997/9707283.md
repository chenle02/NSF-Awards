This comparison of solar variability with stellar analogs broadens the
community's understanding of variability throughout the Sun's 11-year activity
cycle. Researchers have observed the potential for long-term brightness
variability on 41 'sun-like' stars. Their results show that changing visual
brightness and magnetic activity are not simply correlated, as presumed in the
reconstruction of long-term solar irradiance fluctuations from sunspot and other
solar data. This extension of stellar observations provides an unbroken set of
precision photometric measurements, and enables comparisons of magnetic and
brightness variations of the Sun with those of similar stars. The research has
direct impact on global change, as it provides estimates of the Sun's historic
and future variations.
