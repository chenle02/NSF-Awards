This dissertation research project will study the construction of an ethnic
identity by an aboriginal group in Nepal. A cultural anthropologist will conduct
participant observation and survey interviews in several villages in rural
Nepal. The hypothesis to be examined is that the settlement of aboriginal lands
by different groups and the general impoverishment of the aboriginal group has
strengthened the common ethnic identity of the aboriginal groups. This research
is important because different ethnic groups interact in all countries of the
world. Increased understanding of the conditions under which a group's ethnicity
is strengthened or weakened will help us understand the basis for ethnicity-
based claims for special treatment in any society.
