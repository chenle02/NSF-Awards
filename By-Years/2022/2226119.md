The project will fund 15 early career scientists to attend the SEG-AGU workshop
on the Geophysics of Convergent Margins being held at the University of
Washingtonâ€™s campus, in Seattle, WA from July 12-14 2022. These scientists will
have the opportunity to network, present, and collaborate with other scientists
who are studying different geophysical techniques and methods to understand the
processes happening at subduction zones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convergent plate
margins are important to further our understanding and imaging of, as these
tectonic environments (1) host the largest and most destructive earthquakes and
related tsunamis, as well as the largest volcanic eruptions on Earth and (2) are
accompanied by large onshore/offshore basins that are suitable for geothermal
and hydrocarbon natural resources. They also (3) represent natural laboratories
to study fundamental cycles of the Earth System (e.g. carbon, water, etc.) and
the fluid exchange between the Earth and the oceans. Convergent plate margins
are one of the more challenging research environments due to their structural
complexity and their dynamic evolution on geologically short time scales. Over
the last decade, the development of geophysical imaging and monitoring
techniques as well as numerical and laboratory modeling have been proven useful
to unravel some of the complexity of subduction zone processes. This funding
will be used to aid early career scientists to travel to a conference focusing
on these important topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
