Published radiometric calibrations of the mid-Tertiary magnetic polarity time
scale (MPTS) vary in age by as much as 20%. PI's will improve this calibration
by determining a well- dated magnetic polarity record from volcanic sequences in
New Mexico, Colorado, and Texas, using a combination of paleomagnetic analyses
and high-precision 40 Ar/39 Ar dating of sanidine. The combination of precisely
dated polarity records from these volcanic fields, together with similar data
from the San Juan volcanic field, will allow development of a single integrated
polarity record spanning much of latest Eocene and Oligocene time. Although
discontinuous, this integrated record will offer very precise constraints on the
age and duration of polarity intervals from several segments of the mid-Tertiary
MPTS. Accurate calibration of the MPTS will tightly constrain mid- Tertiary sea
floor spreading rates and improve correlations between marine and terrestrial
biostratigraphic records.
