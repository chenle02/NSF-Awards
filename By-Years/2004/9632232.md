Masten 9632232 This is an award to support research on a recirculating treatment
system using ozone for improving the biodegradability of disinfection byproducts
and precursors from water containing natural organic matter. The project's
research objectives are to obtain an understanding of how organic materials in
natural waters are modified during the application of ozone and the response of
biological systems to products of this ozonation process. This knowledge will be
utilized in development of mathematical models that can be used to predict
removal of the target substances from water by the use of the recirculating
system proposed for study in this project. The parameters to be monitored in
evaluation of the system to be studied include total organic carbon, ultraviolet
absorbance, alkalinity, assimilable organic carbon, trihalomethanes, haloacetic
acid formation potential, heavy metals, bromide ion and specific organic
compounds. This project addresses a need for determining how to deal with the
presence of naturally occurring organic materials in water that combine with
chlorine when used as a disinfectant to produce undesirable compounds of
carcinogenic significance. Results of this project are expected to lead to
mathematical models that can be utilized in the engineering design of systems to
address this problem. The research being conducted involves identification of
relationships between products of the ozonation process, the biodegradability of
those products and the potential for the formation of trihalomethanes and other
chlorinated compounds during subsequent chlorination to disinfect the treated
water.
