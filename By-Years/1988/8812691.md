The Cornell Ichthyology Collection contains approximately 1.5 million preserved
fishes. The Collection represents the diversity of fishes worldwide, but
concentrates most heavily on North American freshwater fishes, and it contains
the type specimens for 40 North American species. The Collection regularly
provides information on the collection to a wide variety of scientific,
government and public users and sends thousands of specimens out on loan to
scientists at other institutions. However, some requests are currently
impractical or impossible to answer. For example, the staff frequently receive
inquiries for information on all the specimens from a particular state or other
locality. With the current, ledger- based catalogue, such an inquiry takes weeks
of time to answer, and all other collections activities must be postponed. This
project, which will provide equipment and personnel to enter data on the entire
collection into a computerized data base, will allow the Collection to answer
such questions quickly and will increase the efficiency of all aspects of
collection management.
