project between Dr. Jingguang Chen, University of Delaware, and Professor Xie
Youchang, Beijing University, on synthesis and characterization of bimetallic
catalysts and their catalytic properties. The proposed research on the Ni/Pt
bimetallic catalytic system project is innovative. The project provides
opportunities to train U.S. students. The expertise involved in the U.S. and
China is complementary and benefits are mutual. The project is jointly supported
by the National Science Foundation and the National Science Foundation of China.
