Professor Joel M. Bowman at the Department of Chemistry, Emory University, is
supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program at
NSF for the computational study of the reaction dynamics for gas phase
molecules. Four specific molecular processes are being studied under this grant.
An important aspect of much of the work is that it involves the interaction of
light with free molecules; in particular, the processes of photodissociation and
photodetachment are being examined. Another special and quite valuable aspect of
the work is that a major part of it is being carried out in close interaction
with an expert, at the same university, in electronic structure theory. The
result of this interaction is that Professor Bowman is able to study reaction
dynamics with potential energy surfaces which are based on accurate treatments
of the atomic interaction energies. Since the accuracy of theoretical studies of
the the reaction dynamics is often limited by the accuracy of the potential
energy surfaces, Professor Bowman's access to accurate surfaces substantially
reduces the uncertainties in the results obtained from the work supported under
this grant. The long term goal of the work being carried out is to predict and
explain important gas phase chemical processes, especially those which occur in
the atmosphere and in combustion processes. In the present work, one of the
photodissociation reaction processes examined is for a molecule which contains
chlorine and this reaction is believed to be involved in the ozone depletion of
the polar atmospheres. The results obtained from this particular study are
likely to be of immediate importance for the Environmental Sciences.
