The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will benefit female dogs, their owners, shelters, and veterinarians with
the development of a single-injection sterilant, eliminating the burden of
surgical sterilization for female dogs and those that care for them. Scientists
have worked for decades to develop an affordable non-surgical sterilization
solution. However, efforts to date have been unsuccessful, and surgical spaying
remains as the sole option available for sterilizing female animals. At present,
sterilization is an invasive surgical procedure that requires the removal of a
healthy animalâ€™s reproductive organs at great risk and physical cost to the dog,
financial and emotional cost to the owner, time cost to the veterinarian, and
significant financial cost to shelters. Because the high cost and the risk of
developing surgery-related infection or death makes surgical spays unmanageable,
shelters are forced to euthanize millions of dogs each year due to
overpopulation. By making spays non-surgical, inexpensive, and quick, more
female dogs will be sterilized before reaching puberty, relieving the strain of
overpopulation and dramatically reducing surgical morbidity and mortality.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project seeks to replace surgical
sterilization for female dogs with a single injection sterilant designed to
induce permanent sterility and tested in rats. This project will determine
whether reproductive inhibition observed in rodent species will be translatable
to the dog. Specifically, the goal is to identify effective and safe dosage
range and temporal window. The animals will be carefully followed for health and
safety assessments and female reproductive outcomes will be measured. If
successful, this project will indicate that sterilization can be achieved in
female dogs without resorting to invasive physical surgery. A pilot study will
also be performed in male dogs to determine an optimal dose that will inhibit
developmental maturation of the testis and thus inhibit fertility at
puberty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
