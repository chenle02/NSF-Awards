Dixon 9302574 This project offers a different twist to the ongoing saga of mid-
oceanic ridges. The P.I.s will analyze a selcted set of MORB glasses away from
and close to hot spots for their water contents by infrared spectroscopy. They
will determine Cl by electron probe at LDGO. The purpose is to evaluate how
water relates to other geochemical pararneters and what role it plays in melt
generation at MOR.
