The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the
advancement of novel imaging modalities and improved surgical decision making
allowing for earlier surgical intervention. This technology will advance science
and medicine by providing a novel diagnostic tool to create a virtual biopsy.
This eliminates the need to physically cut and remove tissue for assessment and
imaging. This technology is particularly important in assessing tissues that
cannot be removed without damage, such as neurologic tissue. By utilizing this
technology, surgeons will have more information about a particular tissue or
injury, allowing for improved early surgical decision making, potentially
improved patient outcomes and decreased medical costs.

This I-Corps project is intended to continue the development of a surgical laser
microscope to image tissue intra-operatively. Peripheral nerve injuries are
complex pathologies that leave some mystery as to their prognosis at the time of
injury. Often times, this leads to a clinical observation period of up to a year
during which the nerve is non-functional. The ability to visualize, quantify and
assess the prognosis of these injuries a priori would allow for earlier
intervention and thus improved clinical outcomes.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
