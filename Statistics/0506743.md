The Fifth International Workshop on Objective Bayesian Methodology will be held
in Branson, Missouri, June 4-8, 2005. Objective Bayesian methodology is, for the
most part, oriented towards the development of prior distributions that can be
used automatically, i.e. that do not require subjective input other than the
specific probabilistic model chosen to describe the data. There are three quite
distinct statistical domains in which this development has taken place:
parametric estimation, model selection, and prediction, Objective Bayesian
methodology is of increasing importance today since application of Bayesian
analysis is rapidly growing among nonspecialists, most of whom seek automatic or
objective Bayesian procedures. This workshop will emphasize prediction,
practical applications such as spatial-temporal models, multiple comparisons and
goodness-of-fit. Bayesian methods usually are heavily depend on prior
distributions. Although a prior distribution is an important component in the
Bayesian paradigm, it is known that even in the absence of any relevant prior
information, the Bayes method can produce reliable inference to many challenging
problems by employing appropriate objective (noninformative) Bayesian analysis.
The principal objectives are to facilitate the exchange of recent research
developments in objective Bayesian methodology, to provide opportunities for new
researchers, and to establish new collaborations that will channel efforts into
pending problems and open new directions for investigation. An important
consequence of this meeting will be to further crystallize objective prior
methodology as an established area for statistical research.

Statisticians have traditionally embraced one of two main approaches, classical
or "frequentist" methods and Bayesian methods. In recent years, advances in
computing technology and breakthroughs in statistical theory have made Beyesian
methods increasingly attractive, especially for difficult problems with many
variables in fields such as meteorology, epidemiology, natural resources, etc.
With this increased emphasis on Bayesian statistics, it has become increasingly
important to bridge the differences between the two schools of statistical
thinking. Objective Bayesians are dedicated to resolving these differences. The
planned workshop will bring together 80-100 participants including leaders in
the field of objective Bayesian statistics from around the world together with
young researchers and students in a setting especially conducive to cooperation
and exchange of ideas.
