This research will address issues related to risk management in supply chains.
Risks include disruptions (natural disasters, labor disputes, supplier business
failures, and terrorism), delays, system risks, forecasting risks, intellectual
property risks, procurement risks, inventory risks and capacity risks. Risk
mitigation measures often result in increases in planning/forecasting costs, on-
going costs, or risk recovery costs. The research project will develop
optimization-based multi-objective models to support risk mitigation planning in
supply chains. An important focus area will be the interaction between different
risks and mitigation strategies. Mitigating one risk may increase the exposure
to another risk. The project will also examine mitigation strategies that best
address a combination of risks without significantly adding to
costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will enhance the ability
of a firm or government agency to determine a supply chain risk mitigation
strategy in the face of multiple risks. The taxonomy will enable planners to
identify and categorize a broad variety of risks. It will also provide planners
with an initial menu of risk mitigation approaches that are broadly applicable
to the primary risks being faced. The optimization model(s) will facilitate the
exploration of specific strategies and plans to mitigate risks accounting for
the broad range of objectives faced by industrial and governmental supply chain
planners. The proposed work will also enhance our ability to solve complex
multi-objective optimization problems in the face of uncertain inputs and
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;
