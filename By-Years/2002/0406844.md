AST-0406844 Brainerd

This project focuses on measuring the velocity dispersions, masses and density
profiles of the dark matter halos of galaxies via the dynamics of satellite
galaxies, using publicly available redshift surveys. The sample will be selected
paying close attention to the effects of interlopers, and the results of the
analysis will be used to address a number of issues in galaxy formation,
including halo mass versus Hubble type, mass-to-light ratio versus luminosity,
radial dependence of kinematics, and alignment preferences. Interpretation will
be aided by high-resolution computer simulations, addressing the validity of
mass estimators and the impact of interlopers. The research will include
undergraduate activities far beyond their usual education experience and with
longer-term involvement.
