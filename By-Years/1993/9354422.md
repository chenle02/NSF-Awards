9354422 Amador The proposed curricular development project, "The Physics of
Medical Technologies" addresses two serious concerns: the scientific education
of college students not majoring in the natural sciences, and the enrichment of
standard freshman physics laboratories. The interdisciplinary field of medical
physics offers an exciting opportunity to create general audience courses which
teach a great deal of basic physics in the context of learning how sophisticated
medical instrumentation works. Importantly, the physics is limited in scope to
relatively few topics, but these can be explored in depth. For example,
geometrical optics plays a role in the understanding of fiber optic scopes,
laser surgery, and ultrasound, while the concept of energy occupies a central
place in the discussion of both laser surgery and radiation therapy. The main
outcome of this project would be curricular materials for dissemination: a
complete set of lecture notes, written at the appropriate level for a general
audience course, supporting materials such as sample problems and
demonstrations, and five original discovery-oriented laboratories which blend
the essential science with medical applications. The latter will be appropriate
for either a general audience course or for introducing topical applications
into standard freshman physics. All three components, lecture notes, problems,
and labs, have been designed to emphasize conceptual learning in conjunction
with core quantitative techniques, such as estimation, modeling of data, and
engineering design concerns. A detailed evaluation plan involving feedback from
three off-site peers and a graduate assistant will assist in refining these
course materials before they are advertised through mailings and journal
articles. By encouraging instructors interested in teaching such a course and
providing them with material help, the project will have an impact beyond its
immediate student audience.
