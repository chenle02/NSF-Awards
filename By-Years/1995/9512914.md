9512914 Brasseur This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative
research in atmospheric sciences between researchers at Pennsylvania State
University and at the Center for Acoustics, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, France. The
projects involves graduate students and researchers at both institutions and is
led by James G. Brasseur at Penn State and Philippe Blanc-Benon in France. The
investigators propose to study acoustic propagation using realistic models of
atmospheric boundary layer turbulence for short and long-range propagation. The
research is directed at applications where rapid predictions of spatial
distribution and local intensities of sound are needed. The project takes
advantage of the combined expertise of U.S. and French researchers in
turbulence, atmospheric dynamics and acoustics. The topic is important to
studies of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence and radiowave and light
propagation.
