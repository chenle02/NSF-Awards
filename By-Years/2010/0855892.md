This award supports the development of software infrastructure for large scale
simulations of gravitational wave sources (numerical relativity) through a
collaboration among researchers at Louisiana State University, Pennsylvania
State University, and Rochester Institute of Technology. Recent breakthroughs
have provided the numerical relativity community with the basic techniques in to
evolve binary black holes for multiple orbits, including the merger and final
black hole ring-down phases. Information from these computer simulations have
the potential both to enhance the likelihood that ground-based and space-based
gravitational wave detectors will recognize these gravitational wave signals
from these exotic events and to improve the ability to determine the properties
of these systems if signals are detected. The infrastructure to be developed,
called XiRel, will build upon and integrate several well developed and widely
used computational infrastructures and emerging standards, including Cactus and
Carpet. The initial and primary focus of this project is the development of a
highly scalable, efficient and accurate adaptive mesh refinement layer based on
the existing Carpet driver, which will be fully integrated and supported in
Cactus and optimized for numerical relativity. This project will be driven by
the scientific goal to perform accurate simulations of black hole binaries with
larger initial separations than currently possible, with un-equal masses and
unequal spins, and providing reliable physical results critical for
gravitational wave astronomy and astrophysics. This award is supported by the
Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by
the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Computer and
Information Science and Engineering Directorate.
