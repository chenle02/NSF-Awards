Iron is an essential, but elusive element for most cells, and high affinity
transport systems are usually required for its acquisition. The long range goals
of this project are to characterize the regulation of the iron acquisition
systems and other iron regulated genes of the enteric bacterial genus, Shigella.
These studies will include (1) characterizing the mechanisms of regulation of
enterobactin expression in Shigella flexneri, (2) measuring the expression of
iron-regulated genes in an in vivo system, and (3) characterizing the positive
and negative regulatory elements which affect expression of the gene for Congo
red/heme binding (crb). Experimental approaches will utilize genetic and
biochemical techniques. In vivo expression of the genes will be investigated
using fusions to reporter genes, such as lux, whose expression can be readily
monitored, and an in vivo labeling system has been developed to compare proteins
synthesized by bacteria inside host cells to those observed in vitro.
Characterization of mutants with altered gene regulation is also proposed. These
studies will help define mechanisms of gene regulation both in vivo and in
vitro.
