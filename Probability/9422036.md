The proposal requests funds to partially support the 1995 Seminar on Stochastic
Processes to be held at the University of Florida March 9-11, 1995. This will be
the fifteenth in a series of annual conferences, begun in 1981, giving eminent
researchers, young specialists and graduate students the opportunity to work
together to discuss the most recent advances in stochastic analysis, potential
theory and Markov processes. There will be five formal one-hour lectures and
about nine hours of shorter and more informal presentations. At the informal
sessions, seminar participants volunteer to give short presentations of their
current research. For young researchers, this is an invaluable opportunity to
showcase their work, as well as to learn from the senior members of the
audience.
