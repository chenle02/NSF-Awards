Polymer coatings are being used in a growing range of applications, including
passivation, wear, and chemical resistance. The primary technical challenge in
the practical use of nanocomposite coatings is achievement of uniform
dispersions of the nanoparticulates within the polymer matrix. The research
objectives are: (1) develop an understanding of the complex nanoscale
microstructural development in both the matrix and the overall composite as a
function of reinforcement composition, dispersion/distribution, loading,
morphology and surface chemistry as well as spray parameters; (2) understand the
role of particulate surface chemistry in improving the dispersion of the
reinforcement, the moisture and gas permeability, and the corrosion resistance;
(3) optimize dispersion of the reinforcing phase within the composite coatings
through manipulation of matrix and particle properties and deposition
parameters, including matrix composition, particulate surface chemistry and
morphology, and spray parameters; and (4) develop a property database of the
effects of reinforcement content and surface chemistry, spray parameters and
matrix structure on the corrosion/permeability properties. The scratch
resistance and permeability can both be improved significantly through the
addition of nanoparticulate ceramic reinforcements to the polymer matrix from
the outcomes of the research activities. This would then be used to develop
optimized composite coatings suitable for use as commercial corrosion and
moisture barriers.
