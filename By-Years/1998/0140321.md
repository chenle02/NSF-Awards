Hyperspherical methods are applied to the 1)interaction of atoms in clusters and
Bose condensates, and 2) the interaction of electrons and positrons with matter.
In 1) three body effects are treated using a combination of multi-channel
quantum defect theory (MCQDT) and the adiabatic, hyperspherical representation.
The method incorporates Feshbach resonances in a natural way and enables a
realistic analysis of the effect of the resonances on three-body recombination.
In 2) the hyperspherical hidden crossing method, again coupled with MCQDT is
used to examine positron-atom interactions.
