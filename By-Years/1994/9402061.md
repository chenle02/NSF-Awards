9402061 Sivjee The PIs propose to build a CEDAR Class I high throughput imaging
spectroscopic system for ground-based remote-sensing of polar middle and upper
atmosphere airglow and auroral processes at the Polar Cap Observatory site in
Resolute Bay. The new optical facility will have "Class I instruments" capable
of attaining CEDAR goals of using "state-of-the-art technology to achieve
greater sensitivity, better spatial and temporal resolution and new measurement
capabilities." Among the many aeronomic research projects that can be undertaken
(with greater accuracy and spatial as well as temporal resolutions) are: (1)
derivation of N and O densities in the thermosphere, and (2) investigation of
the excitation mechanisms for highly dynamic transient phenomena such as type-B
red aurora. ***
