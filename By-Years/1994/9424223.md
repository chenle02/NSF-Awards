This award provides funds for a 10-week summer research program in which
undergraduate students will form research teams to pursue research problems that
span levels of biological organization from the molecular to
population/ecological. Although each student will have a faculty mentor, the
program will emphasize collaborative effort. Students will also participate in a
variety of formal and informal workshops and discussions about specific research
problems and about the nature of scientific research in general.
