This grant supports the participation of undergraduate students in the AAAI
Student Outreach Workshop, to be held in conjunction with the AAAI (Association
for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) and EAAI (Educational
Applications of Artificial Intelligence) conferences, February 2-7, 2018 in New
Orleans. This outreach program is aimed at undergraduate students with an
interest in AI or Robotics. Through this workshop, students will work with the
Cozmo robot and the Calypso robot intelligence framework to gain hands-on
experience in applying artificial intelligence to a commercial robot.

This activity will expose undergraduate students to practical skills and
research issues involved in developing systems with robust intelligence. The
activity promotes student interest in artificial intelligence and autonomous
robots for future education and development. The workshop also contributes to
the development of effective methods for teaching about artificial intelligence,
which has the potential to impact the computer science and engineering education
community's ability to recruit future researchers and workforce more broadly.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
