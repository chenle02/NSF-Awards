Proposal Number: 0137023 Flierl / MIT

The proposed work will examine the interactions of jets and eddies with
coastlines and shelves using idealized models based on contour dynamics. The
approximate model of Flierl (1999) will be extended to include tilted and curved
coasts and asymmetric jets in order to determine the ways in which ocean
currents meander and form eddies as they leave the coast and go into the deep
ocean. Additional studies of the interaction of rings with shelves will be done
with a coupled barotropic 11/2 layer model that is extended to include the beta
effect. The baroclinic model will be used to study the conditions that influence
eddy detachment from a coast. In cases where steady solutions are found, the
linearized contour dynamics model will be used to examine the stability of these
flows.
