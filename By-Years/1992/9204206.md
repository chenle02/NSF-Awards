The main goal is a quantitative understanding of the effects of disorder and
electron-electron interactions on the transport properties of electrons sprayed
on to solid hydrogen. The evolution of single-electron localization effects into
the disordered-Wigner-Crystal state will be studied. A Second area of study is
the nature of superfluidity on disordered surfaces that are progressively
smoothed by coating with hydrogen. Reducing the dimensionality of a system
usually introduces profound changes in its character and behavior. Studies of
such changes enrich our understanding of quantum mechanics and condensed-matter
physics.
