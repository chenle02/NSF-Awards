This award provides funding for University of Illinois - Urbana - Champaign
(UIUC) to purchase advanced instrumentation and do associated work for the
George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) -
Multi -Axial Full scale Sub-Structuring Testing and Simulation Facility that
will be operated by NEES Consortium, Inc., as a national shared use facility
during FY 2005 - FY 2014. This award provides funding for the 5-DOF load cells
for LBCBs to enable the accurate application of forces on the test structures, a
6-DOF joystick controller for accurate alignment of the loading platform and
associated instrumentation, and material and supplies. The instrumentation was
selected based on comments by two annual site review panels to improve the
accuracy of load being applied to test structures. This augmented
instrumentation will enable researchers to provide accuracy in measuring loads
being applied to test structures, and to move and align the loading platform
more accurately under low pressure. This award is funded by the NSF NEES Major
Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project and is a
component of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).
