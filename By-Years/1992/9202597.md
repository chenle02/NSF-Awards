This project continues work on the effect of middle Miocene tectonism on
mammalian biogeographic patterns in the northern Rocky Mountains. The project
will test hypotheses concerning the concordance between morphologic patterns,
biogeographic patterns and development of the Mid-Tertiary unconformity in
Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The study will focus on interpreting the
geochronologic and biogeographic patterns of the geomyoid rodents (gophers,
kangaroo rats, and such) from Barstovian deposits in 5 intermontane basins.
Geomyoid rodents are the focus because they underwent a pronounced radiation
just after the unconformity developed. Computerized imaging and Geographic
Information System techniques, combined with a cladistic approach, will be used
to analyze the biogeographic meaning of the abundant geomyoid dental remains
from well-dated horizons in each of the basins, as well as appropriate
comparative material from other localities in the Great Plains and Great Basin.
The research is of widespread interest in (1) identifying the interplay between
geologic and biotic processes on a timescale that has received little attention
(2-3 million years); (2) applying new paleontological techniques (imaging and
GIS) that allow us to address problems of interest to both paleontologists
(evolution, speciation) and geologists (chronology of basin formation) and (3)
refining links of the magnetostratigraphic, vertebrate biochronologic, and
radiometric time scales in the middle Miocene, which is critical for
understanding the tectonic evolution of the northern Rockies.
