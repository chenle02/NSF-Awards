This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in the May 23-27,
2011 workshop on Ergodic Theory to be held in Orsay, France. The purpose of this
international conference is to bring together researchers in Ergodic Geometry,
an area which has seen recent important developments where ergodic ideas and
points of view are used in other parts of mathematics. The aim of the workshop
is to make progress on the core theory while at the same time expanding
applications.

The workshop will bring together both an international group consisting of
experienced and junior researchers, including graduate students, and postdocs to
discuss recent work and advances. For graduate students, postdoctoral fellows
and junior faculty this should serve as a springboard for their future in the
professions. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students, other
young researchers and participants without other support as well as members of
groups underrepresented in mathematics
