This planning grant is for Rutgers University to become a research site for the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Pharmaceutical
Processing Research. Rutgers will add significant intellectual content to the
existing center. The projects focus on understanding granular constitutive
behavior for flow and segregation, and on developing a technology platform for
pharmaceutical manufacturing, based on continuous manufacturing, that is both
more controllable and more flexible than current batch approaches used in the
industry.
