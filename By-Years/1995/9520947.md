9520947 Densmore This research involves collection of samples of a rhacophorid
frog fauna from five hypothesized areas of endemism which comprise the Japan
Archipelago and Taiwan, and phylogenetically related or geographically proximate
taxa from the Asian continent. From these specimens, two independent data sets
derived from mtDNA and morphology will be analyzed independently and in concert
to construct phylogenetic hypotheses for two distinct lineages which have
representatives inhabiting these areas of endemism. The resulting phylogenies
will be used to test whether the present distribution patterns of these frogs
are the result of past vicariant events and to present a hypothesis of their
historical biogeography. This hypothesis will then be analyzed along with the
known geology of the archipelago to yield a general biogeographic hypothesis for
the Japan Archipelago, which can be used to evaluate distributional patterns of
other fauna and flora in Japan and Asia.
