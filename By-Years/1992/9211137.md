This award is to support a postdoctoral associate to work in experimental
computer science. The associate, Naveen Sharma, will work with Dr. Paul S. Wang
on finite element analysis in the context of high performance computing. The
research will consist of a multi-faceted approach to finite element analysis
combining symbolic, numeric, and parallel computing techniques. The research
will bring computer science expertise to engineering applications. The research
will bring both ease of use and high performance to a larger group of scientists
and engineers.
