While integer programming problems are known to be hard (NP-hard) in general,
there is a great practical need to solve such problems. In the last decade or
so, operations researchers have looked at integer programming problems from a
computational complexity viewpoint and a polynomial time algorithm was devised
for any fixed number of dimensions. The approach involved solving a well-defined
problem on lattices and then applying the result to integer programs. A lattice
is the set of all integer combinations of a finite set of linearly independent
vectors (the finite set of vectors is called a basis of the lattice). These
results indicate that a better understanding of lattices could yield important
advances in solving combinatorial optimization problems. This research will
concentrate on lattices and has two main aims: to devise more efficient
algorithms for lattice problems, and to apply these algorithms to solve integer
programming and other combinatorial optimization problems.
