The past several years have seen a fundamental change in the way that
individuals use technology to communicate. One aspect of this change has been
the widespread deployment of new encrypted communications systems that are used
by billions of users. With the emergence of new, practical encrypted messaging
protocols and storage technologies, encryption is now available to the public in
a quantity and quality that could only be imagined in previous decades. With the
deployment of secure encryption technology comes new challenges. These span the
traditional domains of cryptography, software design, and usable
security. Technical flaws in these systems have already exposed hundreds of
millions of users to the threat of data compromise. At the same time governments
around the world have called for the introduction of new potential points of
failure, in the form of exceptional access systems that would allow law
enforcement to access communications on demand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project studies problems arising from the often contradictory requirements of
providing user security and providing exceptional access to government agencies.
The work involves research into many aspects of the problem, ranging from
cryptographic protocol design through the careful consideration of legal and
administrative procedures. Research outputs will include development of
requirements for these systems; analysis of concrete proposals put forward by
government agencies; and the design of meaningful auditing systems and
revocation mechanisms to maintain security for such systems in the event of a
catastrophic breach. The research results have been integrated into graduate and
undergraduate courses, and are disseminated through news publications and a
public blog.
