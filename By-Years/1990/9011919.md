This research will study the influence of lower crustal fluids in the Loma
Prieta area using magnetotelluric and self-potential measurements. Three-
dimensional interpretation of these magnetotelluric measurements will detail the
variation ofj electrical conductivity around the fault zone. Self-potential
measurements are related to fluid pressure variations. The combination of
mapping the resistivity changes and fluid pressure variations in the lower
crustal part of the fault zone should provide important information pertinent to
furthering our understanding of earthquake cycles in the Loma Prieta area. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
