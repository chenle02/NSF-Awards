An arbitrary pulse shaping module at X-band (10 GHz) frequencies will be
integrated into an EPR spectrometer that will lead to unprecedented and
fundamentally important advances, including dramatic enhancement of excitation
bandwidths, reduction of the prohibitively long dead times of current pulsed EPR
instruments, and the experimental realization of Fourier Transform EPR with high
spectral resolution. The implementation of arbitrarily shaped microwave pulses
will also enable the next generation of quantitative and time-resolved
Overhauser DNP spectroscopy to probe the dynamics of the otherwise invisible,
loosely bound hydration water around proteins with site specificity. The
proposed development will capitalize on state of the art integrated circuit
components to generate X-band waveforms, whose amplitude and phase can be
specified on the fly with sub-ns resolution. This control, coupled with the
unsurpassed, built-in flexibility of a commercial pulsed EPR spectrometer will
offer an instrument with a wide range of qualities and capabilities novel to
pulsed EPR and DNP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State of the art EPR spectrometers do
not yet offer the ability to shape individual pulses, as has routinely been done
in modern NMR and MRI experiments for 25 years. This work proposes, for the
first time, to implement arbitrarily shaped pulses for EPR experiments at the
most commonly used X-band frequencies. This development has the potential to
dramatically advance the accuracy, time resolution, and spectral resolution of
current pulsed EPR and DNP experiments, allowing them to measure structural
parameters, interactions, and dynamics of complex and large biological systems
that are inaccessible to other methods.
