The emphasis in this research is on the use of forward recoil spectroscopy to
give rapid, accurate measurements of hydrogen levels in thin metal film systems.
Areas of emphasis in the research follow: (1) measurement of enhanced hydrogen
solubility in thin films; (2) effects of heavy ion irradiation on hydrogen
diffusion; (3) interactive effects of ion mixing and the presence of hydrogen;
and (4) hydrogen solubility in metallic glasses. A variety of metallic systems
are selected to permit detailed investigations to be performed with the goal of
improved understanding of the behavior of hydrogen in thin films.
