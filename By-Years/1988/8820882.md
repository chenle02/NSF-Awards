The investigator will design numerical methods for structured eigenvalue
problems that arise in Engineering and Scientific computation. Goals include
improved numerical stability and improved performance on computers with advanced
architectures. Toward this end, the investigator will complete a small set of
algorithms that serve as "ingredients" in recipes for structure preserving
algorithms. Possible "ingredients" include tearing methods like Divide and
Conquer, simultaneous diagonalization, and variant QR and Jacobi algorithms. The
second area of study is methods for assigning eigenvalues by state and output
feedback to regions of the complex plane. Robust assignment to regions improves
reliability of linear control systems by making them less likely to fail due to
perturbations or uncertainty in the data. Research will be in the direction of
selecting structured objective functions and designing specialized optimization
methods. The third area of study is computational measure of the distance from a
controllable pair to the nearest uncontrollable pair. Success here hopefully
will generalize to a means of estimating the distance of a generic matrix pencil
to an algebraic variety of nongeneric pencils and to general condition
estimators.
