This study will examine the interaction of three major forces in the evolution
of state policies governing management of coastal barrier systems: 1) short-term
and long-term changes to the physical environment of coastal barriers; 2)
substantive knowledge and expertise about environmental change processes; and 3)
the implementation of alternative policy innovations in response to
environmental change. Case studies of coastal states that have experienced
environmental changes will be conducted to provide qualitative empirical
validation of a conceptual model of institutional response to chronic
environmental change. The work will also improve understanding of key
relationships that stimulate environmental policy innovation. Increasing concern
about global environmental change has focused attention on the detrimental
effects that future climate change might exert on natural environments and
society. This research will provide valuable theory and data for aiding societal
decision making regarding environmental policies to plan for and protect against
adverse effects of climate change.
