With the goal of increasing the number and diversity of the Nation's
cybersecurity workforce , the CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program
at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) provides education, training, and
financial support for approximately fifteen undergraduate (B.S.) and five
graduate (M.S.) Computer Science students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building upon
the strengths of the CS Department at UIC, this grant employs a multifaceted
approach to training the future cybersecurity workforce by: providing a
concentration of classes in cybersecurity and information assurance; exposing
students to state of the art research through its curriculum and faculty, the
interdisciplinary IGERT program in Electronic Security and Privacy, and the
Center for Research and Instruction in Technologies for Electronic Security;
engaging students in hands-on experiments; and connecting them with the wider
community of students, professionals, and government agencies through
participation in job fairs organized by OPM, competitions, and summer
classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of cybersecurity incidents has
constantly increased both in government and private sectors. Information
assurance capabilities that prevent, detect, and react to threats on national
infrastructure are part of a comprehensive national security strategy. Higher
education has a pivotal role in this strategy that involves training highly
skilled professionals in information assurance. The SFS scholarship program at
UIC addresses this role by broadening the pool of talented professionals
available to the government cybersecurity workforce. Building upon the CS
Department's successes in recruiting and increasing the number of women and
underrepresented minorities in higher education, this program increases their
participation in higher education and the diversity of the cybersecurity
workforce.
