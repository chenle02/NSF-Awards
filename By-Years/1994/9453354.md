ABSTRACT AST-9453354 Woodward, Charles E The observational program will focus
on the temporal study of novae from both ground-based and airborne platforms.
Novae offer tantalizing clues to the end points of stellar evolution and
chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. Spectroscopy of novae yields
information about temperatures, elemental abundances, chemical anomaties related
to nucleosynthesis, the mass of dust and gas, and dynamical properties of the
ejecta. Determination of the metal abundances from these observations will
clarify how novae contribute to the galactic 22Na and 26Al abundance anomalies.
Because many terrestrial meteorites are overabundant in these isotopes, studies
of how novae contribute to galactic enrichment processes will aid understanding
of solar system formation. * * *
