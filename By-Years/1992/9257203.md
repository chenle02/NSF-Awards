This 1992 National Science Foundation Young Investigators (NYI) grant focuses on
the development of computational techniques which can control engineering
analysis accuracy using adaptive multiscale techniques. This approach is a
hybrid of the hierarchical modeling technique based on the a posteriori
estimation of discretization errors. The techniques developed will be general,
however, specific emphasis will be given to the analysis of advanced material
behavior.
