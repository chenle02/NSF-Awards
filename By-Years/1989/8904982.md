This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will study
the effect of tailoring the properties of smectities and potentially other soil
and/or clay minerals to produce specific adsorption properties. This research
will lead to scientific formulations that can be used to effectively remove
specific organic pollutants from aqueous and gas streams. Earlier studies on
this problem found that the adsorptive properties of certain materials could be
markedly altered over those of the parent material as a function of the type of
amine used. This study on the effects of various tailoring agents on various
clays with respect to the adsorption of specific organic molecules will provide
opportunities for New Mexico State University to strengthen its research
capability. The investigators are experienced and well trained in this area.
Faculty and students involved in this project will have their research skills
enhanced by using several new techniques to manage hazardous waste materials.
