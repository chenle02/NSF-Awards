We propose to continue to develop and explore the enhancement of student
learning of science through an emphasis on student research. Key to the success
of this approach are technologies including: student field stations using low-
cost MBL field monitors, probes, and instruments; experimental growth chambers;
and software tools. Building on materials and technology developed so far in the
project, we plan a careful evaluation and continued development of our approach
in a two-year field test starting September, 1992. The data this yields about
the role of the technologies and strategies employed will answer important
questions about the power and feasibility of our approach. The major components
of our instructional strategy are to: 1) focus on global ecology; 2) establish
school research stations with increasing technological capacity; 3) offer
students and teachers a suite of observations and experiments in global ecology
that can be easily implemented; 4) foster the development of student research
skills: and 5) create a community of student researchers knit together through
telecomputing and other shared experiences. Our work in this phase of the Global
Lab project will concentrate on supporting and evaluating the field test,
developing technologies that fill gaps in our ability to offer experimental
global ecology, developing supporting curricula material, and creating teacher
support strategies.
