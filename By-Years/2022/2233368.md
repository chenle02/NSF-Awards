The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be to accelerate the emergence of next-generation semiconductors,
beyond silicon, with increased performance and efficiency across a wide range of
applications, including those essential for the Nationâ€™s future energy and
communications infrastructure. By replacing the most wasteful and costly step in
the semiconductor manufacturing process, the proposed research will use sound
(acoustic) energy to precisely cut semiconductor materials in a way that
minimizes waste and enables materials reuse. This technology will dramatically
decrease manufacturing costs and, as a result, lead to the accelerated
development of faster, smaller, and more efficient devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach to
lower the cost of advanced semiconductor manufacturing by using sound energy to
lift off thin devices from their host substrates. The innovative approach taken
in this project uses a technique to propagate a crack front at a precise depth
below the device layer of a wafer with the application of acoustic pulses. This
acoustic method wastes no material and, most importantly, makes it possible to
reuse the substrate, which is currently wasted using standard approaches such as
mechanical back grinding. As the single largest cost in manufacturing next-
generation devices based on gallium nitride, the substrate material plays a key
role in achieving higher performance and efficiencies compared to silicon
devices. Making more efficient use of this material directly addresses a
pressing need to find solutions that drive down manufacturing costs and
accelerates the adoption of new semiconductor innovations ranging from power
electronics to communications devices and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
