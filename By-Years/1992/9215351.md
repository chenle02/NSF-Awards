The primary goal of this project is to conduct an intercomparison on the
measurement of sulfur gases in the air between various research groups who are
measuring the gases. These gases are of major atmospheric importance, but at
this time we do not know if the different analytical instrumentation and methods
are equivalent in their measurement capability. This is due to the variety of
preconcentration methods and equipment which are used to measure the gases and
to the high reactivity of these sulfur gases with a variety of chemical species
in the air, water, soils, etc. This proposal is an omnibus proposal to provide
for the logistical support to perform the intercomparison and to analyze the
data generated from the intercomparison. The experimental design is such that
both laboratory and field exercises will be performed and that the range of
concentration for intercalibration of each gas will be from about five times the
minimum detectable limit of each gas to two orders of magnitude higher. This
range will cover the range of natural measurements (part per trillion by volume
to part per billion by volume) and provide an experiment which can provide for
good statistical validity in the intercomparison. A successful intercomparison,
with the validation of several research groups to measure sulfur gases, will
result in the ability to perform coordinated research projects to understand the
vital role of sulfur in global climate change.//
