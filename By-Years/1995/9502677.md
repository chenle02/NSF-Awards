ABSTRACT CTS-9502677 A combined research ad education program is proposed in the
areas of multiphase flow, viscoelastic fluids, and polymer science and
engineering. The main objectives are understanding the role of interactions
between different physical phenomena on the flow stability and dynamics of the
system. The relevance of the research is in the area of polymer melt, stability
analysis and control in materials processing, modeling of flow of composite
materials, and bioseparation with application to environmental technologies. A
variety of undergraduate and graduate student courses and activities are planned
in the area of multiphase flow, mathematical theory of flow instability, and
dynamic control at the University of Wisconsin.
