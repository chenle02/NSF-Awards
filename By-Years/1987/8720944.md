This work is an experimental investigation of deformation- induced melt
migration and related elastic attenuation in silicate partial melts. Two-phase
solid-liquid aggregates (having first attained appropriate textural equilibrium)
will be subjected to a four-point flexure state of stress; the thermodynamics of
solid- liquid interfaces suggests that, in this case, the melt phase should flow
from that side of the specimen under a compressive principal stress to the
specimen side under a tensile principal stress. This melt migration is revealed
as a anelastic, fully- recoverable strain for the two-phase specimen (which is
particularly well "imaged" in the flexure mode). The role of this deformation-
induced melt transport in elastic attenuation will be examined using
reciprocating flexure; the attenuation behavior will be determined by the
hysteresis in stress-strain curves.
