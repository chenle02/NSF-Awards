In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Benjamin T. King and his students in the Chemistry
Department of the University of Nevada, Reno will prepare and study new
circulenes and kekulenes. These compounds can answer important questions about
the nature of aromaticity. In addition, they also serve as models for defects
and provide a starting point to understand the chemistry and physics of
graphenes and nanotubes.

Graphenes and nanotubes are emerging classes of compounds of significant
importance, as they are likely to find widespread technological applications
within the next decade. Understanding the role of defects in these compounds is
vital to their applications. The proposed study is also important in the
development of the next generation of a technical workforce. Both graduate and
undergraduate students will be trained through the proposed research. In
addition, broadening participation efforts to recruit high school students out
of a diverse candidate pool from local high schools will steer these students
down a path to scientific careers.
