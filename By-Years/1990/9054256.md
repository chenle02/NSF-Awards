The one-week workshop introduces participants to the basic theoretical concepts
of solid modeling and finite element analysis and gives them hands-on experience
with state-of-the-art modeling systems. Emphasis is placed on the integration of
these concepts into undergraduate design courses in the areas of mechanical,
manufacturing, aerospace, agricultural and industrial engineering. The workshop
staff serves as a resource group during the implementation of workshop concepts
at the home institution. //
