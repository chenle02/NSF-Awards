The PI will investigate hotspots. The intent is to constrain their underlying
physical processes, mainly heat and mass transfer. the work has helped establish
the current consensus that both on- ridge hotspots like Iceland and midplate
hotspots like Hawaii are produced by mantle plumes that arise from the lowermost
mantle. he will continue to document the time dependence of the heat fluxes of
hotspots over the last 100 m.y. or so where there is good record. For example,
Hawaii has strengthened with time while Louisville has waned to a weak hotspot.
He has constructed simple numerical models to related these changes to local
depletion of the basal boundary layer by plumes and the thickening of the layer
by flow driven by lateral density contrasts. He is also studying shallower
processes particularly heat and material transfer from plumes to the moving
lithosphere of midplate swells.
