Linking Geoscience Research and Education in Schools and Museums: A Model for
Scaling up Successful Collaborations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student-scientist
partnerships (SSPs) facilitate experiences of genuine inquiry while also
contributing data to larger scientific questions. The Paleontological Research
Institution (PRI) and TERC propose a collaboration to develop a model for
successful, large-scale geoscience SSPs. SSPs have involved relatively small
numbers of students in localized areas. Evaluations of student data, and
learning outcomes, have posed a challenge to the few large-scale SSPs. To
overcome these challenges, scientist-educators at the PRI have developed the
Devonian Seas Project. Fourth through ninth grade classrooms have participated
in classroom pilot-tests explicitly designed to meet specific challenges to the
large-scale development of SSPs, including issues of data accuracy and
educational pedagogy. The results of these paleontological SSPs have been
encouraging: students are making important connections to their curricula and
student data is sufficiently accurate to document paleontological patterns of
interest. PRI proposes to partner with TERC to develop a model for scaling-up
the Devonian Seas Project. To increase accessibility and dissemination,
educational materials will be made available on the PRI Website, and catalogued
with the Digital Library of Earth Science Education. By developing a model for
scaling-up successful localized SSPs, PRI and TERC will lay the groundwork for
other museums and universities interested in creating effective, large-scale
projects linking research and education.&lt;br/&gt;
