The relationship between chromatin organization, nuclear architecture and gene
expression in all eukaryotes and, specifically, in terrestrial plants is a
complex and unresolved question. Chromosomal domains, consisting of chromatin
loops attached to the chromosomal scaffold, may provide a specialized
environment for gene expression. Supporting this hypothesis, transgenes inserted
at different loci in a plant genome very in expression levels. Scaffold
Attachment Regions (SAR) are DNA elements that bind to the nuclear scaffolds and
could anchor loop domains. We have discovered that the HSC80 gene of tomato is
flanked by SAR regions, suggesting that, in vivo, the association of these SAR
elements with the scaffold. The putative loop domain will be compared to a
DNAase I-hypersensitivity map of the same region. Using transgenic plants, we
will determine whether flanking SARs are necessary for position-independent,
copy-number- dependent expression of a HSC80-Gus chimeric gene and of a
mannopine synthase (Mas)-Gus chimeric gene. To avoid a selection bias, we will
characterize the expression pattern of Mas-Gus transgenes that were not directly
selected. We will obtain unselected insertion of the chimeric Gus gene by co-
transformation with a separate T-DNA carrying the kanamycin resistance gene. %%%
It has been clear for some time that the programmed regulation of gene
expression during development and in different tissues is too complex to be
totally explained by cis and trans acting factors. One idea which has become
more and more acceptable is that chromosome structure somehow plays a part in
such precise control of gene expression and the information which should result
from the successful completion of this work will give greater insight into
possible mechanisms of regulation.
