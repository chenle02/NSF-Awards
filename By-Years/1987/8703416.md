This is a very exciting proposal by Dr. Strong of Florida State University that
takes a thorough, rigorous approach in examining the dynamics of planthoppers on
cordgrass. If successful, it could provide the best example to date of how a
wide variety of factors interact to generate spatial and temporal patterns in
insect populations. Most of the biotic and physical factors which Strong is
proposing to examine in relation to planthopper population dynamics have been
studied previously but they have generally been studied in isolation. While
valuable, studies of isolated factors tell us of potential effects, but do not
tell us what we need to know--what is their relative importance in relation to
other factors in influencing population dynamics and distribution patterns.
Based on an impressive background with the planthopper/cordgrass system, Strong
has now developed eloquent techniques and identified the major factors
regulating planthopper populations. The research outlined in this proposal could
only be productively attempted by someone with Strong's experience and previous
research support.
