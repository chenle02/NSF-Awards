This complements a recently-funded project to deply biweekly sediment traps for
two years on the eastern and western sides of the Gulf of California which will
cover work on bulk fluxes, planktonic foraminifera, radiolaria and stable
isotopes. This study will concentrate on four preservable groups of
phytoplankton microfossils--diatoms, silicoflagellates, dino- flagellates and
calcareous nannofossils. Fluxes of each taxon will be determined, and the
composition of the trap-based material compared with that of underlying surface
sediments recovered by box cores. The study will examine the seasonal succession
of phytoplankton, and the internannual and spatial variation thereof, in order
to determine the degree to which the original seasonal signal is preserved in
the sediments. Changes in phytoplankton will be examined at 1000 year intervals
throughout the cored section, on eastern and western sides, to address questions
concerning changes in seasonal upwelling and evidence for changed precipitation
and river runoff. The study will expand upon a model being developed to describe
the transformation of biocoenosis to taphocoenosis for diatoms, and produce a
first-range model for calcareous nannofossils and silicoflagellates.
