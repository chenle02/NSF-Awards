The molecular mechanism of bioluminescence in a diverse group of marine
organisms is studied by a variety of techniques. The organisms emit light by an
enzyme-substrate reaction in which luciferin (substrate) is oxidized by
molecular oxygen, catalyzed by luciferase. In Aequorea (jellyfish), where the
light emitted is due to a Ca2+ - binding protein, aequorin, structural studies
are carried out by site-directed mutagenesis, 19F and 113CD NMR, and x-ray
crystallography. In Vargula (crustacean), recombinant DNA techniques are
employed to produce large amounts of luciferase or comparative and structural
work. With Porichthys (fish), close structural analogues of Vargula luciferin,
which induces bioluminescence capability in a non-luminous form of Porichthys,
are synthesized to study the mechanism of the induction. In Apogon (fish), whose
luciferin and luciferase are similar, if not identical, to those of Vargula, the
luciferase is purified, the N-terminal amino acid sequence determined, and
compared with that of Vargula for sequence homology. In Watasenia (squid) and
Stenoteuthis (squid), still unidentified components of the bioluminescence
reactions are isolated, purified, and characterized.
