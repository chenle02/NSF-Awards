This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of
participants in the conference series "Southern California Analysis and Partial
Differential Equations," the first installment of which will be held in Fall
2016 on the campus of the University of California-San Diego.

The Southern California Analysis and Partial Differential Equations (SCAPDE) is
a regional conference series that was started in the 1980s and that twice yearly
brings together, at rotating sites, roughly forty mathematicians from Southern
California and surrounding areas whose interests cover a wide spectrum of topics
within analysis. The following are typical subjects of SCAPDE meetings:
dynamical systems, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, nonlinear partial
differential equations, complex analysis, spectral theory. The conference format
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.
