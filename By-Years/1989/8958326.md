The effects of stress state and reinforcement distribution on accumulated
damage is examined for composite materials. An unusual testing device is
employed which superimposes hydrostatic compressive stresses during tensile
loading. The mechanisms of crack initiation and growth in brittle materials are
explored with the testing temperature and material significant variables.
