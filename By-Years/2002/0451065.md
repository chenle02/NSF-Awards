The PIs have requested a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to perform
a Design Study for an Acoustically Tethered ROV (ATROV) for Ocean Science. The
ATROV proposed would be a small, lightweight, low cost ROV operated via an
acoustic link between the operator and the vehicle. It would be battery powered
and designed to perform a specific set of tasks, rather than be a general
research platform as are current ROVs. The PI proposes to design this
acoustically tethered ROV specifically to perform the servicing work that will
be necessary for deepwater ocean observatories.
