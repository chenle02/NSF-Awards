9602201 Green This study will investigate a method for characterizing
uncertainty in coupled mechanistic models. In order to study the possible
impacts of global climate change on a living system, it seems intuitively
obvious that investigators should pursue models which are well grounded in the
science underlying the system. This is because by exploring the possible effects
of climate change, one is necessarily extrapolating beyond the range of the
data. Hence there is little reason to believe predictions from empirical, data-
interpolation models. An unfortunate consequence of relying on models developed
in accord with scientific understanding of the system is that it is often
problematic to place any sort of confidence bounds on the estimates, or provide
measures of the uncertainty of the estimates. Since the estimates are almost
surely biased, this is a serious problem. This project will address this problem
and demonstrate a solution by means of a case study, in which two mechanistic
models will be linked, and estimates of the uncertainty of the outputs will be
provided. Most current work on global change involves the use of coupled
mechanistic models. Raftery et al. (1995) have presented a method of
characterizing uncertainty for mechanistic simulation models. This project will
extend their method to coupled models. This will be accomplished via a case
study involving MAESTRO, a carbon flux model, and Pipestem, a carbon balance
forest growth model. The project team will specifically study the growth of
loblolly pine stands under several scenarios for atmospheric carbon dioxide and
weather. The result will be estimates of loblolly pine stand development under
the assumed scenarios complete with statistically defensible measures of the
uncertainty of the estimates. The latter are unavailable with current methods.
This approach to characterizing uncertainty in coupled mechanistic models should
be readily generalizable to other integrated assessments of potential global
change.
