The mathematics department of Alverno College is establishing a mathematics
classroom/computer laboratory as a site for innovative classroom instruction,
designed to help students consistently experience mathematics learning as an
active endeavor, and to allow an increased focus on independent exploration and
realistic problem solving through individual and group project work. The
mathematics computer laboratory will also provide opportunities for the all-
female student body, especially prospective teachers, to gain experience and
confidence in the use of modern mathematical problem-solving tools. Students in
the precalculus course regularly make use of graphing technology to study
functions. In calculus, the college has been a test site for Duke University's
Project CALC, of which computer projects are an integral part. Computer projects
will also be incorporated into the linear algebra course and subsequently into
differential equations.
