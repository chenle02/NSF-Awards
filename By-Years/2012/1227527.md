This project examines the economic theory of settings in which multiple parties
first establish externally enforced contracts and then engage in productive
interaction. The contracts specify monetary transfers as a function of the
productive outcome. The parties are unable to contract as a large group and must
instead establish contracts in bilateral relationships. The feasible contractual
relationships are given by a network of links. Because a given agent may not be
able to contract directly with another whose productive action he case about,
there are externalities due to lack of direct links. The project entails
developing a general model and determining whether economically efficient
outcomes can be achieved through endogenously formed contractual chains. The PI
explores how features of the contracting institutions (such as the legal
environment) help or hinder the internalization of externalities. This includes
the analysis of cases in which the parties seek to optimally share
risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead new insights into a variety
of real world situations, including the internal organization of firms, the sale
of 'network' goods, private provision of public goods, commons problems, and
risk-sharing arrangements. The results will give new insights for contract law,
in particular the degree to which courts should give parties the flexibility to
create or cancel contracts in response to developments in their other
contractual arrangements. Broader impacts also include the interdisciplinary
impact on environmental studies; the PI collaborates with a broad group of
scholars on questions of resource management, strategic planning, negotiations,
and public policy.
