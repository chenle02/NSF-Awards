In this Faculty Early Career Development Program funded by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Mullin will use transient
infrared absorption spectroscopy to examine dynamical processes of highly
vibrationally excited molecules. Interconnected processes such as unimolecular
decomposition, collisional energy transfer, and bimolecular reactions which
accompany the relaxation of the high energy species will be investigated. The
excited molecules will be prepared in highly excited vibrational states by
ultraviolet laser excitation, and the final quantum state distributions of the
products will be determined using high-resolution infrared lasers with fast
optical detection. Among the molecular systems to be studied are s-tetrazine,
benzene, and azulene. In her efforts to increase the extent to which young women
engage in scientific study, Mullin will initiate a series of community outreach
programs designed to inform and better prepare junior and senior high school
girls for college science classes and future careers in science. At the
university level, a program of classroom, research, and extracurricular
activities will be designed to improve the academic environment for women
undergraduate and graduate science students, and to provide increased access to
senior women mentors. Our understanding of the chemistry and physics of numerous
high-energy environments will be enhanced from the results of Dr. Mullin's
research program. These studies will follow the different possible paths that
energy takes as it leaves a molecule which has been highly excited internally.
The results will lead to a deeper knowledge of the chemistry of energetic
environments in various high-energy systems, such as plasmas, explosions,
flames, combustion, and materials processing. Dr. Mullin's educational program
is designed to provide outreach and mentoring activities which will increase the
participation of women in scientific careers.
