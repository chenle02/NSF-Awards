This research investigates the metabolic interplay between an invertebrate host
and its symbiotic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria by studying (1) the role of sulfur
compounds in maintaining the functional symbiosis, (2) the internal defense
mechanisms used for detoxifying sulfide, and (3) the role of sulfur compounds in
supporting ATP synthesis, carbon fixation, and cellular metabolic rate. The
bivalve host Lucinia floridana harbors high densities of chemoautotrophic
bacteria in its gill tissues, and furthermore, the bacteria are invariably
housed in one specific typed of eucaryotic cell, the bacteriocyte. The use of
isolated bacteriocytes figures prominently in the experimental approach, because
this cell type represents the simplest level of organization at which the
symbiosis is defined. Studies of sulfide detoxification will be conducted at
three levels of biological organization: tissue, isolated cells, and isolated
organelles. This multi-level approach should allow accurate resolution of the
functional contributions to chemical defense of all individual components and
then to integrated these separate mechanisms into a unified model for sulfide
detoxification in this organism.
