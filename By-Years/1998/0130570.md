The proposed effort is to organize and provide support for two symposia, one in
2002 and one in 2004. The symposia would allow a select group of recent doctoral
graduates in physical oceanography and related fields to present their doctoral
research in a setting that allows a more detailed presentation than is available
at traditional scientific meetings. The venue would be selected and the schedule
designed to encourage informal interactions and development of relationships
that will benefit the community for years in the future.
