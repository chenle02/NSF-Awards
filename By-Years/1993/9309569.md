9309569 Lumpkin The commercialization of therapeutic proteins and peptides has
been impeded by molecular stability problems. Oxygen, metals, and reducing
agents in bioprocessing media combine to cause irreversible damage to
biomolecules via metal-ion catalyzed oxidation (MCO). Metal-affinity based
separations are important new techniques in bioprocessing where MCO reactions
are important. The rate constants and parametric sensitivities of MCO reactions
have not been studied under industrially relevant conditions, and reactive
peptide sequences have not been identified. The objective of this work is to
develop a quantitative understanding of MCO damage through the development of a
kinetic model of peptide oxidation. ***
