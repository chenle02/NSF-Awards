9627222 Hughes This study will characterize the nature of chemical substitutions
by precise diffraction data. The project involves three tasks: incorporation of
REE in titanite, high-precision single crystal and Rietveld studies of
LaNi5-ySny hydrides, and REE in naturally-occurring perovskite phases. Of
particular interest in titanite is the accommodation of REE's and the
concomitant charge-balancing substitution for the Ca+2 ( REE+3 exchange.
Intermetallic compounds such as LaNi5 doped with varying amounts of Sn, are
under intense multi-disciplinary investigation for use as hybrid hosts for H
fuels and electrodes in high-performance batteries. High-precision crystal
structure studies investigate the disorder in the phase as SN substitutes for
Ni. Rietveld analysis of the atomic arrangements will be undertaken to overcome
the pervasive twinning in perovskites that mitigates against solution/refinement
by single crystal methods.
