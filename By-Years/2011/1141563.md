The STEP special project examines the challenges facing principal investigators
and evaluators in efforts to assess the impact of individual STEP Type 1
projects and to define, construct, and conduct appropriate comparison group
studies. The project empirically tests the feasibility and usefulness of
collecting, analyzing, and sharing a common set of data to evaluate the impact
of activities at the individual project level and to assess the effectiveness
and impact of a set of proven practices across a well defined set of
institutions for comparison purposes. The project pairs an interrupted time
series design with a case control design to identify relevant distinctions
between the experiences of students who are participating in project activities
and the experiences of students who are not participants. The research
integrates institutional administrative data with survey data from student
participants to examine the effectiveness and impact of first-year experiences
on student success. The project develops and provides a set of strategies and
data resources from which institutions with similar characteristics can draw to
assess the impact of the STEP program on baccalaureate degree attainment.
Working closely with STEP Type 1 projects, this effort has the potential to
develop strategies for the design and execution of evaluation efforts across
multiple projects; provide project level data for project improvement and
documentation of successes; provide information on project challenges and
opportunities; provide strong evidence for project impact; and provide high
quality data resources for other researchers interested in student retention in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
