This award supports cooperative research in geology to be conducted by Dr.
Stephen Marshak of the University of Illinois, Urbana, Dr. Hannes Brueckner of
the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Drs. Fernando Alkmim, Hanna Jordt
Evangelista and Farid Chemale, Jr. from the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto
(UFOP), Brazil. The objective of the project is to work out the detailed
tectonic history of the eastern margin of the Sao Francisco craton. One, and
possibly two, detailed transects of this margin will incorporate new field
studies of structural geology and petrology, new advanced geochronological
analysis, and a synthesis of existing, but largely unavailable, local studies in
the region. The results of the project will define the geometry, style and age
of the Brasiliano tectonism west of the coastal mobile belt; the nature of the
basins in which Late Proterozoic strata were deposited; and the age and style of
pre-Brasiliano orogenies. The award will foster continuation of a productive
U.S.-Brazil collaboration.
