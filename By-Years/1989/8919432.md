The science network user community of the National Air and Space Administration
and the National Science Foundation largely overlap, so it is advantageous for
the two networking organizatons to be closey coordinated in order to minimize
duplication of facilities, reduce duplicate and wasteful efforts, and control
overall costs for the agencies. This project will provide the means whereby NASA
program management can effectively collaborate with and contribute to the
networking program of NSF, especially in view of the leading role that NSF has
taken regarding the National Research and Education network. Specifically, NASA
would participate with NSF in the development and implementation of networking
workshops, seminars and studies. This project also calls for NASA support of
NSFNET reviews and hearings, for NASA participation in international network
collaborations, and for NASA consultation on national network directions and
management issues.***
