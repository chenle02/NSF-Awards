This purpose of this work is to test the standard cosmological model that
describes the origins and evolution of the universe. In this model the universe
is dominated by as-yet unknown components: dark energy and dark matter, and its
large cosmic structures have grown via gravity from initial features imprinted
at the start of the universe. This model faces two current issues: the current
expansion rate of the universe inferred from two different measurements is in
disagreement, and the expected size of cosmic structures is also in some
disagreement from different measurements. This work focuses on testing those
issues by using new data to make an independent measurement of the expansion
rate and the sizes of cosmic structures. The project will have an emphasis on
the support and training of junior women in the field, as well as taking steps
to recruit women into the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will use new
high resolution, high sensitivity measurements of the Cosmic Microwave
Background radiation to make an independent measurement of the expansion rate of
the universe, and a refined estimate of the sizes of cosmic structures. The
project uses the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, a six-meter NSF-supported
telescope in Chile, currently observing the millimeter-wave sky. This work will
involve computing key statistical properties of maps of the microwave background
radiation to infer the expansion rate of the universe, and combining these data
with measurements of the distortions of galaxies from the optical Hyper-Suprime
Cam survey, to infer the size of cosmic structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
