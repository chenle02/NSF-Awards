Abstract Ferguson The proposed research is to study representations of the
polydisc algebra on Hilbert space using cohomological tools together with
techniques from operator theory and operator algebras. Problems in dilation
theory, as well as, joint similarity problems for commuting N-tuples of
operators, can be formulated and studied in the general framework of bounded
cohomology. The cohomological groups can be realized concretely as quotients of
bounded operators and thus these groups, as well as, the techniques used to
compute them, should be of interest to both operator theorists and operator
algebraists. A significant portion of the cohomology theory developed for Banach
modules is not, in general, applicable in the study of Hilbert modules over
operator algebras. Consequently, there are no standard techniques one can use to
compute cohomology groups. The methods employed so far involve homological
algebra together with operator theoretic techniques, two seemingly disparate
areas of mathematics. Consequently, computations of these groups leads to new
insight and new techniques in operator theory. Also important is that certain
problems in operator theory when formulated in the general context of bounded
cohomology become more transparent and simple algebraic computation often leads
to a significant reduction in the problem. For this reason alone, bounded
cohomolgy for Hilbert modules will likely become a powerful tool for those
working in operator theory.
