This one year project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin Madison and
called the Assessment and Coordination of Math and Science Related Industrial
Internship Programs for Secondary School Teachers, is a program to place 20
outstanding science teachers of minority students in internships in local
businesses and industries so that they will have an opportunity to experience
actually doing science and technology. The intern program is supplemented by
lectures on science and there are follow-through projects to aid in the
implementation of the summer experience in the classroom. Altogether the
teachers will spend eight weeks during the summer in lectures and at work.
Because the academic/industrial internship model has been so successful and
holds such great promise for the future, the University proposes to expand the
teacher/internship experience by working to replicate the program on a national
basis. A national teachers/internship program planning conference will be
organized to find out the nature of support for expanding the project into a
nation-wide effort. The NSF share of the project cost is $109,580 which is being
matched by $145,000 from other sources. This is a cost share of more than 132%.
