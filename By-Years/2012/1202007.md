Most of the visible (light-emitting) matter in the universe is composed of
plasma (ionized gas), e.g. stars like our sun. Most of these plasmas are
permeated by magnetic fields; the forces associated with these magnetic fields
tend to confine plasmas. Although gravity is the dominant force in stars,
evidence of magnetic confinement can be found in the arcades and coronal loops
that are visible in ultraviolet and soft x-ray images of the surface of our sun.
Magnetic confinement of plasmas is used in the laboratory, in particular in
fusion energy research: magnetic fields in a tokamak confine hot plasma so that
nuclear fusion can occur and be harnessed as a power source. In the lab or in
space, magnetic confinement is not perfect: plasma (and associated heat) leak
across the magnetic field, primarily due to turbulence that arises spontaneously
in confined plasmas. Understanding this leakage, or transport, of plasma and
heat across a confining magnetic field is important both for basic understanding
of astrophysical plasmas such as stars as well as for enabling the efficient
production of fusion energy. This project will investigate the role of flow in
controlling transport due to turbulence, making use of a laboratory experiment
at UCLA (the Large Plasma Device or LAPD).

The intellectual merit of this project stems from the fundamental importance of
turbulence, transport, and flows in a wide range of plasmas. A detailed study of
the interplay between transport, turbulence and flows will have an impact on a
wide range of subfields of plasma physics, including magnetic confinement
fusion, and space and astrophysical plasma physics.

The broader impacts of this project are realized through both the research and
educational activities. A major focus of the proposal is the training of two
graduate students, both working toward a PhD. The proposed work will leverage
and extend an existing effort in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory to compare experimental measurements to predictions of massively-
parallel computer simulations. This comparative effort will help build a
predictive capability in turbulence and transport in magnetized plasmas. This is
important in advancing our understanding of fundamental plasma processes in a
variety of settings, but is especially critical to progress in magnetic fusion
energy research.
