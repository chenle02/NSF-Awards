The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will operate the research vessels
EDWIN LINK and SEWARD JOHNSON in 1991. In addition, they operate the submersible
JOHNSON SEA-LINK and a ROV (remotely operated vehicle). These systems are
operated as effective research platforms for a variety of NSF-sponsored research
projects. The research vessels will provide 45 days of ship time and 10 days of
submersible time in support of NSF programs. Additional submersible and ship
time will be provided as cost sharing by the institution for the 1991 projects
