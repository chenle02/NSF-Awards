ABSTRACT A joint meeting of the European and American Associations for
Experimental Social Psychology will be held prior to the meeting of the 1992
International Congress of Psychology in Brussels. This meeting will provide an
opportunity to bridge the gap between American and European views of social
psychological phenomena and facilitate a fuller understanding of human social
behavior. The meeting will encourage collaborative research and scholarly
communication between the two communities.
