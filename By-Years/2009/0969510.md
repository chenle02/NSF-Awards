This award funds the LHC Theory Initiative, a competitive national fellowship
program supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in
theoretical particle physics.

After nearly twenty years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world. Data
from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new "Standard Model" of
particle physics, describing the building blocks of matter and their
interactions at an even higher energy scale. This award will fund competitive
graduate student and postdoctoral fellowships aimed at young theorists intent on
interpreting the LHC data. Theoretical analysis provides an essential complement
to the LHC experimental program, and this award will help ensure that the United
States has the young theorists it needs to gain full benefit from the investment
it had made in the LHC experimental facility.

This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. In
particular, it will train leaders of the next generation in this fundamental
field of physics.
