Much of the organic carbon in lakes originates from surrounding terrestrial
ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;Degradation of this terrestrial carbon in lakes implies
that lake food webs are potentially&lt;br/&gt;supported by external sources,
rather than solely by internal primary production. Prior&lt;br/&gt;experiments
in small lakes using inorganic carbon-13 additions revealed
significant&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial support of aquatic food webs. This project
will directly address the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of terrestrial support
of food webs in lakes 4-10 times the size of lakes&lt;br/&gt;studied previously.
Carbon-13 will be added to two large lakes and analyzed with&lt;br/&gt;several
models developed by the investigators. Results will determine the
importance&lt;br/&gt;terrestrial subsidies in these larger lakes that are in the
top quartile for size in the&lt;br/&gt;Northern Highlands of Wisconsin and
Michigan and representative of a large class of&lt;br/&gt;temperate lakes
globally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to understanding
lakes in a landscape context by&lt;br/&gt;assessing whether differences in lake
size influence food webs and carbon cycling.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this
project include promoting public understanding of lake&lt;br/&gt;ecosystems as
well as research training for graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;Results will be incorporated into an ongoing outreach effort
on the future of the Northern&lt;br/&gt;Highland Lake District.
