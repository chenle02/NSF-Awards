The Jackson Laboratory, a non-profit research institute in Bar Harbor, Maine,
will conduct an internship program in functional genomics research for 10
undergraduate students within the framework of its existing Summer Student
Program. The 11-week summer program - titled "REU Site: Functional Genomics
Research Projects for Undergraduates" - will offer students hands-on training in
interdisciplinary approaches linking the biological, physical, and computational
sciences to investigations of genome function. Each student will perform an
independent, hypothesis-driven research project as a member of a team under the
mentorship of a Ph.D.-level, grant-funded principal investigator. Students will
be selected through a competitive nationwide application process that will
represent a diverse group with respect to gender, ethnicity, and economic
background. Under-represented groups are encouraged to apply and will be
actively recruited. Jackson's institutional commitment to the REU program
includes providing students with access to intellectual and research resources
such as courses and conferences, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and
bioinformatics databases; dedicated program direction by the Education Office;
and housing in an oceanfront dormitory overseen by professional staff. Jackson
offers a stimulating environment in which undergraduates with a passion for
hands-on experimental science can contribute to real research progress and make
great strides in intellectual and personal growth. Point-of-contact is Dr. Jon
R. Geiger, at (207) 288-6749 or summerstudents@jax.org. Additional information
