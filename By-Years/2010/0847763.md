The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports
Professor Bradley Holliday of the University of Texas at Austin for the
synthesis, characterization and reactivity of hybrid materials that incorporate
luminescent metal complexes into polymer backbones. A cooperative relationship
is obtained from the conductive polymers, which can readily shuttle charge, and
the luminescent metal complexes, which offer the advantages of sharp emission
properties (lanthanides), synthetic color tuning (iridium and platinum
materials), and higher potential efficiencies. Dr. Holliday is involved in a
research-based outreach program to local high school teachers and their students
that allows both groups to participate in summer research. This outreach program
also allows the participating teachers to have open access to synthetic
equipment which can be borrowed and taken to their respective schools for use.
This outreach activity leverages previous NSF funding in the Undergraduate
Research Collaboratives (URC) Program by establishing a new Freshman Research
Initiative research stream and supporting cyber-enabled instrument usage.
