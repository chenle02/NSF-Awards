This project develops and analyzes dynamic robust optimization models and
solution methods for electric power systems operation under uncertainty. In
particular, this project will develop multi-stage robust optimization models and
algorithms for the unit commitment problem, a critical decision-making tool for
daily scheduling of power systems. In a multi-stage robust optimization model,
both the generation commitment and power dispatch decisions are dynamically
adaptive to sequential observation of uncertainty, as opposed to existing models
where the decisions are either static or noncausal. Such models involve a large
number of mixed integer variables and decision policies in infinite dimensional
space. Finding an exact solution for these models is computationally
intractable. The challenge is to develop theory and algorithms for large-scale
problems along with performance guarantees. Our approach is to develop and apply
finitely adaptive decision policies in properly designed multi-stage uncertainty
models, and develop efficient decomposition methods for their
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an effort toward building a sustainable
national energy system, electric power systems in the US are experiencing
fundamental changes, with large-scale integration of renewable energy resources
and the deployment of demand response technologies. As a result, both the energy
supply and demand sides have significantly increased uncertainty. Reliable
operation of power systems under these uncertainties is critical. The results of
this project, if successful, will significantly advance the state of the art in
power systems operations under uncertainty, and will also significantly advance
the techniques in solving general multi-stage robust optimization problems.
Substantial effort will be committed to educating next generation academics and
researchers who are proficient in advanced analytics and devoted to improve the
national energy sustainability.
