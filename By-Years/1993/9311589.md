Ratner's project will 10 extend Raghunathan's conjectures to p-adic Lie groups,
2) study the dynamical properties of the geodesics and the horocycle flows on
homogeneous spaces of SL(2,Q_p), 3) apply previous results on orbit closures of
unipotent flows to find asymptotic growth rate of integral solutions of
quadratic inequalities, and 4) study Principal Congruence groups and the
Ramanujan-Selberg Conjecture. This project involves research in ergodic theory.
Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems
whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic
detail. Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the modern theory of how
groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic
theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous
spaces.
