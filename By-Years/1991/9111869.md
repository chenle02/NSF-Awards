This award provides support for a US-USSR workshop, to be held at Rutgers
University, on nonlinear science; more specifically, geophysical wave-and-vortex
systems, their nonlinear dynamics, data assimilation, and predictability. This
workshop would bring together a number of the strongest scientists in nonlinear
science in the United States and Russia. United States and Russian scientists
lead the world in research on nonlinear science. The study of nonlinear
phenomena is a significant direction in modern science. Progress in the
understanding of such fundamental nonlinear phenomena such as solitons, coherent
structures and their defects, collapses, dissipative and hamiltonian chaos and
turbulence is crucially important for many fields of physics, mechanics,
chemical kinetics, and some fields of biology, geophysical sciences and the
mathematical sciences.
