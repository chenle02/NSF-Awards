Abstract

Award: DMS-1105871 Principal Investigator: Mark Gross

The principal investigator plans to study the geometry of mirror symmetry for
Calabi-Yau manifolds. This will be done from the perspective of a program
developed jointly with B. Siebert, which "tropicalizes" Calabi-Yau manifolds,
using an algebro-geometric version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture. In
particular, the principal investigator proposes to resolve a number of the
remaining key steps of this program; these steps should be the component pieces
of a complete conceptual proof of mirror symmetry at genus zero. These steps
include a general gluing formula for the theory of logarithmic Gromov-Witten
invariants and a generalization of the tropical vertex of the PI, Pandharipande
and Siebert to all dimensions. In addition, the program with Siebert has led to
the construction of canonical theta functions for lines bundles on (degenerating
families) of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The existence of such theta functions is
expected to have various applications, such as geometric compactifications of
the moduli space of K3 surfaces (being pursued with P. Hacking and S. Keel) and
a tropical approach to homological mirror symmetry (being pursued with Siebert
and M. Abouzaid).

The work described in this proposal lies at the intersection of string theory
and geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point
particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time. To make string
theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional.
Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions
to be a very small "curled up" geometric object. These geometric objects are
called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a
remarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds:
certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold
could be completed by performing completely different, and much easier,
calculations on a different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as
mirror symmetry. Since this time, many geometers have been trying to understand
the mathematics behind this miraculous observation. New insights and
explanations for this phenomenon are developing rapidly, and these insights are
leading to new approaches to old problems in algebraic geometry. The proposed
work aims to both further understanding of mirror symmetry and apply this
understanding to produce new developments in algebraic geometry.
