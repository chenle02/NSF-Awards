This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG) of the Research Opportunities for Women
Initiative (ROW) that is being made by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division. It will provide Dr. Linda A. Jacob of the
University of Scranton with resources and time to develop a research program.
The electrophilic substitution of aryltrimethylsilanes will be studied as a
method for preparing phosphorous or fluorine containing aromatic amino acids.
The initial focus will be on simpler structures such as F-18 labelled peptides
that might find use in radio imaging or where appropriate with magnetic imaging
techniques. The latter aspects will be carried out cooperatively with scientists
at New York University Medical School.
