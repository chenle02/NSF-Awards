This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor
Philip P. Power at the University of California, Davis to carry out fundamental
studies on the reversible reactions of unsaturated molecules with multiple
bonded heavier main group and transition metal species. These studies focus on
how small molecules containing multiple bonds interact in reversible processes
with a group of elements that have not been well studied up to now. Examples of
the small unsaturated (that is, multiple bonded) molecules to be studied include
ethylenes, acetylenes, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. These molecules are
of great importance in industrial catalytic cycles which usually use transition
metal compounds of metals such as titanium, rhodium or platinum as
catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The studies will focus on abundant and
inexpensive elements such as aluminum or silicon whose use may achieve better
catalysis together with energy savings. In addition, the award supports the
training of several undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows
in numerous practical research skills as well as in independent scientific
thinking.
