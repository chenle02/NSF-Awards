The objective of this investigation is to understand the effects of high
pressure on diffusion and crystal growth. The rates of atomic transport in
condensed matter are typically reduced by the application of pressure, due to a
reduction in the concentration of point defects or free volume. The present
research is on a class of materials known as covalent network materials which
exhibits enhanced atomic mobility under pressure. The emphasis of the research
is to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this behavior. Materials
studied include amorphous semiconductors, chalcogenides, and silicate melts and
glasses. Measurement of the pressure-dependence of atomic transport provides
direct information that cannot be determined by measurement of temperature-
dependent transport. Experimental techniques include high pressure melting and
phase transformation, x-ray diffraction, ion beam sputtering, Rutherford
backscattering, secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and electron microscopy.
