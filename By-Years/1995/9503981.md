9503981 Ingraffea The purpose of this project is to contribute to the
development of a simulator for predicting initiation and near-wellbore
propagation from cased, perforated, deviated wellbores. This simulator will
function on both the IBM SP2 and on a distributed-workstation parallel computing
environment, and will use state-of-the-art computational and representational
methods and correctly propagate fluid-coupled fractures of arbitrary geometries.
Hydraulic fracturing, widely used for stimulating oil and gas production is
often unsuccessful for deviated (non-vertical) wellbores. However, the
economical and environmental advantages of drilling inclined wellbores are
overwhelming: thus, it is imperative that the stimulation techniques be
improved. This includes detailed simulations of the hydrofracturing process.
With an efficient simulator, the causes of hydrofracturing treatment failures
can be analyzed, and new approaches can be investigated. The computational
resources for modeling the geometrical and physical complexities presented by
deviated wellbores have not been readily available to the field engineer, so
there has been little motivation to create such a simulator. This situation is
rapidly changing, and now a useful simulator must be able to model the multiple,
non-planar, propagating cracks which interact and possibly intersect, as well as
the highly non-linear coupling between the fluid flow in the fracture and the
elastic response of the fractured rock. Current "three-dimensional" fracturing
simulators are severely restricted in these areas.
