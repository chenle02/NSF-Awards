This NYI award will support the research of a promising and accomplished young
investigator. Her research will include a study of many aspects of particle
model building and phenomenology, including the mechanism of electroweak
symmetry breaking, the origin and consequences of flavor structure, and the
manifestations and potential sources of CP violation. It directly addresses
present and future experimental studies at Fermilab, LEP, SSC, and LHC.
