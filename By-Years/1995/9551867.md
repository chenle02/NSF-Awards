This project improves methods for teaching and learning calculus in a
technology-rich classroom/laboratory setting, characterized by the seamless
integration of technology and mathematics. Students learn calculus in a way that
easily transfers to other courses, especially laboratory sciences. This project
helps more students to successfully complete calculus courses and provides a
better understanding of how to change the entire before-calculus curriculum.
Through this project, students are prepared to address the quantitative problems
they will meet in their personal and professional lives.
