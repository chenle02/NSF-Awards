High performance graphics and visualization tools are becoming a significant
factor in both experimental and computational chemistry. Further, the computing
power associated with these systems provides a cost-effective computing resource
for groups of investigators. This award from the Chemical Instrumentation
Program and the Division of Advanced Scientific Computing will be used by the
Department of Chemistry at Rice University to help acquire a networked computer
system. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition
include the following: 1) Projects in quantum chemistry 2) Molecular beam
reactive scattering 3) Computer simulations of kinetic processes on silicon and
diamond surfaces 4) Dynamics of photodissociation in small polyatomic molecules
5) Computational analysis of highly excited and reactive molecular systems 6)
Metal and semiconductor cluster surface science 7) Quantum chemistry in support
of photophysics and photochemistry research.
