The objective of this proposal is to develop a fast, refreshing holographic 3D
display in reflection geometry using highly sensitive photorefractive (PR)
polymers. Currently available refreshable PR 3D display uses transmission
geometry with refreshing time slower than that required for many display
applications. The PI proposes a transformative approach that uses carrier
multiplying sensitizers to develop fast refreshing reflection holograms.
Efficient charge transfer and excellent miscibility with other PR components
will be achieved by suitably functionalizing the sensitizer. Transient four-wave
mixing measurements will be used to determine the PR properties of the samples.
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The proposed work will provide new
insights into carrier generation, multiplication and separation when inorganic
and graphene quantum dot sensitizers are used in PR polymer. The proposed
approach of carrier multiplication is appropriate for PR polymers since an
external electric field capable of rapidly separating the charges is typically
required for its operation. In addition, holographic 3D display in reflection
geometry developed using this highly optimized sample will provide fast
refreshing time, many perspectives of the image and wide viewing angles.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: A holographic reflection 3D display will be very
attractive for several applications including entertainment, product development
and urban planning. Furthermore, enhancement of carrier generation and
separation using the proposed sensitizers will have a significant impact on
improving the quantum efficiency in many other optoelectronic and photovoltaic
devices as well. In addition, the theoretical and experimental insight gained
from the subject area will be integrated into a polymer photonics course.
