0318769&lt;br/&gt;Schieber&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support to the Indiana University Department of Geological Sciences for the
acquisition of a state-of-the-art environmental SEM (ESEM) that has attachments
for chemical microanalysis (EDS) and high resolution cathodoluminescence (SEM-
CL). The low-vacuum imaging capabilities of the ESEM will foster new avenues of
research on hydrated sedimentary rocks, clay minerals and zeolites without the
need for conductive sample coatings. The new facility will support faculty and
student research on early diagenetic processes in fine grained sediments,
studies of the microfabrics of fault materials, and studies of the materials
properties of zeolite minerals. The ESEM will also be useful for preliminary
microtextural and compositional mapping of hydrothermal ore minerals and
planetary materials prior to further quantitative microchemical analysis using
an existing electron probe. Studies of petroleum reservoir rocks by researchers
from the Indiana Geological Survey will also be facilitated by this new
instrument.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
