In many situations fear is a learned response. This research project seeks to
understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these learned fears. One
line of research examines manipulations of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors to see
if they are involved in encoding of fear memory as opposed to memory
consolidation, retrieval or behavioral performance. This receptor is interesting
because it has been implicated in certain changes in neurons that may provide a
way for the nervous system to store information. The second line of research
explores the role of endogenous opioids (endorphins) in fear learning. Fear
causes release of endorphins and these endorphins in turn limit or regulate
additional learning. This regulation normally results in controlling the
magnitude of fear, so that the amount of fear is appropriate for the particular
circumstance.
