Three principle direction of research will be followed: 1) Reaction mechanisms
and diffusional processes at high pressures, and the role of protons will be
examined for the most part by measuring rate of oxygen isotope exchange under
different conditions; 2) Determination of oxygen isotope fractionation factors
in minerals of interest, in part in conjunction with the above; 3) Order-
disorder phenomena in silicates, and synthesis of intermediate states of Al/Si
order in albite followed by solution calorimetry at high temperatures for
information on the energetics of the order-disorder process. This will involve
the effect of Al-concentration on diffusion and reaction rates, the varying
availability of hydrogen (protons), and examination of rates of exchange in
minerals with variation of 4 and 6 Al coordinations, all to be oxygen exchanged
with CO2 or CaCO3. Specifically studied will be andalusite, sillimanite and
kyanite, the plagioclase series, the melilite series, and the pair beryl-
cordierite. Fractionation factors will also be determined. Calorimetric work
will be carried out on albites (NaAlSi3O8) synthesized at high pressures with
controlled and variable degrees of Al/Si order to obtain data on the energetics
of the order-disorder process.
