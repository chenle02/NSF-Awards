Proposal: 0943139 Title: VOSS: Empirical Analysis of Large-Scale Argumentation
PI: Mark Klein Institution: MIT

This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This research applies argumentation theory to large-scale
(hundreds to thousands of users), asynchronous, and geographically dispersed
virtual organizations. Solving highly complex scientific and engineering
problems often requires effective collective deliberation among participants who
may be geographically and temporally distributed. Using cyberinfrastructure,
virtual organizations connect people working on the same problem and enable them
to share information. However, when a large number of people are involved,
contributions to internet-mediated discussions are typically scattered and
unsystematic, vary widely in quality, and are highly redundant. Current web-
based systems do not provide adequate support for collective deliberations on
truly complex issues and convergence on well supported decisions and actions to
be taken. Argumentation theory has addressed these limitations in small-scale,
face-to-face settings and will be extended here to provide support for large-
scale, distributed settings through a series of 'action research' interventions
in real-world (business, scientific, government, and educational) virtual
organizations.

Techniques that enable virtual organizations to deliberate effectively about
complex controversial topics can have an enormous positive impact in domains
that range from education to government policy-making to business decision-
making to scientific collaborations. The community of experts and stakeholders
for a problem can be tapped more quickly and inexpensively to generate a much
broader range of potentially useful ideas. Evaluations of these ideas can also
be provided from a much broader and more representative range of perspectives
improving the quality and timeliness of collective decisions about high-impact,
multi-disciplinary problems such as climate change, epidemics, and international
security.
