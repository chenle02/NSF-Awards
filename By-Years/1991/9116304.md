The Equatorial Pacific region is characterized by high and persistent levels of
nitrate (N03) and low levels of phytoplankton biomass (as Chlorophyll), yet it
has been hypothesized that up to 50% of the global new production may be
generated in this large area of the ocean. There are few modern observations of
bacterial biomass (BB) and bacterial production (BP) in the equatorial region.
Bacterial uptake and respiration is by far the major sink for dissolved organic
carbon (DOC), which is one of the largest reservoirs of freely exchangeable
carbon on the planet. This project is part of the US JGOFS process study to be
conducted in the Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean in 1992. In particular the
proposal addresses the need for core measurements of bacterial biomass (BB) and
production (BP), as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PN)
and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column during the Time Series
cruises scheduled for Northern Hemisphere spring and fall. On the basis of
bacterial biomass and production levels in other oceanic areas, it is
hypothesized that bacterial biomass dominates the plankton in equatorial waters
and commands a large share of the total carbon flux. This project will
investigate the role of bacterioplankton in the euphotic zone and upper
mesopelagic water column of the equatorial Pacific, with the specific objectives
of examining: (1) the depth-, time- and space-dependent contribution of BB to
the total plankton biomass and total POC pool, and of BP to total community
production; (2) the role of bacterial extracellular enzymes in breaking down
POC, PN and DOC; and 3) the role of bacterial activity in the turnover of DOC.
Together with the results from other EqPac PI's and plankton modelling studies,
results from this project will contribute to a better understanding of the
factors maintaining the paradoxical high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll condition in
equatorial waters.
