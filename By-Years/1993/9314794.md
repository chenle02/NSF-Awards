9314794 Rose This Americas Program award will support attendance of a group of
U.S. and Latin American scientists and graduate students to an international
workshop on the Santa Maria Volcano, Guatemala. The workshop, organized by Dr.
William I. Rose, Michigan Technological University, will be held in November,
1993 and will initiate a series of collaborative research investigations,
including volcanic hazard field workshops and crisis simulations. In 1902 the
Santa Maria Volcano was the site of one of the largest eruptions in historic
times. Through one of its vents, the volcano has been consistently active since
1922, thus it is regarded as an excellent site for direct observations and
measurements during eruptions. This volcano has been designated a Decade Volcano
by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's
Interior (IAVCEI) as part of the International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction. The many potential research topics arising from the activity of this
volcano will serve to attract scientists from all over the world to work at this
site. ***
