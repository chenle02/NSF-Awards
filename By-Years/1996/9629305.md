*** 9629305 Schmidt This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will demonstrate the feasibility of two cone penetrometers chemical detection
systems. These systems have the potential to reduce the cost of remediation site
characterization, which is currently estimated at over $400 billion in the
United States, by 25%. This cost savings will be achieved by using chemical
sensor-equipped cone penetrometers in place of the expensive soil boring and
well monitoring processes currently used to characterize remediation sites. The
Phase I effort demonstrated the feasibility of a membrane inlet assembly for
cone penetrometers. The Phase II effort will demonstrate the feasibility of
combining the membrane inlet assembly with two types of chemical sensors capable
of detecting volatile organic hydrocarbons (VOCs). Prototype detection systems
will be fabricated, calibrated in the laboratory, and then tested using standard
cone penetrometer rigs at actual contaminated sites. The performance of the cone
penetrometer sensors will be correlated with the results of EPA-approved
analytical techniques. Two products are expected to result from this research.
The first is a system which can measure the concentration of both chlorinated
and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons in soil in real time. The second is an adapter
which permits one to mount a miniature gas chromatograph in a cone penetrometer.
