This research program focuses on the design, synthesis, and study of
bifunctional catalysts containing both Bronsted basic and organometallic (Lewis
acidic) sites. Assisted by calculational studies, bifunctional ligands will be
designed and synthesized. Following preparation and characterization of
transition metal complexes of these ligands, these complexes will be explored in
the catalysis of the anti-Markovnikov addition of hydroxylic compounds to
alkynes and alkenes, hydration of nitriles, cyclization of alkynols and
alkynylamides, addition of terminal alkynes to carbonyl compounds, and
hydroamination of alkenes.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
Douglas B. Grotjahn, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San
Diego State University, is developing new catalysts designed to effect important
chemical transformations through two-site interactions. Catalysis enables the
efficient and environmentally sound synthesis of organic compounds. By utilizing
design principles inspired by Nature's catalysts, the enzymes, Professor
Grotjahn's studies promise both new mechanisms for the catalysis of reactions
and the creation of catalysts able to effect completely new reactions.
