The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
(GC/MS) for use in the upper level undergraduate chemistry laboratories. The
acquisition of the GC/MS is enabling undergraduates to: (1) receive hands-on
experience with this powerful and widely used technique; and,(2) investigate a
range of sampling procedures, instrumental variables, quantitation methods, and
data analysis. The instrument is also being used by students engaged in
undergraduate research.
