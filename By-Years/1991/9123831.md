This SQUID-based sample magnetometer will perform fast, precise measurements of
the magnetic properties of materials over a broad range of temperatures and
applied magnetic fields. It has a complete and sophisticated computer operating
system for control and analysis and allows for total automation. The proposed
instrument exceeds current equipment ability in sensitivity, temperature
control, and computer control. The system will be used by four faculty members
of the Physics and Chemistry departments for fundamental materials research, and
will aid in training of undergraduates and graduate students (20), and postdocs
(3). The SQUID magnetometer is a central measurement and characterization
apparatus for several projects: measurement of magnetic properties of ultrafine
parcticles prepared via novel synthetic techniques having unique compositions
and structures; studies of storage and relaxation processes of photoexcited
charge carriers in II-VI mixed crystals and related critical phenomena; studies
of magnetic anisotropy and interface exchange in multilayers of rare-earth
metals and transition metals and their oxides and studies of critical phenomena
in these systems; and measurements of organic ferromagnets.//
