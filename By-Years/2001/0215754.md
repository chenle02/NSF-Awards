&lt;br/&gt;This research generates new insights into firms' price-setting
behavior and develops guidelines that will be helpful in a wide range of applied
econometric work. Two areas of research are proposed. The first project studies
the question, why don't firms instantly adjust their prices to new economic
fundamentals? This question gets to the heart of many of the central issues in
economics. The novel suggestion here is to study a long time series with a
sufficient number of observed price changes that we can make a useful
statistical statement about the conditions under which an individual firm is
predicted to change its price. A base-case menu cost model is shown to have the
implication that the past history of prices and fundamentals should influence
the probability of observing a price change only through the gap between the
current price and fundamental value. A framework is proposed for testing this
implication and quantifying and interpreting alternative dynamics that are
observed in firms' actual prices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second set of
projects studies the role of normalization in econometrics. This issue, long
thought to be irrelevant for substantive questions, has recently been shown to
make a significant difference for the estimated impulse-response functions and
confidence intervals as typically calculated in a number of models. This
research proposal suggests a unifying principle that could be used to resolve
both the problems that have already been documented as well as help in a number
of econometric applications where this issue has yet to be recognized.
