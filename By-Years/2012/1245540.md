The PI is developing curricular materials based on educational robotics, gaming,
and computer vision for the first-year calculus course. An example project is
based on a throwing robot. By spinning an arm at a controlled speed and
releasing a ball bearing at a precise angle, the robot can accurately toss the
bearing several feet into a coffee cup. Students are using calculus to compute
rotation speed and release angle. The intellectual merit of the project comes
from 1) providing new technology for calculus education, 2) motivating students
with robotics activities which give them a better understanding of the uses of
calculus, and 3) contributing to the emerging body of scholarship on educational
robotics in the university mathematics classroom. The broader impacts of the
project include 1) providing instruction to several hundred students with the
new materials, 2) training future teachers from the UGA College of Education in
technology-based mathematics education, and 3) training faculty from seven
campuses with the new materials. The project is providing a new robot platform
for students to use in investigating the problem of throwing a ball onto a
target, software to track thrown objects for teaching projectile motion, and an
interface to a Bluetooth-controlled toy car with accelerometer to learn about
acceleration, to calculus classes on seven campuses. The new materials are being
evaluated by an external team, using the Student Mathematics Motivation
assessment, to see if they increase student engagement with mathematics.
