The objective of the proposed research is to constrain the relative roles of
eustacy and tectonics for the origins of Pennsylvanian cyclothems by testing how
the cyclothem pattern and timing in a basin directly influenced by uplift
compares with the pattern and timing of eustatic cyclothems. The Desmoinesian
interval in the Ardmore Basin in southern Oklahoma contains progradational
sequences separated by transgressive deposits. Based on the abrupt introduction
of detrital chert, a change in paleocurrent directions, and the facies patterns,
we suggest that this interval was directly influenced by tectonic activity in
the Ouachita fold and thrust belt. Development of a relative sea level curve for
this interval based on a genetic stratigraphic sequence approach and
biostratigraphic calibration of the curve will allow a comparison with a
eustatic curve from the Midcontinent based on fusulinids, and will refine and
test this correlation based on studies of conodonts and other fossil groups
where present. We have a good stratigraphic framework for most of the interval
based on outcrop studies. Additional sedimentologic and stratigraphic studies of
both outcrops and subsurface sections will be integrated to develop the genetic
stratigraphic sequences.
