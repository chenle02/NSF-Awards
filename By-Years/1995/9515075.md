SBR - 9515075 Box-Steffensmeier This project investigates strategic position
taking in legislative assemblies by studying the timing of choices that
representatives make in the U.S. Senate and House. This study is important for
three reasons: it adds information on the context and sequence of decision
making; it more closely approximates members' strategic considerations; and the
process becomes the focus of analysis rather than the final result. Research
into the timing of legislator vote choices should provide insight into
theoretical questions on the strategic behavior of legislators, institutional
constraints on members, and strategies of interest group influence. The project
examines five case studies including the congressional vote on NAFTA, the North
American Free Trade Agreement called "the most important vote on Capitol Hill
since the Berlin Wall came down". The project also has an important
methodological component. It will develop and apply a split population hazards
model. This model will allow researchers to estimate separately the effects of
the determinants of vote choice from the determinants of the timing of vote
choice. * * *
