Abstract&lt;br/&gt;0409923&lt;br/&gt;Andrei Shkel&lt;br/&gt;Univ.
California/Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a novel micro-
machined z-axis gyroscope with multi-directional drive-mode. The objectives are
to study the proposed sensing mechanism, develop a functional prototype gyro
system, and demonstrate its effectiveness in measuring complex, dynamic
rotations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tasks include: to relax the difficult
requirements of mode-matching in the drive and sensing directions as normally
encountered in the design of MEMS gyroscopes, and development of control and
detection algorithms that would increase the resolution of the device. The
prototype sensor system will be tested and evaluated in both the lab and the
field. The proposed sensor on-a-chip is expected to work in unison with a long
term detection system, such as GPS to enhance the orientation
capability.&lt;br/&gt;
