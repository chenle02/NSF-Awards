Professor Douglas plans to continue his research in two areas: multivariable
spectral theory and the study of invariants for differential operators on
manifolds with boundary and on foliated manifolds. His research in multivariable
operator theory will involve the study of Hilbert modules from the viewpoint of
analytic and algebraic geometry. The study of invariants for differential
operators will involve the Chern character for operators on a manifold with
boundary. This research involves the theory of Hilbert space operators. These
are essentially infinite matrices of complex numbers. Such objects have
applications in every area of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.
This type of research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of
Hilbert space operators.
