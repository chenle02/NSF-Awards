This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it
addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. LIGO
(the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) has made history by
detecting several binary black hole mergers and a binary neutron star merger.
The latter was especially exciting because it was also detected by optical and
other electromagnetic telescopes and because it provided new insights into the
behavior of matter at its greatest extremes since the Big Bang. Detection of
continuous gravitational waves from a single neutron star, a faint signal
lasting many years, could tell us even more about such matter - how solid it is,
how well it conducts heat and electricity, maybe even the existence of exotic
states predicted by particle physics. This award supports searches of Advanced
LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in
our galaxy, using existing telescope observations to point toward likely
targets. It also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students
who will constitute the next generation of
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific science goals are (1) directed
searches for young non-pulsing neutron stars such as Cas A, (2) narrow band
searches for r-mode oscillations in pulsars such as the Crab, and (3)
theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for continuous gravitational
waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes. Searches will be performed with
the Texas Tech group's longstanding code pipeline based on matched filtering,
which will be upgraded as the award progresses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
