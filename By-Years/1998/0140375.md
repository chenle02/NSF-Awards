This award is for continuing support of a program of fundamental investigations
of physical phenomena important to understanding x-ray interactions with atoms
and molecules. The primary scientific focus is probing the limits, especially at
low photon energies, of the dipole approximation, the simplest reasonable
treatment of photon interactions. Although well-known breakdowns of the dipole
approximation exist (e.g., the dipole approximation is known to be completely
invalid at photon energies greater than 20 keV), recent work of this program has
demonstrated quantitatively significant breakdowns at surprisingly low energies
and in unexpected ways; further studies may well lead to changes in some of the
foundations of x-ray spectroscopy. The work proposed not only will further
understanding of fundamental x-ray interactions, but determining the limits of
the dipole approximation is important to myriad applications of x-ray
absorption, x-ray photoemission, and x-ray fluorescence to other fields because
these applications routinely assume the dipole approximation. In addition to the
focus on nondipole effects in x-ray photoemission and x-ray fluorescence,
related work is proposed on multi-atom resonance effects, transient species, and
probing the limits of the independent-particle approximation.
