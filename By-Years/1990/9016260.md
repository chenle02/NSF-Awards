A biosystematic study of the genus Caryota (Palmae) using morphological,
anatomical, and DNA level analyses is proposed. The genus is a monophyletic
group of tropical forest trees with economic, evolutionary, and ecological
importance. Due to the variability of many morphological characters used in
previous taxonomies, species delimitions within Caryota and phylogenetic
relationships among the caryotoid genera are not well resolved. Datasets,
derived independently from several lines of inquire including descriptive
morphology and anatomy, geometric morphometry, chloroplast and nuclear genome
restriction endonuclease site mapping, and palynology will be subjected to a
variety of phylogenetic analyses in an effort to establish a reliable taxonomy
and monograph for the genus, examine phylogenetic relationships within and
variable morphological characters within palms, examine patterns of molecular
evolution in the caryotoid palms, and explore patterns of biogeography and
speciation as expressed within the genus.
