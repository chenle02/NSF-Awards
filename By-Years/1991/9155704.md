This project seeks support to explore the results of trying alternative
assessment items in the sciences, developed at the Science Teaching Center in
Israel, with secondary school level students in the United States. It will
determine if more international cooperation is possible and wise in developing
the movement to complement multiple choice test items with other forms of
student assessment in the sciences.
