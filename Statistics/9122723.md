This research project produces new methods for high dimensional multivariate
calibration curves. It will address methods that are robust with respect to
interaction effects. In addition, it will advance calibration methods with
errors in the calibration standards. Methods from chemistry and environmental
chemistry will be the focus. Important policy and legal decisions often depend
upon accurate measurements. These in turn depend upon good calibration of the
instruments. For example, the knowledge of the extent or rate of the ozone
depletion depends upon ground- based Dobson measurements which are suspect due
to poor calibration. The problem of improving calibration methods is one of
several to be considered in this research.
