The main theme of this project is the study of knots, three
dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds and smooth 4-manifolds by using Heegaard Floer
homology, &lt;br/&gt;gauge theory and symplectic geometry. Potential
applications would&lt;br/&gt;include the construction of new invariants for
knots and links, &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of those knots that admit lens
space surgeries and&lt;br/&gt;and the construction of new exotic smooth
structures on 4-manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;The PI also proposes to study the
structure of the Floer&lt;br/&gt;homology invariants and their relationship with
smooth 4-manifold&lt;br/&gt;invariants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal studies the relationship between Seiberg-Witten and
Heegaard&lt;br/&gt;Floer homologies and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;While the
latter theory uses topological tools and &lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry, the
former uses the Seiberg-Witten equations that&lt;br/&gt;are related to gauge
theory and mathematical physics. Progress in this &lt;br/&gt;direction should
lead to a better understanding of connections between&lt;br/&gt;low dimensional
topology and gauge theory.
