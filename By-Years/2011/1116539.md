The project will conduct a series of user studies to investigate the
effectiveness of error reporting with novice programming students. The studies
will focus on how students understand error messages, the effectiveness of
source-code highlighting, and the impact of language syntax on how students
process errors. The PIs will instrument a programming environment to collect
fine-grained data on how students respond to errors. Such scientific user
studies, particularly at a fine-grained level, are rare in this context; the
methodologies and tools developed for this project will be applicable to future
studies. Study results will be used to improve programming environments for
novice programmers with regards to interfaces for reporting errors and
linguistic choices regarding syntax and type systems. Findings will identify
principles for others who design new programming tools for novices. Results will
be disseminated through the DrRacket environment, which is in wide use in
introductory computing courses in universities, high schools, and after-school
programs for middle school students.
