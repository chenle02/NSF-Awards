9316724 Gilmore The demonstration that DNA was the principle that transformed
Streptococcus pneumoniae from rough to smooth colony type is broadly viewed as
the event that launched the era of molecular genetics, the cornerstone of modern
biotechnology. Streptococcal genetics have continued to be at the forefront in
developing biotechnologies for application in manufacturing, such as dairy,
meat, and silage fermentation industries; the production of novel streptokinases
in the pharmaceutical industry; and for determining the structure and function
of numerous virulence factors in human and veterinary disease. Investigators
from these diverse fields who have made major contributions to the rich history
of streptococcal genetics, as well as young aspiring investigators from across
the globe will be brought together in Sante Fe, NM, for the Fourth International
ASM Symposium on Streptococcal Genetics. Funds obtained from NSF will be used to
support travel, registration, and meeting expenses for students, post-doctoral
fellows, and speakers addressing central issues on the basic genetics of
streptococci, lactococci and enterococci. ***
