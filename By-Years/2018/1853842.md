This award is part of a larger initiative in the realm of 2 dimensional
materials to envision and implement how data sciences can contribute to the
development of this discipline to elucidate structure/processing/property
correlations. At present, many materials problems of technological relevance
suffer from lack of data frameworks. Indeed, lack of adequate frameworks to
process, curate, and share complex raw data hinders progress in this field,
ultimately not realizing the promise of 2 dimensional materials commercial
technologies. In short, materials scientists are inundated with multi-
dimensional data from many sources, both experimental and computational, and
vast amounts of data are under-utilized, repeatedly acquired, or thrown out
completely. purpose of this workshop is to provide students and postdocs with
the adequate training to effectively build and use the needed framework towards
sound data schemes and repositories in the realm of 2 dimensional materials.

This meeting is the first training event for students and postdocs of the
recently constituted NSF-2D Data Framework (2DDF), which will be complemented by
further training, as well as PI meetings that will result in a data platform,
developed by PIs in a bottom up fashion.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
