9553580 Apostol The award winning, computer animated, broadcast quality
videotapes on a number of mathematics topics developed at California Institute
of Technology under two previous NSF grants are the basis of this project that
produces interactive multimedia lessons distributed on CD-ROM. The videotapes
use live action footage to relate mathematics to the real world and the
interactive, multimedia version moves these materials more firmly into the hands
of students.
