This award provides particpant support for the Mathematical Olympiad Summer
Program, which brings together 60 highly talented students for an intensive
three-week program of training and instruction. This award also supports two new
initiatives in the summer program: a research component in the instruction, and
a program for women students that will allow eight young women to represent the
United States in a prestigious international mathematics competition.

The United States has sent a team to the International Mathematics Olympiad each
year since 1974. A founding objective for this global competition is to
establish a foundation for future scientific collaboration between promosing
students who will form the new generation of researchers in mathematics. The
International Mathematics Olympiad is widely regarded as a pinnacle achievement
for young mathematicians.
