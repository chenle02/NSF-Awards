The proposed research will investigate the ability of Neurospora crassa to
express and secrete biologically active mammalian proteins. Although bacteria
and yeast have been genetically engineered for this purpose, recombinant
products from these organisms often require additional purification and
processing. Filamentous fungi, including Neurospora can efficiently express,
modify and secrete heterologous proteins in significant quantities. In the
experiments outlined here, cDNAs encoding rat relaxin and bovine chymosin will
be placed under the regulation of N. Crassa beta-tubulin gene promoter and
terminator, and the ability to express these genes and secrete the proteins will
be determined. If successful, these studies will enable the development of an
alternate expression system in Neurospora crassa at a lower cost.
