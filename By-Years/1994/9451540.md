This project is increasing interest in and understanding of the practice of
chemistry among both majors and non-majors through the incorporation of several
new experiments into the curriculum which employ FT-IR spectroscopy. The early
introduction to the actual practice of chemistry through broader use of modern
instrumentation is expected to attract additional students to major in chemistry
and generate more scientifically literate non-science college graduates.
Additionally, new experiments are being developed that include the application
of FTIR methods for environmental pollution monitoring, polymer analysis and
structure determinations of organometallic and coordination compounds.
