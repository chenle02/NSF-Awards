This project is to study the dynamics which arise in mathematical models of
various physical systems. Two such systems which will receive particular
attention are the Hodgkin- Huxley equations of nerve conduction and the swing
equations of networks of electrical generators. For large systems investigations
will focus on decoupling into several simpler systems.
