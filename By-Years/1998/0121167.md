EIA-0121167&lt;br/&gt;David R. Foster&lt;br/&gt;Harvard
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: Digital Government: Harvard Forest Carbon
Exchange Modeling Work in Connection with Digital Aerial Image Analysis by
UMass, Amherst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support preliminary
explorations for applying digital video aerial image analysis to long-term
issues of global warming, in particular carbon cycle modeling, in the government
arena. Many government agencies are already using GIS heavily, but in a less
dynamic way, relying on single images in time, without fine-grain time
references. This project will explore government uses of real-time imaging, at
resolutions beyond what can be achieved with commercial satellite images,
allowing the digital film to be geo-referenced, integrated with data streams
from other sensors, and viewed in 3D through polarized glasses.&lt;br/&gt;
