How do the concepts and applications of identity change as citizens move into
the digital networked realm? In this project, identity is defined as a
collection of transactions, associations, and achievements that are connected to
a single person in the physical world, and correlated with a digital identifier
in the networked world. This question must be framed by current implementations
of digital government for the answer to be relevant to democracy and governance
as practiced in the Internet age. Answering this question requires forging a
common vision of identity from the organizational and technical knowledge of
public sector decision-makers, academic experts, and private sector
practitioners. Progress toward a trustworthy definition and implementation of
digital identity is a key hurdle which must be gotten over in order for
government to move to the next phase of service delivery.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will include participants from multiple disciplines and
sectors in order to answer the identity question posed above. The goal of this
civic scenario process is a coherent, technically sound, compelling view of the
use of identity in digital government and an associated research agenda. Such a
view necessarily encompasses the intrinsically related topics of risk, privacy,
and authentication in digital government. This vision will offer decision-makers
a framing for technical choices in the development of e-government. &lt;br/&gt;
