Some future IODP and borehole observatory science will likely involve the
addition of various geochemical, biological, and geophysical sensors to CORKs.
This program will investigate design requirements for the addition of very low
frequency geophones or MEMS seismometers to CORKs and will research data
acquisition strategies and technologies for both autonomously powered and cable-
powered CORK seismic instrumentation. The seisCORKs could ultimately prove
helpful for conducting offset VSPs long after CORK installation and for
acquiring "time-lapse" VSPs that may be able to document hydrologically-driven
changes related to slow crustal deformation or variations in in situ pressure
conditions as a result of drilling. SeisCORKs could also eventually be used for
monitoring microearthquakes, conducting crosshole tomographic experiments, and
completing coincident hydrologic and seismic measurements. Ongoing studies of
the hydrogeology of the Juan de Fuca crust are the most immediate potential
application of seisCORK technology. The project has broader implications for
IODP and ORION/OOI science and represents a potential expansion of the
capabilities of well-tested borehole instrumentation to provide alternate types
of data. The program will produce a report on the feasibility and design
requirements for seisCORKs.
