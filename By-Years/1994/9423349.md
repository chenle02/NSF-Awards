9423349 Whitledge Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the major reservoir of
organic carbon in the Arctic Ocean, and as such this reservoir may also serve as
an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Characterization of the
processes controlling the concentrations and fates of DOC is therefore critical
for gaining a quantitative understanding of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle.
During a U.S. Navy submarine cruise in March-May 1995 along the shelf breaks of
the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas, approximately 1,000
samples will be collected and analyzed for concentrations of nutrients, DOC, and
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Approximately 100 water samples will be
analyzed for dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, and chlorophyll/phaeopigments during
the cruise track. These data will be used to determine the sources of DOC to the
various regions, the rates of microbial remineralization processes, and the
coupling between nitrogen and carbon cycling.
