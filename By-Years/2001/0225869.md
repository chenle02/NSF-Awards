INT-0225869&lt;br/&gt;Charles Sukenik &lt;br/&gt;Old Dominion
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is about a planning visit
for developing collaborative research work in optical dipole traps for ultracold
atoms with researchers at Korea University in Korea. The proposed work is to
address the issue of creating a perturbation limited environment for conducting
precision measurements by studying two regimes of optical dipole force
trapping.&lt;br/&gt;
