9408869 Kreitman This research will examine DNA sequence features associated
with naturally occurring chromosomal rearrangements in natural populations of
the fruitfly, Drosophila. Rearrangement of the genetic material, such as that
caused by chromosomal translocations and inversions, are common; however, they
are also causally associated with a number of genetic diseases in humans and
other species. In addition, the aberrant segregation of many kinds of
rearrangements with non-rearranged chromosomes in also strongly deleterious.
Despite this expectation that gross rearrangement of chromosomal material will
have strongly negative fitness consequences, and therefore should be rare in
nature, their presence as polymorphisms in natural populations of many species
and as fixed differences between species, suggests that many inversions must, in
some cases, be selectively neutral or favorable. It is the goal of this research
to examine the history of several inversions and to test hypotheses about the
maintenance of genetic variation as well as to investigate the influence of
chromosomal rearrangement on the expression and function of genes near the
breakpoints. This work will also produce insights into the molecular
mechanism(s) leading to chromosomal breakage. The findings will have direct
applicability to the understanding of human variation and disease.
