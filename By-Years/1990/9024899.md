This award will support continued collaborative research in nuclear physics
between Dr. David Fossan, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Drs.
R. Wadsworth and P.J. Nolan, University of York, England. The objective of the
project is to carry out nuclear structure studies in the A=130 region. The
investigators will carry out gamma-ray experiments to study high spin rates in
the mass 130 region, using the UK Science and Engineering Research Council's
research laboratory at Daresbury. The unique facilities at Daresbury, the 22MV
tandem accelerator coupled with the large TESSA gamma-ray array and the recoil
mass spectrometer, have specific advantages for the proposed research, such as
in statistical sensitivity and identification. Complimentary spectroscopy
experiments will be carried out at the Stony Brook tandem- injected
superconducting LINAC facility. Collaboration will take place out at both
laboratories using several experimental approaches to optimize the sensitivity
to important nuclear structure information. Analysis and interpretation of these
different experiments will be jointly examined.
