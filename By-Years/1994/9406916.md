9406916 Watson This project involves research related to deep crustal and upper
mantle chemical processes, focusing on but not limited to diffusion. Five key
sub themes of the research are: (1) connectivity of fluids and melts in the
lower crust and upper mantle, (2) diffusion in magmas, with specific focus on
sulfur, (3) lattice diffusion in minerals, using Rutherford Backscattering
Spectroscopy (RBS) as a tool for depth-profiling very short, laboratory induced
diffusion gradients, (4) permeability of the partially molten mantle, using a
technique in which molten Na-carbonate is substituted for basaltic melt, and (5)
chemical transport by slab-derived fluids in subduction zones, focused on
development of techniques for controlled devolatization, release, and capture of
aqueous fluids from hydrous mafic assemblages.
