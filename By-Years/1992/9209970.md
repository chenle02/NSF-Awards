The activities to be undertaken under this Research Planning Grant are focused
on the preliminary formulation of an improved method for investigating structure
acoustics problems having significant damping. During the course of the effort,
several appropriate models of a duct and other type endosures having sound
absorptive materials will be formulated and investigated. This preliminary work
coupled with consultation with leaders in the field, is expected to lead to the
development of a highly competitive, sharply focused, research proposal within
the field of structural dynamics.***//
