This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a
point of use sterilization method for medical equipment and devices using light-
activated generation of chlorine dioxide gas from a chemical coating enclosed in
a plastic bag.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of healthcare.
This photosterilization plastic bag product will provide a portable, low cost
sterilization device to medical care providers in hospital and field settings,
such as military and emergency response units.
