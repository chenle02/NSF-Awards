This award will provide partial funding for the acquisition of instrumentation
to study the paleomagnetism of ocean sediments and how it is acquired and
preserved. The equipment will be operated and maintained in the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography Analytical Facility at the University of California,
San Diego. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
necessary. The equipment will be used to study under controlled laboratory
conditions the formation, chemical transformation, biomolecular interaction and
magnetization of green rust (a metastable ferroferric carbonate) and its
eventual stable breakdown product, magnetite. Magnetite is one of the main
contributors to the remanent magnetization of sedimentary rocks, and unraveling
the causes of its formation and magnetization is one of the keys to
understanding rock magnetism.
