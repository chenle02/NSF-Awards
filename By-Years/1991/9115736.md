Pelagic biogeography, the study of the distribution of organisms in the open
ocean, has been limited by the inability to determine the genetic composition
and structure of marine species. Dr. George Matsumoto and colleagues will try to
apply new molecular systematic methods of DNA analysis to samples of two poorly
known groups of pelagic organisms, siphonophores and ctenophores. Emphasis in
the laboratory will be placed on analyzing mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal DNA,
because of the demonstrated utility of these classes of DNA in other animal
groups. If successful, the study will yield data that will help characterize the
genetic diversity and differences within and among groups of these colonial
invertebrates. The organisms under study have gelatinous outer sheaths, which
present special problems for the extraction and analysis of DNA. Thus, the SGER
mechanism is especially appropriate for support of this exploratory research.
