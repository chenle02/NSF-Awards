0120523&lt;br/&gt;Stanford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conceptual foundation of
this biocomplexity proposal is that river flood plains are regional centers of
ecological organization. This system is dependent on interactions among dynamic,
nonlinear physical and biological processes linking water, heat and materials
(biota, sediment, and plant-growth nutrients), flux and retention to fluvial
landscape change. Strong interactions between short-duration, high stream-power
floods, channel and sediment movement, increased roughness due to presence of
vegetation and dead wood and upwelling of groundwater creates a complex, dynamic
distribution of resource patches, which we refer to as the shifting habitat
mosaic. This rnosaic promotes biodiversity and complex food webs that sequester
and transform energy and materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using this conceptual
foundation and the implications of two decades of research on expansive gravel-
cobble flood plains in western USA rivers. we propose a set of
working&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses that address emergent properties of these and other
similar flood plains. We will improve and integrate our existing 3D hydrologic
model with new channel change, heat flux and nutrient cycling model in a dynamic
flood plain biogeochemical simulator that is initialized from remote sensing
information. The goal is spatially explicit quantification of heat and nutrient
fluxes in relation to the habitat dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose an
educational component that proactively links the floodplain research with the
summer academic program at the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS), the
natural resources curriculum of our local Native American college (Salish and
Kootenai College) and an annual national workshop for environmental
professionals and high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
