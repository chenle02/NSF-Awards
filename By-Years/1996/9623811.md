9623811 Makris Semi-active dampers are receiving considerable attention for
seismic protection applications, including such devices ranging from hydraulic
dampers to electrorheological (ER) fluid dampers. The implementation of semi-
active dampers in real structures is challenged by a number of fundamental
research problems such as:a) Salability b) The required dynamic range c) Control
models and algorithms; d) Viscous heating and temperature dependent effects. In
this project a systematic effort is made to investigate the forementioned issues
is proposed. Specifically: The hysteretic unique property of electrorheological
dampers to develop a combination of hysteric and viscous forces will be further
exploited to develop a practical solution to protection of structures from
earthquakes. The entire project is based on a coordinated interdisciplinary
effort with strong industrial support and collaboration. A comprehensive
education program will move forward together with the research project to
involve students in their class work, laboratory testings, and analytical
investigations. This is a FY96 Career award. ***
