0118558&lt;br/&gt;Bohs&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a continuation of the NSF-
supported (award 9631587) program at Duke University in which students design
and build custom projects for people with disabilities. The objectives of the
design projects are to enhance engineering education, provide students with
insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people
with disabilities, and serve the community. These projects will address special
needs not met by commercial devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will
comprise a course, summer support of student interns, and follow-up service for
projects already delivered. During the past five years the course was offered
only in the fall semester; however, because of increasing student interest, now
it is to be offered in both fall and spring semesters. The expanded program will
allow approximately ten projects to be completed each year.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will undertake a real-world design as they
develop assistive, recreational, and therapeutic devices for people with
disabilities. A health care professional familiar with the client will meet
regularly with the student design team to insure that the project meets the
client's needs. In addition to this capstone design experience, the course will
provide students with exposure to engineering design procedures and ethics, and
the overall program will help establish and strengthen ties between the
university and the local community.&lt;br/&gt;
