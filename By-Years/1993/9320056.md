9320056 El-Aasser This award is for a joint research effort between Case Western
Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied
Polymers and Lehigh University's Industry/University's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Polymer Interfaces. The project "Novel Design
Concepts in Core/Shell Particles for Toughening Engineering Plastics" is to be
cost-shared by both Centers. EniChem America is also contributing a significant
effort in processing and scale-up of the new materials for testing. This "TIE"
project is studying a novel toughening concept which involves the synthesis of
new rubber latex particles composed of an IPN network of two elastomers, inter-
facially bonded in a controlled manner to the matrix plastics. The two I/UCRCs
have the qualified staff and facilities to address this project synergistically.
The Program Manager recommends Lehigh University be awarded $25,000 for the
first year of a two-year continuing award.
