Teachers, particularly K-12 teachers, need access to educational resources such
as the resources accessible through the NSDL that assist them in achieving
specific learning goals. Many of the learning goals are formally set down
national and state achievement standards such as the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Project 2061's Benchmarks for Science
Literacy. This project is integrating the Content Assignment Tool (CAT), the
Teacher Domain Educational Standards Correlation tool (TD-ESC) and the Digital
Collection Service into the Achievement Standards Network (ASN). Additionally,
the NSDL Metadata Registry required by the TD-ESC and the Gateway to Educational
Materials (GEM) Thesaurus Browser that facilitates cataloging by the DCS are
included. The resultant tool assists teachers by eliminating the cumbersomeness
of working with a set of separate tools that currently are incompletely
compatible
