The overall objective of this project is to better understand the dynamics of
atmospheric fronts. The project focuses on two particular aspects - (1) the
structure and evolution of unstable disturbances generated along fronts and (2)
the interaction of frontal-scale and large scale processes in the development of
fronts at upper levels of the troposphere. The latter will also include an
examination of exchanges between the troposphere and stratosphere in upper level
frontal zones. Both studies will employ a three- dimensional model with an
isentropic coordinate system which the principal investigators developed under a
previous NSF award. The model represents an important tool for improving our
understanding of the basic processes responsible for atmospheric disturbances.
This research will advance our basic understanding of atmospheric process and
ultimately contribute to better prediction of weather and climate.
