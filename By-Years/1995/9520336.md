This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the application of time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry
(MS) to the analytical characterization of polymers. During the tenure of this
thirty-three month continuing grant, Professor Hercules and his students at
Vanderbilt University will seek to establish definitive correlations between TOF
secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) fragmentation patterns and the
molecular structures of well defined polymers and polymer blends. Additionally,
they will apply matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization TOF MS (MALDI-TOF)
to the analytical characterization of thick film (bulk) polymer analytes. The
analytical characterization of polymers is a technologically important and
challenging problem. Mass spectrometric techniques offer versatility and
unparalleled sensitivity for a wide variety of polymer analytes. This research
will enable TOF-SIMS and MALDI- TOF MS to be reliably used as analytical tools
for the characterization of these ubiquitous materials. This research also has
important implications for the broad field of materials degradation and
stabilization.
