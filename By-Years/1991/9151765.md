Modern methods of instrumental analysis will be reemphasized in our curriculum
by incorporating a 60 MHz NMR instrument. The instrument would be used mainly in
the organic chemistry course in hands-on mode to do new experiments involving
chemical shift reagents, spin-spin decoupling, and identification of laboratory
products from micro-scale experiments. Investigative activities of students will
be made possible by the instrument.
