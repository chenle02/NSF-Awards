The objective of this research program is to develop a knowledge-based expert
system which can assist engineers in utilizing increasingly complex models for
seismic hazard evaluation and for which experience and knowledge play a key
role. Experts will be consulted to identify and provide the type of information
used by them to evaluate seismic hazard. An expert-system (a computer program)
in which linguistic and numerical information and logic are processed, will be
developed to incorporate the steps and procedures used by experts to assess
seismic hazard. Finally, a case study will be conducted to check the procedures
developed. The four tasks are: develop a "knowledge base" for regional seismic
hazard analysis; develop an inferential network; develop a simple "knowledge-
based expert system;" and implement the results of Task 3 by means of a case
study.
