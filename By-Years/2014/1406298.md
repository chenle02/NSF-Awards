An important quest in modern nuclear physics concerns the theoretical
understanding of the structure of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in terms of
quarks, antiquarks and gluons, the degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD), the fundamental theory of strong interactions. In this project, the
investigator and his students will advance the development of theory necessary
to understand experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory,
Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other facilities world-wide. In addition to
providing theoretical support for existing and future experimental programs, the
benefits of this project include training for graduate students. The project
will also offer research opportunities for undergraduate students at the
frontiers of theoretical nucleon structure research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will explore nucleon structure in terms of transverse momentum dependent
parton distribution functions (TMDs). Based on a QCD factorization formalism,
TMDs are a useful tool in the study of high-energy reactions. As compared to the
familiar and better known collinear parton distribution functions which describe
processes when no final-state transverse momenta are resolved, TMDs offer
detailed information about dynamics. They provide access to parton orbital
motion and aspects of spin-orbit correlations when polarized beams and targets
are explored. The goal of this project is to advance the current understanding
of the properties of TMDs in a non-perturbative framework. The specific
objectives of the project are: (1) determine the non-perturbative properties of
TMDs at a low initial scale, (2)identify model-independent signatures of chiral
symmetry breaking with focus on sea quark effects, (3) explore phenomenological
applications and present predictions for experiments. The tools employed in this
project include the use of perturbative evolution equations, dynamical models,
and effective chiral theories.
