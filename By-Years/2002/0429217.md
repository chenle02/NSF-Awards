Visions of Digital Government see people easily accessing government information
while simultaneously encouraging a more efficient, transparent, and accountable
government. The implementation of these visions requires government to carefully
consider the design information technologies or" code", i.e., the physical
hardware, software and architecture of information technologies. This research
seeks to provide an understanding of how choices in code can govern or regulate
society. Initially a theoretical framework on how code operates as a regulatory
mechanism will be developed. Additionally there will be a comparative analysis
of code versus other regulatory mechanisms, such as law and social norms.
Finally, there will be an attempt to understand the interrelationships between
regulatory mechanisms, such as laws, social norms, and code. The theoretical
framework will be informed by a series of historical case studies, allowing a
systematic understanding of code. The foremost criterion for the case studies is
to consider fundamental societal values that are of concern to society, such as
free speech, privacy, and intellectual property rights.
