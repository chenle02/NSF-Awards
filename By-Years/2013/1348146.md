This award will support the participation of an early science career female
scholar in the Northern Research Forum, which will be held in Akureyri, Iceland
in the Fall 2013. The Northern Research Forum (NRF) holds an Open Assembly every
two years. Each assembly focuses on a different theme of relevance to
northerners and northern research. This years Assembly theme is Climate Change
in Northern Territories: Sharing Experiences and Exploring New Methods,
Assessing Socio-Economic Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main
objectives of the NRF is to promote the next generation of Arctic researchers by
involving emerging scholars in leadership and by selecting a cohort of early
career researchers to present their research projects and findings at the Open
Assemblies. The aim is to engage early career researchers in dialogue with
senior scientists and other professionals and experts as well as representatives
of various stakeholder groups and the public. This proposal will support the
involvement of an early science career scholar from the United States: Robin
Bronen. She will join more than 20 other Young Researchers from other Arctic
nations, offering an opportunity for exchange of ideas and network building. Dr.
Bonen's participation will create an opportunity to contribute to the discussion
on the impacts of environmental change in the Arctic and raise awareness about
the policy challenges related to environmental change, community habitability,
and population displacement. Through participation in the Northern Territories
conference, the goal is to begin the process of creating an international
research team focused on understanding the nexus between environmental change
and population displacement in the Arctic.
