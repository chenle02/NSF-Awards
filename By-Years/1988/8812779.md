This research is funded to study the relationship of micro- mechanics and the
toughening mechanism of ceramics. Many techniques have been tried to improve
bonding between dissimilar materials with applications to composite materials,
layered electronic devices, and protective coatings. Research will be conducted
to study a number of aspects of fracture along interfaces including the
parameters controlling toughness of a brittle adherent layer, the role of
combined mode loading on debonding, and bond toughening by deflected crack
trajectories within an adhesive layer. Theoretical work will be carried out on
micro-cracking and crack- bridging, two basic mechanisms which can in principle
be manipulated by micro-structural processing to improve the toughness of
polycrystalline ceramics. The objective of this work is to quantify the
mechanisms so that reliable toughness predictions can be made based on
microstructural characterizations. A basic study of cavitation in plastically
deforming solids under triaxial stressing will be conducted. Stress levels at
which "explosive" void growth occurs will be sought. These stress states
represent intrinsic material stability limits which appear to have been attained
in recent experiments under highly constrained flow.
