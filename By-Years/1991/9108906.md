This research is on accelerating mixed level simulation using general purpose
parallel processors. An existing parallel simulator is being developed to make
the code more portable and available for others to use on several parallel
machines. Parallel discrete event simulation is being used. Topics addressed
are: (1) finding techniques for improving the simulation of large fan- out
circuit nodes; and (2) developing graph manipulation algorithms to improve
partitioning, to improve signal distribution, and to do asynchronous message
passing. Experiments on benchmark designs with the simulator to study the
effects of partitioning, component migration, task size, and computational and
communication overhead are being conducted.
