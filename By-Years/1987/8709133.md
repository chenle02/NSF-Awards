This is a pilot study to determine whether an analysis of the Puerto Rican labor
market experience can provide insights into the responsiveness of workers to
changing labor markets and into the general experience of Hispanics in the U.S.
labor markets. The project consists of three major tasks. First, a theoretical
model of sectoral labor markets and labor mobility is developed. The model
highlights the interdependency among primary and secondary labor markets while
incorporating job search and non-labor force participation. Second, changes in
the Puerto Rican labor market from 1950 to the present are examined with an eye
towards establishing its relevance for understanding the experience of Hispanics
in the United States labor market. This requires a detailed cross-section
comparison of Hispanic sub-groups in the United States with the Puerto Rican
labor force. Third, the project examines the cyclical and structural sensitivity
of labor force participation to changing conditions. These comparisons will be
of a time series nature and are disaggregated by ethnicity, gender and age.
