Large scale application requirements for high temperature ceramic
superconductors (HTSCs), in addition to high current density, include high
mechanical strength and chemical and mechanical stability. Multicomponent HTSC
laminates with critical current densities greater than 1000 A/cm2 at 77o Kelvin
fabricated by the contractor address these requirements. Electrodeposition from
a non-aqueous solution of the metal cladding layer in these laminates directly
onto the HTSC may offer a more economical and flexible route to cladding HTSC
tape conductors making the processing of continuous length tape conductors more
feasible. This is a feasibility study comprising the fabrication and
characterization of multicomponent HTSC laminates with electrodeposited metal
cladding layers.
