This program shall develop and apply cryogenic and room temperature torsion
balances to search for anomalous long-range interactions in nature. Such
interactions reveal themselves as anomalies in the effective gravitational
interaction. Recent strong impetus for such investigations comes from reported
experimental evidence for a very weak long range "fifth force" in nature. An
experiment is being conducted to test for such a force by searching for a
composition dependence in the forces experienced by equal masses of different
materials suspended from a torsion balance located on a hillside. A related
experiment is being designed to search for composition dependence experienced by
such a balance due to a local movable mass. Another experiment is being
conducted to search for anomalous long range interactions between samples with
polarized electron spins, magnetically isolated with superconducting shields.
The performance of the torsion balance is being evaluated to assess its
suitability for application to other experiments in gravitation such as an
improved test of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass.
