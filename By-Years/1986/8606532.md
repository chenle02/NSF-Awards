The purpose of this workshop is to identify key areas of mechanics research to
improve paper technologies. The workshop will address the following specific
areas of mechanics research for paper technologies: mechanical properties of
paper products, environmental effects, such as temperature and humidity,
modeling and simulation of the mechanical behavior and experimental paper
mechanics. The workshop will identify key solid mechanics research issues and
develop an appropriate strategy to guide the development of mechanics principles
for technologies and processes to produce and utilize paper. A published report
of recommendations will be prepared and submitted to NSF. This workshop provides
an opportunity, for the first time, to bring together the paper industry with
researchers in mechanics and to identify priority research issues to enhance
paper technologies.
