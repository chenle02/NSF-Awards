The planned I/UCRC for the Sustainable Use of Greenhouse Gases intends to
undertake research aimed at advancing current theory and technology, and to
become a scientific focal point within the renewables and sustainability fields.
Work will include (a) novel scalable plant and algae based systems and synthetic
biomimicry approaches to capture and convert CO2 and CH4 into methanol, sugars,
fatty acids, and oils, (b) scalable fermentation and biohybrid catalytic
approaches to up-convert these into high demand, high value industrial chemicals
and fuels, (c) application of these approaches to capture and convert greenhouse
gases from distributed systems (e.g., the atmosphere) and concentrated systems
(e.g., flu streams from coal and gas powered generators).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the planned center?fs addressing of industrial
needs through efficient capture and up-conversion of greenhouse gases to
valuable chemicals and fuels, the major threats and potential impacts of climate
change may be in part ameliorated on both a sustainable and profitable basis.
The planned center will develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific
community on the sustainable use of greenhouse gases, including short courses,
cross?]departmental and cross?]university graduate course offerings, and
internships with member organizations. The Center will recruit and train
underrepresented groups (minorities, women, and students with disabilities)
through various existing programs on campus as well as new programs. &lt;br/&gt;
