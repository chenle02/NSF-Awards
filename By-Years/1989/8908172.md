The goal of this research is to elucidate the structure and function of
bacterial D.amino acid transaminase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of
the bacterial cell wall. A gene encoding this enzyme has been cloned so that
large amounts of it can be prepared in pure form and crystallized for X-ray
diffraction studies. The specific objective of this award is to define the
stereochemistry of this enzyme which apparently acts on L-amino acids as well as
D.amino acids but at a much lower rate. Since this enzyme serves an essential
function in bacteria and is not found in mammalian systems, it could be a
valuable target for the development of inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents
against bacterial infections.
