Film boiling heat transfer on submerged surfaces will be investigated. The
specific issues to be addressed are: the stability of the vapor films; the
effects of liquid-solid contact; and the behavior of the film boiling wake.
Theoretical models will be developed and experimental measurements of the
surface temperatures of heated spheres under boiling conditions will be made.
