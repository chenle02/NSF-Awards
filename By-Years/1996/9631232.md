9631232 Baumgartner Interest groups have long been seen as important actors in
the policymaking process and yet scholars remain deeply divided about the means
by which interest group influence is achieved. Prior studies have disagreed
about whether interest groups act as pressure groups or service bureaus, and
about the reasons why one group plies the issue networks of Washington while
another turns to the grass roots beyond the beltway. Methodological difficulties
have prevented past studies from testing theories of how different political
circumstances affect the lobbying tactics groups choose, and have created
conundrums such as why mass media tactics are used equally by insider and
outsider groups. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project resolves the
methodological problems of past research by linking data on many groups to data
about specific issues. The project, involving a mail survey of 2,500 interest
groups and corporations and in-depth phone interviews with a subsample of 200
survey respondents, is methodologically innovative in that questions about
tactic choice will be linked to specific issues selected by the respondents
themselves. Tactic use is linked to particular sets of political circumstances,
making it possible to test a context-sensitive theory of strategic choice of
lobbying tactics. ***
