This award provides 52% of the funds required for the purchase of component
parts and machine shop charges for the construction of improvements to a Fourier
transform infrared spectrometer installed and operated in the Division of
Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of Technology. The
Institute is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this upgrade.
The upgrade will significantly enhance the ability of the mineral spectroscopy
group at Caltech to obtain spectra on very small samples through an infrared
microscope. The scientific applications for the enhanced capability include
studies of zonation profiles of water and carbon dioxide in minerals and
glasses, and the determination of the concentration and chemical speciation of
water in natural and synthetic mineral phases.
