The Water Analysis Laboratory is used by undergraduates for coursework in water
analysis, required of environmental science majors. The central piece of
equipment in this laboratory is an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Use of
this instrument is essential for students learning the application of basic
chemistry to the study of environmental problems. Many of the student senior
research projects in environmental science, as well as in biology and geology,
rely on atomic absorption spectrophotometry as the primary means of collecting
data by conducting chemical analyses of water, rock, soil, plant and animal
samples. The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for
the NSF award.
