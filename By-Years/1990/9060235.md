Many outstanding problems in meteorology and climate research would benefit
greatly from the availability of inexpensive in-situ measurements of the
atmosphere, particularly in remote regions of the globe such as over the oceans
where conventional measurement systems are few or non-existent. The National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has developed a family of lightweight
digital dropwindsondes, and Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation has developed a
low-cost Unmanned Scientific Research Aircraft (USRA) called Perseus. The goal
of this SBIR project is to combine the digital dropwindsonde with the with the
USRA to produce a flexible, low-cost system for providing in-situ atmospheric
measurements. During Phase I, the principal investigators will fabricate a
dispenser for the NCAR dropwindsondes and install it on the Aurora Perseus
proof-of- concept aircraft. The dispenser concept will be tested as part of
Perseus' engineering flight tests in early 1991. The receiver and data
processing unit for this demonstration will be ground based. During Phase II, a
dedicated airborne data collection and processing system will be developed.
