This project will help fund an investigation of the climate history of the
northern Great Plains, across the Eocene-Oligocene transition, by analyzing
oxygen isotopes found in the phosphate of fossil teeth of a variety of mammals.
This transition was one of the Cenozoic's most abrupt climatic events, changing
a greenhouse world into an icehouse world. By quantifying isotopic changes in
mammalian teeth, the researcher aims to quantify changes in diet and water
resources as they relate to regional temperature, humidity, and seasonality. A
further science aim is to examine the timing and rate of climate change on the
continent and compare it with the marine record to broaden the perspective of
the research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study will be made
readily available to a broad segment of state and national parks across the
Great Plains thereby connecting to the million-plus visitors who visit the sites
each year. This research project will provide a unique educational experience
for a graduate student who will be intimately involved with the research team.
