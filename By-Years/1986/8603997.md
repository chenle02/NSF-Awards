In real-life operation of heat exchange devices, unsteady forced convection is
as common as steady force convection. However, almost all experimental, results
for forced convection heat transfer are for steady conditions. This
investigation will provide experimental results for unsteady convection, which
will be compared with theory. Supercomputer time will be provided.
