This marine seismic-reflection project is designed to define the geologic
structure of the Victoria Land Basin and the Terror Rift in the western Ross Sea
of Antarctica. The U.S. Geological Survey will deploy its system of digital
ocean bottom seismographs in order to determine the seismic velocity structure
of the continental crust and upper mantle along the eastern margin of the
Transantarctic Mountains. The experiment is scheduled to be performed in the
1988/89 field season in conjunction with the Bundesanstalt fur
Geowissenschaften, Federal Republic of Germany, which will provide the marine
platform for instrument deployment.
