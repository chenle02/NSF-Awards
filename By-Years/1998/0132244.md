0132244&lt;br/&gt;Tulaczyk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides partial
support for acquisition of a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for the Department
of Earth Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The GPR setup
will include five antennas spanning frequencies from 12.5 MHz through 400 MHz.
The GPR equipment will be utilized by: (1) the UCSC Surface Processes Group
(glaciology, geomorphology, hydrology and Quaternary geology; ~60% of time), (2)
other UCSC Earth Science faculty (geophysics, hydrogeology, and neotectonics;
~30% of time), and (3) other UCSC and non-UCSC users (~10% of time). GPR
technology fits ideally into the Earth Science research programs listed above
because it permits better integration of surface and near-surface observations
of geologic structures and stratigraphy. This GPR capability combines with its
portability and ease of use to provide an excellent tool for constraining models
of key surface and near-surface geologic processes even in logistically
difficult environments. In addition to its application in research projects, the
UCSC GPR facility will be used to intensify hands-on training of UCSC
undergraduate and graduate students in field geophysical techniques. Use of this
new equipment will be incorporated into relevant upper division courses:
Geologic Hazards, Environmental Geophysics, Geomorphology, Soil Properties and
Mechanics, and Groundwater. The host department will provide support for the new
GPR facility in the form of: (1) 30% equipment cost match, (2) computer and
software resources for GPR data field processing and post-processing, (3)
technical support by a team of three specialists, and (4) storage
space.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
