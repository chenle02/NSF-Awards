This grant will support a study of several effects of magnetic field aligned or
Birkeland electric currents. The projects begin with a standard model
magnetosphere to which various Birkeland current systems will be added. The
first additions will involve typical simplified auroral current systems. Then
several actual current patterns which are derived from specific radar and ground
magnetometer measurements will be added. The purpose of this part of the project
is to study distortions in the direction and magnitude of electric fields as
they are projected from the ionosphere to the outer magnetosphere in the
presence of Birkeland currents. The next portion of the study involves the
formation of magnetic flux tubes. These tubes are generated by perturbation
magnetic fields that are driven by the Birkeland currents. Such tubes may be of
special importance near the westward traveling surge of an auroral substorm,
near small bright auroral spots, and over the polar caps. Finally, a preliminary
study of induced electric fields that are associated with the diversion of cross
tail electric currents to the ionosphere during a magnetic storm will be
initiated. The overall aim is to study the way in which electric currents modify
the near earth environment.
