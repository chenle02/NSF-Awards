Dynamical systems techniques have tremendous potential for application in the
area of nonlinear optics. Important problems of optical communication, such as
the stability of pulse propagation and locking of multiple pulses can be
formulated as problems susceptible to the modern geometric techniques of
dynamical systems. This proposal involves a collaboration with a German group
headed by Tassilio KÂ¼pper of the University of Cologne. One goal of the
collaboration is to involve graduate students in the research and expose them to
both sides of the work through travel to Germany. Problems considered will be
the stability of nonlinear waveguide modes relative to the full Maxwell- Bloch
system, multiple pulse propagation, and the locking of pulses on coupled fibers.
Techniques used will be bifurcation theory, stability indices, bifurcation from
the essential spectrum, and numerical investigations.
