IBN 93-20443 Martins Abstract A symposium on "Phylogenies and the Comparative
Method in Animal Behavior" will be held at the annual meeting of the Animal
Behavior Society in Seattle, Washington. The comparative method has been an
important component of research in animal behavior since the inception of the
field. In sub-fields ranging from classical ethology to comparative psychology
to behavioral ecology, behavioral researchers rely on comparisons among species
to infer evolutionary patterns and universal trends in animal behavior. In the
last few decades, a huge resurgence of interest in comparative studies has
occurred in evolutionary biology and systematics, focusing primarily on the
importance of incorporating phylogenetic information into the design and
analysis of comparative studies. The main goal of this symposium is to promote
discussion of the impact of the new concepts and techniques that have arisen in
this area on the field of animal behavior.
