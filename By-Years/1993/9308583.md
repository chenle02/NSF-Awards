9308583 Strauss Professor Strauss, of Colorado State University, will continue
to investigate weakly coordinating anions with funding from the Inorganic,
Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program. New target anions will be
polyfluorinated species such as Sb(OTeF5)6 -, Sb(OC(CF3)3)6 -, and analogous
anions having Ti4+ and other cations as central atoms. Stable salts of these
anions will be prepared, characterized, and used to isolate unusually reactive
cations. This will impact studies of coordination complexes having very weakly
coordinated ligands (such as chloroalkanes), and it may help generate new
homogeneous catalysts. Other target cations include silyl cations, Fe(por) +,
and Zr(Cp)2(Me) +. A fourth area will be the preparation of carbonyl complexes
of the coinage group metal cations. %%% Molecules that have a positive charge
are called "cations". When complex cations are constructed by bonding atoms or
groups of atoms to a central metal atom, this atom usually has a preferred
number of other atoms strongly bonded to it. However, when these cations
participate in chemical reactions they can exist briefly with either a reduced
number of bound atoms or else with one bound quite weakly; these unusual states
are crucial to the reactions, but they are difficult to examine because of their
instability. Experiments to alleviate these difficulties will be performed by
preparing specially unreactive anions, negatively charged species which are
required in order to balance the charge of the cations. It is anticipated that
these new anions will permit preparation of highly reactive cations that will
elucidate fundamental chemistry and perhaps serve as new industrial catalysts.
