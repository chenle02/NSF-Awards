The project is designed to engage Hispanic students in grades K-5 in STEM in
afterschool programs within community-based organizations (CBOs). The project
builds on the foundation of an NSF-supported afterschool science program?APEX
(Afterschool Program Exploring Science). In collaboration with National Council
of La Raza (NCLR), and ASPIRA, the project adapts APEX into a bilingual
English/Spanish format and, using a train the trainer model, disseminates it
nationally, using a train the trainer model. Each of the ten local project sites
will build on a partnership between a science museum and a CBO affiliate of NCLR
or ASPIRA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed
to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Build the organizational capacity of partner science
museums to work with CBOs and the Hispanic community.&lt;br/&gt;2. Strengthen
links between science museums and Hispanic serving CBOs in their communities.
&lt;br/&gt;3. Engage the expertise, involvement, and collaboration of national
Hispanic-serving organizations, NCLR and ASPIRA, in STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;4.
Increase the engagement of Hispanic children and families in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project evaluation will investigate how
effectively the project builds the organizational capacity of partner museums
and CBOs in engaging Hispanic children and families in STEM; the types and
strength of science museum/CBO partnerships; the effectiveness of the project in
increasing Hispanic student and family engagement in STEM, and the types of
contributions the project makes to the field of informal STEM learning. The
evaluation will use qualitative and quantitative methods, including surveys,
interviews, case studies, social network and collaboration analysis,
observations, activity tracking, embedded assessment, photo elicitation, and
focus groups.
