The chloroplast enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)
catalyzes the rate-limiting step of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, and thus limits
plant productivity. Oxygenation of substrate ribulosebisphosphate leads to the
loss of fixed carbon, and the competition of O2 with CO2 at the enzyme active
site reduces the maximum rate of carboxylation. Genetic engineering is expected
to improve carboxylation by changing the CO2/O2 specificity of the enzyme.
However, there has been no rationale for accomplishing this goal. Directed
mutagenesis has so far been limited to confirming the essential role of a
variety of "active-site" residues, and the Rubisco primary and x-ray-crystal
structures have failed to identify potential sites for beneficial modification.
In contrast, the neoclassical genetic approach that can be pursued in the green
alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been able to define structural regions of the
chloroplast-encoded large subunit that influence the CO2/O2 specificity of the
holoenzyme. A more methodical approach for the application of induced mutations
is underway. Mutations are being defined by sequencing appropriate chloroplast
or nuclear genes, and mutant enzymes are being characterized biochemically to
correlate changes in structure with changes in function. Directed mutagenesis
and chloroplast transformation are also being used to test hypotheses formulated
from the study of these mutations. The photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco is present
in all green plants and algae and is considered to be the most abundant protein
in nature. Since it catalyzes a reaction which can limit photosynthetic CO2
fixation and, therefore, plant growth, the long-term objective of this work is
to make a better Rubisco. Since the primary structure of the Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii Rubisco is quite similar to that of plants, it is a good model for
defining potential modifications in crop-plant Rubisco enzymes.
