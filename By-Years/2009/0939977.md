Dr. Michael J. Pullin and colleague Lisa Majowski from New Mexico Institute of
Mining and Technology will convene a special symposium for undergraduate
students at the 2009 SACNAS National Meeting (Dallas, Texas; October 15 - 18).
The title of the symposium will be "Exploring Your Future in Science Through an
Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Research Experience." The session will introduce
students to the idea of doing interdisciplinary research and will provide them
advice on how to find and apply to interdisciplinary REU programs, supported by
NSF. Interaction by the attendees with successful, past REU participants will
also be a part of the program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
