Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CHE-0244206 Date:
1-07-2003&lt;br/&gt;PI: Cloninger Institution: Montana State
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Montana State University for the
summers of 2003-2005. Mary J. Cloninger is the site's program director. Twelve
different research groups will offer research projects and mentoring for10
students for ten weeks in the areas of chemistry and biochemistry. Students will
be recruited primarily from the northwest region of the US with particular
emphasis on Montana colleges and Native Americans in this region. Research
projects will involve a broad range of topics including isolation and
characterization of natural products and biologically active compounds, bio-
nanomaterials, structural biology, x-ray crystallography, bioorganic and
biophysical chemistry. The program will have weekly workshops, seminars, and
research group meetings. The participants will write a final paper and present a
poster on their research at the conclusion of the program. &lt;br/&gt;
