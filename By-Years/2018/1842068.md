The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability
to predict how humans will respond to therapeutic treatment options before the
clinical trial stage. By testing drug toxicity and efficacy in a human model,
drugs can get to market more quickly, with less risk and lower costs, while
potentially reducing the use of animal testing. Currently it takes an average of
10 years and $2.8B to get a drug to market, with the majority of the cost due to
late-stage drug failures. The ability to screen drugs in human organ systems
that are predictive of in vivo conditions will better inform "go/no-go"
decision-making throughout the stages of drug development. Broader impacts
include the ability to create clinical trials "in-a-dish" where patient
populations that will benefit the most from the drug versus those that would be
at risk can be determined before clinical testing. Use of patient-specific cells
may enable the development of disease models where animal models failed to
recapitulate the disease, as well as drug testing for rare diseases, where the
limited number of affected individuals prevents the standard clinical trial
format. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes a modular platform
designed to physiologically integrate multiple human tissue engineered organ
models though vascular connections that mimic how organs are connected to one
another in the human body. The connected tissue engineered models are
individually matured prior to integration to provide the high biological
fidelity needed to accurately recapitulate organ level responses of health and
disease. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells enables the use of
patient-specific cells and gene-edited cells, as well as provides a platform to
further precision medicine initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
