California State University, Chico, will establish a communications and digital
signal processing laboratory for undergraduate electrical engineering students.
Major instruments to be purchased are two computer-based telephone branch
exchanges, five microcomputers, three instruments for communication signal
analysis (protocol analyzer, signal analyzer and high speed
oscilloscope/digitizer), and four digital signal processing/analog interface
boards. This equipment will be combined with existing basic laboratory
instruments to provide a laboratory component for five undergraduate engineering
courses. Digital communications and signal processing are rapidly growing
technical areas; this project will provide students with the laboratory
experience needed to prepare them for further study in graduate school or
professional work in industry.
