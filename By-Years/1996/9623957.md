*** 9623957 Singsaas/Penny This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
project addresses the need for improvements in the readout electronics for
cryogenic radiation and particle detectors whic are being developed for diverse
applications in astrophysics, particle detection, medical imaging, and materials
science. Many of these devices use a superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) for reading out the signal from the detector. The extreme sensitivity of
SQUIDs to small changes in current, voltage or magnetic flux are essential for
reaching the detection and resolution limits of the new detectors. Existing
SQUID systems are often ineffectual or of limited usefulness in exploiting the
full potential of these detectors due to limitations of bandwidth and slew rate,
which make high count rate detection and pulse shape determination difficult or
impossible. Recent work on high-speed SQUID electronics and improved sensors has
shown that performance can be greatly improved not only in frequency response
and slew rate, but also in stability, reliability and noise level. This will be
a significant advance for cryogenic radiation and particle detector readout. The
improvements will also aid in enabling laboratory for other industrial,
military, and field use applications. SQUID technology to emerge out of the
laboratory for other industrial, military, and field use applications. The
technology developed here will significantly advance the use of do SQUID systems
by providing the capability for measurements over a much wider range of
frequencies, as well as in harsh environments where measurements were difficult
or impossible to perform previously. Commercial applications benefiting from
these advances include eddy current and biomedical instruments, ground-based or
airborne magnetic anomaly detection, and airborn gravity gradiometers. ***
