The focus of this research is on the chemistry of organic compounds of sulfur
and selenium. Major areas of effort are six-fold and include: 1) Dithiin
chemistry, especially the synthesis and study of the reaction chemistry of
1,2-dithiins; 2) Synthesis and study of 1,2-dithiocins, 1,4-dithiocins, higher
ring homologs of 1,2-dithiins and likely thermal sources of singlet S2; 3)
Research on Allium chemistry; 4) Investigation of the chemistry of shiitake
mushroom flavorants; 5) Development of new reagents for organic synthesis, and;
6) Characterization of highly reactive small organosulfur compounds using
microwave spectroscopy. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Eric Block of the Chemistry Department at
SUNY, Albany. Professor Block will focus his work on the chemistry of organic
compounds of sulfur and selenium. The projects in this broadly based research
program range from the study of the chemistry of garlic and onion to the
development of new reagents for organic synthesis.
