Increased wildfires are predicted to accompany ongoing climate change. Yet,
little evidence exists supporting this hypothesis. This project will examine
relationships between wildfire and climate over the past four+ centuries, from
the steppes of the Gobi to the taiga forests of northern Mongolia. Mongolia?s
landscape, land-use history and recent history of rapid climate change make it
an ideal test case for an examination of the relationship between wildfire and
climate. Wildfire occurrence and severity will be reconstructed using tree ages
and fire scars as recorded by tree rings. The main objectives are to: 1) test
hypotheses about climate impacts on wildfires by developing a network of fire
histories across Mongolia; 2) determine whether recent climate change has caused
unprecedented changes in the number or severity of wildfires, and 3) potentially
identify what climatic combinations could cause forest properties to change
significantly from what they had been historically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will increase understanding of how wildfires affect forests within the
context of climate change, past, present and future. It will also complement a
growing global-scale database on fire, climate, and forest histories that can
assess the potential impacts of climate change on wildfires. This is important
because, in some forest types, wildfire is a critical process that helps to
maintain ecosystem health. Wildfires may also influence atmospheric processes
and, potentially, global warming. This research will contribute to international
cooperation between the U.S. and Mongolia and will include involvement of
Mongolian scientists and students.&lt;br/&gt;
