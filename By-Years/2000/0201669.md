Title: Cubature Formulae and Orthogonal Polynomials in Several Variables

The aim of this project is to study various aspects of cubature formulae (CF),
synonym for higher dimensional numerical integration formulae, and orthogonal
polynomials of several variables (OP). The project calls for a study of cubature
formula from an algebraic point of view as well as new constrction method, such
as through studying of polynomial interpolation in several variables. It also
proposes to investigate further properties of OP with respect to weight
functions on various regular domains, such as the cube, the ball, the simplex
and the sphere. The aim is to uncover further hidden properties of CF and OP,
and to find closed formulae and explicit construction, so that further theoretic
results and methods with practical implication can be built upon.

Cubature Formulae (CF) and Orthogonal Polynomials (OP) of several variables have
fruitful connections with many branches of applied mathematics such as numerical
integration, approximation, coding theory, data fitting, combinatorics and
statistics, to name a few, as well as with areas such as harmonic analysis,
group representation, computational algebraic geometry and differential
equation. CF itself is essential for practical evaluation of high dimensional
integrals, which is one of the basic questions in numerical analysis and is
often taken as a test problem in high speed computing. The proposed project
seeks new understanding in the nature of CF and OP in several variables, and it
aims at workable results that have practical implications, such as new method
for constructing CF.
