WIth support from the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the NSF
Division of Chemistry, Professor Angela Wilson at Michigan State University
(MSU) will conduct computational modeling to investigate the fate, distribution,
and dynamics of poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in soils, sediments,
and surface and groundwaters. PFAS molecules are resistant to degradation which
leads to their widespread presence in the environment. Exposure to PFASâ€™s has
been linked to environmental and human health impacts such as the onset of
cancer, developmental disorders, and reproductive issues. In this project, PFAS
interactions with surfaces within soil, sediments, and surface- and groundwater
under environmental conditions will be investigated. This will help scientists
and engineers gain insight about PFAS mitigation strategies for soil, sediment,
and water. A library of YouTube videos about the findings from this research
will be made available, and collaboration with the MSU PFAS Center will further
enable dissemination of the findings to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
unique chemical and physical properties of PFAS have enabled this class of over
5,000 molecules to be incorporated into a wide range of commonly used products
including fire-fighting foams, non-stick cookware, packaging, cosmetics, papers,
paints, waterproof clothing, and carpets. This work will utilize state-of-the-
art computational modeling methods with the goal of identifying the dominant
interactions that govern the initial adsorption and subsequent dynamics of PFAS
with environmentally relevant clay minerals, metal cations, and organic matter.
This work aims to illuminate the important physical and chemical properties of
PFAS in these natural settings. This computational modeling effort will produce
a database of physico-chemical properties of PFAS compounds in various
environment settings. The proposed systematic evaluation will likely be of
interest to researchers working in disciplines including environmental
engineering, contaminant remediation, plant and agricultural sciences, and earth
sciences. The insight from this effort has the potential to help guide the
design of future mitigation strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
