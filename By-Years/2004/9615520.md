9615520 Blackwell The taxonomic order Laboulbeniales includes minute fungi that
are obligate ectoparasites on a variety of arthropod hosts. Their bizarre
morphology and interesting ecological relationships make them fascinating
subjects for evolutionary investigation. Although known in a general sense to
mycologists and entomologists, these remarkable ascomycetes have attracted
little sustained study, and the taxonomic classification of the c. 2,000 named
species is unstable. As a group, the Laboulbeniales are characterized by the
absence of the tubular threads (mycelia) typical of the bodies of most fungi,
but instead possess few-celled bodies that are initiated by division of the
sexual spores, followed by haustoria that grow through the arthropod host
cuticle to obtain nutrients. Because they are dispersed through host contact,
often during mating, species of Laboulbeniales often have processes and
structures that may act as triggers for spore discharge. So unusual is the
morphology of this group of fungi that they were once proposed as parasitic
descendants of the red algae. The intriguing features of their life cycle
provide many morphological characters for phylogenetic analysis, but no such
explicit study has yet been undertaken. The current study draws upon Prof.
Meredith Blackwell's previous work with putatively related ascomycete fungi with
more typical morphology and with life cycles that include parasitic stages on
both other fungi and arthropods. The phylogenetic work will include studies of
morphological features, of life history stages, and of nucleotide sequence
diversity in nuclear ribosomal DNA as a source of characters for taxonomic
resolution and genealogical reconstruction. A phylogenetic framework for the
genera and families of the order, with consequent improvement in classification,
is one major goal. Another goal is to explore hypotheses of host-shifting and
speciation among groups of Laboulbeniales on different arthropod hosts.
