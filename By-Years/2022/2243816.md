This three year renewal REU Site entitled "IEDA Incubator for Porous Materials:
Integrating Discovery, Engineering and Art (IDEA) Incubator" is hosted by the
University of Kansas. The primary goal is to engage ten undergraduate students
each year in a variety of experiences, both in and out of the laboratory over
the course of the ten week Summer semester, aiming to nurture innovative
thinking, communication, and teamwork. These skills are essential to train the
future workforce that will help the U.S. compete in the worldwide economy. The
topic will help attract students with varying backgrounds, including women,
underrepresented minorities, those with disabilities and veterans, to pursue and
prepare for careers in science and engineering, and graduate education. Each
summer, ten undergraduates will grow as independent researchers and thinkers.
Participants will be involved in team-based learning projects focused on porous
materials, which have a variety of applications in both chemical and biomedical
fields. Training activities will be provided to help students develop a robust
understanding of innovation and concepts of time and scale, which are critical
for scientific knowledge and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three year

These skills are essential to train the future workforce that will help the U.S.
compete in the worldwide economy. During the 10-week summer program, this REU
Site will engage ten undergraduate students in research on topics related to
porous materials that varies from fundamental to applied. For example,
participants will gain fundamental knowledge on how to synthesize absorbents for
chemical separations, catalysts to convert renewable feedstocks into valuable
chemicals, print 3D passive samples for remediation and tune the surface of
heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, students will gain hands-on-experience
with state-of-the art analytical tools for characterizing porous materials. REU
students will be mentored by experienced faculty and trained graduate students.
Furthermore, synergistic benefits will arise from partnering with KU Research
Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site and faculty teamâ€™s outreach efforts, leading
to broader impacts for high school-level students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
