Eastern Virginia Medical School is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a
56,000 bits per second line through the Virginia Educational and Research
Network and the SURANET mid-level network. The connection enhances
collaborations of campus researchers with colleagues in several medical fields,
as well as on-line access to remote bibliography databases. This award funds
part of the costs for twelve months.
