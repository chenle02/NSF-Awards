This award supports two experimental investigations into the physics of musical
instruments. The two projects represent complex problems involving energy
transfer between vibrating structures and the air flow that produces the
vibration. One goal is to determine if the vibration of the tubing of brass wind
instruments in the direction of the air flow is the primary reason that the
material and bracing of the instrument affects the sound. If this is found to be
the case, it will answer a question that has been debated in the scientific
literature for over a century. The second goal is to determine the physical
parameters of a reed that are necessary to construct an accurate model of a
clarinet during actual performance. The results of this study will enhance the
ability to synthesize the sound of woodwind instruments and provide needed
information concerning which parameters musical instrument designers should be
adjusting to improve their instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The primary goal
of the work is to involve undergraduate students, particularly women, in
original scientific research. While the systems under study involve musical
instruments, the research centers on studying basic physical phenomena that are
not unique to musical acoustics. This work contributes to the understanding of
some important physics, with both scientific and industrial applications, but
more importantly it introduces undergraduate students to original scientific
research through a subject they find fascinating.
