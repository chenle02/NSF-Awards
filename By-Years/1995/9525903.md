9525903 Hall Because different astrophysical processes show characteristic
emission at different wavelengths, astronomers seek many different wavelength
windows to the universe. The difficulty of making infrared observations from
typical optical observatories led NASA to construct a 3-meter dedicated
telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii in the mid-1970's. NASA decided,
however, that half the total observing time would satisfy its needs, and
allocated the other half to visitors. The National Science Foundation has
provided funds to support these visitors since the opening of the telescope in
1979. While the NASA observers examine objects related in some way to NASA space
missions, the visitors are free to observe any object of sufficient scientific
interest, whether in or out of our Galaxy. The modest amount of money is used
for accommodations, local transportation, cryogen (to cool the receivers), and
publication in the scientific journals. The success and diversity of the program
fully justify its continued funding.
