This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of a variety of equipment items
to be used for biotechnology research by members of the zoology and biochemistry
departments at Iowa State University. Equipment includes a state of the art
imaging device for detection and analysis of radioactively-labelled nucleic
acids and proteins, a device for densitometry of stained-gels and
autoradiograms, equipment for synthesis and separation of DNA oligomers, a
computer workstation for data analysis and several other items. The equipment
will be housed in the nucleic acid facility of the new Biotechnology Center.
Advances in basic research in Biotechnology, including studies in molecular
biology and cell biology, have depended heavily on the development of
instrumentation such as DNA synthesizers and sequencers that permit what had
been time-consuming and difficult experimentation to be accomplished rapidly and
with little effort. New devices have now increased the speed and sensitivity of
detection and analysis of proteins and nucleic acids by orders of magnitude.
Typically such equipment is placed in a central location where it is available
to a large number of investigators who can benefit from its use. Precisely such
an arrangement is proposed for the equipment to be purchased through this award.
