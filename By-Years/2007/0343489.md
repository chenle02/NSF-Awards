This project will enhance to student learning in team environments by providing
students with an awareness of how their individual approaches to learning
impacts their abilities to work together in teams and by regularly reflecting on
barriers to successful teaming through targeted writing exercises, including the
development of team charters and biweekly memos addressing team dynamics issues.
The specific goals of the project are to:

1. Increase student awareness of how individual approaches to learning affect
team dynamics through discussion of Learning Combination Inventory (LCI)
results. 2. Help teams identify potential barriers to effective teaming 3.
Provide students with tools to develop effective teamwork and project management
skills through reflective writing assignments. 4. Develop faculty skills in
facilitating teamwork and student metacognition in the learning process. Results
of this study will be disseminated at the university level through summer second
year of the proposal. Teamwork is an integral part of most engineering programs
and the methods developed in this project can be readily adapted by other
universities.
