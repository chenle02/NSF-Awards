This grant is supporting the planning activity at Santa Clara University which
represents a new approach to interdisciplinary engineering education. The
University is making Service Learning the core through which students at all
levels interact with different disciplines and gain motivation for further study
through understanding the relevance and impact of engineering. Faculty
development and assessment, with the help of an expert from the Psychology
department, will be integrated with the curriculum development effort. The
director of the Arrupe Center for Community-Based Learning has long supported
service-learning efforts in other contexts, building a substantial
infrastructure to support community relationships, and has pledged direct
support of this effort. The activities of the planning year lay the framework
for an expanded program. The program will confront serious challenges in
updating content and delivery to attract, educate, and retain students from an
increasingly diverse high school population. &lt;br/&gt;
