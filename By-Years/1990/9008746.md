The objective of this research is to investigate large-scale "buffer-focusing"
chromatgraphy in which a precisely controlled, internal pH gradient traveling
much more slowly than the fluid velocity is used to simultaneously concentrate
and purify dilute mixtures of biomolecules. The internal pH gradient is
characterized by a low salt concentration, a high buffer capacity, and is
produced using multicomponent mixtures of common amphoteric and non-amphoteric
buffer compounds of defined chemical composition. Each of the buffer compounds
interacts with the column by adsorption or through acid-base reactions. Reliable
methods for producing internal pH gradients (e.g., criteria for selecting buffer
compounds, type of sorbent, starting and final pH, column dimensions, and
particle size) are to be developed using numerical simulations and ancillary
experiments. The use of buffer-focusing chromatography to separate model
mixtures of proteins is also to be investigated theoretically and
experimentally. The results from this work can be used to evaluate buffer-
focusing chromatography as an efficient, gently (i.e. non- denaturing)
alternative to conventional large-scale methods for concentrating and purifying
dilute mixtures of biomolecules.
