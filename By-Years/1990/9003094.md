A theoretical framework to calculate pressure-broadened halfwidths with an
uncertainty of ~ 5% for atmospherically important species will be developed.
Calculations are also expected to yield pressure-induced line shifts. Two
approaches to computing the halfwidth and line shift for water vapor perturbed
by nitrogen or oxygen will be compared with experimental measurements, and the
method that results in the best agreement will be used to generate a database
for atmospherically important transitions of water vapor. Next, the calculations
will be extended to methane perturbed by nitrogen or oxygen. The research is
motivated by the need for increased confidence in remote sensing measurements
and a better determination of the radiative forcings of greenhouse gases. This
investigation will lay the foundation for further calculations of halfwidths and
line shifts for other atmospheric species.
