9728581 Horvath All animals studied to date possess endogenous biological
clocks that mediate biological rhythms. In rats and other mammals, pulsatile
hormone release from the anterior pituitary is essential for normal growth,
metabolism, and reproduction. The interaction between visual, circadian and
neuroendocrine systems underlies rhythmic anterior pituitary hormone secretions,
including prolactin and luteinizing hormone (LH). The suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN) is the critical brain structure underlying biological rhythms and a
monosynaptic pathway between this hypothalamic nuclei and the principle neuronal
populations regulating LH and prolactin release has been documented. Recently,
it has become clear that pure visual signals may directly or indirectly via the
intergeniculate leaflet of the lateral geniculate nucleus influence endocrine
mechanisms and these pathways may be functioning in parallel with the biological
clock that itself is under the influence of light. This indicates a more complex
integration of visual signals into the neuroendocrine hypothalamus than previous
suspected. Dr. Horvath, through a series of elegant neuroanatomical studies,
will determine the morphological relationship between subcortical visual
efferents and hypothalamic neurons responsible for the regulation of endocrine
mechanisms. By using tract tracing methods in combination with degeneration and
light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical approaches, and using
biochemical assays, he will also assess the role of subcortical visual pathways
in the regulation of pituitary gonadotrophs underlying ovulation. The
delineation of the pathways via which visual and circadian signals are
integrated into the neuroendocrine hypothalamus will enhance our understanding
of how rhythmic anterior pituitary hormones secretions are regulated and this is
critical for understanding reproduction and behavior.
