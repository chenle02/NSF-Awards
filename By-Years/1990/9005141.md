Monocotyledons are one of the two main groups of flowering plants. A special
symposium entitled "Systematics and Evolution of the Monocotyledons" was held at
the 1986 meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences. Dr. George
Rogers has created a Proceedings Volume from the seven research articles
produced for this symposium. Dr. Rogers proposes to publish these as a volume in
the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Gardens. The proceedings volume will bring
together several of the most important contributions to our understanding of
this major plant group. The Annals is a widely distributed and highly respected
journal, and publication in this series will ensure wide impact. Students and
researchers will turn to this volume as a milestone in botanical research.
