As the progress in nanotechnology continues, aggressive scaling and
miniaturization of electronic circuits has reached a fundamental limit set by
dissipation. At the same time, dwindling natural resources threaten to increase
the cost of energy sources, and limit energy consumption not just in electronic
devices, but on a much broader scale. In addition, popularity of portable
consumer electronics has put a strain on limited portable energy sources and
small batteries cannot keep pace with increasingly power-hungry gadgets.
Combined, these trends highlight the need for electronic materials and devices
that treat energy in a fundamentally new way and use thermal effects to their
advantage in order to recapture, store, and manipulate thermal energy rather
than treating it as a waste by-product of electronic and other
processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves comprehensive simulation
of coupled electro-thermal and thermoelectric transport in semiconductor
nanostructures. The results of this work allow a fundamental understanding of
non-linear and non-equilibrium electrical and thermal transport in
nanostructures, and enable the design of more energy efficient semiconductor
devices by minimizing dissipation, recovering waste heat through the
thermoelectric Peltier effect, and improving thermal management on the circuit
level by using efficient nanostructured thermoelectrics. In addition, the
investigators explore the design of advanced nanoscale control of heat transfer,
and design nanoscale thermal rectifiers, heat valves, and novel devices based on
using heat storage and transport as an additional state variable in electronic
circuits. The investigators use the nanoHUB and thermalHUB on-line scientific
portals to disseminate results and make this work available to the broader
scientific community, allowing students and researchers to benefit from NSF's
investment into computational science and cyberinfrastructure
