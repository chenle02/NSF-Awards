Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to substitute amino acid residues in
these enzymes, and steady-state and transient kinetics, x-ray crystallography,
and other methods will be used to study these variants. Amino acid residues in
the proton relay system, and the environment of the catalytic zinc, will be
studied. Protein flexibility and hydrogen tunneling will be studied in the liver
enzyme. "Extraneous" structural elements, including the structural zinc loop and
other loops, will be deleted. The origins of the oligomeric structures will be
explored. Fluorescence properties of the horse liver enzyme will be determined
by x-ray crystallography. %%% Alcohol dehydrogenases from horse liver and yeast
have been studied extensively. The objectives of the proposed research are to
answer several outstanding questions about the catalytic mechanism of the
enzyme, the evolution of specificity for substrates and coenzymes, and the role
of the three dimensional structure in enzyme dynamics and catalysis. This
research should increase our understanding of biocatalysis.
