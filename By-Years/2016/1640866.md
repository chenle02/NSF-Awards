Through this project, US Ignite expects to accelerate the development and
adoption of compelling next-generation wireless network technologies that will
transform people's lives, by virtue of the creation of a Wireless Research
Consortium composed of a diverse set of partners in industry, private
foundations, research and education networks, cities and regions, researchers,
venture capitalists, and software developers. The project will culminate in the
national launch of the US Ignite Wireless Research Consortium, which will
include announcements about the National Science Foundation-led deployment,
partner commitments, and proposed long-term governance model of a series of
advanced wireless research initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
Wireless Research Consortium is critical to advancing wireless network knowledge
and understanding, since no such coordinated partnership focused on the support
of long-term research exists at present. The next-generation of wireless
networks is changing the landscape for what networked applications can do. The
proposed partnership anticipates significant impacts when transferring knowledge
among partners from research to practice. Given the groundswell of interest in
next-generation wireless network technologies, US Ignite will extend
partnerships to numerous partners who can, in turn, give access to their diverse
skill sets, expertise, and resources, with a view to share them with NSF-funded
researchers. The current US Ignite management team brings 85 collective years of
academic, industry, and government leadership and start-up experience to the
project, and will leverage this experience to build the Wireless Research
Consortium.
