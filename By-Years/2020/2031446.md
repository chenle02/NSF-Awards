The research team will conduct choice experiments combined with a survey to
determine how the COVID-19 pandemic may be shaping economic preferences. They
also want to determine whether those preferences are correlated with preventive
health actions taken by individuals. The project will include subjects from a
variety of different racial and ethnic groups, to get solid information on the
groups that to date have been especially affected by COVID-19 in the United
States. The project should help us understand whether and how methods developed
for use in behavioral economics and consumer choice can also help us predict the
extent of health promoting behaviors. The results may also give us new insights
into how to best target public health communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
experimental tasks will measure risk tolerance, time preference, altruism,
willingness to contribute to public goods, cooperation, willingness to lie in
self protection, preference for competition, and over/under confidence. Economic
theory suggests that each of these aspects of individual preferences play a role
in determining the extent to which a given individual carries out recommended
health behaviors. Examples of these behaviors are wearing a mask (altruism,
willingness to contribute to public goods), truthfully informing others about
possible exposure (willingness to lie), avoiding crowds and indoor spaces (risk
tolerance, over confidence), and limiting social gatherings today for future
benefits (time preference). Survey methods will be used to measure health
behaviors. The team will use the data to test whether or not economic preference
measurements do indeed predict health behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
