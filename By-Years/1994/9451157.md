9451157 Lightcap A multidisciplinary social science computer laboratory links a
local area network of microcomputer workstations to a campus-wide network of
computer resources. The network has linkages to Internet and provides extensive
storage capacities. The project gives undergraduates social science databases
for independent undergraduate research projects. CD-ROM data resources through
each workstation further widen educational opportunities in the laboratory. The
facility also has dynamic, interactive statistical and simulation applications,
and includes elementary geographical information systems.
