The Theoretical and Compuational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division
will support Kellman in a series of theoretical analyses of the dynamics of
highly excited rotation-vibration spectra of polyatomic molecules. The work will
concentrate in three areas: (1) dynamics of strongly coupled vibrations from
experimental spectra, investigating the relation of spectral patterns to phase
space structure including low-frequency modes, and phase space structure and
bond selective reactivity, (2) work with chaotic systems with many degrees of
freedom including search for dynamical constants of motion and quantum number
assignments, and phase space bifurcation structure and catastrophe maps for
chaotic systems, and (3) determination of molecular potential surfaces from
"bootstrap" fitting of highly excited spectra. %%% Modern laser experiments can
deposit a large amount of energy in molecules, converting them into highly
excited states which are not easily, if at all, describable in the terms that
chemists and physicists have used so successfully for matter in or near its
ground, most relaxed state. Kellman is developing analytical tools to interpret
such experiments and the highly complex or chaotic states that they produce.
There are possible practical consequences in terms of the use of laser
excitation to affect selected bonds in a molecule, but the principle purpose is
to understand more fully the nature of highly excited molecular matter.
