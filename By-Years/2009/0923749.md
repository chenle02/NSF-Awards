This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
novel "fluorescent emissive projection" (FEP) display system, which will turn a
glass window or windshield into a full color, high contrast electronic display
panel, without blocking the view through the glass. The team will develop novel
display engines as well as quantum dots based display materials while also
integrating these key components into a full color 40 inch size FEP display
prototype. The reliability and regulatory concerns for commercial applications
will be investigated in Phase II.

If successful this innovative display-on-glass technology will create a broad
spectrum of commercial applications with significant market sizes and economic
benefits. Success of this project could enable a mass deployment of the display
technology in commercial advertising places and automobiles. The new display
technology will be applied broadly for many commercial applications, such as the
display on store front glass windows or cabinets to attract consumers into
stores. It will present real-time commercials on glass windows, without blocking
the view into the store and its displayed merchandises. Given the huge number of
glass windows and windshields where the technology can be implemented, it has
very significant economic impacts.
