*** 9612214 Indeck This research program will construct a novel theory of
innovation through an application of current cognitive models of creativity and
an application of institutional economics. Cognitive science has posited certain
recurring skills in unusually creative people. Institutional economics teaches
that many non-technical factors influence innovation, product choice and
marketability. Although cognitive scientists and institutional economists have
independently examined how innovation is fostered or constrained, this project
will combine these disciplines for the first time in a study of the actual
process of technical innovation in the magnetic storage industry. A theory will
be developed to describe this innovation that is expected to be valuable to
other high technology industries such as semiconductors, electronics and
pharmaceuticals to enhance the effectiveness of their innovation process. This
research program will foster innovation in the magnetic storage industry that
has been defined by the federal government as crucial to US international
economic competitiveness. This industry that has been highly successful in the
face of worldwide competition, should benefit substantially from these process
enhancements. ***
