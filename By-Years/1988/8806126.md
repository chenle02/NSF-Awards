Funds for the purchase of a multichannel signal processor and an
electromechanical shaker are granted. The equipment is required for projects
researching the assessment of highway bridge structural integrity from analysis
of the vibration signatures; the dynamics of machine tools undergoing rapid
change in configuration; the vibrations of earthquake - resistant buildings;
aeroelastic testing of bridge decks; and a set of small shaker table studies.
Each of these projects requires the multichannel signal processing capability of
the requested equipment. The electromechanical shaker will serve as an
excitation mechanism and as a small shaker table. The successful completion of
these projects could have a significant impact on the maintenance of the
nation's highway infrastructure and could produce new machine tool technologies.
