Laser based techniques for producing and manipulating ultra- cold atoms are
used to study basic properties of collisional interactions of ultra-cold atoms
immersed in intense light fields; and to study the self-organizing properties of
atoms to form very small scale structures. These new techniques are used to
create, and focus into 100 nm diameter spots, two ultra-cold beams of sodium
atoms. These will be used in a crossed beam configuration in high vacuum to
study collision cross sections at very low relative velocities in a regime where
conventional collision theory does not apply. In the final two years of this
five year Presidential Young Investigator program, light pressure forces on
atoms of interest to the semiconductor industry will be studied, including use
of these techniques to fabricate structures on the 100nm scale with tailored
transport properties.
