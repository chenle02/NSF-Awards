Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most important tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry
at Arizona State University will use this award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. Included
among the areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition
are the following: 1) Transition metal complexes 2) Electron and energy transfer
in photosynthetic bacteria 3) Photochemistry of pyrimidine dimers 4) Synthesis
and reactions of iron acyls derived from optically active amino acids 5)
Structure and function of toxic proteins 6) NMR investigations of of meteoritic
macromolecular carbon 7) Hydroxy polyethers as model polysaccharides 8) Metal-
ammonia-intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides 9) High surface area
silica catalyst supports
