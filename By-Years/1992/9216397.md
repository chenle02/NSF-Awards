The principal investigator will extend his 1967 theory of wind generation of
ocean surface waves by including turbulent Reynolds stresses associated with the
air flow explicitly in the model. Several parameterizations of the air turbulene
effects will be tested to provide insight and context to recent observational
and modeling investigations of ocean waves.
