9614683 Dilles Copper (Cu) and molybdenum (Mo) ore deposits can be formed as
products of giant magmatic-hydrothermal systems centered on granitic porphyry
intrusions. Hydrothermal wall-rock alteration, vein formation, and ore sulfide
precipitation form as the result of fracture-focused degassing or granitic
batholiths to produce aqueous fluids containing dissolved salts, metals, sulfur,
and acids. The current models for mineralization of this type need to be re-
evaluated based on recent research results. This proposal has as a primary goal
to improve the understanding of porphyry-type base metal deposits by using an
integrated geochemical study that focuses on samples derived from drill cores
that reached deep portions of the giant Butte deposit. These data together with
the information that is currently available for higher levels of the deposit,
should provide an exceptional three-dimensional view of this huge, world-class,
base metal hydrothermal system.
