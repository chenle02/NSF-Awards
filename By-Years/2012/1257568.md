Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral for plants, and the humans and animals that
consume plants. Iron deficiency hinders crop production on neutral-to-alkaline
soils, which occur on approximately 30% of the earth. One of the most important
unanswered questions in the plant Fe nutrition field is, "How do plants sense
and respond to Fe status?" Iron deficient Arabidopsis thaliana and other plant
species accumulate additional copper (Cu) in leaves. The investigators
hypothesize that this Cu accumulation is a specific Fe deficiency response that
allows the plant to use Cu containing proteins in place of Fe containing
proteins. The investigators will use a genetic mapping approach to identify key
components that carry out or control this Cu uptake activity. Additionally, the
investigators hypothesize that specific molecules called microRNAs are key
mediators in the plant's ability to switch from Fe containing proteins to Cu
containing proteins. This will be tested by measuring gene expression data in
wild-type and certain mutant plants. It is anticipated that certain genes that
encode Cu containing proteins are regulated directly by plant Fe status. The
major long-term goal of this research is to understand mechanisms of plant Fe
accumulation in optimal and adverse environments. In a broader sense, this
information could be used to develop crop varieties with increased Fe
concentrations in edible portions or varieties that are more productive under
low Fe conditions. This project will provide training activities for one
postdoctoral scientist, one graduate student, one undergraduate student, and one
high school student in the Young Nebraska Scientist program. Additionally,
educational videos or plants science lessons will be produced and made available
to the public on the Plant and Soil Sciences eLibrary
(http://plantandsoil.unl.edu).
