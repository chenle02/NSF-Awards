Michael Heinekey, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for
continued explorations of metal-dihydrogen interactions or metal-alkane
interactions. He uses unique NMR techniques including photolysis of precursors
in the NMR probe; very low temperature NMR, exchange coupling and tritium NMR to
explore the nature of these weak bonds. Heinekey also studies elongated
dihydrogen complexes which display novel vibrational and dynamic properties that
may provide a "snapshot" of an H-H bond rupture process.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education and training of future scientists and the
development of new NMR methods are major impacts of this work. The activation of
hydrogen is a critical reaction biologically (hydrogenase enzymes) and
industrially. By better understanding how various metal species interact with
hydrogen, better homogeneous catalysts and processes may be designed.&lt;br/&gt;
