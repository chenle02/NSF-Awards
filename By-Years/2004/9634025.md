9634025 Branca This fifty-seven month Local Systemic Change in Mathematics
(LSCM) project, which builds on and joins the Middle Grades Mathematics
Renaissance and the California Mathematics Project, provides teacher enhancement
for 2,000 teachers of mathematics in grades K-12 in 16 clusters in four regions
of California. The cluster, defined by a high school and its feeder middle and
elementary schools, is the unit of participation in the project. From each
school in the cluster, each secondary teacher of mathematics receives a minimum
of 130 hours of professional development over the life of the project and each
elementary teacher receives a minimum of 100 hours. Algebra -- algebra for all,
algebraic thinking throughout the K-12 curriculum -- is the center of the
mathematical work. As districts make their adoption decisions from a defined
menu of high quality instructional materials (both NSF-supported and others),
the project assists teachers in the implementation of comprehensive materials.
This initiative will develop a model for K-12 articulation and will inform
educators on the process of articulating a coherent K-12 program of professional
development and instruction. Linkages are forged among schools engaged in
mathematics reform, California Mathematics Project (CMP) sites, and university
mathematicians. Estimated cost-sharing from CMP, local school districts, and the
San Diego University Foundation is approximately $ 3.86 million.
