This award is concerned with research into the internal structure and
representation theory of certain associative algebras that are of current
interest within mathematical physics and Lie representation theory, namely
quantum groups and enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras. The quantum groups
to be studied are the quantized coordinate rings of algebraic groups; the Lie
superalgebras which will be considered are the classical simple and solvable
ones. The focus throughout will be on prime and primitive ideal theory, and the
principle methods involve new induction techniques for ring extensions. Quantum
groups are a new area of research for both mathematicians and physicists. On the
mathematical side, it combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,
algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to physicists
working on conformal quantum field theory.
