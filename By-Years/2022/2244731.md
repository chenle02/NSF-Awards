The National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (NOSAMS) was
established to provide analyses of 14C at natural levels. NOSAMS plays an
important role in the oceanographic community by generating high accuracy, high
precision 14C data in a timely manner for seawater, groundwater, organic carbon
(OC), carbonates, sediments, individual compounds, and other materials. The
three-pronged mission of NOSAMS is to make high quality radiocarbon measurements
accessible to the ocean sciences community, to continuously improve and develop
new measurement capabilities, and to serve as an educational and outreach
resource. NOSAMS provides significant training opportunities for early career
scientists, and especially graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
Graduates are offered internships that will lead to experience gained from
running their own samples, and publication of the results. Postdocs will be
supported for 2-year terms through the award, as well as a WHOI postdoc at no
cost to this award. The PIs plan to hold a series of one-day short courses every
year at either OSM or AGU Fall meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOSAMS is unique
in offering comprehensive radiocarbon services and expertise to a diverse
community of users. NOSAMS has provided data that is critical to understanding
geophysical process in the earth's surface environment, for example past and
present ocean circulation, and biogeochemical cycling of carbon. Water samples
collected as part of two major NSF-funded experiments known as the Climate
Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) and Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic
Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) have comprised a significant fraction of
samples analyzed by NOSAMS to date. NOSAMS will continue to provide 14C analysis
for the oceanographic community for the next five years and will continue to
research new methods for 14C dating. Over the next five years NOSAMS plans to
capitalize on the new capabilities of the recently installed MIni CArbon DAting
System (MICADAS) and to streamline operations by increasing automation. The
hybrid gas interfaces of the MICADAS offer new opportunities for rapid
measurements, new procedures, and new sample types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
