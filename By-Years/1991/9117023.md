This award will support the participation of ten U.S. participants in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on New Approaches to Developmental Endocrinology, to be held
Janaury 11-15, 1993 in Honolulu. The co-organizers are Professor Christopher
Brown, Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, and Professor Akihisa Urano, Ocean
Research Institute, University of Tokyo. The seminar will address the state of
understanding of the involvement of hormones in the regulation of development.
Participants will include biologists working with a wide range of organisms:
insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Recent indications that
signals from the endocrine system of the developing embryo are supplemented by
hormones of maternal origin has required some revision of prior thinking on this
subject. Researchers in the United States and Japan have figured importantly in
this research. The "new approaches" in the seminar refer to both new concepts in
the endocrinology of development and the application of new techniques. The
seminar will provide a form for integrating recent findings and increasing the
collaboration among scientists in the two countries.
