9512230 Huber This proposal requests equipment to upgrade the existing
Microfabrication laboratory facility at the university of Utah, which is
operated by the College of Engineering and used by 5 departments. The laboratory
was created in 1977-8 by a grant from the HEDCO Foundation and UU institutional
funds with further help from the DoE in the late 80's to improve the facilities
and, more recently, from the Whitaker Foundation in the area of MEMs technology.
A variety of fabrication equipment is requested, such as a back-side' mask
aligner, flip-chip' aligner/bonder, furnaces, sputtering system, RTA system,
SPM, and general repair/modifications to existing process equipment. The focus
of the research is with sensors for medical applications which involves MEMS
technology. ***
