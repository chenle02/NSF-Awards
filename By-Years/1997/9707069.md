Abstract ATM-9707069 Wallace John M. University of Washington Title: Finger
Prints of Antropogenic and Natural Climate Variability Climate model simulations
predict a change in the mean state of the climate due to anthropogenic changes
but uncertainties remain as to what part of the observed warming can be
attributed to this anthropogenic influence. A combined application of two
different methods to reduce uncertainty associated with estimates of the climate
change signal is proposed here. By this technique it is hoped to make more
reliable estimates of the magnitude of the anthropogenic signal in the present
climate record.
