This research is concerned with noncommutative algebra, particularly the theory
of noncommutative noetherian rings and its applications to other areas of
mathematics. The principal investigator will study the abstract properties of
nontrivial examples and their interrelationship with the theory of quantum
groups. He will also consider the skew group ring of a finite group acting on a
polynomial ring to determine when the category of projective modules over such a
ring satisfies cancellation. The postdoctoral associate will study the stable
rank of enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras. A ring is an algebraic
object having both an addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the
additive operation satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation
is not required to do so. The study of noncommutative rings has become an
important part of algebra because of its increasing significance to other
branches of mathematics and physics.
