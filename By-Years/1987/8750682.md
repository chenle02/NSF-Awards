The Carleton College Geology Department will purchase a semi- automated x-ray
diffraction unit. The diffractometer is needed by the Geology Department to
teach modern x-ray techniques in mineralogy, soils, and advanced petrology
courses. These classes will teach x-ray theory and practice in lectures and
laboratory exercises. Virtually all geology majors take at least one of these
classes. The diffractometer is also needed for student research projects,
including senior integrative exercises required of each major.
