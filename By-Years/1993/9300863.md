The goal of the project is to carry out some high precision calculations on
three and four electron atoms. The specific objectives are to 1) resolve a
disagreement between theory and experiment on the 2s-2p transition in Li, 2) to
compute the energy of the Be atom to 1> Hartree or better, 3) to get a precision
lower bound on the non-relativistic energy of Li and 4) to determine the
specific mass shifts and isotope shifts for several states of Li and Be.
