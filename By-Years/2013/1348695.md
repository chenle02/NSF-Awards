The Teaching Channel is hosting two day workshop/colloquium at Northwestern
University focused on the use of video and on line learning in support of the
College and CAREER Readiness Standards. The three research questions are: 1) How
can these tools increase discussion, inquiry and reporting of teacher progress
on the standards through data sharing and writing? (2) What research tools can
be deployed to determine the efficacy of these tools and their potential for
scale? and (3) How can video and on line professional development tools best
support teachers in a time of increasing accountability and change?

The outcomes of the workshop include research briefs and a summary paper. These
will be posted on the Teaching Channel resource cite.
