The Moving Image Gateway is a combination Collections and Services project. The
Services aspect is developing a web portal for moving images that combines an
archives directory database with a union catalog to provide access to the
world's moving image collections. The Collection aspect involves opening the
archives of moving images found in the Library of Congress, Cable News Network,
National Geographic Television, National Library of Medicine, Oregon Health and
Sciences University, ResearchChannel, and the Smithsonian Institution to STEM
students, educators, and researchers as well as the general public. Moving image
materials that are being selected from these archives represent a wide array of
science disciplines and a wealth of materials that support all levels of
education from K-12 through university, postgraduate and continuing
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Moving Image Gateway is a result of prior
collaboration between the Association of Moving Image Archives and the Library
of Congress and is bringing a very flexible but standardized metadata
architecture to these diverse resources so that moving images are being
integrated into the information mainstream. The Moving Image Gateway is offering
several innovative components, including a searchable directory of international
moving image archives that will identify the document and generate a dynamic web
page for each archive and a union catalog that supports portals for customized
end user searching. An NSDL portal specifically for science materials is being
developed as well as an innovative schema-independent union catalog architecture
that provides export and display in different schemas depending on the portal
used for searching. This project is allowing the participating organizations to
collaborate in describing, preserving, and digitizing these unique cultural
resources.&lt;br/&gt;
