The American Meteorological Society (AMS), with the support of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), and National Science Foundation (NSF), has for many years
been able to support and provide its subscriptions of our "Monthly Weather
Review," "Journal of Climate," and "Weather and Forecasting" to less developed
countries. Feedback from participants in the program has been extremely
positive. There is little doubt that these journals are used to the utmost
advantage by both scientists and professionals alike. It is essential that we
continue our work with developing countries so that their knowledge of
scientific developments is up-to-date.
