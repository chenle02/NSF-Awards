Standards for data exchange are critical to the development of any field. They
enable researchers and practitioners to exchange information reliably, apply a
variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce scientific results. This is a
project to support a workshop on this topic in October, 2015 to be held in Salt
Lake City, Utah. The meeting is organized by the COmputational MOdeling in
BIology NEtwork (COMBINE), which was created in 2010 to organize standardization
efforts for systems biology. The request if for participant costs to enable
students and junior scientist attend the meeting. They will learn will learn
valuable lessons in the importance of research and tool standardization and the
impact of a community-wide effort. This effort is essential for areas of systems
and synthetic biology and translational research where to be seamless.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meetings will specifically explore data exchange
standards for biology to enable researchers and practitioners to exchange
information reliably, apply a variety of tools to their problems, and reproduce
scientific results. The discussion will center, among others, on the systems
biology markup language (SBML) for mathematical modeling, the biological
pathways exchange language (BioPaX) for describing pathways, the systems biology
graphical notation (SBGN) for visual representations, and the synthetic biology
open language(SBOL) for describing biological designs. While synthetic biology
data exchange has many unique requirements, there are also many overlapping
goals such as the need to construct mathematical models, describe pathways, and
provide visual representations. Therefore, it is highly beneficial to join these
efforts, such that, the synthetic biology community can leverage existing
standards enabling the sharing of tools and other infrastructure. Likewise, the
other communities will benefit from renewed discussions around data exchange and
synthetic biology's unique process of forward engineering living systems.
