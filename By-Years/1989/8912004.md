The narrowness of the neovolcanic zone at MORs and the variations in ridge
crest topography are poorly understood. It is generally agreed that pressure-
release melting at depths between 20 and 100 km occurs beneath ridge crests and
that the melt is segregated from the mantle and rises because of density
differences to form the ocean crust. Recently acquired seismic data suggest that
the zone of upwelling beneath ridges is much narrower than theoretical models
predict. The observed topographic highs at fast-spreading ridges and the lows at
slow-spreading ridges are also not predicted by the models. The PI has developed
a new model wherein mantle viscosity is temperature dependent and is coupled to
the fraction of melt present. This produces a narrow upwelling zone in better
agreement with observations. He proposes to run through a large number of
calculations to determine the range of conditions that produce narrow upwelling
and melting below the ridge, looking in particular at the effects of varying the
permeability, and how the model affects topography.
