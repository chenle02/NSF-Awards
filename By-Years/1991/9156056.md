This project institutes a three-year visiting professorship program in gender
and the sciences--which includes the biological and physical sciences,
mathematics, engineering, and provides semester-long visiting professorships,
faculty-mentee fellowships, monthly faculty development seminars for a semester
in nine science departments, and the development or revision of 36 introductory
science courses affecting close to 4,000 undergraduate students during the
initial funding period and thousands more within the next few years. The purpose
of this project is to address the increasing shortage in scientific
professionals by reaching, in their early college years, the "second tier"--
defined by Sheila Tobias as that group of students who, though qualified to do
science, routinely choose another major. The University of Wisconsin System
Women's Studies Consortium focuses on two aspects of this problem: 1) the
underrepresentation of the second tier, in general, and women and minorities, in
particular, in scientific and technical fields; and 2) the factors--specifically
the content, pedagogy, and climate--in introductory science courses which
discourage the "second tier" from pursuing science majors. This project design
is founded on the assumption that incorporation of the new scholarship about
gender in the scientific canon and curriculum will improve the quality of the
introductory courses which will, in turn, lead to the recruitment of more women,
minorities, and others in the second tier to scientific education and careers.
