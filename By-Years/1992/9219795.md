PIs will examine evolution of co-occurring lineages of benthic marine
invertebrates from the well-studied Middle Devonian Hamilton and Tully groups,
to determine how ecology influences rate and style of evolution. Morphometrics
of selected fauna will establish degree of change of lineages within constrained
biofacies through several transgressive/regressive cycles. Community structure
will be examined to test the degree of community stability. The origin,
stability and demise of the Hamilton-Tully fauna will be examined as a case
study of apparently coordinated or community-level stasis, leading to a general
model for the dynamics of ancient marine benthic communities. PIs will also
produce a photo atlas.
