Autonomous sensing/actuation applications will use sensors to observe the world
around them, process the data they gather to reach conclusions and make
decisions, and use actuators to affect the world on the basis of those
decisions, all potentially without any human involvement. These applications
significantly extend the scope of today's sensor networks, which are used
primarily to ease data collection for offline analysis by humans. The goal of
this project is to design and build a data-centric software infrastructure and
pertinent abstractions, mechanisms and protocols that significantly simplify the
structuring and implementation of robust and efficient autonomous
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system enables developers to easily
specify application-specific data acquisition, processing, dissemination, and
actuation logic using a flexible set of high-level computational primitives. The
system translates these global specifications to code and protocols executable
by individual network nodes and then automatically distributes and executes them
reliably and efficiently using a novel set of algorithms. The system can employ
both generic and application-specific optimization techniques to improve its
operation, as these specifications are logical and do not indicate where and how
execution should take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the
proposal include significant graduate and undergraduate course development, the
recruitment of undergraduates into research, integration of research and
teaching through graduate courses, introduction of state-of-the-art research
ideas into undergraduate courses, public dissemination of educational materials
and research results, and development of publicly-accessible tools and
infrastructures that facilitate learning, discovery, innovation, and solutions
to real
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.brown.edu/~ugur/spawn_project.html
