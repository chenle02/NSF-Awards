The mathematical work supported by this grant lies in the area of systems of
partial differential equations. More specifically, boundary value problems in
domains with nonsmooth boundaries for elliptic and parabolic systems and higher
order equations will be investigated. In addition work on homogenization will be
carried out. One of the particular problems of interest involves elliptic
systems of elastostatics and parabolic systems with boundary data in the
Lebesgue spaces. It is not known, in dimension four and greater, what range of
power norms of boundary data will yield solutions. Partial differential
equations form the backbone of mathematical modeling in the physical sciences.
Phenomena which involve continuous change such as that seen in motion, materials
and energy are known to obey certain general laws which are expressible in terms
of the interactions and relationships between partial derivatives. The key role
of mathematics is not to state the relationships, but rather, to extract
qualitative and quantitative meaning from them.
