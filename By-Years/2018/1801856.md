The increasing scale and complexity of parallel systems present enormous
challenges to parallel applications. One such challenge is the integration and
balancing of execution time, power, and resilience for parallel applications.
The MuMMI_R project seeks to advance the scientific understanding of the
interdependence among power, execution time, and resilience for various
application-system configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MuMMI_R research
aims to develop effective techniques for quantifying the complicated tradeoffs
among execution time, power, and resilience, and to provide a tuning mechanism
for user-defined metrics. Toward this goal, the research focuses on three
interrelated research thrusts: (1) experimental research to conduct extensive
experiments of a suite of representative application under different resilience
strategies on various parallel architectures, (2) application-level co-modeling
to develop analytical models and colored Petri net based simulation for
quantifying the correlations and tradeoffs between execution time, power, and
resilience, and (3) model-based analysis to examine the tradeoffs among
resilience, execution time, and power for different application-system
configurations, and to tune application implementations for a user-defined
target metric on current and future systems. The resulting framework, MuMMI_R,
will provide valuable insights into application-system interactions and aid in
the design of efficient parallel applications (with respect to execution time,
power requirements, and resilience), runtime systems, and computer
architectures. The broader impacts include training of undergraduate and
graduate students and the participation in programs such as REUs, CREU, and DREU
to increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups in the
project.
