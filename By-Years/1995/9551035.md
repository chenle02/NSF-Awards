Miami is a dynamic, multicultural city at the gateway of the United States,
Europe, and Latin America, a characteristic that has created the largest
manufacturing region in Florida. The school, one of the nation's three Carnegie
II doctoral-granting universities with more than 50 percent minority students,
is continuously updating its curriculum to teach the constantly changing
knowledge base of modern engineering. In addition, the school graduates more
Hispanic engineers than any other institution in the nation, and more than 60
percent of its engineering graduates continue on to graduate programs. This
project enhances the current curriculum with signal processing applications in
mechanical engineering to introduce conventional mechanical engineering students
to system identification, failure prediction, and nondestructive testing. These
areas enhance the instrumentation and electromechanical system design skills of
our students. Eleven new experiments have been added to the curriculum to open
one new course and to improve six existing courses. Students use state-of-the-
art precise measurement equipment in laboratories to learn the basics of
monitoring and analysis techniques. The experiments were prepared with the
assistance of a select group of students. Equipment purchased for this project
is used for various contracts (with local industry and federal agencies) as part
of undergraduate research projects. These undergraduate student activities
generate funding to support maintenance expenses and future enhancement. The
student activities associated with this project are targeted towards juniors and
seniors.
