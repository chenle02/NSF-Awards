This award supports basic research in theoretical nuclear physics. The research
deals with the relativistic treatment of nuclear reactions which is required by
the new and forth coming national experimental facilities. The work will
investigate the nuclear optical model and its extension to coupled-channels
treatments of nuclear reactions. Particular attention will be made on
determining spin-observables within the relativistic framework.
