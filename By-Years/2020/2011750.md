Nontechnical Description: The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center
(MRSEC) at Princeton University is a thriving research center and educational
outreach resource that serves the campus, local community, and the greater mid-
Atlantic region. The research is focused on two key fundamental areas of science
that underlies creating new quantum technologies and biology-inspired materials.
The development of topological quantum materials is crucial for catalyzing next-
generation quantum technologies for sensing, computing, and communicating. The
application of such technologies will have wide-ranging implications for
national security, industrial competitiveness, and workforce development for
decades to come. This MRSEC's research will lay the foundations of the field of
living materials science by bridging materials science and biology or soft
matter. Establishing this new field will lead to advances in biotechnology, as
well as many other industries reliant on nanotechnology using polymers, gels,
colloids, biofilms, and other soft materials. Training the next generation of
world-class materials scientists, and sharing the excitement of their research
with the broader community are fundamental pillars of this MRSEC’s mission. The
inclusion of underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities
is a key priority embedded in all its research, education and outreach
activities. Moreover, the Princeton MRSEC leverages its substantial
institutional resources and facilities to encourage collaborations with the
broader research community, including industrial partners who not only provide
stakeholder insights, but also opportunities for workforce development beyond
academia. Outreach activities are popular and meaningful opportunities to engage
the general public, school teachers, and students of all ages, and spark their
enthusiasm and appreciation for materials science in the world around
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The unique research underway
at the Princeton MRSEC addresses some of the most exciting topics posed by the
NSF’s Big Ideas. The IRG-1 team is focused on uncovering novel electronic
effects in a wide range of new quantum materials, from spin liquid systems, to
novel 2-D systems and their twisted stacks, and various superconducting and non-
symmorphic materials. The team searches for and synthesizes new topological
materials guided by the application of machine learning techniques combined with
topological quantum chemistry — taking on the NSF’s Big Idea “The Quantum Leap.”
The IRG-2 team is uncovering new insights into how cells use macromolecules to
function, while also using these insights toward the design of new responsive
materials systems with highly tunable properties. Their research is helping to
lay the foundation for a new field of “living” materials science at the
interface of biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics — addressing the NSF’s
Big Ideas “The Rules of Life” and "NSF2026".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
