Abstract

Current methods for predicting the dynamic behavior of the milling process are
limited because they do not provide combined stability and accuracy information.
Therefore, the selection of machining parameters is commonly based upon limited
information or experience. The result is unnecessary part errors that are
created from tool vibrations. These errors are a limiting factor when producing
precision components (e.g. thin wall structures and miniature components).

Tool vibrations impose severe limitations on industrial capability: 1) reduced
accuracy; 2) a poor surface finish; and 3) increased costs which are linked to
instability. Although research studies target these limitations for conventional
size tools, the differences and role of dynamics at miniature levels has
remained virtually unstudied. This research seeks to develop analysis and
sensing methods for conventional to miniature milling dynamics; these
developments will enable Smart Machine Tools that account for the effects of
vibration. Dynamical system analysis and modeling efforts provide the crucial
first steps for integrating control strategies into smart machines.

This research seeks to advance industrial capability for conventional to
miniature machining applications, develop new capabilities for monitoring
rotating shaft motions, and provide advances in miniature part production (e.g.
small medical devices and MEMS). Outreach and recruiting efforts focus on K-12
students and undergraduate students, particularly from traditionally
underrepresented groups, through: 1) developing a "So you want to be an
engineer?" outreach program with a hands-on children's learning museum; 2) two
existing UF outreach programs. Furthermore, this research develops tools that
enhance the infrastructure for future research and seeks to enable the
industrial application of miniature machining dynamics.
