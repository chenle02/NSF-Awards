Learning algorithms aim to solve dynamic optimization problems in which the
decision maker has limited or no prior information about either a part of or the
entire system structure. Indeed, in many applications, the system is so complex
that it may not be possible to lay out an exact theoretical model with all
system parameters known in advance. In these settings, the decision maker needs
to learn such information during the decision making process, e.g., by
extracting information from the collected data, to design algorithms for
improved system performance. This view of optimization as a dynamic learning
process has become prominent in recent years and has led to some promising
results. This research will develop efficient data-driven learning algorithms
for dynamic operations optimization problems in supply chain management. It will
be accomplished by incorporating and extending ideas and techniques from machine
learning and stochastic optimization, and the effectiveness of the algorithms
will be measured by regret, defined as its average loss (increment) in profit
(cost) per unit time compared with a clairvoyant who has complete information
about the underlying system structure. This project involves several disciplines
such as manufacturing, computing, operations research, and business analytics,
and the multidisciplinary approach will encourage participation from under-
represented groups and positively impact graduate and undergraduate
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Efficient data-driven algorithms
will be developed for several classes of dynamic operations optimization
problems, including multi-product dynamic inventory control with stockout
substitutions, multi-product pricing and inventory control under customer choice
models, inventory and pricing optimization under changing and seasonal
environments, dynamic optimization in competitive environments, dynamic
inventory control and pricing with reference point effect, and dynamic joint
operations and marketing decision making. The research integrates cutting-edge
knowledge and ideas from various areas, such as statistics, game theory, machine
learning, operations research, and behavioral sciences, and it will lead to
efficient learning algorithms that perform well both theoretically and
empirically. With the increasing availability of data in companies, the research
from this project will help them better utilize data for intelligent pricing and
inventory decisions, and increase revenue and minimize cost.
