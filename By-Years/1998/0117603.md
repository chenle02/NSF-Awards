Neurons communicate with each other through chemical substances,
neurotransmitters. Glutamate is the predominant fast excitatory neurotransmitter
in the central nervous system (CNS) that is secreted by some neurons and
activates other neurons. A decreased level of glutamate activity can be found in
the CNS during embryonic development and during some pathological conditions.
Recent studies indicate that during a long-term decrease in glutamate activity,
the activity of another less predominant excitatory neurotransmitter,
acetylcholine (ACh), is dramatically increased. It was hypothesized that in the
absence of glutamate, ACh plays the role of the major excitatory
neurotransmitter in some regions of the CNS. However, the mechanisms that
increase ACh activity when glutamate activity is decreased have not yet been
studied. They will be studied in the proposed research. Using neuronal cultures
obtained from the hypothalamic region of the brain, two hypotheses will be
tested. The first hypothesis is that during a decrease in glutamate activity
neurons that secrete glutamate change their phenotype and begin to secrete ACh.
The second hypothesis is that the change in phenotype is due to the decrease in
Ca2+ influx to the neurons and the inactivation of certain intracellular Ca2+
signaling pathways. Since glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in
the CNS and is involved in many functions of the brain, it is very important to
know the mechanisms that regulate the functions of neuronal networks when
glutamate activity is decreased. Increased ACh transmission is likely one of
such mechanisms. This project addresses the investigation of the fundamental
mechanisms of neuronal plasticity and the regulation of neuronal activity that
can take place in neuronal circuits during a decrease in glutamate excitation.
