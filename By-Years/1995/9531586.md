95-31586 A'Hearn Dr. A'Hearn and his Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Timothy A.
Livengood, will carry out ground-based thermal infrared (IR) observations of
Jupiter and its environment, supporting and complementing an international
ultraviolet (UV) observing program. Dr. Livengood is one of the two principal
investigators of the international UV observing program. Both the IR and UV
efforts will run in parallel with and complement the observations of Jupiter by
NASA's Galileo mission, which is presently orbiting the planet and obtaining
data. The ground-based thermal IR observations will be carried out with the
thermal-infrared imaging camera at the European Southern Observatory. The
wavelengths of the observations are chosen to coincide with emissions from a
range of hydrocarbons. The objective is to understand better the auroral
activity in the Jovian System, the transfer of material from Jupiter's satellite
Io to the plasma torus surrounding Jupiter, energization of the torus plasma,
seasonal response and photochemistry in the planet's stratosphere, and
energization of day glow emission. ***
