Acute Renal Failure complicates 5% of all medical and surgical hospital
admissions in the United States, but not all hospitals provide acute dialysis.
Low cost portable systems will allow more hospitals to provide these emergency
treatments. The proposed project aims to develop a portable hemodialysis system
for acute renal replacement therapy that clears toxins at rates required for
human treatments. The team intends to enter the market place by introducing a
small format portable dialysis enabled by highly efficient silicon nanomembranes
applied to ambulatory dialysis and mobile home dialysis analysis.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High membrane permeability is the key to creating a small-
format hemodialysis device. Simply, the greater the efficiency of a membrane in
clearing toxins, the less membrane area is necessary to achieve a given
clearance and the smaller the device format required for clearance. The team has
introduced a new class of membrane - ultrathin porous nanocrystalline silicon
(pnc-Si). This membrane material is highly manufacturable with pore size control
(5 nm to 100 nm), molecular scale thinness (&lt;50 nm), and enough strength to
support an atmosphere or more of differential pressure. Because of the
molecular-scale thinness, both small molecule diffusion and hydraulic
permeability are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher with pnc-Si than conventional
dialysis membranes. The proposed membranes are also orders of magnitude more
permeable than 'nanoslot' membranes reported in the literature as having benefit
for an implantable hemodialysis system. The team has also shown that the silicon
nanomembranes have the ability to separate species that differ by only a few
nanometers in size and specifically separate molecules middle weight protein
toxins from serum albumin as required in hemodialysis.
