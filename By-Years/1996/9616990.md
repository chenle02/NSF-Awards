Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies: The Portal Project The
Education Development Center, Inc. has been awarded $684.260 for a 24-month
period to develop computational tools, with access to World Wide Web resources,
to support effective learning and integration of computational processes with
real-world research problems. This software consists of a suite of computer-
based, Web-enabled programs for systematically documenting, examining, and
offering feedback on students' project work. The goals of the project are: (1)
to develop the Portal Tools; (2) to implement the tools in up to 70 schools in
five states; and (3) to evaluate the impact of the tools on student learning,
through case studies and analysis of student presentations and process
documents.
