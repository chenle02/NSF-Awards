9507157 Gasser The ovules of higher plants play a central role in plant
reproduction. In addition, because ovules are the precursors to seeds, ovule
development is a critical component of crop productivity. Ovule development
includes processes which typify development in all multicellular organisms and
can be used as a model for studying fundamental mechanisms regulating
morphogenesis and tissue differentiation in all organisms. Dr. Gasser will use
Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism for elucidation of the genetic pathway
regulating ovule development. The primary tool in this analysis will be a set of
mutants with defects in genes which regulate this process. He has already
isolated five such mutants with specific lesions in ovule development and will
continue to add to this set through ongoing mutant screens. He will determine
the specific phenotypic effects of these mutations and will characterize their
interactions through epistatic analyses. The results of these studies will allow
identification of critical regulatory steps in ovule morphogenesis and will
enable the construction of models of the regulatory pathway governing ovule
development. Completion of the proposed research will significantly contribute
to our knowledge of regulation of reproductive development in higher plants and
to a general understanding of genetic control of morphogenesis and histogenesis
that can be applicable to all organisms. ***
