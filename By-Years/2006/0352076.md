This project explores the feasibility of an innovative new on-line analysis
method for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their oxidation products. In a
collaborative project between investigators at University of California - Davis
and University of North Carolina an atmospheric sampling glow-discharge
ionization/quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (ASGDI/QITMS) will be modified
then challenged in a number of laboratory experiments to quantify sensitivity to
and selectivity of VOCs and oxygenated VOCs at levels representative of the
ambient natural atmosphere. The broader impact of this project involves
demonstration of a potentially innovative new technique for selective
measurement of a variety of critically important compounds playing key roles in
ambient photooxidation cycles; ozone and secondary aerosol formation; human
health and habitability; and climate. The full-time directed research work of a
graduate student is supported by the project.
