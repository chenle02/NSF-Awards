Characterization of Water Deficit Effects on Chloroplast Photosynthetic
Potential: This research continues the characterization of how water deficits in
leaves inhibit chloroplast photosynthetic potential and proposes to identify
endogenous cellular mechanisms that modulate the severity of this inhibition.
The chloroplast response in vitro to dehydrating external osmotic potentials and
in situ to leaf water deficits will be examined. The information obtained from
this research should increase our understanding of the factors involved in non-
stomatal-mediated water deficit effects on photosynthesis. Non-stomatal effects
appear to be the major limiting effects on crop growth under- water stress
conditions.
