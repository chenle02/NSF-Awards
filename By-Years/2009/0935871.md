Dr. Anthony Lowman of Drexel University submitted a DDEP for a Ph.D. candidate,
Kara Spiller, on engineering smart biomaterials for cartilage tissue. This award
enables this Ph.D. candidate to work at the Shanghai JiaoTong University for the
Ph.D. dissertation research. This research is of great importance in the field
of biomaterials and tissue engineering. The resources and expertise available
from the Chinese labs at JiaoTong University and the medical facilities there
are complementary to those at Drexel University. The results of the proposed
experiment on the material properties of hydrogels and their subsequent release
profiles are useful to understand the ability to enhance cartilage repairs.
