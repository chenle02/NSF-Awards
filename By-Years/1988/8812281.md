The University of Hawaii requests planning grant funds to develop a Science and
Technology Research Center proposal for an Infrared Array Astronomy and
Technology Center. The planning grant will be used to conduct a survey of the
astronomical and industrial community. This will be accomplished through an in-
depth review of the l987 Hilo Detector Workshop, establishment of a focused
conference with broad community participation on the needs and goals of the
proposed center, and site visits to industrial vendors. The goal of this
proposed technology center will be to further the development of infrared array
detectors for ground-based infrared astronomy, to make this technology broadly
available throughout the astronomical community, and to provide a strong link
between the infrared astronomical community, industry, and government personnel.
