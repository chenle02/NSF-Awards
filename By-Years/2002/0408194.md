ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Research: Quorum sensing influences
soil nitrogen mineralization and plant nitrogen
availability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rhizosphere microbial N mineralization
provides plants the majority of their N nutrition, but most soil N is organic
(chitin, proteins, lignoprotiens and nucleotides). The rate-limiting step in N
mineralization may be digestion of these large molecules by microbial
extracellular enzymes. Plants exert some control over bacterial function, and
new evidence shows that root exudates can disrupt the dominant mechanism of
bacterial-bacterial communication (quorum sensing (QS)) and QS-controlled
behaviors, such as extracellular enzyme production. Our first hypothesis is that
QS affects rhizosphere N mineralization, and plant health, by increasing soil
enzyme activity due to increased signal in the rhizosphere. The second
hypothesis is that cross-kingdom interactions in the rhizosphere between
mycorrhizae, bacteria and plants affect N mineralization via QS. Microcosms
allow easy access to the rhizosphere for manipulation of QS through signal
addition, measurement of inorganic N pools and N mineralization. A combination
of whole-cell biosensors, process rate measurements, decomposing population and
community analyses will reveal the degree to which plants control rhizosphere N
mineralization and how important this mode of control is for plant N
accumulation. To establish this would be to rewrite the current paradigm that
plants and microbes are the passive recipients of each other's excess, and set a
new precedent for inter-species chemical communication and
competition.&lt;br/&gt;
