This study investigates the effects of integrating literacy instruction with
biology coursework on high school student learning. It would investigate the
relationship between the growth in reading achievement and biology learning. It
will target schools serving especially large populations of African American and
Latino students. The project will include use a randomized experimental design
with multiple measures of student learning, classroom observations, surveys, and
interviews for validating quantitative results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
researchers have consulted research studies of reading practices. The project
would create a professional development reading apprenticeship program to
prepare teachers. Teachers will also be provided with funds to supplement their
textbooks with science magazines, trade books, and fiction related to biology
topics in the state curriculum frameworks. The study will occur in cities of
California. Teachers will be assigned to immediate or delayed intervention
randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. &lt;br/&gt;
