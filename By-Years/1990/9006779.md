This research will improve understanding of the dynamics of tree death
replacement in old-growth forests. Specific goals are to investigate the
species-and size-specific growth and death rates of canopy trees, gap
characteristics associated with canopy tree death, vegetation development in
gaps, and the dynamics of dead trees. These goals will be met by resampling
canopy trees and gap vegetation originally sampled in old-growth forests of the
southern Appalachians. The combinations of data sets on growth and mortality
will allow turnover in the forests to be studied to a degree impossible
elsewhere. These forests are the best example in the eastern United States of
forests likely to be in long-term equilibrium in terms of species composition
and ecosystem properties. They will serve as a valuable control for interpreting
changes in other eastern forests; e.g., determining whether human activity or
changing climate is causing more or different changes than usual. This study
also will demonstrate how different aspects of species life histories (e.g.,
canopy longevity versus gap-capturing ability) can result in their coexistence
in diverse forests. Findings from the analysis will contribute directly to the
knowledge base needed to predict the effects of global change.
