University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral Dissertation Research: How Problem
Gambling is Medicalized &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This study will
provide insight into the mechanisms that shape the medicalization of problem
gambling. It will examine how counselors construct racial and gender differences
in problem gambling behavior. It will also examine the ways counselors construct
and understand race and gender in their everyday discussions of clients and
client behavior. Using Conrad's (1992) definition of medicalization, the process
by which social problems are redefined as medical problems mandating the
intervention and control of licensed medical professionals, this project will
demonstrate how social and historical factors shape the construction of illness.
And it will bridge the theoretical work on medicalization with research on the
"policy making" of street level bureaucrats (Lipsky 1980), and on clinical
decision-making processes (Hays et al. 2010, Gushue 2004).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection through participant observation and
interviews will address three themes: (1) the types of racial and gender
discourses counselors use when discussing clients, (2) the kinds of legitimating
evidence counsellors provide in these discourses, and (3) the meanings
counselors attach to the differences which have been constructed. Data
collection strategies include interviews with counselors and managers of problem
gambling programs and a multi-site ethnographic study of gambling addiction
training workshops, conferences, and call centers. &lt;br/&gt;Very few
qualitative studies closely examine the role of counselors and managers in
shaping definitions of mental illness and even fewer seriously examine their
subjectivity. Combining interviews and ethnographic approaches, this study will
advance understanding of the complex processes of medicalization.
