The principal investigator (PI) will develop techniques for the modeling,
analysis, design, and optimization of distributed network management and control
schemes for broadband communications networks. The emphasis will be on
interconnected broadband local and metropolitan area telecommunications
networks. Network management architectures for such network structures are
hierarchically arranged to yield lower complexity and more reliable
implementations. They highly capitalize on parallel control, processing, and
computational processes to yield considerable speed up of the management and
control process. These measures ensure that control actions are executed in a
timely manner, reacting fast to observed changes in distributed loading,
capacity, performance, and system conditions. This research will focus on key
elements involved in the design of such distributed management and control
systems including the following issues: 1. Information sensing, observation, and
gathering procedures for collecting relevant information for underlying network
management tasks. 2. hierarchial network management architectures and control
policies. 3. development of numerically effective techniques for studying the
steady state performance of such distributed network management policies.
