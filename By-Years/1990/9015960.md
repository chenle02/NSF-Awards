This project supports a workshop on an introduction to the Cornell National
Supercomputing Facility (CNSF) and to parallel processing and vectorization. The
CNSF is an NSF supported supercomputer center providing access,education,
training and consulting to academic researchers. Attendees at the workshop will
be engineering faculty members from eight Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU's). CNSF will work closely with these institutions and their
faculty on the many aspects of supercomputing. This project is aimed at
encouraging minority institution and researchers to expand the scope of their
research problems by utilizing the advanced computation capabilities of the
center in the areas of vector and parallel processing, access to large address
space and extensive visualization tools such as video animation. The
participants will also have an opportunity to meet with other researchers. Each
participant will receive an initial allocation of 10 service units for use in
their research program.
