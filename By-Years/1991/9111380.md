This research will develop and empirically test models of the location of
production within countries, as a way of shedding light on the forces driving
international trade and investment. The theoretical part of the research will
use models of imperfectly competitive markets in which there are increasing
returns to scale to analyze the processes leading to geographical concentration
of production. This will involve modeling both concentration at an aggregate
level - the division of countries into densely populated "core" regions and less
dense "peripheries" -and the emergence of high geographical concentration of the
production of many manufactured goods and some services. The models will borrow
techniques from both the new trade theory and the new growth theory. Key themes
will be path dependence, i.e., dependence of eventual outcomes on initial
conditions, and the observation that the qualitative character of economic
geography depends in predictable ways on a few key economic parameters, such as
transport costs, scale economies, and the nonagricultural share of employment.
The empirical research will use US Census data and comparable data from other
countries (especially Europe) to test these models and compare interregional
with international specialization and trade. A central project is to use US data
to compute indices of geographic concentration for a large number of industries,
and then to compare these indices with industry characteristics in order to
discriminate between alternative explanations of concentration. A second project
will use historical evidence to test for the kinds of qualitative changes,
critical mass phenomena, and other nonlinear features predicted by the
theoretical models. This project is important because it attempts to integrate
economic geography with international trade theory. With this study, we will be
better equipped to understand the likely effects of the 1992 economic
integration in Europe and the US- Canada Free Trade Agreement.
