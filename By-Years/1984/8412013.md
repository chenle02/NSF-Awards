Research is being conducted on multicomponent ion exchange systems to: compare
ion equilibrium data on mixed reruns with a complex Langmuir adsorption model
and compare data on the dynamics of mixed media ion exchange columns with
predictions from the extension of the coherence model of Helfferich and Klein.
The comparisons will verify or lead to the development of models which can be
used to design ion exchange systems for such applications as the removal of
ammonia from dialysis fluid, contracting metal ions in hydrometallurgy, and
chromatographic separation of complex biological mixtures.
