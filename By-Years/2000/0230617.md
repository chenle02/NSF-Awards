PROPOSAL NO.: 0230617 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Seat, Janie INSTITUTION NAME:
University of Tennessee Knoxville TITLE: Engaging Preservice Science Teachers in
Engineering

ABSTRACT Success in engineering is strongly dependent on the quality of a
student's secondary mathematics and science education. Unfortunately, many
middle school and high school teachers in Tennessee do not know enough about
engineering or the engineering education process to prepare their students
adequately for the rigors of engineering degree programs. Together with the
University of Tennessee (UT) College of Education, the UT freshman engineering
engage program is proposing to develop and test novel methods of educating
secondary science teachers about these topics, and to thereby increase the
quantity and quality of students entering engineering degree programs. A pilot
program will bring preservice science teachers from the UT College of Education
will spend ten hours each week learning firsthand about engineering education by
working in engages Physical Homework class. Participants will also take a
Special Topics course in Education in which they will be encouraged to apply the
knowledge that they gain from their science education experiences in engage to
the secondary science classroom. At the end of the year, faculty members from
both Education and Engineering will evaluate the pilot program to determine
whether or not it would be an effective way to increase the engineering content
in the existing preservice science curriculum. This program leverages facilities
and expertise from two different colleges to work on the problem of science
teacher preparation. This problem is one of actual preparation as the role of
the College of Education and from the College of Engineering, a customer of
science preparation. This program puts the best resources of teaching pedagogy
and understanding applied science together to improve and educational resource.
