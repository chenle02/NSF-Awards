The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics of the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean System The PI
will investigate the geophysical fluid dynamics of the coupled atmosphere-ocean
system with novel but dynamically appropriate models. The effort will
concentrate on mid-latitude dynamics, and primarily on phenomena with timescales
of a decade and longer. The goal of the project is to isolate and understand
specific and robust mechanisms which produce variability and limit
predictability on these timescales. The approach the PI will take is different
from, but complementary to, more conventional approaches using GCMs. The PI uses
rational approximations of the primitive equations of motion to derive models
appropriate for the time and space scales of interest, for both atmosphere and
ocean. These are then coupled and integrated numerically. By basing the models
on rational approximations to the underlying dynamics, the models are reliable
indicators of the underlying mechanisms occurring in the real atmosphere and
ocean. Last, but by no means least, the models will provide a tool for the
interpretation of more complex GCM experiments. Specific mechanisms to be
explored and hypotheses to be tested are described in the text of the proposal,
with the primary goal of understanding the basic dynamics and predictability of
these processes, and thereby the extent to which long-term variability can be
produced by either atmosphere or ocean alone, or by coupled interactions. In
spite of much study with coupled GCMs, the dynamics of coupled interactions
leading to variability on long timescales are poorly understood, and the
magnitude and thus importance of such variability is not known. Further, climate
variability on the decadal to century time scale is perhaps less well studied
and understood than the mechanisms of variability on either interannual or
millennium timescales, in spite of its manifest importance.
