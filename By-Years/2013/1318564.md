The project examines novel services built on top of public cloud infrastructure
to enable cost-effective high-performance computing. The PIs will explore the
on-demand, elastic, and configurable features of cloud computing to complement
the traditional supercomputer/cluster platforms. More specifically, this
research aims to assess the efficacy of building dynamic cloud-based clusters
leveraging the configurability and tiered pricing model of cloud instances. The
scientific value of this proposal lies in the novel use of untapped features of
cloud computing for HPC and the strategic adoption of small, cloud-based
clusters for the purpose of developing/tuning applications for large
supercomputers.

Through this research, the PIs expect to answer key research questions
regarding: (1) automatic workload-specific cloud cluster configuration, (2)
cost-aware and contention-aware data and task co-scheduling, and (3) adaptive,
integrated cloud instance provisioning and job scheduling, plus workload
aggregation for cloud instance rental cost reduction. If successful, this
research will result in tools that adaptively aggregate, configure, and re-
configure cloud resources for different HPC needs, with the purpose of offering
low-cost R&D environments for scalable parallel applications.
