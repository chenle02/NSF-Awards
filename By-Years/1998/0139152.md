This joint Chemistry Division and Materials Research Division award supports a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Iowa State University.
Mark Gordon is the site's Program Director. James Evans, Bruce Harmon, Kai Ming
Ho, and William Jenks are the Co-Directors. Seven faculty members from the
Departments of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry will serve as REU student
mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), eight students will be supported
each summer in a ten-week program. The recruitment focus will be directed
towards regional undergraduate institutions and several HBCU universities where
personal contacts exist. The research focus will be computational chemistry and
physics with special emphasis on applications in materials science. The specific
areas of research are quantum chemistry, surface dynamics, solid state
properties and dynamics, and dynamics of biomolecules. Students will participate
in a series of short (half-day) courses on high performance computing. Weekly
meetings will be held, where students, during the later part of the summer,
present their research. At the end of the summer students will present their
research in a poster session. Part of the assessment of the program will be exit
interviews with each of the students. All participants will be tracked until
they complete their undergraduate educations.
