Global environmental change poses critical environmental and societal needs.
This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award prepares
master's and doctoral students at the University of California - Berkeley with
tools to advance frontiers at the intersection of social, natural, and data
science. Trainees will develop skills in data visualization, informatics,
software development, and science communication. Through an innovative team-
based problem-solving course, trainees will collaborate with an external partner
organization to tackle a challenge in global environmental change that includes
a significant problem in data analysis and interpretation of impacts and
solutions. A new generation of researchers and professionals interested in
issues of environmental change will be trained in the emerging practices of open
science, which will create fully reproducible and collaborative analyses that
document the evidence for scientific conclusions and their implications for
policy. This training program will advance progress on grand challenges of
national and global importance.

The research theme of this program addresses grand challenges at the junction of
open science and reproducible data analysis, responses of coupled human-natural
systems to rapid environmental change, and development of evidence-based
solutions. Trainees will research topics such as management of water resources,
regional land use, and responses of agricultural systems to changes in economic
and climate factors. Trainees will master the skills needed to evaluate how
rapid environmental change impacts human and natural systems and to develop and
evaluate solutions in public policy, resource management, and environmental
design that will mitigate negative effects on human well-being. Trainees will
learn to apply these skills examining the integrated dynamics of coupled human-
natural systems from local to global scales.
