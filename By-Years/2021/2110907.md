This is a project to explore the best way to document the development of the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory, a story of diverse people drawn together for an
adventure of exploration and discovery. Rubin Observatory makes possible a
critical mass of character-driven science documentary programming that will
allow audiences to see themselves reflected in diverse members of the Rubin
team. A continuing web series will provide Rubin scientists and engineers with
media training to tell their stories, thus broadening participation, increasing
STEM enrollment, boosting scientific literacy, and increasing trust in
scientists. The full series will be developed through the early concepts created
by this award. It will create a model for employing women-led, diverse, local
crews; for documenting “big science” through construction and integration, and
for addressing the humanities in science documentary projects. It will provide
scientists with media training, and filmmakers with science training. There will
be an associated web series that will reach people all over the world, enabling
everyone to avoid isolation and explore the universe, providing perspective for
all human activity, and wordlessly confirming that ‘we are all in this
together.’&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
