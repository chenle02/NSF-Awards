This research will bring together researchers actively involved in the study of
how to value complex environmental services and amentities. Participants in the
workshop include experts in the use of different valuation approaches -
contingent valuation, small-group value structuring, laboratory experiments and
deliberative polling as well as critics of these various approaches. The
workshop is designed to address the shortcomings associated with these various
methods of value elicitation and explore alternative approaches and methods for
eliciting values in non-market contexts.
