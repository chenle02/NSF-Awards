The primary goal of the proposed research program is to investigate the shell
structure of exotic, neutron-rich nuclei by direct reactions. These kinds of
reactions are an excellent tool to probe the single particle properties of
nuclei and gain information on the nuclear wave functions. Comparisons of the
experimental results with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations will give
new insights on the nuclear potential such as the role of tensor forces and
three-body components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed
project includes building an active research program in nuclear structure
physics at Central Michigan University. This project will provide opportunities
for undergraduate and M.S. students to actively participate in experiments
carried out at world leading research facilities. Students can apply their skill
outside of the class room and gain new experience in simulating and analyzing
experimental data, setting up data acquisition systems and developing a new
particle detection system. The students will be expected to publish their
results and present their research at national and international conferences.
