Understanding volcanic processes in the ocean basins is critical to several
major research areas in the geosciences. Most active volcanism occurs at mid-
ocean ridges where mantle material upwells and melts as a result of the
separation of crustal plates. Away from these plate boundaries seamounts and
oceanic islands can form, though the processes which form magmas in this
environment are poorly understood. The present project will examine seismic data
from a recently formed seamount, Loihi, to the southeast of the Hawaiian Island
chain. Current models for the origin of this volcanically active feature
indicate that it is, or will be, a new volcanic island or seamount along the
Hawaiian ridge. Hawaiian volcanoes are apparently produced by magma from the
mantle as the Pacific Plate drifts over a fixed magma source. Overall objectives
of the project are to identify the source and depth of earthquakes in Loihi and
to relate these to models of the volcanic evolution of such seamounts.
Additionally, the project will provide constraints to allow better location of
future earthquakes from land stations on the Hawaiian Islands. Data for the
project were collected on a university sponsored research cruise.
