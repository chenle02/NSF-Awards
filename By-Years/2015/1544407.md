Southeastern Lie Theory Workshops will be held October 9-11, 2015 at North
Carolina State University and May 23-26, 2016 at the University of Virginia.
These workshops are part of the annual Southeastern Lie Theory Workshop Series
held at universities in the southeastern region of USA since 2009. The workshop
series website is http://pi.math.virginia.edu/lieworkshops/. The aim of the
workshop series is to bring together senior and junior researchers, as well as
graduate students, in order to build cohesive research groups in various aspects
of Lie theory; to stimulate and enhance research collaborations in Lie theory;
and to infuse a strong tradition of research and education in the region. Each
workshop is centered on a research theme and will feature one or two main
speakers, giving two to three expository talks that will be accessible to
graduate students and postdocs in the workshop's theme area. In addition, there
will be four to six invited talks by other researchers and contributed talks by
junior researchers and advanced graduate students. Considerable time will be
devoted to informal discussions among participants in small groups to work on
specific research problems led by invited team leaders chosen from among the
participants.

Algebraic, combinatorial and geometric Lie theory is a major area of
mathematical research with important applications to many different areas of
mathematics, physics, and computer science. Research in representation theory
includes the study of quantized enveloping algebras, quantum function algebras,
Kac-Moody Lie algebras, Hecke algebras, canonical bases and crystal bases,
vertex operator algebras, Hall algebras, A-infinity algebras, quivers, cluster
algebras, Hopf algebras, and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. The research
theme for the workshop at NCSU in 2015 will be "Algebraic and Combinatorial
Representation Theory" and the research theme for the workshop at UVA in 2016
will be "Algebraic Groups, Quantum Groups and Geometry."
