During the conduct of the National Science Foundation sponsored American Society
of Mechanical Engineers Workshop on Mechanical Tolerancing (September 28 -
October 2, 1988), it became evident that there was a need to determine the
shortcomings and ambiguities of inspection systems that assess deviations of
part geometries according to current standards and practices of dimensioning and
tolerancing. A study will be conducted to examine the difference between the
results of current sample measurement systems measuring workpieces dimensioned
and toleranced to current geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T)
standards. The ambiguities found can be traced to the need for a mathematical
foundation for current standards. The final report will consist of a draft
standard to be supplied to the National Science Foundation and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers Y14 Committee for approval as the American
National Standard.
