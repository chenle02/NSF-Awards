The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships are awards to
recent recipients of doctoral degrees. The fellowship is designed to provide 24
months of support divided into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer
months. The recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which allows
the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months of full-time support
and 18 months of half-time support. Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship awards allow fellows to choose research environments that will have
maximal impact on their future scientific development. Dr. Andrew M. Winkler
received his doctoral degree from New York University, and will pursue research
in the area of numerical computation, theoretical work on the existence of
cuspidal spectrum for non-congruence arithmetic discrete groups, and continuing
work demonstrating the absence of such spectrum for non-arithmetic Hecke groups,
under the guidance of Peter Sarnak at Stanford University.
