The orthodox view of spontaneous mutations is that they arise continually and at
random, without reference to their ultimate utility. However, in Escherichia
coli, many of the mutations that convey immediately-expressed phenotypes arise
after the application of the very selection that allows for their detection.
Indeed, some classes of rare mutational events, such as those that activate
cryptic operons, are only observed in stationary-phase cells under selective
conditions. The mechanism of this post-selection mutational process is unknown.
Bacterial variants (mutants) that are defective in the process, will be
isolated. This will be done by mutagenizing bacteria that carry two cryptic
operons, one for salicin (bg1o) and one for lactose utilization (ebgo), and
screening for variants that cannot mutate spontaneously to Sal+ or to Lac+. The
phenotypes of the variants obtained will be extensively characterized. The
specific genetic defects will be identified by conventional mapping techniques
and cloning. If conditional-lethal variants are obtained, suppressors of this
phenotype will be selected for and characterized. Ultimately, this approach
should allow the pathway of post-selection mutagenesis to be deduced.
