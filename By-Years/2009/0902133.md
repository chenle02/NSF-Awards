Funding is provided to combine paleoclimate and instrumental observations with a
new Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to improve constraints
on key climate parameters including those governing dynamical and potentially
abrupt responses to forcing. Specifically, the research team will focus on
dynamical mechanisms associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) using an existing EMIC
("LOVECLIM"). The broader impacts involve supporting postdoctoral scholars and
graduate students and contributing to the understanding of abrupt climate
change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
