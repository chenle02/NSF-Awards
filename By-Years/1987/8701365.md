Meteorologists recognize that most heavy precipitation and severe weather
events are controlled by factors that occur on what is termed the stormscale or
mesoscale as it is called by meteorologist. These features have typical spatial
scales of 10 to 100 kilometers and are not well sampled by the operational
weather system nor well understood. In a collaborative effort with a scientist
from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Principal Investigator
will study small mesoscale disturbances that have been observed to develop on
large scale synoptic frontal surfaces. The primary questions to be addressed are
the hydrodynamic mechanisms that give rise to mesoscale waves, their
interactions with convection and their effect on the structure of the frontal
zones on which they form. Answers to these questions will enhance our basic
understanding of the distribution and intensity of precipitation along frontal
boundaries. This investigation involves theory, numerical models and
observational analysis. The data to be used were collected during two field
investigations focussed on mesoscale processes -- the Genesis of Atlantic Lows
Experiment and the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-
Central (STORM stands for Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology).
