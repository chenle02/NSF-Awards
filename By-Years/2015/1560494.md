This project focuses on the study of black carbon (BC) in the atmosphere, one of
the major short-lived climate pollutants. Comprehensive multi-scale modeling
studies will be conducted to assess the climate impacts of BC on urban and
regional scales. Modeling studies will be applied to the Mexico City
Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and evaluated using ground-, aircraft- and satellite-
based measurements obtained during the NSF-sponsored 2006 MILAGRO (Megacity
Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations) Campaign in the MCMA.

The objectives of the research are to: (1) evaluate the radiative impacts of BC
only; (2) assess the net radiative effects of BC and co-emitted species; (3)
apportion the regional radiative impact of major BC emission sources; and (4)
investigate the influences of climate change on air quality and on the radiative
impact of BC. The WRF-Chem model will be driven by both the National Center for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data and the NASA GISS-E2-R model
output, and chemical initial and boundary conditions will be interpolated from
the global chemical transport model MOZART-4 and GISS outputs.
