With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University in Corpus Christi will
acquire a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS). This equipment will
enhance research in a number of areas including a) the semiquantitative analysis
of pesticides and other suspected endocrine disruptors; b) analysis of climate
patterns based on sedimentary lipid components; c) mechanistic studies on
aquatic organisms' response to encironmental contaminants; and d) development of
a novel air sampling technique that uses solid cyclodextrins to trap unstable
volatile polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas
chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GCMS) is an extremely powerful
technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. This
instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research in environmental
chemistry at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, a primarily undergraduate
institution. &lt;br/&gt;
