The International Conferences on Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for
Chemical Process Design are held every three years, presently alternating
between North America and Europe. The first five conferences have produced
highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government
workers in this vital area for chemical process design and simulation. The
meetings have also become the most important gatherings for workers in the area
from all over the world; the Fifth Conference held in 1989 at Banff, Alberta,
Canada attracted more than 200 participants from nearly 30 countries. Each
conference has produced important collections of papers in their Proceedings.
The Fifth Conference provided over 900 pages of reviews and new research when
published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria. The Sixth
Conference is scheduled for 19-24 July 1992 in Cortina d' Ampezzo, Italy, with
substantially the same successful format as for the most recent Conferences.
Travel funds are provided to support invited speakers and young research
professors.
