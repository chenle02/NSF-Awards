Oden The investigator and his colleagues organize an international symposium on
computational and applied mathematics. The meeting focuses on interdisciplinary
approaches to problems arising in mathematical modeling and computer simulations
of major scientific and engineering applications. Conference topics include
large-scale scientific computing, parallel processing, numerical methods,
applications in biological and environmental studies, materials science,
mechanics, image processing, and engineering analysis, design, and
manufacturing. Mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and computational
mathematics have had a revolutionary impact on how research is done throughout
science and engineering. The conference explores recent developments in applied
mathematics and computation across a wide variety of application areas. The
problems stuied are important in manufacturing, materials, environment, global
change, and high-performance computing.
