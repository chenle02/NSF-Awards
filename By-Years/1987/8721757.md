This project will explore the sedimentary rock section in East Greenland for
fossil vertebrates and other evidence relating to the transition in terrestrial
faunas during Late Triassic to Early Jurassic times. The rock section at this
location occur in a documented and extensively exposed series of Triassic and
Jurassic sediments in which vertebrate remains have been reported but not
described. The stratigraphic units of primary interest are the Gipsdalen
Formation, the Fleming Fjord Formation, and the Kap Stewart Formation. The
principal objectives are to: 1) recover paleontological evidence of the origin
of mammals and other modern vertebrates, 2) extend the stratigraphic framework
for the continental Triassic-Jurassic boundary, and 3) analyze the
sedimentological evidence of climate variability during this time.
