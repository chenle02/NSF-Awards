The New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium, in conjunction with the University of
Genoa, Regions Liguria of Italy, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, proposes to design, coordinate, execute, and control the third
International Symposium on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization. This Conference on
March 30 to April 2, 1993 will bring together leading ocean experts from
science, technology, industry, and government to consider questions of how to
effectively use ocean space for sustainable development. The three day
Conference will comprise five topics, including about 30 individual
presentations. These experts will examine the sociological and technological
aspects of living and working on and in the ocean. Speakers will be recruited
from more than a dozen nations, mainly in Europe and the USA. Finally, this
symposium, as in International forum, will consider major technical issues and
problems in order to highlight the most promising research opportunities in the
ocean. Thus, the most important product of the Conference will be its
identification and guidance of the most promising ocean technology research
possibilities.
