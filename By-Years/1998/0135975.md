This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor F. Albert Cotton at Texas A&amp;M University to
continue studies on using dinuclear complexes to design and synthesize molecular
architectures including pairs, loops, and polygons as well as 1-, 2- and
3-dimensional extended structures. The communication between the pairs of metal
atoms will be investigated as the oxidation of the neutral units occurs. Refined
synthetic methods should allow for the design of large cavities with better
shape control and factors for anion and guest recognition. Diruthenium molecules
will be used in addition to those involving molybdenum and rhodium. Designs will
focus on new structural motifs with a special emphasis on the introduction of
chirality into the structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecules with two metal
atoms will be used as building blocks to design extended lattices with
interesting structural, magnetic and conductive properties. Graduate students
and postdocs will be trained in the synthesis and structural characterization of
novel supramolecular materials and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;
