9413923 Lewis This award provides funds for a robotics assembly cell and mobile
vehicle testbed. The equipment will be dedicated to the advancement of robotics
intelligent material handling technology. The equipment consists of two Silicon
Graphics servers, a MIMD parallel processing computer, robotics equipment for
the intelligent materials handling cell, a mobile platform with arm, a real-time
digital control system, and distributed control equipment. This equipment will
comprise the completion of two next generation systems ready for technology
transfer to industry: the Intelligent Material Handling Development Cell and the
Real-Time Digital Control System. The objective of the research to be performed
using this equipment is to develop intelligent material handling technology in
unstructured environments. The technology may improve United States global
competitiveness by providing robotics systems that do not need to be explicitly
retaught and reprogrammed as a result of minor changes in environments or tasks.
This research represents across-disciplinary effort that is con-sponsored by
industry, whichs will work with the university to steer the research and
commercialize the result.
