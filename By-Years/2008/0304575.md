Professors Christine Keating and Theresa Mayer of Pennsylvania State University
are supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the
Nanotechnology Initiative to develop a novel biosensing strategy in which a
nanomechanical transducer array is built from the bottom-up, by integrating
nanobiosensor elements onto a CMOS chip. Sensing is accomplished by measuring a
shift in the resonance frequency of nanowires due to the mass change associated
with DNA hybridization. The DNA derivitization will guarantee high detection
selectivity, while the nanometer scale dimensions of the resonant cantilevers
will provide high sensitivity. This exploratory project will focus on the
incorporation of DNA molecules onto the nanowires before alignment and
integration and show that their bioactivity is retained, and sensitivity will be
demonstrated. In addition to training graduate students in this collaborative
environment between chemistry and chemical engineering, two undergraduates will
also be involved as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates Supplement.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the potential to impact several fields
including trace detection and biosensing for food safety, national security,
forensics and medical diagnostics. Introduction of the nanoscale in these
applications is desired for low cost, rugged and miniaturized devices.
