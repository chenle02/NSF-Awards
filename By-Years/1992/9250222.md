The goal of this project is to acquire a set of hardware and software that will
provide flexibility in supporting CASE (Computer-aided Software Engineering)
tools for project- oriented courses. The project will acquire five SUN
workstations with UNIX operating system and X-window protocol and appropriate
CASE software tools. A laboratory manual for the selected tools will be
developed which will be tutorial in nature with the purpose of getting the
students into the CASE tool environment as quickly as possible. One of the
biggest drawbacks with teaching software engineering process without CASE tools
is that it is difficult for the students to see the benefits of the iteration
and control processes in the software development. This software engineering
laboratory setup will allow emphasis on these processes without undue burden on
the students' part to manually track documents and artifacts.
