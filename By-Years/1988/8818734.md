The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the pattern of the Late
Pleistocene human fossil record in Southwest Asia, and to relate this pattern to
the broader issue of modern human origins. The study proposes to provide a
systematic descriptive and comparative analysis of the morphology of the frontal
bone of archaic, early anatomically modern, and Upper Paleolithic hominids. Data
from Middle and Late Pleistocene hominids in Europe and Africa will be used as a
comparative sample. Scientists currently recognize two contradictory models of
modern human origins: long-term regional continuity (the candelabra model) and
monocentric origin (the "out-of-Africa" model). Results of this analysis should
help to clarify the relative importance of local continuity and extraneous
influences in the emergence of moderns humans in Southwest Asia, and thus
provide evidence for one or the other of these models.
