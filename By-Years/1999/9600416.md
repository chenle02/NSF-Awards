The interaction of positrons with molecules is investigated using crossed beams.
The energies and masses of the dissociation fragments are measured using mass
spectrometric and kinetic energy spectrometry in order to study the chemical
stability of molecules containing positronium. Applications to solid state
physics, medical physics, polymer research and astrophysics are anticipated.
