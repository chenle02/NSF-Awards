This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The research is to
study computational complexity of adaptive and robust robot motion planning
algorithms which can be effective in situations with incomplete information or
in dynamically-changing environments. The planner's performance is to adapt as
new information is acquired or the environment changes. The research will also
consider movement problems with inherent errors in the sensing and movement
control, so that the motion planning algorithms must be robust to lack of
information on the position of the robot. The emphasis is on the design of
algorithms that give provable optimal or near-optimal performance, focusing
especially on some less-investigated motion planning problems. The use of
massive parallelism will be explored, to speed up the movement planning
algorithms. The results should contribute to a more fundamental understanding of
the nature of motion planning problems, and ultimately to more robust planning
approaches for less structured environments.
