The Micron Automata Processor is a reconfigurable non-Von Neumann co-processor
which can be used to simultaneously execute multiple Non-deterministic Finite
Automata over one or more input data streams. The technology supports an
algorithmic model and a programming abstraction that is radically different from
any processor or co-processor that is in existence today. The goal of this
exploratory project is to conduct early-concept research on the Automata
Processor so that the research community has access to techniques and tools for
utilizing the technology. The project is developing algorithmic building blocks,
programming techniques, and libraries for enabling researchers and developers to
take advantage of this new architectural paradigm, and designing automata-based
algorithms to solve path problems in graphs as a step towards exploring general
purpose use of this architecture. The project will lead to fundamental research
on how to solve problems using a new computational model. Research results will
be shared through publications and release of automata libraries, to enable
rapid adoption of this new technology by the computing community.
