This RAPID project seeks to improve the understanding of the airborne
transmission of (SARS) CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic, via sub-
micron airborne particles. Chamber experiments will be conducted to help
determine how long (SARS) CoV-2 remains viable in sub-micron aerosol and how
atmospheric oxidation, particle size, and other environmental conditions affect
viability. The team includes well-established infectious-disease scientists,
coronavirus microbiologists and aerosol scientists with a unique combination of
techniques and instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two objectives of this
research are to: (1) Conduct controlled chamber experiments using a non-
pathogenic model coronavirus embedded in submicron aerosol in the
presence/absence of ozone (O3) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals (separately) to
examine how viability is influenced by atmospheric oxidation; and (2) Measure
the concentrations of (SARS) CoV-2 and non-pathogenic T3 bacteriophage in
aerosol with a novel BioSpot sampler and a gelatin filter sampler in at least 2
locations (e.g., wastewater treatment plant, hospital, daycare, nursing home,
grocery store, classroom), and if viable viruses are detected to examine the
ability of airborne O3 or OH radical treatment to inactivate the airborne (SARS)
CoV-2 virus. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to lead to a better
understanding of the viability of coronaviruses in sub-micron aerosol. It is
anticipated that this effort will provide information relevant to the improved
design of mitigation measures and shared indoor/outdoor spaces that are more
resilient to respiratory virus transmission and more conducive to protecting
public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
