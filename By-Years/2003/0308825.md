Human alteration of river ecosystems is an enormous concern worldwide. This
study is focused in the Middle Rio Grande (MRG) of New Mexico, which has been
severely altered since the early 1900s. The overall aim of the research is to
document present conditions and reconstruct past conditions of the MRG aquatic
food web to understand how river regulation (e.g., dam and levee construction,
large-scale diversion of water for human use) has affected organisms that live
there. Naturally occurring stable isotopes will be used as biochemical tracers
to document production and cycling of food energy through the entire MRG
ecosystem from plants to fishes. We will then compare isotope signatures of
present day fishes to historical fish specimens held in the Museum of
Southwestern Biology (up to 63 years) to evaluate (i) changes over time in
carbon sources entering the food web due to altered flood cycles, (ii) changes
in fish food web as non-native fish species increased in abundance and many
native fishes declined, and (iii) variation in nitrogen fertilizer inputs from
agriculture over time. This research will advance knowledge of how aquatic
communities respond to river regulation over decadal time spans. More broadly,
this research focuses on developing a novel method to address the challenging
problem of reconstructing community food web structure and function following
river ecosystem alteration.
