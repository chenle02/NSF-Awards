Project Porifera is a cooperative education venture in which the museum
scientists and educators will train and assist teachers in integrating a newly
developed aquatic biology research program into the life science curriculum of
twenty junior high schools in the Thames River watershed. Teachers will be
involved in activities designed to upgrade their research skills and content
knowledge. Their students will become involved in in-depth investigative
experiences, an innovative networking of computer communications, museum
displays, and the opportunity for supervised independent student research.
Focusing on the freshwater and estuarine ecosystems of eastern Connecticut,
Project Porifera is designed to involve regional teachers and students in field
studies and scientific surveys on selected bodies of water within the l,500 sq.
mi. Thames River Basin. A staff composed of a computer specialist, an aquatic
biologist and a curriculum specialist will offer twenty teachers courses, field
experiences, and classroom training to prepare them to implement this new
approach in their classrooms and in the field.
