9301950 KNAP This effort will continue the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-
series Study (BATS) for a second five year period. This station, approximately
75 km southeast of Bermuda, has been occupied for 67 cruises in the 49 months
since sampling began in October 1988. These cruises included 49 core cruises
where the entire suite of measurements is conducted, 13 spring bloom and 5
validation cruises to look for island effects and to estimate the extent of
spatial variability in this region. The results of these cruises have been
distributed to the oceanographic community in data reports and peer-reviewed
publications. The aim of this project is to continue the same measurement and
protocol scheme in order to fulfill the requirements of a US JGOFS time-series
station. The only differences for the next few years is to supplement the
program by core measurements of dissolved organic carbon, the addition of pCO2
measurements and the upgrading of capabilities for data validation and
distribution. The understanding and platform opportunities created by this
Station over past 4 years has provided a rich infrastructure in which individual
research projects are also imbedded. With another 5 years of support the
processes controlling the time-varying flux of carbon and associated biogenic
elements in the ocean will be further elucidated.
