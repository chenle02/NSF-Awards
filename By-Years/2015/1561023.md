Ensuring a high level of security and reliability in the electronic computing
devices is a significant challenge. Central issues include secure and reliable
identification, authentication and integrity checking of underlying hardware.
Hardware-based security primitives such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs)
are still a work-in-progress in terms of the cost they require to guarantee
reliable operation and their resistance to physical attacks. This project
investigates security primitives suitable for high volume production where the
allowable costs for design, integration, and testing of hardware security
primitives are low.

The techniques developed in this project utilize existing resources in the
memory hierarchy to cover multiple hardware security primitives all at once.
This project also verifies the effectiveness, cost, and attack vulnerabilities
of the proposed primitives and techniques through extensive experiments on
multiple test platforms. The benefits for society include more trustworthy,
reliable, and secure verification of electronics for healthcare and dependable
computing platforms for intelligence, financial transactions, energy, and
military systems.
