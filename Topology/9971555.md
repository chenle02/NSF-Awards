Abstract: The proposer plans to investigate purely algebraic analogs of the
theory of the characteristic submanifold of a Haken 3-manifold. Some results in
this direction have already been obtained by several authors but their
uniqueness results are much weaker than that in the 3-manifold context. It is
expected that such results should also yield new understanding of the purely
topological theory of 3-manifolds.

The universe appears to be 3-dimensional and it is a very interesting question
to understand its shape. There is an abstract theory of spaces called
3-manifolds which attempts to describe all the possibilities for the shape of
such a space. While this theory is not complete, there is a great deal known. In
particular, many (and perhaps all) such spaces can be decomposed into simple
geometric pieces in a natural way. In this proposal, it is planned to
investigate further the properties of this decomposition into geometric pieces.
