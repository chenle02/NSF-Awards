A central aim of school instruction is to facilitate the transfer of
generalization of acquired knowledge beyond the initial learning context to new
circumstances. Recent efforts to develop curricula in which mathematics is
embedded in meaningful contexts has given the transfer of leaning across
contexts new relevancy. However, transfer research has floundered in recent
years due primarily to findings that transfer is difficult to engineer in the
laboratory. Furthermore two controversies in the literature indicate theoretical
problems with the construct of transfer. Unfortunately, many researchers have
abandoned inquiry in this area, well short of reaching and understanding of
transfer sufficient to provide much-needed guidance in designing and organizing
learning environments.
