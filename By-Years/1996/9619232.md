Abstract Proposal Number: CTS-9619232 Principal Investigator: Karniadakis This
is a proposal to explore a different approach to turbulence modeling based on a
new generalized analogy between hydrodynamic turbulence and electromagnetism.
The new analogy originates from the Maxwell equations, which completely describe
the electromagnetic fields in all cases and not simply the induction laws, which
have been previously used to develop the classical analogy. The new
correspondence is between vorticity and magnetic field, and Lamb vector and the
electric field. Appropriately averaged, as in standard large-eddy simulation
(LES) approaches, the new system leads to a linear set of equations, which
reduces to a second-order wave equation for the locally averaged vorticity and
Lamb vector fields. Because of the linearity of the system in these variables,
the superposition principle can be used to construct solutions for complex-
geometry flows using analytical/numerical solutions in simpler domains.
