Stochastic processes and their applications are a subfield of probability theory
dealing with modeling real life data, representing the evolution of a system of
random values over time. Familiar examples of stochastic processes include stock
market fluctuations, signals such as audio and video, medical data such as a
patient's blood pressure or temperature, and random movement, such as random
walk. A generalization, the random field, describes evolution in time and space.
Examples of random fields include static images, random terrain (landscapes),
waves, or composition variations of a heterogeneous material. This research
project is concerned with a better understanding of the degree of dependence in
a stochastic process or random field by using new techniques for studying the
interactions between its variables. These techniques are based on surprising
relationships with concepts that appear in other fields of mathematics, such as
algebra and dynamical systems. The results will lead to a more accurate
prediction of future values of random evolution.

More specifically, in many situations, the interactions between the variables
are viewed as a measure of the strength of dependence of a time series. The
information about these interactions is given by a function called the "spectral
density function," which plays a central role in the theory of time series and
random fields. Other spectral notions in mathematics are: "operator spectral
measure," which generates the transitions of a Markov process, and "empirical
spectral distribution" of the eigenvalues of large random matrices with entries
selected from random fields. This research project aims to establish several
structural relationships that will build bridges between these three, apparently
disparate notions, each having the word "spectral" in its definition. The
results of this research will show that this is not a coincidence. As a matter
of fact, they are interconnected and they shed light on one another. These
relationships will facilitate determination of the strength of dependence in a
random evolution. They will extend and improve tools used for analyzing
stationary stochastic processes and fields by indicating new ways to estimate
their spectral density. Some of the results will contribute to a better
understanding of the limiting empirical eigenvalue distribution for random
matrices with correlated entries, exhibiting long range dependence. The research
aims to show that this limiting distribution is uniquely determined by the
field's spectral density and to find a formula relating them.
