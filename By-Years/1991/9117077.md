This projects deals with optical spectroscopy of metal ions in crystalline
solids. The research utilizes laser based tunable spectroscopic techniques
applied to investigate dynamical processes in the excited state, cooperative
transitions, and dynamic effects involving elementary excitations. A major
objective is understanding how optical energy absorbed by ion in crystals is
subsequently dissipated in the solid. The research also involves instrument
temporal dynamics and nonequilibrium narrow band, high frequency elementary
excitations of ordered systems. These issues are of fundamental interest and are
important for the development of new laser materials.
