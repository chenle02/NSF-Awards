9705784 Hofmann The PI intends to investigate the relationship between the
geometry of time varying parabolic boundaries, on the one hand, and estimates
for caloric measure, or parabolic singular integrals, on the other. A primary
long-term goal of the project is to show that appropriate caloric measure or
singular integral estimates on the parabolic boundary of a time varying domain
imply some regularity of the boundary. These questions are a type of "free
boundary problem", that is, a problem where one would like to be able to say
something about a boundary which has not been specified in advance. These sorts
of questions arise, for example, in the mathematics of phase transitions, where
the interface (the free boundary) between two phases of a substance (e.g., its
solid and liquid phases) is not given in advance, but rather evolves with time
depending on other physical constraints.
