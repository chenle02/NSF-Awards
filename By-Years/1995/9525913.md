9525913 Langer This project is to continue previously funded NSF work on a new
copolymer, poly (lactic acid-co-lysine) PLAL, which is biodegradable, which is
to be used as a matrix to hold mammalian cells, and which may ultimately serve
as an artificial organ. The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose to modify this
polymer to increase the density of attachment sites for cells, to develop
approaches to create photopolymerized polymer systems which could lead to
injectable transplantation systems, and to characterize both of these types of
polymers. ***
