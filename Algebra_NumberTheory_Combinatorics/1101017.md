At the heart of algebraic combinatorics is the philosophy that every aspect of
mathematics can be made more precise, more concrete and more computationally
feasible by identifying key combinatorial structures. This proposal addresses
several specific problems that span a wide range of mathematics including
topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, statistics, computer
science and combinatorics. The central theme is to facilitate computation and
understanding in these areas. The four areas of research include varieties with
combinatorial structures, k-Schur functions, branched polymers, and
combinatorial/statistical algorithms for analyzing ordered data.

The work proposed will have a broad impact in several areas of pure math,
theoretical physics, computer science and statistics. All of the proposed work
will have a computational focus which will further develop algorithms and proof
techniques. All of the proposed work will have a human impact component through
teaching and mentoring of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs doing
research. In terms of education, the PI has initiated a service learning course
to address problems in non-profit organizations and small businesses in our
community through mathematics.
