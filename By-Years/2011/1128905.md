University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Doctoral
Dissertation Research: Urban Food System Alternatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In
the past decade, the local alternative food movement has been discussed as part
of the solution to social problems, such as public health concerns about an
obesity epidemic, environmental degradation, and economic stability. Yet, as
this social movement has become more popular and visible, there has been
criticism that activities, such as shopping at Farmers' Markets, belonging to
food cooperatives, or participating in urban gardening are a luxury of middle
and upper-class citizens who have the time, knowledge, and resources to be part
of this movement. Disadvantaged citizens, such as the working poor, and
racial/ethnic minorities, continue to have less access to quality food, and
subsequently poorer health outcomes. Although there are common messages about
how to best maintain one's health that are part of food system alternatives, how
different citizens are encouraged to "seek health" varies. &lt;br/&gt;The goal
of this research is to investigate whether and how alternative community food
initiatives are used to address health inequalities, how these initiatives vary
according to the social class, race, and gender of the targeted audience,and in
turn, how these different populations engage with and/or seek to transform both
the conventional and alternative food systems in their local communities.
&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate how different institutional spaces of
alternative food activities (a food policy council, farmers' markets, and an
urban garden) engage participants in different ways, how power is exercised, and
where points of resistance lie. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Results from
this research stand to influence food policy at the local, state, or national
level through federal agencies. They may help to improve the work of food-
related non-profit organizations to more appropriately serve the needs of
vulnerable populations, and they could have broader impacts on community
betterment and empowerment.
