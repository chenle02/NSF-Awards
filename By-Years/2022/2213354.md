Condensates have emerged as a provocative new way to understand how cells are
organized. This novel understanding suggests that the cell is occupied by
numerous droplets, each comprised of a small number of member proteins that
preferentially interact with each other. However, the available visual
representations of condensates fail to communicate the growing body of knowledge
about how condensates form and are maintained, and also focuses attention on
only a subset of the potential implications of condensates. We therefore propose
a workshop that will foster a community engaged with constructing a visual
language and new tools to accurately capture the complexity of condensates.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together experts from diverse
disciplines to re-imagine cellular space: about one-third of the participants
will be biologists actively engaged in condensate research, one-third will be
visualization and computation specialists, including modeling experts, data
visualization specialists and molecular animators, and one-third will come from
fields that do not normally engage with cell biology but that have long been
thinking about space and ways to represent it, such as architecture, design,
urbanism, and cognitive science. We will explore specific approaches to
communicate concepts and intuitions about cellular space to colleagues and
students. The representations created in the conference will generate
experimentally-testable hypotheses and allow for the development of new tools
for scientific communication and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
