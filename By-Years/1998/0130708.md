-Title: Principles of Information Dynamics in Basic Neural Circuits: A Hybrid
System Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid systems: biological neurons
interacting with electronic model neurons via electronic or computer simulated
synapses can be a powerful approach for understanding basic neural computational
principles and for building small hybrid and artificial processors that will
create new perspectives for modern information
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on our previous studies on neural
dynamics in living cells, computer models and analog electronic implementations
of model neurons and connections, we are planning to work in two directions: (i)
we will explore the main principles of information processing that uses
dynamical elements, i.e. neurons, synapses and small neural circuits; and (ii)
we will reconfigure real biological networks by utilizing electronic neurons and
synapses in order to transform such circuits into controllable information
devices with new functions and new abilities. &lt;br/&gt;
