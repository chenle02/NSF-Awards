The second international workshop on computational differentiation will be held
on February 12-15, l996 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is being conducted by SIAM
with the cooperation of the special interest group on numerical computing
(SIGNUM) of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). The workshop is
intended to bring together researchers and students working on constructive and
accurate methods for differentiation and their applications. The workshop
attendees will discuss recent advances in theory, implementation, and
application of computational differentiation. The resulting close interaction
between developers of tools and their users in applied mathematics, computation,
science, and engineering will accelerate progress. The researchers and
developers will be able to focus their efforts on the major issues and users
will have a view of what is currently being developed. ***
