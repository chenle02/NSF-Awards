In this two-year program, the P.I. will accomplish the following major tasks:
(1) Synthesis and characterization of block copolymers containing
hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains; the feasibility of synthesis has been
demonstrated in his laboratory; (2) Measurements of diffusivities of solute
molecules in the copolymers; solute molecules of widely different molecular
sizes and hydrophilicities will be used; and (3) Development and verification of
theoretical models for diffusivity.
