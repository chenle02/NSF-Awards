This project is focused on efficient algorithms for performing trusted
computations in a networked environment, with applications to cyber-security.

Intellectual Merit.

The following topics will be investigated:

- Authenticated data structures and algorithms. We will study methods for
authenticating the results of data structures and algorithms, even when those
computations are performed by an untrusted third party on behalf of a trusted
source.

- Audited algorithms. Bringing together recent research on program checking and
space-efficient computations for streaming data, the project will explore a new
computational framework in which computations are performed by a community of
untrusted users and are checked by an external auditor with limited
computational resources.

Broader Impacts.

The proposal is directed at a subject area of critical importance to society --
methods for efficiently maintaining the security of computations and
computational resources, including the networks that communicate vital data.
