In past two decades, undergraduate courses in differential equations and their
applications have undergone revolutionary changes by embracing numerical
simulations and scientific visualization. Several notable commercial software
products, including Phaser, the winner of EDUCOM/NCRIPTAL "Best Mathematics
Software in Higher Education" award in 1989, have made this revolution possible.
The original Phaser has been completely rewritten in Java, a platform-neutral
language with excellent Internet support. Many new visualization features have
been added, notably a Gallery for viewing and organizing multiple simulations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supporting three full-scale development
activities for Phaser:&lt;br/&gt;(a) Developing and distributing freely a
browser version of Phaser, akin to AcrobatReader by Adobe; and facilitating wide
distribution of dynamic Phaser Projects and Galleries over the
Internet.&lt;br/&gt;(b) Creating a portal of multidisciplinary differential and
difference equations&lt;br/&gt;projects in collaboration with mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers, posting these projects on www.phaser.com, and
creating Galleries for dynamical systems and their applications suitable for
beginning and advanced undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;(c) Testing and
evaluating the use of Phaser with students and faculty at diverse
institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, development continues on the
Phaser numerical engine. Methods are being developed and tested for validating
numerical simulations of chaotic systems using the concept of shadowing.
