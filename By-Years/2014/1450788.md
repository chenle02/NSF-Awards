1450788 - Ierapetritou&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is to provide support for
a workshop on Process Intensification that will take place on September 30 and
OCtober 1, 2014. The objective of the workshop is to create a forum where the
main contributions in the area of process intensifivation will be reviewed and
the remaining challenges will be identified. Bringing together academic,
industrial and government participants, the workshop will provide a forum to
identify past successes and look to identify gaps in knowledge that future
research needs to fill. It is hoped that this will lead to identification of
roadblocks to progress in this area as well as efficient ways to overcome these
difficulties so that future efforts lead to more efficient, green and
commercially competitive industrial processes. The workshop will involve at
least 40 participants from academia, industry and
government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from the workshop should not only help
US industry but also generate new educational advances. New Process
Intensification projects will create many educational and training opportunities
where US students can naturally acquire fundamental skills while engaging in
cutting edge research that is very relevant to domestic industry. It is expected
that the concepts generated will qucikly find their way into the syllabi of core
courses such as reaction engineering, separations, unit operations, process
design and control, etc. One of the breakout sessions will specifically address
educational opportunities.
