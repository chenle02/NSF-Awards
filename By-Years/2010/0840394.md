This award supports the Second IFIP Working Conference on "Verified Software:
Theories, Tools, and Experiments (VSTTE 2008)", Oct 6-9, 2008, Toronto, Canada.
The construction of reliable software poses one of the most significant
scientific and engineering challenges of the 21st century. Professor Tony Hoare
of Microsoft Research has proposed the creation of a program verifier as a grand
challenge for computer science and outlined an international program of research
combining many disciplines such as the theory and implementation of programming
languages, formal methods, program analysis, and automated theorem proving. The
VSTTE conference series was established by the research community in response to
this challenge. The VSTTE 2008 program includes three one-day workshops focusing
on the three areas of focus: theories, tools, and experiments. This award is
enabled through support provided by the NITRD High Confidence Software and
Systems (HCSS) interagency Coordinating Group.
