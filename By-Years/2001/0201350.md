This dissertation research will investigate how well a sense of community
survives the rapid incorporation of an existing town into a larger metropolitan
area. Divisions between newcomers and longtimers may emerge in conflicts over
zoning, schools, and political office. These divisions may be reinforced by
distinctive subcultures and interaction networks within the town. As the town
grows and becomes more integrated into the metropolitan area, the town will
become less important as an identity for local residents. These issues will be
investigated using a variety of methods (a survey, oral histories, secondary
data, and ethnographic observation) in Burlington, Kentucky, a small town on the
outskirts of Cincinnati, Ohio.
