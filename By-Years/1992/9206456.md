This award provides one-half the funding needed for the acquisition of a modern
electron microprobe microanalysis system that will be installed and operated in
the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
The University is committed to providing the remaining funds required for this
purchase. The microanalytical capabilities of the electron microprobe (rapid and
automated quantitative chemical analysis of solids with a spatial resolution of
a micrometer) are required for the projects of an active group of researchers in
geology, geophysics, engineering, and materials science at Wisconsin.
