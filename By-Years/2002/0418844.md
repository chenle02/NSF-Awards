A collaboration between mathematical and space scientists provides a novel data
assimilation algorithm, capable of handling temporally and spatially
inhomogeneous data sets, to assemble (in a model-useful format) an extensive
amount of total electron content (TEC) data. These data are assembled from
ionosonde networks, GPS receiver networks, satellite electron density
measurements, radio occultation data, and other sources. The data are then
described in a multi-resolution ionosphere model using spherical wavelet
functions, and a regional description of the ionosphere in the equatorial
anomaly is a primary focus of the model application. The methodology takes
resultant ionospheric multi-dimensional regional ionospheric maps, generated by
the data assimilation and the wavelet description, and then updates the
International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model for improved global ionospheric
model accuracy. The research expects to significantly improve operational
predictive capability.
