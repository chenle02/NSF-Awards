0122911&lt;br/&gt;Kondic &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will
support Dr. Ljubinko Lou Kondic of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in
collaboration with Dr. Javier A. Diez of the Institute of Physics of the
Universidad Nacional del Centro in Tandil, Argentina. The researchers intend to
work on the computational and theoretical analysis of the interface dynamics and
instabilities in thin film flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main subject of the
proposed research is to apply existing, and develop new compu- tational methods
for a variety of problems related to thin film flows. In particular the
researchers will concentrate on problems where the fundamental issues related to
the development of instability are still not well understood. This includes thin
film flows on imperfect surfaces, flows of non-Newtonian fluids, and surfactant
flows. They also plan to extend computational and theoretical methods to other
areas (such as spin coating) that are relevant, not only because of challenging
theoretical and computational issues, but also because of their importance in a
variety of technological applications. The research will combine the U.S.
researcher's expertise with the computational aspects of the project with the
Argentinean researcher's theoretical expertise. &lt;br/&gt;
