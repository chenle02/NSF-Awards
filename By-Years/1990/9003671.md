The long term goals of this research project are two fold: (1) to obtain a
concise description of how an ion channel system functions efficiently in an ion
selective mode and (2) to develop experimental techniques and theoretical
interpretations that can be applied to the study of more complex biological
transport systems in the future. Multinuclei-multidimensional NMR spectroscopy,
together with peptide synthesis will be used to study the effect of single amino
acid substitution in the gramicidin transport system. The effect of this
substitution on channel structure, on the integration of the gramicidin into a
membrane, on channel formation, and on cation binding and transport will be
observed and characterized.
