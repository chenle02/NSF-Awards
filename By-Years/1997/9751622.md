Current work with Ostrinia nubilalis, in the introductory biology laboratory
courses, has resulted in successful learning experiences for students. This
course enrolls large numbers of students (2,000/year) many of whom are elmentary
education majors. This insect has great potential for development as a model
organism. With its short life cycle (approximately 5 weeks) and ease of culture,
Ostrinia nubilalis could duplicate this success in a wide range of laboratory
settings. This project fully develops Ostrinia as a model animal system that can
be used in investigative laboratories in beginning biology. During its
development, ongoing evaluation is taking place. The work being done with
Ostrinia may be presented at the Association for Biology Laboratory Education,
the National Association for Research in Science Teaching, the National Science
Teachers Association, and the National Association of Biology Teachers. As part
of these presentations, peer feedback can be solicited. *
