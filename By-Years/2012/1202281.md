The objective of this program is to fabricate and characterize thin-film
transistors (TFTs) and associated large-area circuits, with focuses on both
improving device performance for TFT applications and understanding the
mechanisms responsible for NW based device performance variations and
reliability. The intellectual merit includes a well-integrated effort which will
correlate the device and circuit performance to the materials and structures.
The transformative nature of the program includes a focus on addressing overall
issues associated with achieving operation at megahertz (MHz) to gigahertz (GHz)
frequencies, in contrast to previous studies which have typically addressed
basic materials issues and low-frequency performance. The interdisciplinary
program will provide a means to utilize the developed thin film technology in
two niche applications that are expected to have a large share of the future
high tech market,namely flexible displays and radio-frequency identification
chips (RFIDs). Two proof-of-concept circuits, a flexible color display and a
super regenerative RFID tag, will be developed. The broader impacts of the
program include the technological relevance of new device and circuit concepts
for applications in thin film electronics, including display technologies and RF
circuitry. The program will develop nanowire TFTs and associated circuits that
can be fabricated reliably and consistently using simple low temperature
fabrication processes. The program also includes an integrated education and
outreach effort aimed at addressing challenges in nanotechnologyrelated
education/training arising from the interdisciplinary nature of many of the
projects, and at providing opportunities for participants from under-represented
groups.
