Bradley University with participation and support from major educational
institutions and industry, and a strong working partnership with CICNet, the
state of Illinois Central Management Services (CMS), and with considerable
networking experience within its member shop, has developed a communications
network known as netIllinois. This network in cooperation with sixteen (16)
Illinois colleges and universities (Aurora University, College of Saint Francis,
Illinois Central College, Knox College, Lewis University, Monmouth College,
Moraine Valley Community College, National-Louis University, North Central
College, Rockford College, Roosevelt University, Rosary College, Saint Xavier
College, Southern Illinois University Medical School Library, University of
Health Sciences/ The Chicago Medical School, and William Rainey Harper College)
requests support to connect these institutions to netIllinois. The requested
connections will support connectivity to netIllinois,m CICNET, NSFNET, and the
greater Internet. It will also provide access to state, regional, and national
computing resources and databases; and foster communication and collaboration
among teachers, students, scholars, and researchers at these institutions and
their peers within the worldwide education and research community. The network
will provide a consistent statewide architecture for NSFNET access for a broad
variety of entities engaged in education and research. This cooperative network
will provide gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will
be consistent with their standards. It will further the institutions' work in
enhancing the state's economic development through a well-educated workforce,
accessible training opportunities, and research and development partnerships.
Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and sharing
of resources between institutions, including those outside the state.
