9321930 BRANSCOMB This project is Phase 2 of a three-phase project to study the
science and technology policy support available to state legislatures and, in
cooperation with legislators, to explore alternative models for meeting their
needs. In Phase 1 (not supported by NSF) of this study, conducted during the
spring of 1993 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, the investigators
surveyed 50 state legislatures and received 100 percent response. This high
level of interest suggests that the issue is both important and timely; it does
not suggest that the state legislative bodies are well supported and do not need
to be exploring affordable and practical alternatives for improving their
capabilities. At stake is the legitimacy of state government and the
accountability of technical experts who may be advocates, critics, or advisors.
Phase 2 involves the on-site study of 6 to 10 selected states to provide a valid
basis for evaluation of the need for S&amp;T support and the adequacy of current
resources. A conference will be convened to review recommendations from which
one or more model legislative-support structures will be designed. The final
stage, which the investigators will fund from non-NSf sources, will be the
implementation of the model in one or more states.
