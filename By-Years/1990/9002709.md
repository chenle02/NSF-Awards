This proposal is to deploy a suite of current meter moorings in the Pacific
Ocean near New Zealand to measure the influx of deep waters into the Pacific
Basin. The meters will be recovered after two years. In association with the
mooring, hydrographic and tracer data will be collected. The work is coordinated
with proposals by Nowlin (8917338) and Warren (9002708) and the New Zealand
Oceanographic Institution. It is a component of the World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE).
