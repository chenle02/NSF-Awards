Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to explore,
uncover, and control the rich nonlinear and quantum dynamics of light
propagation that arise because of the presence of multiple, nonlinearly-coupled
modes in multimode optical waveguides. This research is transformative in that
it establishes a rigorous theoretical and experimental framework of this
uncharted territory to develop fundamental understanding and to investigate
novel device application.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, efficient generation of
quantum-entangled photon pairs in nonlinear multimode optical fibers will be
explored in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop a parallel
theoretical and experimental platform that integrates fundamental research on
nonlinear and quantum dynamics of multimode waveguides with novel device
applications.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is in response to the emerging
needs of the photonics community for a rigorous and comprehensive treatment of
the nonlinear and quantum aspects of light propagation in multimode optical
waveguides, such as in the emerging field of multimode-multiplexed fiber-optic
communications for ultra-high-data-rate transmission, and for better security in
quantum cryptography using the modal-entanglement
platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts are to obtain the mastery of nonlinear and quantum phenomena in
multimode waveguides, which is vital to the national security and technological
competitiveness of the United States for the development of the next generation
of optical communication devices; and to integrate cutting-edge research with
education using initiatives that include curriculum development, expansion of
the photonics teaching laboratory, and continuing with the annual summer
workshop program for teachers of the Milwaukee Public Schools system.
