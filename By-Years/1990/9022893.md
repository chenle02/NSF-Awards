Wellesley College has supported a herbarium for more than a century, and the
Wellesley lichen collections are historically important for systematic and
ecological research. Recent changes in the composition of the biology faculty at
Wellesley have left the herbarium without an appropriate curator. The College
decided to discontinue its support for the herbarium in the late 1980's, and in
1988 the collection (70,000 vascular plants and 20,000 cryptogams) was
transferred to the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG). Dr. J. Kallunki, Curator at
NYBG, proposes to repair specimens, transfer them to new sheets and folders, and
integrate them into the Garden's herbarium. Systematic collections such as the
Wellesley herbarium are critical resources for the study of biological
diversity. The long-term maintenance and growth of natural history collections
are essential for future generations of research. The New York Botanical
Garden's willingness to incorporate the Wellesley herbarium will protect it from
an uncertain future, and will make it available to the research community in a
timely fashion.
