9355569 Crow Participating in a series of three-week institutes and eight
academic year follow-up meetings, a core of 45 leader science teachers from
middle schools in the Houston Independent School District will gain new skills
in instructional practices, student assessment, test and measurement statistics,
and important related science content. This core group will then serve as
workshop leaders and as a human resource for their peers in their schools and
district. The goal of this three-year project is to produce assessment literate,
subject matter competent teachers who can implement authentic assessment of
science, use the best science teaching practices and provide the classroom
environment needed to achieve the goals specified by current science reforms
such as Project 2061, Scope Sequence and Coordination and the emerging national
standards. The project uses a three part model that directly links the desired
goals for students, the behavior of the teacher (including assessment), and the
role of the student necessary to achieve these goals. Intertwined with this
model is the need for teachers to understand the targeted science concepts and
relevant statistical test measurements. The project includes a research
component to assess its effectiveness and its impact on student learning.
