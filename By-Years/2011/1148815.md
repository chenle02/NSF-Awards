Wide-scale deployment of wireless sensor networks has been hindered primarily by
the inability to endure for long durations on small power sources. The focus of
this project is on creating computationally efficient electronics to extend the
lifetimes of wireless sensor nodes. Ultra-low-power analog circuitry is used to
provide additional computational resources at each sensor node while
simultaneously reducing the total power consumed. This project systematically
addresses how to effectively use analog signal processing in a wide variety of
wireless sensor network applications by investigating (1) the creation of
modifiable, easy-to-use smart-sensor architectures for ultra-low-power
computation, (2) continuous-time signal-processing approaches for event-
detection systems (including biologically inspired processing), and (3) ultra-
low-power memory storage and data conversion techniques.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this research is in providing the
knowledge necessary to create drastically improved nodes for wireless sensor
networks in terms of power consumption and computational ability. The same low-
power design techniques can be used for a variety of other power-constrained
applications such as consumer electronics and biomedical/implantable devices.
Integrating education and outreach with the research of this project will lead
to (1) close mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in a team-centric
environment, (2) cross-disciplinary coursework, and (3) high-school outreach
activities to expose many new students, including those from underrepresented
groups, to engineering and electronic systems.
