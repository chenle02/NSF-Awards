Research in Generative Lexicon Theory: The Semantics of Complex Types The goal
of this research is to study the role of the mental dictionary within the
cognitive apparatus underlying language use, from the dual perspective of formal
linguistics and computational modeling. Our investigation focuses on the complex
nature of words by addressing the problem of the "multiplicity of meaning",
namely the way in which humans combine words in a creative way to generate an
infinite number of senses out of a finite vocabulary of semantic types. The
consequences of this research are cross-disciplinary, since a linguistic account
of the formal properties of language meaning has implications for the
psychological modeling of the activities responsible for production, generation,
and categorization. Contrasting a generative view of word meaning to a static
sense- enumeration approach, we are interested in identifying the nature of the
universal components of the lexicon and their role in elucidating the
compositional processes involved in language use.
