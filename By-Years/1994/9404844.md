Winslow 9404844 The objective of this research is to utilize modern principles
of nonlinear dynamical system theory in conjunction with the power of massively
parallel computing to study, in great biophysical detail, the effects of
ischemia on the dynamics of single cardiac cells and networks. It will use a
physiologically detailed model of single cardiac cells which consists of 16
coupled ordinary differential equations. Tools for chaos theory will then be
used to analyze the model.
