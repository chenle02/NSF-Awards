9305018 Agrawal The principal objective of this research is to investigate the
role that feedback can play at the cell level control in ATM networks to affect
explicitly the amount of excess traffic released into the network. The thesis is
that feedback based schemes can achieve better throughput -- packet loss/delay
tradeoffs than schemes that are essentially open-loop at the cell level. A
layered framework does require the network elements to provide feedback on their
congestion level to the access regulators. In that sense the schemes explored in
this research augment the currently emerging framework. The principal
investigator describes a precise mathematical framework for the work and
identifies several time constraints and parameters critical in assessing the
efficacy of feedback based schemes. ***
