A major goal of the CEDAR (Coupling,Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric
Regions ) program is an understanding of global ionospheric-thermospheric
coupling. The equatorial region is of major interest in the overall
understanding of the global picture. This project proposes to carry out
extensive coordinated studies using the incoherent scatter radar at Jicamarca,
Peru and the Fabry-Perot Interferometer observations from Arequipa, Peru. This
will compare the effects of the electron density profiles and the vertical
plasma drift velocities with the thermospheric neutral winds. The results will
be compared with the available ionospheric and thermospheric models. ***
