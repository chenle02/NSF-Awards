With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San Francisco State University will
acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including studies on a) the environmental fate,
transport and bioavailability of heavy metals and toxic trace elements in soil,
sediment and groundwater; and b) novel zeolite intercalation compounds such as
alkali metal doped pure silica zeolites.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full
three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles,
and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the
molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an
impact in a number of areas, especially synthesis of important materials science
and environmental chemistry.
