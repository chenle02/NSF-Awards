The objective of this research is to program self-assembly into nanoparticle
building blocks. The approach is to break the symmetry of spherical
nanoparticles by selectively patterning one hemisphere or less. Through
subsequent chemical attachment of polymer chains to one of the two regions on
the nanoparticle surface, the interaction between different nanoparticles can be
precisely controlled. Factors such as polymer chain length, polymer side chain
functionality and chemical crosslinking of the polymer chains can be varied to
yield a desired arrangement.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The development of methods to
manipulate nanoparticles and lock them into predefined structures provides new
possibilities for designing and constructing objects and materials that have
dimensions on the nanometer scale. In the past few years, it has become possible
to synthesize a range of nanometer-sized particles with unusual electrical,
optical, and magnetic properties. The gateway to the eventual success of
nanoscience and nanotechnology will be the programmed assembly of such
nanometer-sized building blocks into functional devices. The proposed research
will develop new assembly methods for nanoparticles and will provide a sound
scientific foundation for translating nanotechnology from the laboratory to
practice. &lt;br/&gt;
