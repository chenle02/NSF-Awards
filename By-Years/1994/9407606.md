9407606 McCourt In an intriguing and challenging application of both molecular
and morphological data to a problem in phylogeny, Professor Richard McCourt at
DePaul University will be studying the algal group known as stoneworts, the
Charophyta. Representatives of all seven genera of living members of the group
will be analyzed for a number of genes by nucleotide sequencing methods, to
acquire data on mutational differences among the species. Morphological features
of these same taxa along with data on the rich record of fossil forms of these
algae, acquired in collaboration with French paleobotanical colleagues, will be
integrated with the DNA results to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of
the charophytes. The charophytes are relatively large and complex for algae;
they have growing regions at the apex of branches and flagellated sperm cells
that are more similar to those of certain land plants than to other green algae.
As one of the algal groups closest phylogenetically to the land plants, the
charophytes are likely to show evolutionary adaptations that will help
understand the sequence of changes in the origin of land plants. As well, their
fossil record provides an opportunity to calibrate rates of molecular change in
genes.
