While many communities have deployed key components needed to deliver smart
community services, many cities currently lack the necessary data platforms or
staff expertise to handle the complexities of gathering, analyzing, or sharing
smart community data. This challenge will become significantly more difficult as
sensors, vehicles, and other sources provide more real-time data. Without such
platforms, along with modeling and visualization tools, the promise of smart
city technologies will remain unattainable, especially for smaller or low-income
communities. Big data analytic tools have become a critical missing link to
smart community solutions and there is a growing demand from a variety of
computer science disciplines, along with industry researchers and municipal
governments, to share best practices and best-of-breed tools. Creating an
approach that allows for the development of secure, open, flexible, and scalable
smart community big data solutions will have lasting societal impact.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the Smart Community Big Data Co-operative (the Co-
op), US Ignite will leverage its 100 city, university, industry, and nonprofit
partners to design, build and use the important capability of big data sharing
to enhance local smart community efforts and generate enhanced community
services. Communities are looking to quickly identify current gaps in their
real-time data, applications, and modeling tools to design a cohesive smart
community strategy with local partners. This current effort will extend this
formula to launch new forms of smart community research, applications, and
services that benefit end users through open data and data analytics. US Ignite
will ensure alignment among all parties interests in supporting big data and
smart community applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
