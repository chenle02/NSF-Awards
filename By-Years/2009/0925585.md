This research is to design and evaluate an Internet architecture that is
resistant to Denial-of-Service (DoS) flooding attacks of any scale. DoS attacks
have become an increasing threat to the reliability of the Internet. These
attacks are capable of knocking any user, site, and server right off the
Internet. This research targets the root cause of the DoS flooding problem: the
network's inability to intelligently handle overload. When DoS attacks occur,
the network drops legitimate traffic and attack traffic alike, leading to heavy
losses of legitimate traffic, which in turn triggers the TCP-friendly backoff of
legitimate clients, further reducing the volume of legitimate traffic. One
approach to robustly distinguish legitimate and attack traffic is network
capabilities. Capabilities are short-term authorizations that senders request
from receivers and stamp on their packets. They allow a destination to classify
traffic into two broad categories: authorized traffic and unauthorized traffic.
With capabilities, the network is able to discard unauthorized traffic in favor
of authorized traffic, and protects authorized communications from unauthorized
attempts. This research will design and evaluate a DoS-resistant network
architecture that builds on the concept of capabilities. It will also compare
the costs and benefits of this solution with solutions that build on other
primitives, such as black-list filters.
