This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
2018 East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium that will be held on October 13 and
14, 2018, on the campus of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas.

This conference is the sixteenth installment of the East Coast Operator Algebra
Symposium (ECOAS), a series that annually brings together a diverse group of
mathematicians with broad research interests in the theory of operator algebras,
both C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras as well as noncommutative geometry.
Some of the 2018 areas of emphasis will be on the following topics: the theory
of subfactors, deformation/rigidity theory, free probabilty, classification of
C*-algebras (the Elliott program), the C*-algebra approach to the Novikov
conjecture, C*-algebras and dynamical systems, the Baum-Connes conjecture,
noncommutative differential geometry, and index theory. The conference program
provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young
scientists to present their work.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
