The principal investigator on this project will continue studying the structure
of projective modules over affine algebras and their application to ideal theory
of affine algebras. Specifically, cancellation properties of projective modules
and the question of set-theoretic complete intersection for affine varieties
will be investigated. The principal investigator will also consider embedding
questions for affine varieties. This research is concerned with questions
involving algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. This is a very active area
of mathematics at present. The outcome could have a substantial impact on the
directions in which this area is heading.
