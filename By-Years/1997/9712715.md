The goal of this research project is to investigate issues involved in the
implementation of image databases containing symbols. The issues involve the
specification of queries with a preference given to a graphical specification as
well as the development of algorithms to process the queries. A query is
specified with exemplars of the symbols that are to be found in the database.
The symbols in the database are not necessarily classified in advance thereby
permitting variation in the quality of the match. Queries to the database
involve matching contextual, and spatial constrains. The order in which he
different constraints are checked for satisfaction is not fixed, the query
optimizer chooses the optimal order. The query images can contain one or more
instances of each symbol. The user can specify if all of the symbols must
satisfy the spatial constraints or if a maximal subset is also permitted. In the
latter case, there is a need for a specification technique for the required
subset as well as for the response. The spatial constraints include topological
relations such as overlap, encloses, and intersects as well as distance and
direction. The symbols are not restricted to point objects thereby also
including objects with extent such as lines and areas. The query processing and
specification method is integrated with an existing spatial and non-spatial
database to enable queries about non-spatial attributes of objects corresponding
to the symbols. The results of this research will improve the ability of
symbolic image databases and geographic information systems (GIS) to efficiently
handle large spatial problems, e.g., adding fiber cables in city planning.
