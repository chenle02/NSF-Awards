Most of the solar energy that drives the atmosphere enters through the tropics.
Understanding how the atmosphere behaves depends then on understanding how the
tropical atmosphere and its major weather systems work and relate to the
extratropics. This project involves the study of the dynamics of large-scale
atmospheric motions in the tropics and in the Asia-Pacific monsoonal region. The
principal investigators will combine several approaches, including theoretical
and numerical modeling as well as analysis of observational data, to investigate
a variety of motion systems. These systems include the planetary scale 30-50 day
oscillations, propagating and stationary tropical waves, zonally varying mean
flows and related disturbances, and the various monsoon circulations ranging
from the summer monsoon trough over East Asia (Mei-yu) to winter monsoon cold
surges. The purpose is to understand the structure, behavior and dynamic and
thermodynamic mechanisms of these systems and the interactions and
interrelationships among them. Possible interactions of these motion systems
with weather and climate outside of the tropics and monsoon regions will also be
investigated.
