9306392 Gelbaum Investigators in the Schools of Chemistry and Biochemistry,
Biology, Chemical Engineering, the Research Center for Biotechnology at the
Georgia Institute of Technology and the Institute for Paper Science and
Technology request funds for an upgrade of a Varian XL-400, 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer. At the present time this is the only instrument on the Georgia
Tech Campus that is completely multinuclear and on which one can reserve time
for long term multidimensional NMR experiments. A Varian Gemini 300, 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer located in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry is only capable
of running lH and 13C spectra and is used so extensively that time can be
reserved for only short periods. In addition it does not have the capabilities
necessary to carry out research in the area of structure and dynamics of
biologically important systems. The recent shift in emphasis of several Georgia
Tech departments to more biomolecular related areas make it essential that we
increase the capabilities of our instrument to carry out the most important
multidimensional NMR experiments i.e. TOCSY and NOESY in 90% H2O. The XL-400
NMR, for which we are requesting an upgrade, serves the entire Georgia Tech
community, therefore, a description of all of the research projects that will
utilize the new upgrade would be too extensive for this proposal. Some of the
research projects that will require the upgraded instrument include the
investigations of: protein structure and folding (Briggs), structure and
dynamics of G.G mismatch (Gelbaum), protease and protease inhibitors (Powers),
fundamental investigations of xylanases (Ragauskas), NMR studies on mammalian
cells (Sambanis), complexes of intercalators with DNA lesions (Williams) and
isolation and synthesis of chemotherapeutic agents (Zalkow).
