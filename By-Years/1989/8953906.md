A non-traditional, entirely new course is being developed under this pilot
project through live Mathematica notebooks. Emphasis is placed upon individual
student use of the Mathematica program for instruction, computation, and
symbolic manipulation within the Mathematica notebooks. The goal is to motivate
the students to better understand the foundations and enable them to execute
calculations far beyond those expected of students in the traditional course.
