The Gordon Research Conference on Physics and Chemistry of Laser Diagnostics in
Combustion is a high quality gathering of experts. It is held biennially in New
Hampshire to review the state of the art and promising directions. Although the
program is structured to cover all relevant aspects of the field, considerable
flexibility is built in so that truly creative discussions can take place and
new directions emerge. In the many scientific areas covered by the Gordon
program, the name has become synonymous with quality. A 12-month grant is
recommended in the amount of $3,500.
