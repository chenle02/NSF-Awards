The focus of this project is on creating new techniques for understanding
population analytics over a space of interest, e.g., a shopping mall, a busy
street, or an entire city. Knowledge of population behavior important for many
applications. For instance, knowledge of which are the busy corners of city
sidewalk can provide city planners with input on where to invest city resources.
Knowledge of where people congregate in a shopping mall allows officials to plan
where to provide useful services, e.g., information kiosks, floor plans, and
more. The process of gathering population analytics today is tedious -- some
stores and shops use manual people counters to track how many persons are
entering wireless technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical contributions
of this project are two-fold. First, it is attempting to reduce the complexity
of determining location of people by reducing the number of infrastructure
points needed. Second, automated approaches to population analytics are fraught
with privacy concerns, and this project is examining techniques that mitigate
such concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personnel involved in this project will be
trained in significant technical skills across a broad set of domains including
wireless technologies, privacy techniques, and machine
learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To demonstrate the feasibility of this project,
the PI team is deploying a version of the system in an urban downtown area of
Madison, WI. The team is collaborating with a number of local partners -- the
city of Madison, the University of Wisconsin Bookstore, 5NINES (a local Internet
Service Provider), and a few local participants. Together they are entering this
technology demonstration as part of the Global City Teams Challenge being hosted
by NSF and NIST.
