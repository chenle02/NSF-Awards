The volatilization and condensation of potassium, sodium, silica, calcium, and
other mineral matter of several species of woodand bark will be studied in a
tube furnace using SEM and ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical
analysis)/AES (Auger electron spectroscopy) to investigate the chemical and
physical behavior of the mineral matter during combustion and gasification. The
formation of particulate matter nodules on the surface of wood and bark char
will be studied in situ using fiber optics. It is proposed to develop a
temperature-time map to better understand the effects of temperature and
residence time relationship on the release of volatile minerals and particulate
formation. Over one half of the wood harvested in the United States and over
three quarters of the wood harvested in the world are used for fuel for
residential and industrial heat, hot water, steam, and electricity. Mineral
matter is a minor component of wood but during combustion, mineral matter
corrodes and fouls furnaces and boilers, forms air-polluting particles in stack
gases, and results in ash, which poses a disposal problem. Extensive research
has been done on the behavior of the mineral matter in fossil fuels so that
their effects on the combustion system and environment can be minimized. There
is no information, however, to describe the behavior of the mineral matter in
wood fuels during combustion. The basic information obtained in this study can
lead to the design of more efficient and environmentally safer combustion
systems.
