The team of S. Burges and P. De Vries (Univ. of Washington) and G. Parker (Univ.
of Minnesota) plan collaborative research into the mechanics of coarse bedload
transport at the particle scale. Gravel tracer particles are a convenient way to
study the longitudinal travel and dispersion and vertical mixing of sediment in
mountain rivers. Field observations of tracer displacement have not yet,
however, been linked comprehensively into the formal framework of sediment
transport in rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will use experiments as a
bridge between theoretical/numerical research and field-scale research to a)
develop formulations for distance moved, dispersion and mixing of tracers for
unsteady flow, b) link these formulations to mechanistic theories of bedload
transport and c) test and validate the results against field data taken to the
standards needed to test theory and numerical
predictions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field research will be conducted in
several streams in western Washington State. The experimental research will be
conducted at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. The Washington and Minnesota teams
will collaborate on both efforts, with both sides contributing to the
development of a predictive numerical model.&lt;br/&gt;
