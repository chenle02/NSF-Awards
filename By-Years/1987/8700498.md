This project will focus on problems of rational interpolation and approximation
in the complex domain. Emphasis will be placed on Pade approximants and related
continued fractions. Constructive methods of complex analysis will be developed
for the study of convergence, speed of convergence, acceleration of convergence,
truncation error analysis, moment theory and stability analysis. Methods of
numerical analysis and large-scale computations will be used both for numerical
experimentation (to gain new insight into complex problems) and for numerical
results on the computation of special functions. The work involves fundamental
mathematical analysis with applications to digital filtering and signal
processing, to the theory of special functions and to the solution of nonlinear
Riccati differential equations. Digital signal processing has applications to
diverse areas such as astronomy, economics, electrical power planning, medicine,
radar, seismology and speech processing. It is expected that the project will
add significantly to the present state of knowledge of rational approximation
and point out new directions for future research.
