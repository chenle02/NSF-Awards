9625992 Gastaldo This grant provides $7,750 in support of the costs of acquiring
a modified Fisher 1650 MV aluminum boat with a 40 hp Mercury outboard and an
aluminum vibracore rack and working platform for the Department of Geology at
Auburn University. This equipment is essential to the PI's active field research
programs studying tropical and temperate plant taphonomy in fluvio-deltaic
systems both in the southeastern U.S. and also in southeast Asia. The new
equipment will replace a twenty year old jon boat and trailer which are nearing
the end of their useful life and present potential safety hazards. The vibracore
rack and working platform are necessary to conduct both water column and
vibracore sampling from the boat. The PI's research on the fate of plant
materials in recent sedimentary environments are of fundamental importance for
understanding the palynological fossil record. Additionally, the use of this
equipment provides valuable field experiences to graduate and undergraduate
students. ***
