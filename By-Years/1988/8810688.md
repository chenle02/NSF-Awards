This award will support a two year program of research in four ecologically
distinct communities in Inner Mongolia. The principal investigators, an
anthropologist from Hunter College CUNY and a sociologist from the University of
Toronto will carry out the research in collaboration with Chinese scholars from
Beijing University. The project will examine how the productive arrangements of
the society (animal husbandry, agriculture, mixed animal-agriculture, and
commercial) influence family and demographic variables as well as migration,
social mobility and changes in occupation, income, residence and levels of
education. A survey conducted in the summer of 1988 will be followed by an in
depth study of a sample of households.
