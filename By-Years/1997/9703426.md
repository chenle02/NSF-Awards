9703426 Zhang Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) presents a challenge in
fabrication of truly three-dimensional (3D) and high aspect ration
microstructures. Conventional IC-based approaches can not deliver a feasible
solution to this challenge due to its planar nature. This research project
studies a novel non-IC laser-based technology for 3D high aspect ration
microstructures through micromachining. A novel doping technique to achieve
ultra-shallow micromachining of 10-20nm in depth for CD-ROM will be
investigated. The outcomes of the research could generate an array of
opportunities in the areas of optical data storage and bio-medical engineering.
The research activities will be balanced by an education plan to improve the
quality of graduate and undergraduate education at the Pennsylvania State
University.
