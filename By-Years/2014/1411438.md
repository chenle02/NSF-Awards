The principal investigator studies complex network structures in amphiphilic
mixtures under a framework that includes degenerate diffusion and functionalized
Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) energy. Network structures in complex systems have close
relations to phase transitions, materials science, and mathematical biology. He
develops methods to model and analyze the development of structures in
amphiphilic mixtures and their properties. Such systems include biological
membranes and polymer materials like polymer electrolyte membranes. Biological
membranes play critical roles in biological processes such as protein
transportation, drug encapsulation and delivery. Polymer electrolyte membranes
are key ingredients of fuel cells that are able to efficiently produce clean
energy and are a promising replacement for traditional batteries. Their
effectiveness is directly related to their fine structures. In the course of
this project, a graduate student and an undergraduate student are trained.

The principal investigator concentrates on the influence of degenerate diffusion
on the dynamics of complex amphiphilic structures, the variational properties of
the functionalized Cahn-Hilliard energy, and their relation to amphiphilic
structures. He formulates bilayers, filamentous pores, micelles, and defect
structures such as open edges, end caps, and triple junctions, as minimizers of
the FCH energy, and relates them to variational properties of the FCH energy
under various geometric constraints. By building degenerate diffusion into the
FCH equation, he is able to model biologically significant phenomena such as the
co-existence of bilayer vesicles of various sizes and shapes, the diffusion of
lipid molecules along lipid bilayer membranes, and the impermeability of
bilayers. He studies the evolution of the defects and the sensitivity of their
energies to parametric variation, and identifies the energetic cost for the
defects to form. The tools developed in this project have wide applications in
the modeling of other physical and biological systems, and in the study of other
problems in applied mathematics related to nonlinear PDEs.
