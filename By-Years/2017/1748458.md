This project provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of NSF's
Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP)Science Policy Research
Reports. The principal investigators of each of the seventeen reports will be
invited to present a report that provides evidence-based recommendations for
policy and practice.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be organized around
seven major themes: (1) improving communication to facilitate more informed
decision making;(2) improving data for decision makers;(3) investigation of
tools to support innovation, such as inducement prizes; (4) benefits of
interdisciplinary and collaborative research efforts; (5) benefits of research
portfolios versus large projects; (6) impacts of inclusivity and immigration on
the science labor force; and (7) opportunities for entrepreneurism. Members of
STEP's Innovation Policy Forum will serve as moderators.
