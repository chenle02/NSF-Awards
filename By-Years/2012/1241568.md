This project at the Polytechnic University of New York (NYU-Poly) is training a
cadre of two-year and four-year faculty in cyber security. The faculty, who are
recruited from urban inner-cities with socially diverse, economically
disadvantaged, and underrepresented students, engage in an intensive six-week
summer cyber-security course and also participate in on-going, cutting-edge
cyber-security research projects with their mentors from NYU-Poly. The program
provides the faculty with arc of experience starting from knowledge acquisition
in the summer workshop, application and integration of the knowledge in a
research project, transmission of this knowledge as they teach their classes,
mentoring of their student teams for the Capture the Flag challenge, and finally
the culmination of their experience in the national Capture the Flag challenge
conducted by NYU-Poly that attracts thousands of students. Faculty develop and
hone their research, communication, and presentation skills, which are critical
to their professional growth and success. The faculty are introduced to a topic
of critical national need and mentored to develop and offer courses that, in
turn, introduce their students to concepts and challenges in cyber security. The
project team is disseminating the results of project through the competitions
and the TeachEngineering digital library, for adoption by others.
