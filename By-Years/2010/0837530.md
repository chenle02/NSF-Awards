Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The infrastructure in the United
States is aging and in some cases is exceeding its original design capacity.
Revitalizing and rebuilding infrastructure will be a significant endeavor in the
coming years, yet resources for this work are not unlimited. Knowledge in multi-
disciplinary aspects of infrastructure management and the collateral impacts of
infrastructure choices will be required for practicing engineers. Through this
project two new courses are being developed and rigorously assessed. The first
course is aimed at civil engineering undergraduates to help students develop a
broad understanding of the issues with regards to improving the infrastructure.
The second course is aimed at non-engineering majors to promote understanding of
infrastructure needs to the general public. Students enrolled in both courses
will work jointly on a project on infrastructure evaluation as part of a service
learning component. In addition, an annotated bibliography is being developed
with a focus on infrastructure topics including technical aspects, public
policy, socio-economic impact, and global competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;
