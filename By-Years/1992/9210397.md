Compromised brain function can occur in the absence of apparent structural
damage. Certain types of brain scans which show only structural features may
appear normal, yet other types of scans based on the metabolic activity of the
neurons will show changes in discrete brain regions that are related to the
functional disturbances. In this award to Drs. Ruthmary Deuel and Lyndon
Hibbard, the metabolism of brain regions will be measured by the method of
2-deoxy-D-glucose, which is a metabolic marker. The syndrome of hemineglect will
be produced by cortical damage and changes in metabolic activity in areas
removed from the damage itself will be studied during the recovery process. The
syndrome of hemineglect involves an abnormality of spatially directed attention
and motor performance. The precise localization of neuronal metabolic changes
associated with this syndrome will be studied by computer reconstruction of
brain sections. This work will contribute to understanding brain function in
normal individuals and during recovery from damage.
