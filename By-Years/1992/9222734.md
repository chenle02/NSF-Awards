This project is concerned with the analysis, implementation and simulation of
asynchronous algorithms. Asynchronous algorithms do not require synchronization
and thus are particularly suitable for large-scale multiprocessors or massively
parallel systems. Moreover, asynchronous algorithms are tolerant to processor
and link failures and easily adapt to changes in parameters or sensor data in
real-time embedded systems. The theoretical analysis of convergence considers
models with stochastic delays. Asynchronous algorithms running on a
multiprocessor are processes with random communication delays. With this
approach complex problems such as the effects of random message delays due to
variable load conditions in the interconnection network and the reliability
issues related to probabilistic link or processor failures are easily analyzed.
The approach is also applied to the analysis of problems in which the solution
changes with time and of algorithms with good time-adaptation. Finally, the
convergence of algorithms which are trapped in periodic orbits can be improved
through randomization techniques. Six asynchronous algorithms with the above
features are implemented on the Intel Touchstone DELTA machine accessible at
Caltech. Extensive evaluation of each algorithm is performed in order to assess
the effectiveness of asynchronous algorithms in the context of large-scale
multiprocessor systems.
