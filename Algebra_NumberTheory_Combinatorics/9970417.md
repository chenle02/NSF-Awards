Abstract

Daquing Wan UC Irvine 9970417

Professor Wan will continue his study of the p-adic of L-functions arising from
algebraic geometry over a finite field of characteristic p. The central problem
in this study is a 1973 conjecture of Dwork about the p-adic continuation of the
L function of a unit root F-chrystal. Prof. Wan will try to establish the
general validity of this conjecture. He will also investigate the arithmetic
consequences of the conjecture including higher dimensional generalizations of
the Gouvea-Mazur conjecture, and the zeros of certain geometric L-functions, and
the connections with the mysterious mirror map that arises from a family of
Calabi-Yau varieties.

This is a project in number theory and algebraic geometry. One of mathematics
oldest branches, number theory is the study of numbers that can be expressed
exactly in terms of the simplest counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In the second
half of this century, modern geometry has had a tremendous impact on number
theory introducing new methods and new problems. The development of algebraic
geometry has paralleled advances in number theory for the past 30 years.
Professor Wan will study geometric objects defined over the simplest possible
mathematical basis for such a geometry, a finite field. These are simultaneously
the simplest and most intriguing objects in algebraic geometry. They have found
very practical application in communications, security, and other surprising
areas.
