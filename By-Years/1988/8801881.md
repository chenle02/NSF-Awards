The multi-configuration Hartree-Fock approach will be used to calculate energy
levels of auto-ionizing states and photoelectron angular distributions, focusing
on groups IA, IIA and IIIB. This will make use of newly developed MCHF programs
which include continuum states. The scheme handles well the electron-electron
correlation and polarization terms, explored in recent experiments. Subsequently
calculation of photodetachment of atomic and molecular anions will be
considered. The new theoretical program will support an ongoing experimental
program, but is also intended to identify and stimulate new experiments.
