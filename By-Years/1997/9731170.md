Investigators perform a theoretical study of nonlinear electrodynamic coupling
effects of tropospheric thunderstorms to the mesospheric and lower ionospheric
regions in (1) intense electromagnetic pulses (EMP), originating in lightning
discharges, and (2) long-enduring electrostatic (ES) fields, produced by
electrified thunderclouds. Such coupling produces strong modification of
conductivity in the mesosphere/lower ionosphere above thunderstorms. Using two
and three dimensional electromagnetic models of the lower ionosphere's
interaction of lightning EMPs and ES thundercloud fields, radiative transfer
models, and D-region chemistry models, they are gaining (1) quantitative
information on the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of the mesosphere and
lower ionosphere, modified by heating in lightning EMPs and ES thundercloud
fields; (2) identification of the dominant sinks in the mesosphere and lower
ionosphere for the electromagnetic energy generated by thunderstorms; and (3)
quantitative assessment of long-term effects of the EMPs and thundercloud ES
fields on the chemical and thermal balance in the mesosphere and ionosphere.
