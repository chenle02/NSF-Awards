The project will develop digital libraries technologies for ancient Near Eastern
studies with two archaeological components. The project will build on and extend
tools to enable archaeologists, humanists and social scientsts to gather,
preserve, and disseminate real-time and historical data . The effort involves
developing archeological metadata, field tools for collecting and recording data
and a network based repository to which users can contribute and draw materials
relevant to their work. Taken together, the products of the project offer to
archeology and related disciplines significant advances for collecting,
disseminating, sharing information and enable new collaborative possibilities
for interdisciplinary work.
