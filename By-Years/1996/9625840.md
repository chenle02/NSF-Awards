9625840 Quintana This research planning grant involves planning for research to
determine production strategies that minimize hazardous waste generation for a
particular family of products. The goal is to develop a state-of-the-art audit
which can be readily utilized by manufacturers to determine the production
system which minimizes waste for their given production lines. Planning for this
research includes (1) an extensive literature search, (2) detailed analysis of
the Environmental Protection Agency's waste management auditing procedures, (3)
database development containing manufacturer information, products manufactured,
hazardous materials and amounts used, (4) identification of production systems
to be used in the research, (5) identification of possible measures of
effectiveness and performance, (6) identification of feasible methodologies for
grouping product families with respect to hazardous materials and manufacturing
processes used, (7) identification of feasible models that can be used for
comparative analyses, (8) identification and solicitation of industry and
government contacts for support and (9) planning for integration of research
results into the classroom. Industry is becoming increasingly responsible for
mitigating the hazardous effects of production on the environment. It is
therefore useful to understand the impact of particular production processes on
the environment. The proximity and availability of a diverse array of modern
manufacturing facilities - over 350 industrial factories known collectively as
the maquiladoras - provide a unique opportunity for the university research team
to conclusively deduce firm relationships between production system and waste
generation for specific families of product lines.
