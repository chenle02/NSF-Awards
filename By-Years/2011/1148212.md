Over the last 25 years cosmic ray produced (cosmogenic) radionuclide techniques
for earth sciences have revolutionized the understanding of processes at the
Earth's surface. Most of these investigations utilize in-situ produced
cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in quartz, due in part to the ubiquity of this mineral,
and in part because of the availability of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)
sample preparation protocols that are accessible to the earth science community.
Since the development of the method, measurements of 10Be and 26Al in quartz
have been used to provide empirical constraints and answer fundamental
outstanding questions throughout the fields of geomorphology, climatology,
archaeology, ecology, seismology, and geophysics. This investigation will
develop a routine, robust standardized approach for measuring multiple
cosmogenic nuclides in the iron oxide, magnetite, providing a powerful new tool
for earth scientists working across many disciplines.
