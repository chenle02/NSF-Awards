9505697 Fox-Farsi-Yu This is an award to hold a special year in the
interdisciplinary areas of index theory, coarse geometry and topology of
manifolds at the University of Colorado Boulder. The purpose of this special
year is to bring together mathematical analysts and topologists in this area for
fruitful interactions. The special year will start with a CBMS conference "Index
Theory, Coarse Geometry, and Topology of Manifolds" and will end with a
conference "K-homology, Index Theory, and Geometry". There will also be a
workshop for graduate students to introduce them to this research field.
Visiting experts will be in residence to serve as the nucleus of this activity.
