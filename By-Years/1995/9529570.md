9529570 Evans This project will undertake two complementary activities. First, a
joint team of American and Japanese architects will gather data on the
architectural and urban design lessons to be learned from the Great Hanshin
earthquake. The data gathering effort will document and analyze the impacts of
the earthquake from the specific standpoint of the architectural ad urban design
professions. Following the data gathering activity, a workshop will be convened
in Washington, DC to present project findings, develop recommendations for
future design and planning policy, and identify needed areas of research. ***
