Steven Schwartz is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical research in the application of
evolution operators to condensed phase systems consisting of a few quantum
degrees of freedom in contact with a solvent bath. This model is useful for
theoretical treatments of chemical reactions in the presence of solvent.
Schwartz has developed a propagator expansion resummation technique which shows
significant promise in terms of improved accuracy and range of applicability for
treating many dimensional chemical reactions. He plans to apply this theory to
the elucidation of the mechanism of rate processes in multiple pulse ligand
photolysis experiments on hemoglobin. A great deal of progress has been made in
the theoretical treatment of gas phase chemical reactions of systems consisting
of relatively few atoms. Using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, it is now
possible to explain a great deal of the experimental detail for such systems.
However, the large majority of reactions which are of interest to chemists occur
in condensed phase systems in the presence of solvent. The theoretical models
for treating such complex systems are in a much earlier stage of development.
Schwartz is developing new theoretical approaches for dealing with solvated
chemical systems undergoing chemical reactions where quantum effects may be
important.
