A microwave time-of-flight system is built to measure carrier drift velocities.
This system will consist of a scanning electron beam, which scans across a
Schottky barrier diode, generating a current. By using a microwave network
analyser, the phase of this current can be compared with a reference signal and
used to determine the time required by the carriers so generated to cross the
diode depletion region. As the depletion length and field are determined
separately, the average drift velocity can then be calculated.
