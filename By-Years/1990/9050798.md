The Psychology Department of Wittenberg University has recently revised its
curriculum, the most significant change being the institution of laboratory
courses for upper division students. The department is purchasing equipment
(Human Physiology Recording Package) that allows enhancement of the laboratory
in Physiological Psychology, improves lectures in lower division courses, and
increases opportunities for independent research by advanced undergraduate
students. Laboratory exercises involving human subjects are being incorporated
to introduce important psychophysiological principles to the students. The
physiological polygraphic recording systems can display brain, muscle, heart,
and skin resistance activity and allow students to analyze analog data. The
compact portable design of the systems allows them to be used in demonstrations
for lower level courses and for research by advanced students. Thus, students at
all levels learn about the interrelationship between human physiology and
psychology. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
