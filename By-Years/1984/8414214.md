Slurry rheology plays a significant role in both the transport of solids and the
size reduction process in continuous grinding mills. Despite their importance,
however, there is a surprising lack of quantitative information of the precise
nature of these rheological effects. The objective of this project is to carry
out a systematic investigation of the effects of slurry rheology on material
transport and size reduction in tumbling ball mills. The proposed research
includes fundamental studies of the rheological behavior of slurries,
quantitative evaluation of the effects of slurry rheology on particle breakage
in mills, and investigation of the rheological aspects of material transport in
continuous mills. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop an improved
physical/mathematical treatment of the process of size reduction in continuous
grinding mills.
