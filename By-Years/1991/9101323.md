Novel applications of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (TLCP) are
currently prevented by the lack of understanding of the structure formation
processes in the liquid crystalline state and during solidification (transition
to the crystal state). Such understanding is required for controlling
mechanical, electrical, and optical properties which not only depend on the
intrinsic molecular properties but also on the large-scale texture. This
research involves a cooperative study of the structuring of TLCPs in rheological
and magnetic fields. Light scattering and microscopy (R.S. Stein) and rheology
(H.H. Winter) will be applied to specifically synthesized samples (Polaroid) and
the magnetic field of a laboratory will be utilized to create the necessary
alignment. Intermediate textural states will be produced by applying well-
defined mechanical and electrical fields. The study of the field induced
monodomain will give the intrinsic properties (Miesowicz viscosities, Frank
elastic constants) which are needed to understand the behavior of polydomains.
The natural polydomain and intermediate disclination densities will be studied
to lay the foundation for practical applications (design of suitable processing
equipment) as well as for a theoretical description of polydomain TLCPs.
