Non-technical abstract: &lt;br/&gt;Quantum devices have exceptional promise for
computation, communication, and sensing. To realize this potential, scientists
and engineers must find the right physical system in which to implement quantum
bits, called qubits, with sufficiently low error rates. Small superconducting
devices are one of the most promising candidates for building physical devices
that function as qubits. This research seeks to address fundamental questions
about the nature of small superconducting devices. The researchers make
sensitive magnetic measurements to detect the current flowing through a
superconducting device to determine whether it has a conventional
superconducting state or an unconventional, "topological" superconducting state.
Topological superconducting state are states that host special modes at their
boundaries, called Majoranas modes. Qubits based on these Majorana modes could
greatly reduce errors compared to other types of qubits.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed operation of
topological qubits is based on a special zero-energy modes known as Majorana
modes. The objective of this research is to experimentally demonstrate the
existence of Majorana modes using a new generation of fast, highly sensitive
Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) sensors. The two most
important properties are the current-phase relation, a fundamental relation that
will have conclusive signatures of Majoranas if they are present and stable, and
the parity lifetime, which determines how long the Majorana states are stable.
The experiments address longstanding questions in conventional (non-topological)
mesoscopic superconductivity, such as the behavior of tunable few-mode junctions
with perfect transmission. They also address newer, more urgent questions in
topological devices, such as in which systems Majorana fermions exist and for
how long their properties are stable. The realization and control of Majoranas
would have great foundational significance as an experimental instance of
engineered particles with non-Abelian statistics and could also enable certain
quantum information technologies. The activities additionally foster the
development of fast, ultrasensitive magnetic measurement techniques that are
relatively noninvasive. The researchers engage actively in community and
outreach activities designed to provide role models and experiential learning to
science students at all levels. Student and postdoctoral researchers involved in
the research are well-trained in nanotechnology, cryogenics, quantum science,
and precision measurements, and are prepared for a lifetime of contributions
both as educators and as scientists.
