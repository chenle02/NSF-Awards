Coleman 9709517 Plant growth and development depends upon the acquisition and
use of resources. In most environments, one or more resources will be limiting
during plant growth. Understanding how plants use resources and the components
that contribute to the economy of use are basic to understanding plant growth,
plant competition and ecosystem function. The acquisition and storage of
nitrogen is thought to be an important component of woody perennial plant
nitrogen dynamics. Although current theories suggest that nitrogen storage is
important in woody plant growth and development, few studies have directly
measured the contribution of nitrogen storage or determined how the different
components of storage influence growth and development. This research will use
plant biotechnology to determine how specific proteins contribute to tree
nitrogen storage and how altered storage influences growth and development. The
results will contribute significantly to understanding seasonal nitrogen storage
in woody plants and how nitrogen storage contributes to plant growth and
development. Such knowledge will contribute to understanding the utilization of
nitrogen in forest ecosystems
