The success of the future Internet will not be measured by performance alone,
but by its social and societal effects that alter our quality of life. The next-
generation Internet must connect not only machines but also users: families and
friends, representatives and rights advocates. There are immense technical
challenges in facilitating communication while protecting user privacy and
guarding their security. We address three key challenges. First, we apply user-
focused research into developing practical secure communication between friends,
laying the groundwork for social messaging without trusting centralized
authorities to provide identities. Second, we develop advanced cryptographic
techniques for processing private data without divulging it to application
providers, placing private social applications on a solid theoretical
foundation. Finally, we propose to fundamentally change how cooperation is
encouraged and misbehavior is punished in distributed applications by embedding
social network data into the design of applications.

This work has important broader impacts. Social networking is incredibly popular
and maintaining privacy is a significant problem within these systems. The
desire for privacy prevents individuals from participating fully and makes those
who do participate vulnerable to various problems including potential identity
theft. Because of the importance of the problem and problem domain, the results
of our research will have significant public impact. Graduate and undergraduate
students working on this proposal will gain experience with social applications,
evaluating cryptographic protocols, and building systems that combine social
data. We have actively involved undergraduate students in our research, and
expect to continue.
