To date, that has been limited involvement by researchers and developers in the
National Big Data R&amp;D Strategic Plan. However, their input is vital to the
success of the plan. This one-day workshop in Washington, D.C. will being
together academics and industry leaders across disciplines to inform the
development of an effective National Big Data R&amp;D Strategic Plan. The
development of a government-wide strategic plan impacts all of the agencies
involved. The workshop will engage a range of experts to hear about the plan
status and share concerns and ideas. Incorporating this feedback will improve
the plan and develop an overall blueprint for Big Data R&amp;D across much of
the government. The growth in scale, diversity, and complexity of data has
increased the demand for understanding large amounts of heterogeneous data. This
present new challenges to the way data and information are used and managed.
Need exists to understand ways to design systems for big data analytics,
consider privacy issues that arise when using this massive data a determine ways
to teach big data analytics across the sciences. The workshops aims to balance
plenary presentations and smaller focus discussion groups for in=depth
discussions. Coordinator reporters for each focus group will participate in
writing the reports and outcomes of the workshop.
