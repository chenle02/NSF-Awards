ABSTRACT Proposal Number: 9313714 P.I.: Marc D. Donohue Institution: The Johns
Hopkins University The behavior of complex fluids of interest because of the
intriguing range of phenomena they exhibit and because of the variety of
industrial processes that can take advantage of this behavior. The research
proposed here will advance our knowledge of submolecular environments within a
microstructured fluid. Additionally, experiments will be carried out to probe
these submolecular environments. Over the past twenty years, significant
advances in the thermodynamics of fluid phases have occurred; despite these
improvements, most theoretical and predictive treatments of micellar solutions,
liquid crystals, and microemulsions depend strongly on specific physical models
of the microscopic ordering. The proposed research will employ a new technique
(kuespert and Donohue, 1993a) to modify advanced equations-of-state for use with
complex fluids to predict microphase equilibria such as those observed in
micellar solutions and in computer simulations. An experimental program to
qualitatively and quantitatively study microphase equilibria also will be
conducted, focusing on nonintrusive spectrometric investigations. The polarity
and polarizability of microscopically-ordered fluid phases will be examined
using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. Separation of a nonordered bulk
fluid into two or more ordered microphases will be studied using that
salvatochromic shifts observed in various IR spectral bands. Quantification of
the polarity and polarizability of such microphases will allow interference of
their compositions. The compositions thus determined then will be compared with
those predicted by theory. As a cross-check on the FTIR methods, nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements of solvent shifts and lanthanide shift reagent
effects will be used to estimate the phase splits between microphases.
