With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Transfer Student
Pathways to Graduate School program will provide support to low-income students
with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to succeed in the College
of Engineering (CoE) at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB). The
project will fund 64 scholarships over 5 years for transfer students who will
pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering disciplines. The significance of this
project is in its potential contributions to the scholarly literature on
persistence in graduate school by low-income community college students. This
literature is extremely limited and the Transfer Student Pathways to Graduate
School project will help close that knowledge gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
S-STEM Track 2 project will investigate the predictors of a graduate school path
for community-college transfers and the effective interventions to promote this
in engineering. The program will focus on increasing scholars' academic
achievement and self-efficacy and preparing them for entry to graduate school
through individualized supportive services. Those services include faculty
mentoring, counseling, individualized plans for graduate school, peer advising
from graduate students and access to the UCB CoE's expansive student services
network. The program objectives are to 1) increase enrollment of transfer
students into STEM graduate programs; 2) provide low-income transfer students
with supportive programs that better prepare them for entry to and success in
graduate school; and 3) advance understanding in higher education communities of
methods that prepare low-income transfer students to enter graduate school and
the workforce.
