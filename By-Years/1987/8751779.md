Astronomy and Space Science Summer Institutes for Elementary and Middle School
Teachers is a twenty-four month program which will introduce fifty elementary
and fifty middle school teachers whose school districts already own planetariums
to experiences and resources for teaching astronomy and space science through
classroom activities. Lawrence Hall of Science, in conjunction with New York
Hall of Science, will conduct two three-week summer institutes and develop a
series of Guides to the Active Planetarium to support teacher's efforts in
conducting inservice workshops and fully utilizing planetariums to supplement
classroom instruction. During the two year period following the NSF funding
cycle, participants will have follow-up meetings at major science teacher
conferences with funds provided by Learning Technologies, makers of portable
planetariums.
