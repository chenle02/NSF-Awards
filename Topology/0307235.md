This project is about representations of braid groups. Viewing a braid group as
the mapping class group of a punctured disk, one obtains representations by
taking the induced action on homology modules of configuration spaces of the
disk. Lawrence has shown that all Specht module representations can be obtained
in this way. This project will use topological methods to study these
representations. Of particular interest is their behavior at non-generic values
of the parameter. There are applications to invariants of knots and three-
manifolds.

A braid is a certain kind of arrangement of pieces of string in three-
dimensional space. One can join some of the ends of the strings of two braids to
form a new braid. A representation is a way to encode this operation using
matrices and matrix multiplication. One application is in defining knot
invariants, which are numbers or polynomials that can be used to tell different
knots apart. The representations studied in this project include the Specht
modules, whose rich structure makes them extremely important to representation
theory in general. Representation theory is the area of mathematics most useful
for studying symmetry whether in nature or in abstract mathematics.
