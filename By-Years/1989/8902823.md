The objectives of this experiment are to use seismic signals recorded on a 120
station array in West Germeny to determine the deep geological structure beneath
the Rhinegraben and to relate it to the dynamics of graben formation. Seismic
tomographic techniques will be used to analyze the data and image the deep
structure of the rift. Similar experiments have been done in the Rio Grande Rift
in the U.S. and in the East African Rift in Kenya. Such comparative rift
tomography is a fundamental measurement for understanding the dynamics of
rifting, its relation to plate tectonics and continental break-up. The
experiment will be a joint effort by three universities: Karlsruhe, F.R.
Germany; Strasbourg, France; and UCLA. The Karlsruhe group will pay field costs
for the U.S. participants. The collaboration between the U.S. and German groups
is an ongoing one that has been very beneficial to both sides. In this case,
UCLA will be able to participate in a major field program that on their own they
would not be able to mount. They will share the data processing load, software
development and interpretation.
