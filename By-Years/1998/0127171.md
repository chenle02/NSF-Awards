Information Science and Systems (33)&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need
for access to educational opportunities enabling anyone to become fluent in
information technology as defined by the 1999 National Research Council's report
"Being Fluent with Information Technology" which defined what Skills, Concepts,
and Capabilities everyone should possess for work, citizenship and personal
benefit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is creating BeneFIT100, a free,
online self-study version for independent learners, based upon the fluency
course first developed at the University of Washington in 1999. Developed with
high production values, the course includes all the labs and projects of the
successful classroom version. To reach students not sophisticated enough for a
self-study approach, we also offer an instructor-mediated version of BeneFIT100.
We address the need for a Fluency instructor corps by using BeneFIT100 and a
specialized workshop to train a nationally selected cohort of future Fluency
instructors. Thus, the project creates a new, unique resource of international
importance, and demonstrates leveraging it for teacher training.
