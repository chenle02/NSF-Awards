This award to Meharry Medical College, is for support for renovations in the
West Basic Sciences Building. This building houses the basic sciences
departments which are involved in conducting research including the departments
of Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, and the Division of
Biomedical Sciences. These departments are responsible for 85% of the research
grants that are awarded to Meharry Medical College as well as 90% of the
publications. Together, these departments train 56 Ph.D. graduates, 46 of which
are African- Americans. This award will be used to renovate current space in the
West Basic Science Building. Funds will also be used to modernize the
Recombinant DNA Laboratory. In addition, funds will be used for addressing the
heating and cooling problems within the building that make it difficult at
various times during the year to conduct laboratory research. These renovations
will result in 6-10 new laboratories which will be available for faculty. The
expansion of this facility will increase the opportunity to train talented
minority graduate students in areas where a national need exists and for which
Meharry Medical College has an outstanding record.
