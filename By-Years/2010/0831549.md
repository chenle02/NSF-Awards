Cross-layer design problems in wireless networks are usually very complex, since
they require simultaneously optimizing a large amount of algorithms and
parameters. Most existing solutions for cross-layer optimization rely on
heuristic procedures to solve this problem. However, to obtain an optimal
utility for the wireless user, cross-layer optimization should be formulated
rigorously as a sequential decision problem that takes into account the
capability of the various layers to autonomously make forecasts about their
experienced dynamics, and perform foresighted adaptation, while adhering to the
existing layered network architecture. To address this challenge, the
investigators study a new, systematic framework for cross-layer optimization
that allows each layer to make autonomous and foresighted decisions on the
selected transmission strategies (e.g. protocol parameters and algorithms),
while cooperatively maximizing the utility of the wireless user by optimally
determining what necessary information should be exchanged among layers.

This research involves two main thrusts: (a) Develop a novel cross-layer
optimization framework with message exchange among layers in which each layer
optimizes its own protocol parameters and algorithms based on its own
experienced dynamics and the information exchanged with other layers, in order
to cooperatively maximize the wireless user?s utility in a foresighted manner
while adhering to the layered network architecture; (b) Design layered on-line
learning algorithms for the cross-layer optimization to allow each layer to
interactively learn the experienced dynamics and other necessary information
from other layers, such that the cross-layer strategies can be optimized
cooperatively. This research leads to a fundamentally new way for designing
wireless networks, systems and applications, where devices evolve and become
smarter, by learning from their interactions with the environment over time.
