The movement of traffic at freeway on and off ramps is a serious problem which
needs to permit a smooth flow of the vehicles. This project will develop a
mathematical model based on time-series data of traffic counts to forecast
origin-destination volume. The objective is to be able to forecast the flow of
traffic on the on-and-off ramps or intersections in order to develop real time
traffic control plans. The researcher is qualified to perform this investigation
and facilities are available to conduct the research. The project is recommended
for an award. This is the first year of a two year award with an increment of
$68,868.
