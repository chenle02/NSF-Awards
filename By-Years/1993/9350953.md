9350953 Salafia This project has established a network of computers with
statistical and experimental software, and Internet connections, to update and
enhance a sequence of three methodology courses for undergraduate psychology
majors. Two of the courses, Statistics and Experimental Psychology Laboratory
(EP Lab), are taken consecutively by all psychology majors. The former
introduces the students to basic statistical concepts and continues through
factorial ANOVA. In EP Lab, students learn to read and analyze research, develop
hypotheses, design and conduct studies, apply their statistical knowledge to
data they've collected, and write up their research. The final project in EP Lab
involves an original study which students are then encouraged to carry out in
Independent Research, the third of this integrated set of courses. The
laboratory is expected to increase the continuity among these courses, and to
introduce students to statistical software and computer technology , and to
encourage more students to pursue independent research.
