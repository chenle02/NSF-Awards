All stars lose mass from their surfaces by what has become known as stellar
winds. In the case of cool stars, like the sun, the winds emanate from coronae,
the tenuous outermost gaseous layers of those stars; and these winds are
ultimately due to energy deposited from lower layers into the coronae. In the
case of hot and luminous stars, the winds are driven by photons that are
absorbed by gas particles constituting the stars' atmospheres. This absorption
of photons can lead to dynamic instabilities and emission of radiation from
radio to X-ray frequencies, offering opportunities for indirectly observing the
wind generating mechanism. The Principal Investigator proposes to model this
mechanism numerically and analytically.
