The objective of this research is to investigate boron carbide diode-based
sensors applied to high spatial resolution neutron imagers. The approach is to
experimentally and theoretically investigate the operational parameters and
spatial resolution enhancement techniques required for this purpose. The four
spatial resolution enhancement techniques to be investigated include threshold
discrimination, density gradient, fast logic, and columnar sensor medium
techniques. Each of these enhancement techniques will be investigated for
feasibility and effectiveness. Boron carbide diode sensors will also be
characterized experimentally with respect to related operational parameters for
these spatial resolution enhancement techniques. The combination of these
results will provide a basis for the development of a state-of-the-art neutron
imager. The boron carbide will also be tested through direct coupling with
Timepix QTPX-262k to test its functionality and improvement of current state of
the art techniques utilizing established front end electronics and signal
processing methods.
