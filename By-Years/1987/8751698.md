Chemistry for Children: A Program for Elementary School Teachers in Precollege
Chemistry will introduce experiences with chemistry at a level appropriate to
elementary teachers with little or no background in chemistry, and will be
presented in such a way that the teachers can translate the experiences into
safe, hands-on, exciting activities for their students in elementary school.
Twenty-five teachers will be given the educational experiences in three-week
summer workshops in each of two summers and an academic year one-week workshop
at Mansfield University to act as resource persons for other teachers. PI Arnold
George and Co-PI Robert Johnson have previously completed an outstanding 150
page book of activities Chemistry for Children and an accompanying in-service
guide (TEI 85-50036) which will be further disseminated through this project.
