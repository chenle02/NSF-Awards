The Physics Department at Rensselaer will carry out a REU Site Program for 10
weeks to be held in each summer from 1992 to 94. The aim of the REU projects is
to involve 10 undergraduate students, four from Rensselaer and the rest from
other institutions in the Northeast and the Atlanta University Center to
participate in frontier physics research under the supervision of experienced
faculty members. The available projects cover a variety of topics including
Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Optical Physics; Innovative
Undergraduate Education; Nuclear Physics. A plan to recruit minority and women
students into the program is included. The majority of the students will be
recruited from outside Rensselaer.
