9413126 Zimmerman, J. K. The El Verde Field Station is a long-established
research facility in the only Neotropical rain forest under the jurisdiction of
the United States. The field station is located in the Caribbean National
Forest, which is an Experimental Forest, a Biosphere Reserve, a participating
component of the University of Puerto Rico Minority Research Center of
Excellence, and a site of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program.
The field station and adjoining research area have been the focus of projects by
scientists from over 50 institutions in the United States and other countries.
Current research projects are funded by the National Science Foundation, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the USDA Forest Service.
Research and living facilities at the El Verde Field Station date to the 1930's
and their current size is restrictive to the ongoing research activities. This
project will assist in the action of a Master Plan for the field station which
will guide future efforts to expand and modernize the facilities.
