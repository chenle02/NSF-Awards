This award supports a program of research in heavy ion nuclear physics at the
Nuclear Structure Laboratory, State University of New York at Stony Brook, using
a superconducting booster accelerator in conjunction with a model FN tandem
accelerator. The research is carried out by SUNY Stony Brook staff and provides
for the training of graduate students in nuclear science, accelerator physics
and instrumentation development. The objective of much of the research is to
find how nuclei behave under extreme conditions of high spin and/or high
temperature. Another effort involves the application of laser spectroscopy and
atomic physics methods to determine nuclear moments and properties of
radioactive atoms. Nucleus-nucleus reaction mechanisms are probed over a range
of incident energies from below the Coulomb barrier, where collective nuclear
response is important, to higher energies where individual nucleon-nucleon
collisional aspect begin to be evident. The project also entails new
instrumentation and accelerator development, and continuing facility refinement.
