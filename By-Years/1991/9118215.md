Regulation of differential mRNA stability is an important control step in
plastid gene expression. Dr. Gruissem has shown that ribosome association and
structures in the mRNA are important determinants for the decay of chloroplast
mRNAs. Inverted repeat sequences (IR-RNAs) in the 3' untranslated region of
chloroplast mRNAs function as cis-regulatory determinants for mRNA 3' end
processing and stability , and interact with RNA-binding proteins. Three of the
RNA-binding proteins have been purified and sequenced and the gene for the
proteins has been cloned. Two RNA-binding proteins have been identified and
partially purified that specifically interact with the 3' IR-RNA of one mRNA. It
is proposed to continue the functional analysis of the RNA-binding proteins in
chloroplast mRNA metabolism and stability using in vitro reconstituted systems,
and by genetic interference of the expression of their genes in Arabidopsis. A
biochemical and molecular approach is presented to determine how ribosome
association contributes to the different half-lives of chloroplast mRNAs. %%%
Dissection of the molecular mechanisms by which chloroplast mRNA stability is
accomplished will provide novel and general information about the nuclear
control of organelle gene expression. Regulation of mRNA processing and
stability is an important mechanism in control of gene expression in virtually
all organisms. Despite the wide-spread occurrence of mRNA stability control, our
understanding of this type of regulation is still cryptic and incomplete.//
