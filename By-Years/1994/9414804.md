9414804 Naganathan This award is to demonstrate that motions of a few
centimeters can be performed by smart material actuator system. A program that
combines theoretical investigations and experimental demonstrations will be
conducted. Potential configurations made of piezoceramic and electrostrictive
materials will be evaluated for providing larger motions at reasonable force
levels for non-military applications. ***
