This is a proposal to support best paper awards, US student travel,
and&lt;br/&gt;publication costs for the third IEEE/ACM Information Processing in
Sensor&lt;br/&gt;Networks (IPSN) to be held in Berkeley, CA in April
2004.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is devoted to recent advances in information
processing&lt;br/&gt;techniques and algorithms for sensor networks. This
workshop brings&lt;br/&gt;together members of the signal processing,
communications, networking and&lt;br/&gt;protocols, data bases, information
management and distributed algorithms&lt;br/&gt;communities, working in
universities, research centers and industry. The&lt;br/&gt;meeting will feature
keynote addresses by leading researchers, as well as&lt;br/&gt;invited and
contributed papers.&lt;br/&gt;
