Despite the growing importance of lasers and modern optics, undergraduate
institutions rarely provide coursework in these increasingly pivotal areas. At a
time when growing numbers of scientists are using lasers in research and when
modern optics and microelectronics are spawning new technologies whose impact
may rival that of the silicon microchip, undergraduates in this country remain
largely on the sidelines. Lawrence University is undertaking a pilot program
designed to determine the staffing and hardware requirements for meaningful
instruction in lasers and modern optics in undergraduate institutions. With
support from the National Science Foundation and other sources, it will develop
courses at several levels, devise suitable laboratory experiments, test various
types of lasers and optical hardware, and develop instructional materials.
Publications, visits, workshops, and outreach programs will serve to inform
other institutions of the details of the findings. The primary objective is to
demonstrate to others that undergraduate offerings in laser science and modern
optics are feasible and overdue. Aspects of this program are expected to be
emulated elsewhere. The present grant will assist in the acquisition of
electronic equipment for use in designing and operating the laser laboratories.
