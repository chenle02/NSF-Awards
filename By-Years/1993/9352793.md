Gas Exchange as a Primary Component of a Research-Oriented Biology Curriculum A
new biology curriculum integrates project-oriented laboratories in all four
years of the major to empower students with experience, confidence, and skills
necessary to undertake independent research. A series of laboratory activities
leads students through progressively more significant research experiences from
introduction of biological concepts through guided design of their own
experiments to development of research protocols. This series develops
throughout three sequential courses: Frontiers in Biology, Organismal Biology,
and Plant Physiology and prepares students for independent research projects
involving organismal metabolism and gas exchange. Infrared gas analysis systems
engage Frontiers in Biology students in the development of concepts in
photosynthesis and respiration. Students in Organismal Biology use a diffusion
phorometer and a portable photosynthesis system to investigate mechanisms of
control of transpiration, factors that limit photosynthesis, and the effects of
mineral nutrition on photosynthesis and transpiration. In Plant Physiology,
students apply gas exchange techniques used in prerequisite courses to develop
research protocols for investigating water use efficiency of desert shrubs,
fruit ripening in native plants, and mechanisms of senescence in leaves.
