This project supports travel for students in robotics to participate in the
Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, along with its associated
workshops in 2020 at the Oregon Sate University. The students will be mentored
both through being paired with senior PhD students and postdocs and
participation in a mentorship event led by the RSS conference chair. By exposing
early career researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to this
type of intellectual environment, they will be better able to be situated in the
robotics field and get better ideas for the type and quality of research needed
to have impact in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports travel
for students in robotics. Awardees of these travel grants will fill out post
conference surveys to help measure the effects of attending the conference.
Analysis of the responses will help tailor future travel awards. One goal of
these travel grants is to expand the pool of future researchers to have a more
diverse set of backgrounds than is currently typically found amongst researchers
in robotics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
