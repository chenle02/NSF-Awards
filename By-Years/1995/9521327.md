This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. Unlike Europe, where the demographic transition went along with rapid
industrialization, demographic shifts in Latin America appear as the result of
public health care programs. Yet there is considerable variation among
population groups in their use of primary health care programs and this study
will examine the factors affecting these differences. The study tests
demographic theories and social epidemiological theories of health and disease.
Three Latin American countries will be compared using existing data sources,
primarily from demographic and health surveys. %%% This research will contribute
to sociological understanding of population changes and the social factors
affecting the adoption of public health measures at the household level.
Findings will be of use to policy-makers concerned with improving public health
among households at high risk for disease and early mortality. In addition to
the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will materially
assist a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.
dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
