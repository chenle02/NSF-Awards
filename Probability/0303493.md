The PIs propose a new approach to thinking about long range dependence by means
of phase transitions, which extends typical thinking in terms of product moments
which exist unreliably. Such an approach will likely lead to new directions of
research, for example to new connections between probability theory and ergodic
theory. Furthermore, various difficult issues concerning heavy tails will be
investigated, including high dimension problems, visualization problems, impact
of minimum distance methodology and asymptotic sufficiency. Application areas
include financial engineering, data networks, hydrology, meteorology and
environmental studies, risk analysis. A three year program of research by Sidney
Resnick and Gennady Samorodnitsky will deal with theoretical and practical
problems about phenomena with heavy tails and/or long range dependence. Long
range dependence is a property of a model in which dependence persists over
exceptionally long time periods. Heavy tails are exhibited by model subject to
particularly large shocks. Both notions are practically important (in internet
modeling, finance, reliability ) and theoretically challenging.
