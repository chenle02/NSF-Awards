This research project involves experimental, theoretical and process
optimization for the metal-matrix composites (MMCS). The experimental program
involves solidifying pre-infiltrated samples of the composite and characterizing
the product under a range of ambient pressure and cooling rates. This experiment
will provide information on the critical pressure required for defect formation
as a function of the cooling rate. A parallel theoretical program will be
undertaken to numerically predict solidification pattern and porosity
distribution under these process conditions. The experimental data will be used
to validate the theoretical model. Finally, these findings will be utilized in a
computational framework to optimize the casting operation for minimal shrinkage
porosity. It is anticipated that this award will provide leveraging to obtain
additional funds to study continuous-fiber-reinforced composites, the influence
of reinforcement/matrix interfacial characteristics, preform temperature, matrix
superheat and hydrogen content on porosity formation, and extension of
experimental technique to the fabrication of large castings from pre-infiltrated
small components.
