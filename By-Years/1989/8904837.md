This project is concerned with the K-theory of fields. The principal
investigator will attempt to extend the results of Rost and Merkerjev-Suslin. He
will employ the techniques of relative K-theory to provide an understanding of
the weight three K-theory of fields. He will also employ his recently
constructed relative Milnor K-groups to construct motivic complexes. This
research is concerned with algebraic K-theory. In a broad sense algebraic
K-theory concerns the evolution of concepts from linear algebra such as basis
and vector space. This work has significant implications for number theory and
algebraic geometry, and promises to make exciting connections between a number
of different areas in mathematics.
