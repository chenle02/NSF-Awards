Embedded systems, such as controllers in automotive, medical, and avionic
systems, consist of a collection of interacting software modules reacting to a
continuously evolving environment. The emerging theory of hybrid systems---
systems with tightly integrated discrete and continuous dynamics, offers a
foundation for model-based design of embedded systems. For analyzing hybrid
systems models, there are two prominent trends: an integral component of
industrial modeling environments is numerical simulation, while a number of
academic tools support formal verification of safety requirements using symbolic
computation of reachable states of models. The proposed research is aimed at
developing symbolic analysis techniques for simulation trajectories so as to
significantly improve the simulation coverage. For this purpose, a new
instrumentation scheme that would allow simulation engines to output, along with
the concrete simulation trajectory, the symbolic transformers, will be
developed. For managing complexity of symbolic analysis using polyhedra, new
approximation schemes will be explored. The proposed algorithms will be
implemented and evaluated in an analysis tool built on top of the widely used
Stateflow/Simulink toolkit. The research results will be integrated in Penn's
new Masters' program in Embedded Systems that will train students in
fundamentals of embedded systems design and implementation.
