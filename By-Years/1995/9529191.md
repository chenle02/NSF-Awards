9529191 Jensen The National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense and
nine other Federal agencies sponsor several National conferences on the Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program each year. One such conference will
held in Salt Lake City on October 30-November 1, 1995. The purpose of the
conference is to introduce small high technology firms to the SBIR program and
provide a mechanism for face-to-face interactions with government policy makers
and program managers. Under this grant, the Utah Engineering Experiment Station
(UEES) will help plan and undertake the conference. UEES will assist NSF in
designing the conference agenda, identifying and contacting speakers, and
identifying and contacting past and current SBIR grantees from Utah. UEES will
also mail conference brochures to appropriate organizations within the region
and will initiate press releases and other media contacts for the meeting. The
conference is the most important outreach activity for the SBIR program because
it introduces the program to many smaller high technology firms and provides
basic information on how to successfully participate in the program. This grant
should significantly increase both the size and effectiveness of the Salt Lake
City meeting.
