This pilot project will initiate the development of a large, coordinated
citizen-science network to study small Solar System bodies in the Kuiper Belt.
Studies of this population of objects have already led to major improvements in
the understanding of planet formation and Solar System history; determining
their sizes is essential to constraining their surface albedos and estimating
the size-frequency distributions of different dynamical sub-populations. The
Research and Education Cooperative Occultation Network (RECON) is proposed to
eventually be a collection of 40 citizen-scientist-operated stations spread
across the western United States from southern Arizona to northern Washington,
each employing an 11-inch telescope and video camera system, with the purpose of
measuring sizes of objects in the outer Solar System as small as 100 km by
observing occultations of background stars. The full network is expected
eventually to produce measurements of the sizes of 1 to 2 Kuiper Belt objects
per year. This pilot project will support the initial establishment of 10
stations in order to develop and refine operating procedures and demonstrate the
scientific capabilities of the network. The observing equipment will be located
primarily in underserved communities, and affiliated with educational
institutions such as K-12 school districts, libraries, and informal science
centers. Local participants will be recruited and educated to carry out
observations at their local sites, thus not only participating in cutting-edge
research as citizen scientists, but also helping to disseminate the results
through the network and in their own communities.
