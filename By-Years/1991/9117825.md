The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to acquire
instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis of oceanographic
data. This proposal from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory (LDGO) requests funding for acquisition of an Inductively-Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP/MS). This instrument will be used to support NSF-
funded research at LDGO and will be made available for shared use by the
oceanographic community. LDGO will supply matching funds for this purchase. The
inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) interface effectively lowers the detection
limit for mass spectrometer analysis. Samples are aspirated into a high
temperature argon plasma, which ionizes elements with ionization potentials
lower than Ar with an efficiency of over 90% (for 50 elements; 70% for most
others). These ions are then pulled through the ICP interface to the mass
spectrometer. The instrument will be used for a wide variety of NSF-funded
research efforts that require the accurate detection of elemental composition.
The ICP-MS analysis technique allows the use of smaller sample volumes and
decreases the amount of time required per sample for analysis.
