Plants that are exposed to gradually increasing water stress over a long period
of time become "drought hardened." In this state, they can survive drier
conditions than plants that are shocked suddenly by drought after having an
abundance of water. In this project, we are testing the two-part hypothesis
that: (1) chloroplasts must maintain an optimum size in order to exhibit
efficient photosynthesis, and (2) that drought hardening is a process whereby
plants synthesize substances that prevent their chloroplasts from shrinking as
they dry. If it is true, the hypothesis would explain at least one aspect of
drought hardening.//
