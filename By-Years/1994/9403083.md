9403083 Dr. Jeffrey A. Jankowski has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Jankowski received his doctoral degree from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the supervision of Professor
Mark Wightman. Dr. Jankowski will continue research at the University of
Illinois under the sponsorship of Professor Jonathan Sweedler. Dr. Jankowski's
postdoctoral research will focus on the analytical chemistry of neuroscience. He
will develop skills in capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluoresence
and radiochemical detection to study the release of neuropeptides from
individual nerve cells. Longer term, he plans to develop the use of
electrochemistry and capillary electrophoresis to characterize steroid secretion
and quantify steroid synthesis at individual adrenal cortical cells. This work
will provide great insight into steroid biochemistry and the physiology of the
adrenal cortex with implications in the fields of medicine and pharmacology. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching. ***
