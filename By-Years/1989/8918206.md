In April, 1987, the United Nations Environment Program issued a report that was
published under the title of "Our Common Future". This report, known as the
Brundtland Report in honor of the committee's chairman, calls for a new world
economic order, designed around the concept of sustainable development. In a
project sponsored by the International Association for Ecology, Dr. Golley and
Stenseth propose to conduct a workshop on the environmental implications of the
Brundtland report. The workshop will deal with three areas: 1) management of the
environment as a commons, 2) the environmental consequences of further human
population growth, and 3) the interaction between ecology and economics. The
conference will be held in a facility in Norway and will be partially supported
by the Norwegian National Science Foundation. The International Association for
Ecology has actively pursued the international collaboration of scientists for
the benefit of mankind. This workshop will provide an unusual opportunity for
scientists concerned about the environment to provide input to global decision
making at a decisive moment.
