This two-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on
radar studies of electrodynamics and plasma instabilities and sporadic-E
phenomenon in the upper atmosphere. The project involves Erhan Kudeki and Steven
Franke at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Alain Bourdillon of the
University of Rennes I, and Christian Hanuise of the University of Toulon. The
investigators propose to set up a portable HF radar system, provided by the
French, to complement a three-sensor VHF radar interferometer system in Ponce,
Puerto Rico. Both radar systems will provide comprehensive ground base support
for a proposed rocket experiment to monitor the structure and dynamics of meter
scale field-aligned plasma irregularities. Use of the VHF and HF systems will
allow for comparisons of metric and decametric scale irregularity structure. The
project will advance understanding of the instability processes responsible for
sporadic-E irregularities and provide crucial information for rocket launch
decisions.
