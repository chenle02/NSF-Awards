This project is developing searching algorithms, markup guidelines and metadata
practices for enhancing searching of mathematics, with an emphasis on MathML-
based technology. The investigating team is assembling a test collection of
representative documents, researching and prototyping three search techniques,
and performing quantitative and qualitative testing of their effectiveness. In
addition, the project is organizing two events in cooperation with the Institute
for Mathematics and its Applications to bring together toolmakers, content
providers, librarians, and other NSDL stakeholders. The first workshop seeks to
identify current best practices, practical workflow and business constraints,
and organize coordination between participants. The second event is a larger,
more inclusive conference, aimed at disseminating the results of the project,
and formalizing consensus as to best practices. The Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS)
is providing significant co-funding of this project in recognition of the value
that enhanced searching for mathematics has for all the MPS disciplinary domains
and for enabling interdisciplinary interactions.
