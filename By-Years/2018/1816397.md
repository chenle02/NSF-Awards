The deadline scheduling problem, in its most generic setting, is the scheduling
of jobs with different workloads, costs/rewards, and deadlines for completion.
Today, computerized deadline scheduling permeates in all types of applications,
from computer architecture to cyber-physical systems, from communication
networks to the Internet of Things. It is not an overstatement that deadline
scheduling is at the foundation of real time system theory and applications.
Yet, much is unknown, and the state of the art falls far short of solving an
expanding range of real-time deadline scheduling problems. Missing in particular
are a fundamental understanding of the tradeoff between complexity and
performance, algorithms that deliver near optimal solutions for very large
problems, and techniques capable of dealing with model, data and operational
uncertainties. This project seeks to advance the state of the art by addressing
these missing elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances the real-
time system theory and practice in three directions. First, it pursues a novel
ranking-based scheduling methodology that breaks the curse of dimension of
scheduling complexity while guaranteeing asymptotically optimal performance for
high dimensional deadline scheduling problems. Second, this research advances
the frontier of sensor fusion for real-time monitoring and control by developing
a decentralize scheduling solution for collecting information with varying
degrees of priority and urgency. Third, this research develops online learning
techniques to cope with unknown system dynamics and job arrival
statistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
