Paradigm Development Group Ltd. is developing a software package for individual
decision support that provides an integrative graphical model, which is
initially expanded (problem structuring) and then contracted (analytical
structuring) prior to analysis via quantitative models. This process can be
characterized as having three phases: divergence, convergence, and analysis.
These phases may be repeated iteratively or may be stopped early, depending on
the needs of the user. This software uses graphical models to move the user
through the structuring and analysis phases. Problem structuring is a
combination of text-based queries and the construction of a cognitive map, a
directed graph. The software will then aid the user in reducing the cognitive
map to an analytically tractable influence diagram during the analytical
structuring (convergence) phase. Analytical support for elicitation, sensitivity
analysis and interpretation will be provided during the last phase. This
research focuses on the convergence phase. The divergence and analytical phases
are well understood and have been automated. The ability to do the convergence
phase well is the primary distinction between professional and novice analysts,
and has not been examined systematically in the literature. This research will
identify, classify and test sufficient convergence techniques to aid the user in
winnowing a large cognitive map down to a reasonably sized influence diagram for
analysis. The results will form the basis for future empirical work on the
usefulness of the techniques for real decision makers. The same research area is
a great concern to Group Decision Support System developers. The research will
lead to commercial decision support software and techniques that can be used in
a wide range of research and development for decision aiding systems.
