This project studies the effects of design/construction errors occurred in long
return period loadings such as seismicity. These type of errors often produces
catastrophic consequences. Whittier (1987) earthquake evidence is used for
detection and analysis of such errors. The study would lead to practical steps
for determination of the proneness of a structure to errors revealed by seismic
actions.
