This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project further develops the
use of Pr:YLF as a unique lasing crystal specifically for pulsed laser
holography. In this project a method of pumping Pr:YLF with pulses of blue laser
light derived from the frequency doubled output of a Cr:LiSAF laser is
demonstrated. Outputs in red, green and blue will permit true color pulsed laser
holography for the first time. Medical imaging, particularly for diagnosis of
the human eye, as well as display holography and replacement of helium cadmium
lasers are just a few of the applications of this technology.
