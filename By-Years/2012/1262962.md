This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) program at the Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT). The focus of the REU
program will be chemically-mediated aquatic processes. The proposed 10-week
summer internship program will provide laboratory and field-based research
expertise to ten undergraduate students from across the nation each summer for
three years. GIT faculty in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Chemical
&amp; Biomolecular Engineering, Earth &amp; Atmospheric Sciences, Chemistry
&amp; Biochemistry, and Biology will form a core group of mentors and will guide
undergraduates in basic and applied research on multiple phases of chemically-
mediated processes, stressing interdisciplinary research as a tool to solve
complex problems. Each student will complete an independent research project and
will give written and oral presentations on their research. They will be
encouraged to attend a professional conference after the summer program. Funding
supports student stipends, travel to the site, housing and some research
expenses.
