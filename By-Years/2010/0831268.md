The integrity of commodity operating system kernels is threatened by
rootkits&lt;br/&gt;that modify key kernel data structures to achieve a variety
of malicious goals.&lt;br/&gt;While rootkits have historically been known to
affect control data in the&lt;br/&gt;kernel, recent work demonstrates rootkits
that affect system security by&lt;br/&gt;modifying non-control data, such as
linked lists used to manage bookkeeping&lt;br/&gt;information and metadata used
for memory management. Existing techniques fail&lt;br/&gt;to detect such
rootkits effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing techniques
to provide real-time protection against&lt;br/&gt;rootkits by detecting
anomalies in both control and non-control kernel data&lt;br/&gt;behavior using
automatically-generated integrity specifications. This goal is&lt;br/&gt;being
achieved in two steps. First, a technique to mine specifications
of&lt;br/&gt;kernel data structure integrity is being developed. These
specifications are be&lt;br/&gt;mined automatically as data structure
invariants. Second, these techniques are&lt;br/&gt;being extended using
operating system support to provide real-time
detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impacts and Results: The techniques developed in
this project will defend&lt;br/&gt;against the next generation of rootkits, and
will enable real-time detection of&lt;br/&gt;such rootkits. In addition,
techniques to infer kernel invariants &lt;br/&gt;may also find applications in
operating system reliability, fault tolerance and&lt;br/&gt;software
engineering. The PIs will disseminate the results by releasing the
&lt;br/&gt;tools developed. The results of this project will equip the workforce
with an&lt;br/&gt;inter-disciplinary toolkit, that combines operating systems,
computer security,&lt;br/&gt;and software engineering, to address the challenges
posed by the next&lt;br/&gt;generation of stealth malware. &lt;br/&gt;
