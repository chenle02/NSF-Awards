Microchannel plates (MCP) are essential for high gain imaging and detection
applications in science, medicine, and industry. They have superior temporal
resolution for incident charged and UV/x-ray particles, operate in high magnetic
fields, and are essential for many particle detection applications in scientific
instrumentation, such as scintillating fiber particle trackers. However, most
existing MCP are fabricated from activated glass and suffer from a gain that
falls rapidly with the cumulative charge per area collected from the MCP.
Furthermore, MCP are expensive, available in limited areas, have significant
spatial non-uniformities, and radiation damage readily. We propose to overcome
many of these difficulties by using anodized aluminum plates as the basis of an
MCP. When formed under controlled anodization, amorphous alumina contains open,
densely packed, straight micropores, oriented perpendicular to the surface, with
a length to diameter ratio appropriate for microchannel gain. Pure alumina has a
sufficient secondary emission gain so that the pores can serve as gain channels,
without activation, or contaminating materials. We anticipate that this ceramic
material will have superior stability and lifetime properties to those of glass
MCP, at very low cost, with the potential of large MCP areas. The microporous
MCP matrix could result in much better spatial resolution and spatial uniformity
than existing MCP, with high radiation resistance. The gain stability and long
life will enable the fast, compact MCP technology to be used much more widely in
a large variety of vacuum electronics amplification applications. In Phase I, we
propose to fabricate prototype amorphous alumina MCP's by anodization, and
measure gain, gain stability and spatial properties. If successful,
micro/nanochannel plates (M/NCP) with a much longer operational life compared
with current MCP would result, and could enable ultrafast, gated, compact, high
magnetic field, radiation-hard MCP photomultipliers (PMT); (2) long lived image
intensifiers/ converters with sub-micron spatial resolution; (3) flat panel
vacuum phospher displays; (4) imaging charged particle/x-ray detectors with high
gain and sub-micron spatial resolution.
