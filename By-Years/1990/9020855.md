This research, by one of the leaders in advancing our theoretical understanding
of accretion phenomena, will investigate the generation of radiation by
accreting systems on both stellar and galactic scales. It will address the
problem of bringing material close enough to the central black hole in active
galaxies to produce the radiation observed. The evolution of low mass X-ray
binary systems will also be studied.
