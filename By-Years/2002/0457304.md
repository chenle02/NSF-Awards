Over the last few years the PI and collaborators, have developed a gauge
invariant Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mill theory in two spatial dimensions.
Several interesting results were derived such as an exact expression for the
integration measure on the gauge invariant configuration space, an expression
for the vacuum wave and an analytic formula for the string tension. Motivated by
recent renewed interest in this topic, the PI proposes to analyze higher order
corrections to the calculated string tension, investigate screening of adjoint
matter versus confinement in this frame work and apply this
&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian formulation to study issues of dynamical mass generation
in (2+1) dimensional QED with massless fermions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
