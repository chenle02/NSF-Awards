This action funds a graduate student travel award; this is a supporting
activity of the NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowships as announced in
NSF 94-133. This travel award will permit the applicant to travel to the United
Kingdom, Spain, and Portugal where she will meet with leading authorities on
harvester ants, the subject of her doctoral research project. She will discuss
the possibility of postdoctoral research in one of these laboratories upon
completion of her PhD in June, 1997.
