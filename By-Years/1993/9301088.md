This project will focus on several areas of mathematical research in the area
of several complex variables. Work will continue on the problem of embeddability
of three dimensional CR-manifolds, exploring connections between this problem
and the Kuranishi construction of versal deformations for surface singularities.
An integral part of this investigation is the development of computer software
which facilitates the computation of these spaces. The ultimate goal is the
construction of normal forms for CR-structures on three dimensional manifolds
and the characteristics of embeddable structures. In addition, work will be done
to apply pseudodifferential and blow-up methods to study the d-bar operator on
domains with singular metrics. The applications include index theorems for
Bergman type metrics and infinitesimal versions of the Runge theorem. Several
complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth
of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that
the theory differed widely from it predecessor. The underlying geometry was far
more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with
partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
