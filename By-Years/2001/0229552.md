Brady&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0229552&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical zoning of minerals in
terms of their Fe/(Fe+Mg) value can be used to constrain the rates and nature of
a variety of geological processes, if the rate of Fe-Mg interdiffusion is known
for the minerals of interest. The goal of this project is to measure Fe-Mg
interdiffusion rates for the common minerals orthopyroxene and olivine as a
function of temperature and oxygen fugacity. Rutherford backscattering will be
used to measure the Fe/(Fe+Mg) profiles produced in laboratory experiments. This
will permit very short (200 nm) compositional profiles to be measured. Because
of the comparatively slow rate of diffusion in orthopyroxene, previous attempts
to measure Fe-Mg interdiffusion coefficients for orthopyroxene have been
unsuccessful. Diffusion in olivine will also be studied because of disagreement
among published diffusion data sets for olivine and to extend the range of
measurements to lower temperatures (600-900 degrees C).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
