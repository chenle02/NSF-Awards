This investigation in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division involves the continued development of the correlated
effective valence shell Hamiltonian method for describing the electronic
structures of both small and large molecules. Adaptations are being made to
massively parallel computer systems, while applications include photochemical
reactions, nonadiabatic couplings in photo-dissociations, and the electronic
spectra of conjugated pi-electron systems and transition-metal diatomics. %%%
The continued development of theoretical methods for describing how the
electrons in atoms and molecules interact with radiation and how this
interaction affects the chemical reactivity of the atoms and molecules is a key
thrust of this investigation in theoretical and computational chemistry.
