9457908 Gibble A research program in experimental atomic physics will be
initiated. The collisions of very slow moving atoms will be studied. This will
lead to an attempt to condense such ultracold atoms ("Bose condensation"), and
to the development of new atomic clocks of unprecedented stability and accuracy.
