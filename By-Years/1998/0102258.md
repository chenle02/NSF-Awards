With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
George A. Olah, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern
California, is studying protolytically activated superelectrophiles and their
chemistry. This includes the investigation of superacid catalyzed carbonylation
of alkanes and cycloalkanes with protolytically activated formyl cation
[HCO+...HA or, in the limiting case, HCOH(2+)] as the de facto formylating agent
in both liquid and solid superacid systems. Superelectrophilic nitrations with
activated nitronium ion reagents [NO2H(2+)], nitrosations with NOH(2+)
equivalents, and acylations with protioacyl dications [RCOH(2+)] will be
investigated. The chemistry of fluorine-substituted allyl cations and polyallyl
cations, several elusive azo onium dications, including bisdiazonium dication
[N4(2+)] and diazo acyl cation [N2CO(2+)], and a number of silylated onium ions,
including silylated CO, CO2, COS, CS2, N2O, O2, and O3, will also be
explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous chemical transformations are effected by
acids. Extremely potent acids have been discovered which can react with
compounds which are only very weakly basic, and through such reactions of
"superacids", extremely reactive species may be generated. Through the
preparation and study of such species, one may gain insight into the mechanisms
by which organic molecules react and develop the ability to effect chemical
transformations of otherwise unreactive molecules, including petrochemical
feedstocks. Professor George A. Olah, of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Southern California, is carrying out fundamental studies of
superacid-activated molecules and their reactions with the support of the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.
