This project's major objective is to develop a principled basis for
constructing and scoring conceptually rich performance tasks in order to serve
the goals of enhancing both the teaching and learning of science, while at the
same time meeting psychometric standards needed to provide accountability
information to the public. Classroom-based experimental trials will explore a
set of alternative assessment models for middle and secondary school science.
These trials will be carried out in schools, and will incorporate a variety of
assessment activities. The activities will range from asking students to engage
in "what would happen if ..." thought experiments, to extended research
projects, often carried out in collaboration with other students. In addition to
the creation of a variety of assessment activities, alternative rubrics for
scoring the activities will be developed and tried. The Oakland and New York
school sites represent different contexts for the experimental trials. We will
study not only the effectiveness of the different performance assessments and
scoring rubrics for enhancing the students' learning, abut also their
effectiveness in improving the teachers' teaching.
