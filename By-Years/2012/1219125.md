A new class of non-volatile, solid-state memories (e.g., phase-change memory,
spin-torque MRAMs, and the memristor) are emerging that promise to revolutionize
the way that computer systems store and access data. While these memory offer
significant promise they will also require us to re-engineer many parts of
existing computing systems. No where is this more critical than in database
systems, where overall throughput (in terms of transactions per seconds) is
closely tied to the performance of the underlying storage system and the
optimizations that have been applied in software. This project is analyzing the
implications for these new memories on database systems and devising now
hardware and software mechanisms to improve performance, reduce energy
consumption, and improve reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential impacts
of these optimizations is wide-reaching. Database (in various forms) constitute
the heart of the cloud computing infrastructure that supports many of the
"killer apps" that are driving technologies forward. Leveraging these new
technologies, will make it cheaper, easier, and greener to implement existing
applications and will enable new applications that are not currently possible.
