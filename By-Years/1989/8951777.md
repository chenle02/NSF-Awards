The spectrometer can spark the interest of the freshman chemistry student. It is
a powerful analytical instrument that most students identify as a state-of-the-
art tool used by practicing chemists. This project involves placing a
spectrometer at each lab station so that each pair of lab students have their
own instrument. The experiments include the discovery of the nature of light,
verification of the law governing solution concentration and optical, spectral
analysis of various student prepared compounds ranging from aspirin to
coordination complexes, and evaluation of an equilibrium constant. Many of the
planned activities are closely connected to other experiments or skills that
include reading analog meter displays, graphing techniques, solution
preparation, synthesis, volumetric titration, ion exchange chromatography, and
computer interfacing. Spectrometry can serve as a focal point of mathematical
and chemical concepts for students in laboratory courses. The institution is
matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.
