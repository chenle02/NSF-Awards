Currently used method of stress laminating sawn timber bridge decks possesses a
significant stress relaxation problem due to the rod force being applied
perpendicular to grain. Based on theoretical consideration, a cross laminate can
be developed which would greatly improve the stress relaxation characteristic of
the decking and, at the same time, provide a better dimensionally stable product
with potential for material amount and quality savings. An experimental
investigation is proposed to compare the stress relaxation characteristics of
the cross laminate to that of solid sawn lumber. The experimental investigation
will also encompass the effect of variation of core to face and back material
ratio.
