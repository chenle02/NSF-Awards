Researchers have developed a new in vitro instrument. The device allows cultured
living cells to be exposed to complex air pollution mixtures of gases and
particles directly, without pre-collection or conditioning. Previous work has
found that conditioning results in underestimation of exposure risk. This device
provides faster exposure times, is less expensive, and is more sensitive at
lower exposure concentrations. Cells in the device are exposed to a realistic
pollution mixture, similar to what a human experiences. This technology has the
potential to provide information for gaps in our scientific knowledge concerning
the full impact of air pollution on public health. These gaps include the
identification of the pollutants responsible for health effects, the synergistic
effects of mixtures of multiple pollutants, and how to efficiently and
affordably monitor all pollutants in real time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
device fills a "missing technology" that can accurately perform in vitro
exposures without errors. It is a multi-use platform that can sample any type of
air and expose any type of living cell. It has applications with assessment of
the toxicity of any breathable space, testing inhaled therapeutic drugs,
cosmetics, product safety, occupational safety, and bioterrorism detection. The
initial focus will be on airborne toxins as there is no marketed instrument that
fulfills the need for comprehensive in vitro analysis of chemistry and biology.
