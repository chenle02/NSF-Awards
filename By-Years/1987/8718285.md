This research is designed to identify and explain systematic changes in causal
attributions over time. Past research has indicated that the explanations people
give for their own and others' behaviors often are different if the attributions
are assessed immediately after the task of several days afterward. Consistent
with past work on attributional phenomena, several motivational and cognitive
explanations for these effects are proposed. The motivational explanations posit
that people forget reasons for behavior in self-flattering ways, leading to more
ego-flattering attributions over time. One cognitive explanation is that
attributions become simplified over time, resulting in the exaggeration of
differences seen immediately after the task. Two other cognitive variables that
would seem to have an impact upon changes in attributions over time are the
salience of the attributionally-relevant material, and the consistency of the
material with the attributor's existing cognitive structures. Eight experiments
will examine one or more of these explanations each. At times the experiment has
been designed to test two competing explanations for the predicted effect.
However, the combined findings from the series of proposed investigations is
expected to provide evidence for the role of all of these proposed mediators in
the systematic changes in attributions over time.
