This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the
use of advanced electromagnetic suspension and actuation technology to improve
silicon wafer handling during Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP). Current wafer RTP
processing incurs substantial cost from lost wafers and facility downtime due to
ball bearing failure and wear. In addition to improved RTP equipment,
manufacturers of wafer processing equipment need advanced facilities, which will
make rolling element bearing technology obsolescent. Advances are expected in
higher rotation rates and larger diameter wafers. Magnetic suspension and
actuation technology looks promising for supporting and rotating a wafer in the
high temperature corrosive atmosphere (fluorine, chlorine, HCl) used in RTP.
Phase I will combine design, analysis, prototype testing, and cost/per-formance
trade-offs to demonstrate feasibility and to produce a cost competitive
conceptual design for an integrated motoring and magnetic suspension system
(IMMSS) for RTP facilities. A prototype would be evaluated Phase II. Magnetic
suspension and actuation technology is ultimately applicable to a wide range of
material handling problems in integrated circuit manufacture which require
precise positioning; the absence of stiction; the absence of wear particle
generation; and exposure to vacuum, corrosive, or high temperature environments.
