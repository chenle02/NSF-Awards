9321168 Sezgin Description: this project supports participation by U.S.
scientists in the "VIth Regional Conference on Mathematical Physics", planned
for February 5th through 11th, 1994, in Islamabad, Pakistan. The conference will
highlight the latest developments in the field of high energy physics and
cosmology. The emphasis will be on the discussion of particle phenomenology, QCD
light cone methods, neutrino physics and weak interactions. In the more
mathematical section, the conference will focus on formal aspects of field
theory: superstrings, conformal field theory, finite temperature field theory
and its implications. A third session will be devoted to general relativity and
cosmology. Scope: This meeting is expected to be attended by scientists and
young physicists from South Asia, and Central Asia, as well as by speakers from
the U.S., Canada, Europe, including from Turkey. The aim of the conference is to
promote research in fundamental physics and mathematical physics in the
countries of South and Central Asia, and to create linkages between young
scientists in these regions and U.S. scientists. This fits well with the
objectives of the Division of International Programs. ***
