Professor Mark Ediger is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations of the
glass transition in supercooled organic liquids such as o-terphenyl, glycerol
and trinaphthylbenzene. Time resolved optical spectroscopy on dilute solutions
of rigid probes will be used. Measurements of pattern photobleaching of the
optical probes will be used to determine how the rotational and translational
motions decouple near the glass transition temperature. These experiments are
motivated by results from a number of laboratories which indicate that
translational motion has a significantly weaker temperature dependence than
rotational motion as the glass transition is approached. The extent to which
decoupling is observed for probes of different sizes will clarify the nature of
the cooperative motion in supercooled liquids. In the last 25 years, physical
chemists have made significant progress in the molecular interpretation of the
static and dynamic properties of the liquid state. The relationship between
intermolecular potentials and liquid structure is now well understood, and the
role that solvent friction plays in molecular reorientation and chemical
reactions is also understood for liquids of low viscosity. Nevertheless, the
properties of supercooled liquids, and the molecular motions which occur near
the glass transition temperature, are still not well understood. The experiments
being conducted by Ediger are designed to shed light on the anomalous rotational
and translational motions which occur in viscous supercooled liquids in the
region near the glass transition temperature.
