Research in theoretical condensed matter physics will be conducted on the
relation between multifractal and random walk methods arising in the physics of
diffusion-limited aggregation and physical problems in electrochemistry. Two
problems, pattern formation in electrodeposition, and the frequency dependence
of the double layer impedance at a rough surface, may be treated using random
walk algorithms closely related to those used in diffusion-limited aggregation.
Other areas of research will include heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion,
electro-rheological fluids and disordered superconductors.
