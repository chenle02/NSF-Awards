The Synthesis of a new kind of composite materials will be carried out that has
a more highly ordered microstructure than any known polymer composites. The
composites will consist of monodisperse colloidal silica spheres distributed as
crystalline arrays in amorphous polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and
Poly(ethyl acrylate). Crystal-like order will make them highly selective filters
of visible and infrared light that can be tuned by variation of the particle
density to reject any wavelength by Bragg scattering. The composites will be
prepared by sol-gel synthesis of monodisperse 100 nm diameter silica particles,
modification of the silica surface to make it compatible with monomer, formation
of colloidal crystals of silica in monomer spontaneously or by shear forces, and
polymerization of the monomer. The modified silica particles and the composites
will be analyzed by solid state C-13 and Si-29 nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. The preparation and chemical characterization of the colloidal
silica and the composites will be performed in Professor Ford's research group,
and light scattering and rheological characterization will be performed in the
laboratory of Professor Bruce J. Ackerson of the Department of Physics. The
effects of ordering the dispersed particles in a composite on its mechanical
properties are fundamentally important to understand, but presently unknown.
Glassy and elastomeric polymer composites having a wide variation of particle
density and particle size of the silica will be provided to Professor James E.
Mark of the University of Cincinnati for investigation of their mechanical
properties.
