9322008 Eglin Dr. Judith Eglin and other members of the Chemistry Department of
Mississippi State University are being supported for a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry. For the period 1994-6, eight students
will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety of projects.
Projects cover the traditional areas of chemistry-analytical, inorganic,
organic, physical and biochemistry. A unique feature will be the focus on four
year colleges particularly on those lacking research programs in the region.
