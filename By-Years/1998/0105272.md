SGER: Digital Aerial Video Mosaics for Ecosystem Carbon Cycle Modeling

This grant will support preliminary explorations for applying digital video
aerial image analysis to long-term issues of global warming, in particular
carbon cycle modeling, in the government arena. Many government agencies are
already using GIS heavily, but in a less dynamic way, relying on single images
in time, without fine-grain time references. This project will explore
government uses of real-time imaging, at resolutions beyond what can be achieved
with commercial satellite images, allowing the digital film to be geo-
referenced, integrated with data streams from other sensors, and viewed in 3D
through polarized glasses.
