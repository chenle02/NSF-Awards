This Research Planning Grant will concentrate on developing techniques for
measuring the growth rate of calcareous algae in carbonate reefs of Panama. It
has been hypothesized that these algae may contribute a substantial amount to
the total amount of carbon fixed into calcite in reef settings. The author will
monitor the growth rate of individual algae and calculate the number of calcite
particles produced and their ultimate fate--whether they are preserved in the
sediment, thus burying carbon in the sediment or altered, thus releasing carbon
back into the water. The long- range goal is to determine whether atmospheric
levels of CO2 might be affected by changes in algal production resulting from
sealevel variations.
