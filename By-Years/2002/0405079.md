For at least three decades there has been a call for training ecologists with
greater quantitative skills and for scientists that are capable of working in
groups to solve complex environmental problems. The Ecological Circuitry
Collaboratory (ECC) is an effort to "close the circuit" between empiricists and
theoreticians in the ecological sciences. The ECC consists of a set of seven
investigators previously funded by the NSF Ecosystem Studies and Ecology
programs, and their students, whose projects study the relationship between
ecosystem structure and function. Students in the ECC are learning to build,
use, and understand models while at the same time have firm grounding in the
practices of field- and lab-based empirical science. Training in modeling comes
from students' home institutions and from a series of group workshops. A major
effort has been the development of a group modeling project to develop both
modeling and group interaction skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific merit
of the project comes from the completion of seven novel and important graduate
student research projects. The broader impacts will emerge as the ECC addresses
critical questions about links between research, education, synthesis,
prediction and group dynamics in environmental science.&lt;br/&gt;
