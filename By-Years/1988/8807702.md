Cooperation is rare in animals, yet in species such as the African lion
cooperation permeates all aspects of their lives. Cooperation is only expected
to occur where animals associate persistently with their close kin, or where
social interactions result in mutual benefit to each participant. Gaining a full
understanding of the evolution of cooperation therefore requires information on
the precise ways that cooperation is elicited, the distribution of cooperative
acts among companions of varying degrees of kinship and the effects of such
cooperation on the participants' lifetime reproductive success. Many different
kinds of cooperative behavior in lions can be elicited by playing the recorded
roars of intruders in their territories. In the next three years the
investigators will perform playbacks both where the willingness of an individual
to cooperate is visible to its companions and where its behavior would be
unseen. Several other forms of cooperation will also be investigated under
natural conditions. The consequences of cooperative behavior in these lions can
be estimated from the 22 years of demographic data available on the study
populations. These studies provide a unique opportunity to learn how animals
have evolved complex forms of cooperative behavior. The long term demographic
data will also be used to develop detailed models of lion population dynamics.
These will be used to simulate the fates of populations of varying sizes and to
calculate the potential impact of human disturbances on natural populations.
