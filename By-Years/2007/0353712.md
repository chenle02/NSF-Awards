Using only radio-frequency (RF) methods for observing the normal mode
frequencies of a single isolated ion, bound to a small electro-magnetic cage
called a Penning trap, it has become possible to measure masses of low mass-to-
charge ions relative to a multi-charged carbon ion with a precision that exceeds
one part in 10 to the 11th in 24 hours. This work will focus on the development
of a reliable apparatus that allows any ion of a volatilized element to be
loaded from an external ion source into this Penning trap mass spectrometer. The
first application of this external loader will be to alternately inject tritium
and helium-3 ions directly into the trap in order to measure their mass
difference. The broader impact of the program involves the education of both
graduate and undergraduate students as well as applications to mass detection
techniques.
