Although high temperature Bi-2212 superconductors have been fabricated in round
multifilamentary practical conductor form and have demonstrated excellent
potential (Jc 165,000 A/cm2 at 4.2K) for commercialization, the need still
exists to use scalable techniques to achieve high uniformity, good densification
and high critical current densities (Jc) in long lengths of wire. The work
proposed here will use hot rolling and hot drawing as a means to demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach to obtain improved texture, density and uniformity
in HTS Bi-2212 composite conductors. During Phase I of this program, efforts
will concentrate on optimizing process parameters associated with hot
processing. Success in Phase I will lead to scale up of the hot processing of
longer lengths and/or billets in Phase II, to reproducibly and consistently
achieve good superconducting properties resulting in significant cost savings.
