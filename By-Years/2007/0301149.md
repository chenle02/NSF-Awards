This award provides five years of U.S. support for the Global Biological
Information Facility (GBIF), a multilateral organization headquartered in
Copenhagen, Denmark. GBIF is a coordinated international scientific effort to
enable users throughout the world to discover and put to use vast quantities of
global biodiversity data. GBIF will develop an interoperable network of
biodiversity databases and related information technology tools. Near term GBIF
developments will focus on species- and specimen-level data. Mid-term
development will concentrate on expansion of content, additional improvements of
search engines and tools to combine data from different sources. In the long
term, GBIF will provide a portal that enables simultaneous queries against
biodiversity, molecular, genetic, ecological and ecosystem level databases,
which will facilitate and enable "data mining" of unprecedented utility and
scientific merit.
