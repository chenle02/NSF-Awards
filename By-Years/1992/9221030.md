In this project, the PI's will study ocean thermohaline circulation and its
variability in ocean models, and relate this to climate variability. Work
already underway on two Atlantic models will be continued. Subsequently, the
domain will be extended to include the Pacific basin, joined to the Atlantic by
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).
