The project described involves one of the most important aspects of a lightwave
communications system that of detection of the transmitted signal. This must be
done with the capability of high speed and with little noise interference. While
this can be done the method by which the detectors are made is difficult and
costly. The effort described in the proposal involves a simplified approach
which could not only make the detectors superior but also more cheaply and by a
significant amount.
