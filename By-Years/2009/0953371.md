Emerging general-purpose high performance computing and storage resources
provide great opportunities to tackle grand challenge problems in science and
engineering. However, most systems do not have adequate support to meet special
requirements of a number of ultra-scale dynamic scientific applications due to
lack of application-awareness. These computation and data intensive applications
are aimed to model and investigate highly dynamic and sometimes drastically
changing phenomena in science and engineering, such as interacting black holes,
global and regional high-resolution weather forecasting, combustion and
detonation simulation, and many others. Furthermore, it is challenging and time-
consuming for scientists/engineers to develop their large-scale parallel and
distributed scientific applications from scratch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project fills the gap and aims to (1) create an integrated framework of scalable
adaptive runtime management algorithms, libraries, and toolkit (called SMART)
with friendly programming models so that scientists can write sequential
programs to achieve automatic parallelism and high performance and throughput;
(2) design a suite of application-aware adaptive algorithms to holistically
address various issues in computation, communication, data, and energy
management in systems with thousands of processors (such as clusters, grids, and
clouds); and (3) enable high-impact real-world large-scale scientific
applications with additional tools for simulation and visualization.
