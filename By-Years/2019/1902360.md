This award supports the conference series "The Annual Geometry Festival," which
is held in rotation at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of
Maryland, the University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at
Stony Brook, Duke University, New York University's Courant Institute of
Mathematical Sciences, and Princeton University. The next meeting of the Annual
Geometry Festival will take place at the University of Maryland from Friday
April 5 to Sunday April 7, 2019. The Geometry Festivals aim to expose and
explain the major recent accomplishments as well as the outstanding problems in
a broadly construed field to a diverse audience of interested students and
faculty, to foster their interaction and to advance knowledge and discoveries.
The goal of the series is to help provide: (a) A more widely trained community
of geometers, able to integrate divergent approaches; (b) A more diverse
mathematical workforce; (c) A more rapid integration of younger geometers into
areas of current research; (d) Enhancement of interaction and collaboration
among researchers in different areas of geometry.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The speakers at the upcoming Geometry Festival at the
University of Maryland will discuss their work in the following fields: partial
differential equations and numerical analysis, algebraic geometry, spectral
geometry, geometric and harmonic analysis, dynamical systems and mathematical
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
