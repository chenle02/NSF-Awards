9420511 Hirth This research examines mixed-mode loading effects on the fracture
and fatigue behavior of metal alloys. A high purity steel and a special aluminum
alloy, for which base-line data already exist, are the focus of the study.
Mechanical property measurements include low-cycle fatigue and fracture tests
under mixed mode type I-II-III loading, with multiaxial and non proportional
loading conditions. Deformation and fracture behavior are characterized by
scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Theoretical
modeling includes a continuation of dislocation modeling of the onset of failure
in the form of a localized shear deformation by a translating and bowing
discontinuous tilt wall. Theoretical work employs finite element modeling of
crack propagation in terms of a damage mechanism associated with the mode II and
mode III loading components. %%% This research is of fundamental importance in
material design standards since it establishes the mechanism of degradation of
fracture toughness under mixed-mode I-II-III loading. It also examines the role
of such loading on damage under low-cycle fatigue. ***
