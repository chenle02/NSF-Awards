9614580 Nerem This project is to develop a further understanding of the biology
of the vascular wall so as to provide guidance for the development of tissue
engineered vascular grafts for the bypass and replacement of diseased vessels.
This is to be done by reconstituting a blood vessel in culture from vascular
cells and extracellular matrix, and then evaluating this reconstituted blood
vessel in a laminar pulsatile flow system. A key question to be answered by this
project is whether cell-cell interactions, i.e. between the endothelial cell and
vascular smooth muscle cell, are required to create a blood vessel with
functional integrity, particularly in regard to its endothelium. ***
