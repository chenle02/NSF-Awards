Faculty at Wright State University and Miami University are conducting
complementary activities for the purpose of introducing and training students
and educators to the precepts and techniques of combinatorial chemistry. The
primary focus of the project is laboratory instruction in this area. Activities
include testing, adapting and documenting experiments already developed at the
collaborating institutions as well as developing additional exercises
appropriate for students at all levels of undergraduate training. The materials
take into consideration variations in equipment inventory and faculty expertise
at institutions serving as adaptation sites. The utility of these experiments as
an educational contribution to the training of chemical technicians is also
being explored. Experiments range from solid phase variants of traditional
experiments to discovery-based activities requiring group work and several weeks
of project-style input. Anticipated dissemination activities include publication
and presentation of papers at professional conferences, the development of
sourcebooks and workshops for educators, dedicated conferences and collaboration
on an introductory laboratory manual.
