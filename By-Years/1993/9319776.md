This project continues research in design, analysis, implementation of
efficient algorithms for several basic computer algebra problems. The parallel
time complexity of solving linear systems with a minimum number of processors is
further investigated. New sequential and parallel randomized algorithms for
sparse linear systems are explored, and polynomial-time algorithms that make
irreducible polynomials factorizable via substitution of the variables by
monomials are sought. Another research direction is how to handle imprecise data
in the course of symbolic computation. The allowance of floating point
coefficients in a symbolic (i.e., parameterized model) is considered crucial for
a symbolic approach to real-world problem solving. In particular, the question
of computing in polynomial-time the nearest singular Toeplitz matrix for a given
Toeplitz matrix, and the nearest pair of polynomials with a common divisor for a
given pair of relatively prime polynomials, is a starting point for the theory
of precision-tolerant symbolic computation. Ultimately, the problem of factoring
over the complex numbers a minimally perturbed version of an absolutely
irreducible curve is attacked. Algorithm implementation is done using the DSC
system for distributing a symbolic computation over a network of workstations.
