Streaming potentials and streaming currents exist in bones when they are bent or
subjected to hydrostatic pressure. It is thought that changes in these signals
during bone remodeling may be important in controlling the bone remodeling
process. This project will develop an analytical macroscopic model of streaming
potential and streaming current generation based on cortical microarchitecture
of bone. The model will be validated using existing data and data from
experiments that are proposed as part of this study. This work is important
since the results could lead to an understanding of how electric fields are
involved in the fracture healing process and how electric fields might be used
to control osteoporosis.
