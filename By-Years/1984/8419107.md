This project supports a conference in which the primary objective is to improve
communication between several disciplines that do not otherwise interact much.
It will bring together researchers and scholars from three disciplines: human
factors engineering, environmental design, and organizational dynamics. The
conference will use case studies of good and bad design as a common starting
point to explore several major approaches and to find where the knowledge from
the various disciplines impacts on a common problem. The conference will yield a
better understanding of the state-of-the-art and indicate where the specialties
involved might collaborate in future research. The papers, case studies, and a
summary of the discussion will be published as a conference proceedings.
