9706233 Serpa The most well-exposed extensional/transtensional system in North
America occurs in close proximity to Death Valley, California. It has been used
as a natural laboratory to study large-scale crustal extension. However, two
different models have been developed for this extension, one requiring nearly
400% extension and the other only 50-100%. This difference is important because
the first model requires large amounts of lower-crustal flow to accommodate
supercrustal thinning to reconcile with the observed crustal thickness, and
impacts estimates of effective viscosity of the lower crust. The distinction
between these two models is clear, and each makes specific predictions that can
be tested. This project will attempt to determine the importance of extensional
versus transtensional tectonics in the formation of the Wingate Wash basin.
Results will significantly improve understanding of this
extensional/transtensional area and will help improve estimates of crustal
parameters involved in extensional models and processes.
