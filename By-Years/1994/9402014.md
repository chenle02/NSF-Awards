9402014 Poe This award supports a 12-month Science and Technology Agency of
Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Russell Poe, Department of Chemistry,
Virginia Commonwealth University, at the National Institute of Hygienic
Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Poe will work with Dr. Yuzuru Hayashi in the
Department of Medical Devices on a research project entitled, "Chemometric
Studies of Capillary Zone Electrophoresis and Micellar Electrokinetic Capillary
Chromatography." The research project focuses on improving the quantitative
abilities of high performance liquid chromatography and capillary
electrophoresis. The researchers will explore novel multivariate calibration
methods and digital filtering techniques and will determine the accuracy and
precision of these in quantifying species from complex mixtures. These
techniques promise an advantage of subtracting out unresolved components or
variable backgrounds and allowing multiple wavelengths to be detected at the
same time. This will result in separations being performed in less time and in
peak purities being more accurately determined. ***
