9452594 Nosek Senior level multi-semester team software development projects of
"real-world" problems provide inestimable rich learning experiences. However,
the usual problems that student teams encounter in finding opportunities to meet
are exacerbated for poor and middle class urban students who commute, work to
pay for educational expenses, and/or are physically challenged. Current
computer-based laboratories available for student software development teams are
inadequate in several major ways: limited availability; restrictions on student
access to client/server functions to prevent inadvertent student-caused failure
of the common laboratory; can't support team efforts at off-campus work sites;
team discussion interferes with, or are inhibited by, other students using the
same common laboratory. "Virtual laboratories" using leading edge technologies
are proposed to provide flexible, portable LANs with effective collaborative
software to provide any time/any place laboratory support for software
development teams. This approach will fundamentally alter the way team software
development is taught.
