The research will investigate biochemical mechanisms related to induction of a
cytochrome P450 enzyme in the cockroach fat body by the hypertrehalosemic
neurohormone (HTH) is an insect protein hormone secreted by nerve cells that
stimulates the fat body (=insect "liver") to convert carbohydrate stores to
blood sugar (trehalose). HTH also stimulates expression of a gene for a new
member in a family of P450 enzymes traceable in evolution history to the time of
divergence of bacteria and higher organisms. The significance of HTH-dependent
P450 will be assessed as it relates to fat body metabolism, and the P450 gene
will be isolated and structurally characterized to identify how HTH controls its
expression. Cockroaches are one of the oldest living organisms, and since this
P450 is one of the oldest genes, studies on HTH regulation of P450 gene
expression in cockroach fat body will illuminate a fundamental cellular
regulatory process that dates to the time of the origin of higher animals. From
a practical view, P450's are the means by which all animals, including man,
metabolize foreign chemicals such as drugs, toxins, carcinogens and
insecticides. Since many of these compounds are neurotoxic, they may stimulate
neuroendocrine cells to release hormones which induce P450 synthesis for
metabolism of the toxicant. Therefore, studies linking neurohormones with P450
synthesis may provide a fundamental explanation for both man's response to
carcinogens and insect resistance to insecticides.//
