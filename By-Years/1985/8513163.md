Recent developments on Stackelberg Games and Incentive Strategies are adapted to
develop a novel decomposition approach for the solution of dynamic optimization
problems. The approach involves stage-wise decomposition, and stems from the
following observation: "In the dynamic programming approach to optimization, if
the cost-to-go functions at every stage were known, then the solution of an
N-stage optimal control problem would be obtained by solving (in parallel) N
decoupled static (single stage) optimization problems." Taking this observation
as a starting point, the principal investigators suggest that even if the
optimal cost-to-go functions are not known, one can start with some initial
guesses, solve the corresponding N static optimization problems, update on the
initial guesses using these solutions, solve a new set of optimization
problems,...and so on..., until some convergence is achieved. The research is to
study various aspects of this scheme, including its convergence properties,
computational requirements, and feasibility, and apply it to an economic
dispatch problem arising in power systems.
