The University of Chicago will upgrade their existing Macintosh Plus-based
undergraduate instructional laboratory to one based on Macintosh IIx
workstations, to aid in the teaching of two specific interdisciplinary courses.
These courses are closely linked in intent, audience, and laboratory
requirements: Mathematical Sciences I, II, and III; and Computer Programming as
a Liberal Art. These courses are explicitly directed to students in
nonscientific fields. Both courses make extensive use of the instructional
computing lab. The improved laboratory will aid in extending the Computer
Programming as a Liberal Art course to three quarters, and will enhance their
ability to teach other undergraduate Computer Science courses.
