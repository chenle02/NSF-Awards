Parasitic angiosperms are noxious and persistent pests in farmers' fields and
serious constraints to crop productivity. The "witchweeds", members of the genus
Striga, are particularly devastating since their primary hosts include the major
cereals (maize, sorghum, rice and millet) and grain legumes that are dietary
staples worldwide. How parasitic weeds and Striga species in particular
recognize their potential hosts and overcome the innate defense systems are not
known. Using the interaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), an important food
and forage legume, with Striga gesnerioides, this project seeks to identify
parasite-derived effectors and virulence proteins that enter host cells,
specifically altering their structure and function and suppressing the defense
response mechanism at various levels, enabling infection and parasite ingress to
occur. Novel, in planta functional screens will be used to identify candidate
effectors from Striga that are directly or indirectly recognized by race-
specific resistance proteins in cowpea leading to activation of a hypersensitive
response at the point of infection and associated downstream defense responses.
These functional screens are complemented by comparative transcriptome
sequencing in compatible and incompatible host-parasite association and in
silico analysis aimed at identifying candidate virulence effectors through race-
specific gene expression signatures.

The outcomes of this project will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by
which parasitic angiosperms identify and parasitize their hosts and how hosts
block such attack. The negative impact of parasitic plants on crop productivity
increases globally each year and their potential for affecting domestic
agriculture looms larger as the movement of seed resources expands globally. The
outcomes of this work will contribute directly to the development of strategies
to improve crop security by providing targets for manipulating pest resistance
responses of crop plants. In addition these studies provide new educational,
research, and training opportunities for US students on the African continent.
