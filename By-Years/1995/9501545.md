A statistical analysis of the properties of the low-speed flow state of the
earth's plasma sheet is approved. The low flow state plasma sheet (i.e., the
quiet-time plasma sheet), is defined as the complementary of the bursty bulk
flow event (BBF event) state, previously studied by the PI. The low flow state
is the most probable state of the flow in the plasma sheet as it comprises 92-
95% of the available plasma sheet datasets. This flow state possesses an average
flow pattern that can be explained in terms of a 2-fluid picture of the plasma
sheet. That flow pattern will be mapped on the ionosphere by use of current
magnetic field models, and the dependence of that pattern on the IMF sector will
be examined. The non-BBF flows have a variance that is many times larger than
the average flow speed in the plasma sheet and persist even during low AE
conditions. The unsteadiness of the flow may allow convection in the plasma
sheet to proceed, contrary to the pressure balance inconsistency argument. Thus
the flow variability under different geomagnetic conditions, and in different
locations on the X-Y plane will be studied as well as the correlation between
earthward convection and flow variability. The flow variability will be
incorporated in a qualitative model of the plasma sheet equilibrium. The theory-
guided statistical analysis of the quiet plasma sheet flow field aspires to
characterize the basic properties of the ground state of the plasma sheet and
its relevance to global magnetospheric circulation.
