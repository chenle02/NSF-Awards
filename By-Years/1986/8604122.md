The aim of this proposal is the development of a computer-aided-design
methodoloy for the linear multivariable control problem based on an approach
called H-infinity optimization. H-infinity optimization is an approach to
control system design which takes into account plant uncertainities and rather
general classes of reference and disturbance inputs. The goal of this research
is to resolve certain conceptual and computational difficulties which must be
overcome before the H-infinity approach becomes a practically useful design
methodology.
