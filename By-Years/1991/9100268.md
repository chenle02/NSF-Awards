This application is for partial funding of the 1991 Summer Conference on Smooth
Muscle to be held under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology (FASEB) from July 14 to July 19, 1991, at Copper Mountain,
Colorado. About 150 scientists will be selected from applications on the basis
of expertise, interest, contribution, and balance to provide an intellectually
stimulating environment. This meeting will focus specifically on areas of
notable advancement and new conceptual development in smooth muscle, including
membrane ion channels, Ca2+ pumps, regulation of intracellular calcium, cGMP
second messenger system, regulation and functions of contractile proteins, and
molecular adaptations of contractile protein expression. We will provide a
special effort to integrate dell and molecular research with that at the
organismic level in these sessions. These combinations are distinct from the
first three Smooth Muscle conferences, and from any smooth muscle conference
that has occurred to date. The meeting will be particularly useful for
interactions of scientists working in rapidly developing areas, and will be
specifically designed to provide improved dialogue among those working in highly
specialized areas. Suggestions of new experiments and refinement of concepts
that are likely to occur will importantly advance current knowledge in many
areas of smooth muscle research.//
