The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the umbrella organization including the
Bronx Zoo, will design, develop, fabricate, evaluate and install a long-term
exhibition with ancillary public programming about the biology and conservation
science of the island of Madagascar. Based in part on long-term scientific
research conducted in Madagascar by the WCS, the exhibit will use immersive,
interactive exhibit approaches including live plants and animals, as well as an
on-line curriculum (Wild Explorations in Science), distance learning
expeditions, and an interactive website to engage visitors of all ages in
experiencing conservation science and specific examples of science saving
wildlife. Visitors will explore unique and beautifully re-created habitats,
encounter fascinating animals and learn about concepts such as endemism, island
biogeography and biodiversity. The exhibit will serve about 2,000,000 visitors
to the Bronx Zoo annually and millions nationwide through on-line curricula and
distance learning programs.
