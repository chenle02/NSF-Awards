The goal of the work is development of a simple reproducible method for assaying
for the presence of functional ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. Improving
upon liposomal ion flux assays and electrical measurements employing BLMs, patch
electrodes, or whole cells would greatly facilitate routine testing for ion
channel activity in biophysical and biochemical research. The technique of patch
clamping bilayers formed from monolayers would serve well if it were not so
irreproducible. We propose to test a new approach at forming stable planar
bilayers that will lend itself well to such a new assay system--this is to
support bilayers on planar hydrophilic surfaces perforated by small single
orifices containing one Ag/AgCl electrode each. First we will fabricate planar
silicon and glass structures with small hydrophilic holes. Lipid bilayers will
then be formed across those holes by passing the device twice through an air-
water interface covered by a lipid monolayer with or without ion channels.
Measurement of the function of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in such
bilayers will be made with conventional electrophysiological techniques.
