Dr. Schlesinger will organize a workshop to plan and coordinate a soil warming
experiment to be conducted at wide variety of research sites, including LTER
sites, across North America. The workshop will establish formal protocols for
the experiment and establish a minimum standard set of dependent variables to be
measured in response to soil warming. The products of the workshop will include
a formal workshop report and coordination of a future proposal to fund the soil
warming experiment.
