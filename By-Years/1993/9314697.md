9314697 Kleinrock This award will support a field program and subsequent data
analysis to examine the relation between volcanism, tectonism and hydrothermal
activity in the TAG area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The program will use Woods
Hole assets (DSL-120 side-scan sonar and ARGO system) to survey TAG segment.
Objective is to relate hydrothermal mound-venting to local, segment-scale
volcanic and tectonic features, and to determine controls on hydrothermal
location. Work will be of benefit to interpreting results of drilling which is
scheduled at TAG by placing drilling in local and regional context. Project is
also important for joint ODP- Interridge planning to evaluate impact of drilling
on hydrothermal system. Results will provide baseline study of "undisturbed"
system prior to drilling. Project is being jointly supported by Ocean Drilling
Program and Marine Geology and Geophysics.
