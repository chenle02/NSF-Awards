This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education research
award to Carnegie Mellon University will develop new analytical methods to study
learning in engineering project teams. These methods will be based on the recent
theoretical findings from the study of group cognition. The specific research
objectives are to create analytic tools that automatically detect and tag
evidence of learning events in group discussions and that summarize the evolving
content of the documents created by a group. The project will also create
visualization tools that integrate and summarize the team communication to track
the emergence of a shared solution. The results will be presented at technical
conferences and published in professional journals. The goal of this research is
to better prepare students for the practice of engineering through developing
tools to enhance team work skills. These techniques are expected to increase
students' interest in engineering and will enhance the number who complete
engineering degrees and are ready to fill engineering jobs.
