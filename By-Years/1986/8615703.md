Diffusion coefficients are important to understanding and designing a large
number of processes well enough to compete effectively in the high technology
world marketplace. Of particular importance is the need for diffusion data in
multicomponent systems. A theoretical and experimental work in perturbation gas
chromatography will be conducted that will lead to application of the technique
for measuring diffusion in multicomponent systems.
