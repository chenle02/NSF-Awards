This project is concerned with dynamic strategies for the so called Model
Generative Reasoning (MGR) architecture that will enable MGR application
programs to cope with both data and knowledge limitations imposed by
unstructured task environments with greater effectiveness, i.e., task
environments in which problems are typically ill-posed, and data are typically
sparse, noisy, and uncertain relevance.
