This award supports the U.S. participation in a workshop to be held in
Taipei/China to explore research on climate changes of the last 2000 years in
monsoon Asia. The discussion focuses on the preparation and analysis of: (1)
early instrumental and historical records (colonial and indigenous) and (2) high
resolution proxy records of past climate, such as tree rings, laminated
sediments, banded corals, ice cores from high alpine areas. The National
Research council of Taipei/China has agreed to host the meeting under the
auspices of the IGBP-Past Global Changes (PAGES).
