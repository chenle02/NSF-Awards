With the support of the Division of Chemistry, Professors Kelly Chacon of Reed
College and Steven Townsend of Vanderbilt University are organizing a workshop
that seeks to provide new chemistry faculty insight into the proposal writing
and reviewing process so that they can identify and develop strong research,
education and outreach activities. Faculty beginning their independent careers
often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to be challenging.
Participants will have the opportunity to network with each other as well as
with successful grant recipients and federal program officers from a variety of
agencies. The participants will engage in mock panels, research presentations,
and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how
to put together a research plan that is ambitious, yet realistic and compelling.
Broader impact criteria will also be discussed including educational activities,
outreach, broadening participation and longer term application to societal
problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2021 Chemistry Early Career Workshop,
supported by the Division of Chemistry will be held on May 17-18, 2021 in a
virtual format. This workshop will bring together up to 100 junior faculty from
a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically
crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, achieving
excellence through diversity and assessing and evaluating project aims.
Potential participants can access more information as it becomes available at a
publicly-facing web page. Inquiries will also be receivable through a dedicated
email address (nsfworkshop2021@gmail.com).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
