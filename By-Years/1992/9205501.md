The ongoing collision of the Indian subcontinent with southern Asia has
produced the Himalayan Range and the Tibetan Plateau; the highest present-day
topography on the earth's surface. Decades of structural studies have documented
large amounts of shortening within the Himalaya, and more recent isotopic
studies have begun to delineate the history of uplift during this shortening.
Large amounts of erosional and tectonic denudation are required to reconcile the
calculated crustal uplift with the present topography. This denudation has
caused a massive sediment flux from the hinterland into the basins bounding the
Himalaya: the Indo-Gangetic foreland, the Tarim basin, the Indus Cone, and the
Bengal Fan. The research proposed here will attempt to examine this sediment
flux to the south of the Himalaya in order to determine: 1) how much and at what
rates sediment has been stored in the past within the potential sediment sinks
bounding the southern margin of the Himalaya; 2) the presence or absence of
synchronous changes in the rates of sediment storage between the foreland and
the marine fan systems and within different parts of the foreland (partitioning
of the sediment load); 3) modern rates of sediment delivery out of the
hinterland for a major and minor river that debouch into the Himalayan foreland
in northern Pakistan; 4) an estimate of the amount of sediment storage that
occurs within the hinterland itself and a comparison of the relative storage in
monsoonal dominated versus semi-arid, nonmonsoonal drainages; and 5) volumetric
approximations based on digital elevation data of erosional losses within
selected parts of the uplifted hinterland.
