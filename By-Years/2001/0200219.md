ABSTRACT

Research will be conducted into the Fejer-Riesz factorization of two variable
positive trigonometric polynomials. The results obtained recently with Hugo
Woerdeman on this problem will be used to investigate the properties of stable
two variable polynomials. A two variable polynomial is said to be stable if it
is non vanishing inside and on the bicircle. Results obtained from these
investigations will then be applied to the construction of two variable
wavelets, two variable filter design, and image processing.

An important problem with many applications that was solved early inthe
twentieth century was the problem of factorizing positive trigonometric
polynomials. A trigonometric polynomial of degree n in x is a polynomial that
can be written as linear combination of sines and cosines of integer multiples
of the frequency x. It was shown by Fejer and Riesz that such a polynomial can
be written as the magnitude squared of another polynomial. This result has had
many useful applications in the area of filter design for electrical circuits,
prediction theory, and more recently in wavelets.
