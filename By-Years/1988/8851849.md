Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is being incorporated into the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum at both St John's University and the College
of Saint Benedict. The mass spectrometer is being interfaced with a gas
chromatograph which was previously present. The new system is being used to
illustrate the principles and techniques of MS or GC/MS in the organic,
physical, advanced analytical, and advanced inorganic courses, as well as
student research. All of these areas are being expanded and enhanced by the
acquisition of the mass spectrometer. Students are gaining a first hand
knowledge of the diversity of applications for a GC/MS system. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
