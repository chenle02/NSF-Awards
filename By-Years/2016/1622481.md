A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these
institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the
traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project
aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will increase the body of knowledge
on the efficacy of novel devices that may improve the detection of seizure
onset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dine' College will analyze datasets in order to
validate a novel tripolar Laplacian electroencephalogram (tEEG) based seizure
onset detection methodology using automatically detected high-frequency
oscillations (HFOs) with better sensitivity (correct detection rate),
selectivity (false positive detections per hour), and detection delay compared
to the recent results of others obtained on large scalp encephalogram (EEG)
datasets will constitute a positive output. This project will contribute to
advancing quality postsecondary student learning and development through the
inter-disciplinary Mathematics for Engineering Applications (MEA) research
laboratory to be established at Diné College led by the PI of and funded by this
proposal. Four undergraduate research assistant positions will be created in the
MEA lab providing Diné College students with valuable cutting edge research
experience. Moreover, talks and presentations by the MEA lab members and invited
speakers collaborating with the lab will help further involve students into
mathematics and engineering disciplines.
