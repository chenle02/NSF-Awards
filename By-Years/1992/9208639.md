This is a renewal project to investigate the compuational complexity of number-
theoretic problems. Besides providing a number of unsolved problems in
complexity theory, number theory is useful in the design of systems for random
number generation, cryptography, and computer algebra. The investigations fall
into three categories: a) Exploration of the algorithmic consequences of
heuristic assumptions such as the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. b) Analysis and
design of number-theoretic algorithms, with special attention being paid to
efficient randomized algorithms for primality, factorization of polynomials,
etc. c) Applications of algebraic geometry (especially the theory of varieties
over finite fields) to constructives techniques.
