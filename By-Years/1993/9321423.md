9321423 Schwartz This REU Site award provides an opportunity for six
undergraduate students to conduct research on interface properties of advanced,
fiber-reinforced composites. The research projects include viscoelastic effects
on interfacial shear stress in single fiber composites, the effect of plasma
surface treatment of graphite fibers on torsional fatigue in composite strands,
interfacial shear strength measurement in environmentally friendly (e.g.,
"green") composites, and functional finishes for enhancing fiber- matrix
adhesion in arimid/epoxy composites. %%% The objectives of this program are (1)
to enhance the undergraduate experience, especially of students from four-year
colleges, by meaningful, hands-on research involvement promoting independent
thinking; (2) to attract potential U.S. graduate students interested in
fundamental research in fiber science, with special emphasis on women and
underrepresented minorities; and (3) to motivate students to consider research
careers in academia, industry or government. Students will work directly in
faculty research groups, and weekly research seminars will be scheduled in which
currently enrolled graduate students will present in-progress results of thesis
research. At the end of the ten week program, REU Site students will present
their research results in a university-wide forum, along with students in
similar programs in other colleges, at Cornell University. It is expected that
these projects will contribute to publications in major refereed journals, and
will be co-authored by REU Site students.
