ABSTRACT Philip Kutzko University of Iowa DMS-97 32527 Professor Kutzko will
study the smooth complex representation theory of a reductive p-adic group using
the method of types. A type in a group is a compact open subgroup together with
an irreducible representation in such a way that the pair carries information
about all irreducible representations. This approach has been used successfully
in the past to study other linear groups. Among other projects, the investigator
will try to apply the method of types be applied in the context of split
classical groups with the goal of understanding reducibility of parabolically
induced representations. One of the most important mathematical ideas of the
second half of the century, is that analytic formula often encodes discrete
information. For example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a
particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find. On
the other hand, you might want to count the number of solutions to a sequence of
equations and consider the answers as a sequence. Mathematicians call these kind
of problems 'discrete'. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which
calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic.' Amazingly, the right
kind of analytic function can contain the answer or answers to the discrete
examples above. Actually the first examples of this were discovered a couple
hundred years ago, but in the past thirty years, the subject has been
systematized into a branch of number theory called the Langlands program. This
project is an important part of the Langlands program.
