This award is for the investigation and analysis of several topics related to
the dynamics of tropical cyclones. The research team will use a combination of
theory, numerical models, and observations to address longstanding questions,
with a particular focus on tropical cyclone eyewall structures. The development
of secondary eyewalls in tropical cyclones has a significant impact on the
intensity of the storms and is a limiting factor on how well the intensity can
currently be forecast. A successful project would lead to better understanding
of the physics of the storms and how they can best be modeled, leading to an
improvement in forecasts and public safety and economic benefits. In addition,
the project will help to educate and train the next generation of research
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, simplified dynamical theories
will be developed using balanced model principles and potential vorticity
arguments. The objectives of the proposal address the following fundamental
research questions in tropical dynamics: 1) What is the distribution of
subsidence in the hurricane eye? Is subsidence concentrated at the edge of the
eye, thereby producing a warm-ring rather than a warm-core thermal structure? 2)
Why is the ITCZ so thin, why does it form where it does, and what are its
natural forms of oscillation? 3) Why do major hurricanes often form double
eyewalls, what determines the locations of these eyewalls, and what dynamics are
involved in the disintegration of the inner eyewall? 4) How do surface
frictional effects in a moving hurricane break the circular symmetry of the
eyewall and lead to crescent-shaped regions of intense eyewall
convection?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
