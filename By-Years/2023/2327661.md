Unsteady turbulent flows are known to be very complicated, but there has not
been much effort to assess just how complex they are. The reason for their
complexity is that the patterns of flow structures in terms of space and time
contain both predictable and random elements. However, predictive laws or
probability models cannot fully capture the behavior of such systems. The
degree-of-complexity is a measure of how certain or random a flow field is in an
unsteady state. This research will evaluate the degree-of-complexity using
advanced mathematical methods. The knowledge acquired through this project can
be applied to various other fields that involve complexity theory. The research
topics explored in this project will be tailored to be suitable for
undergraduate research programs and will be shared with K-12 teachers to enrich
their class topics.

The proposed research attempts to establish a new theoretical framework for
quantifying the complexity of unsteady flows. Traditional complexity estimators
typically operate on 1D data and are inadequate for analyzing 3D unsteady field
results. To address this limitation, the proposed research tackles the issue by
utilizing large-scale flow structures as the fundamental unit of analysis, which
represent the collective motion of the flow over a defined period. These
structures exhibit intricate 3D spatial interactions and can be classified and
symbolized based on their topological characteristics, utilizing the persistent
homology algorithm. The resulting symbolic sequence is then employed to assess
complexity using the excess entropy method. This innovative approach diverges
from conventional practices by using recurrent spatial-temporal patterns as the
fundamental analysis unit instead of instantaneous fields, thereby enabling the
separation of spatial interactions within a finite domain from the long-term
evolution of the entire system. Furthermore, the proposed methodology
investigates how large-scale structures self-organize to shape the flow, a
pursuit that is challenging to achieve through short-time methods (e.g., finite-
time Lyapunov exponent) or conventional statistical techniques (such as Reynolds
stresses and spectrum). The examination of temporal order among flow patterns
also yields insights into the dynamics of coherent structures, shedding light on
fundamental inquiries such as the relationship between invariant solutions of
the Navier-Stokes equation.
