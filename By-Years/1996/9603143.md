This grant provides travel costs and incidental expenses associated with
international collaborative studies of nuclear fission by Texas A and M faculty
members, and scientists of the Flerov Laboratory in Moscow. Experiments will be
carried out using the facilities at both institutions using heavy ion beams to
examine the mechanisms and time scales of the processes by which heavy ions fuse
with heavy element target nuclei, and later emit particles and radiation both
before and after fission.
