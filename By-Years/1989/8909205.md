Dr. Summy-Long is using her Career Advancement Award to learn the state of the
art molecular techniques which will allow her to investigate independently gene
expression in magnocellular neurosecretory cells. Magnocellular neurons
synthesize vasopressin, a peptide that regulates fluid balance and blood
pressure, and oxytocin, a peptide released during lactation to initiate milk
let-down in response to suckling and at parturition to contract the uterus. The
oxytocinergic neurons as part of the magnocellular system undergo plasticity
beginning during pregnancy at mid-gestation and lasting through lactation. This
plasticity is expressed in the formation of new and reversible synapses
involving growth and adaption of neurons. Although the morphological changes and
electrophysiological activity are well understood, knowledge of the control of
these adaptive changes at the cellular level is rudimentary. Dr. Summy-Long will
examine the role that proto-oncogenes, especially c-fos, play in oxytocinergic
neurons that undergo plasticity during lactation. These studies provide a
foundation for probing further how and when proto-oncogenes are expressed in
neurons. The research has implications for reproductive neuroendocrinology as
well as for cancer, since understanding proto-oncogene expression in normal
cells during changes in physiology may provide clues as to how this regulation
becomes aberrant.
