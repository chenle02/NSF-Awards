This project will provide a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for use
by members of the Biology and Chemistry departments at George Mason University.
There is currently no mass spectrometer at the university. The purchase of a
versatile, high performance GC-MS will permit the extension of several research
activities that had previously been done off- campus at relatively high cost in
both dollars and hours and will encourage development of new research areas for
many of the faculty members. The acquisition of the GC-MS will also provide the
opportunity for appropriate training of students through established chemical
and biological instrumentation instructional programs at George Mason. Five co-
principal investigators with experience in GC-MS techniques will immediately use
the instrument for a broad range of applications, including studies of: 1)
biochemical systematics of red algae; 2) accumulation and biotransformation of
organometals in aquatic environments; 3) secondary compounds in leaves of spring
ephemeral plants; 4) pyrolysis and oxidation of long chain alkylaromatic
compounds; and 5) analysis of polar fractions of shale crudes. Numerous other
uses of the GC-MS are proposed by other investigators who have not had previous
direct experience with this instrument.
