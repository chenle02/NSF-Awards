Regenerative neurogenesis in adult echinoderms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Regeneration processes are of vital importance to repair and replace lost
tissues and organs. In chordates and other animals groups, the nervous system is
considered almost irreplaceable; neurons that are lost after trauma cannot be
replaced and there is a limited functional reconnection of nerve fibers. This
project uses a new experimental system, the sea cucumber, a member of the phylum
Echinodermata, to explore the regeneration of the nervous system. Echinoderms,
although invertebrate animals are closely related to the vertebrates, and posses
an extraordinary regeneration capacity. &lt;br/&gt; The project aims to study
the regeneration of the nervous system within the digestive tract and the
cellular division and differentiation associated with this process. It also
explores the regeneration capacities of the main echinoderm nervous tissue
components to determine if the regeneration of cells and fibers constitute a
general event in echinoderm tissues. Finally, it studies the expression of
genes, known to be important in regenerative and embryological organogenesis,
and their expression during nervous system regeneration. &lt;br/&gt; Results
from our experiments will advance the understanding of neuronal regeneration by
obtaining information from a key group of organisms, echinoderms, where
regeneration is a natural regular event. The proposed work on nervous
regeneration is part of our overall goal of understanding the process by which
the cells that make up the nervous system are generated, and how they
differentiate and assemble into a functional organ.&lt;br/&gt;
