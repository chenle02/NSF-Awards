This conference is on The Arithmetic of Algebraic Curves. It will be held at
the University of Arizona January 7-10, 1989, immediately prior to the Winter
Meetings in Phoenix. Some of the invited speakers are Bryan Birch, John Coates,
Robert Coleman, Barry Mazur, Ken Ribet, Karl Rubin, John Tate, and Paul Vojta.
The emphasis will be on new ideas and techniques being used that come from
number theory, analysis, and algebraic geometry, and the interplay between them.
The conference organizers are Professors Sheldon Kamienny and William McCallum
of the Mathematics Department of the University of Arizona. Participant support
is available, including support for graduate students.
