The Scanning Electron Micoscope is to be used as a major facilitfor the support
of Materials Research at the University of Virginia. This facility will include
capabilities for high resolution secondary and back scattered electron imaging,
channeling, cathodoluminescence imaging, as well as wavelength and energy
dispersive X-ray analysis. Current and planned research involves studies of 1)
electrochemistry, electrocatalysis, and corrosoion, 2) environmental fatigue and
fracture, 3) oxideation of alloys, 4) compositie materials, 5) processing of
materials, 6) electronic materials and evices, 7) geochemistry and 8) light
weight, high temperature alloys. The proposed facility is essential in the above
research areas for the detailed characterization of topography, composition,
orientation and perfection of the various materials studies.
