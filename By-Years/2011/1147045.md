Flower maturation is critical for plant reproduction because it ensures
coordinated maturation of female and male reproductive organs as well as floral
display that attracts pollinators. The Arabidopsis transcription factors AUXIN
RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 regulate these complex processes by promoting
petal expansion, male and female organ maturation and other processes. This
project will identify floral genes directly regulated by ARF6 and ARF8,
determine their effects on chromatin modifications that influence gene
expression, and identify other transcription factors that act together with ARF6
and ARF8. By understanding the functions of ARF6 and ARF8 in flower maturation
the project will provide general insights into regulation of coordinated
developmental processes. The research may also inform strategies to optimize
seed or fruit production in the face of declining pollinator populations. The
project will provide scientific training for postdoctoral fellows and students
and will produce an interactive 30-minute multimedia presentation for
schoolchildren and the general public. Produced in collaboration with the
Morehead Planetarium and Science Center at the University of North Carolina,
this presentation will educate the public about genetics and flower function and
will be presented daily in the summer months. The project will generate
extensive genome binding and gene expression data that will be published and
deposited in the public NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. Plant materials
generated in the project will be deposited in the Arabidopsis Biological
Resource Center.
