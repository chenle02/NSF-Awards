Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms are now used in a wide spectrum of
disciplines including neurophysiology, electrical engineering, computer science,
mathematics, and the cognitive sciences. But only a small number of economists
have used these powerful statistical methods because of their heavy
computational demands and because the theory to rigorously test hypotheses and
make efficient estimates using ANN does not yet exist for the types of problems
faced by economists. This project explores a promising method called simulated
annealing that could significantly reduce computational costs and permit
rigorous hypothesis testing for economic problems. More specifically, the grant
permits the investigator to purchase additional processors for his computer so
that he can use simulated annealing algorithms for constrained optimization. The
additional processors will improve the performance of the computer and allow the
estimation of more realistic economic models. The project tests the ability of
ANN models to approximate classical production function using experimental
production data from agricultural economics.
