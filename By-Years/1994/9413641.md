Near-infrared fluorescence is a relatively new technology which enables high
sensitivity at reduced cost. It is currently used in commercially available
automated DNA Sequences as well as applied in single molecule detection
research. The large reduction in background fluorescence as well as the greatly
reduced scatter effect. Derived by operation in the near-infrared optical region
accounts for the increased sensitivity. The economical use of diode lasers and
low noise silicon detectors has been made possible by recent technology advances
in communications, optical storage, and video cameras. This STTR project will
investigate the feasibility of using near-infrared fluorescence for detecting
and quantifying analytes using liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary
electrophoresis (HPCE). Various optical configurations will be fabricated in
order to maximize sensitivity as well as compatibility with HPLC and HPCE. Both
direct fluorescence using analytes labeled with near-infrared dyes will be
examined. Applications includes detection of analytes in media such as blood
where background fluorescence and scatter is greatly reduced in the near-
infrared.
