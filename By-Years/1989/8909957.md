Complex social interactions involve communication through auditory, postural,
visual and olfactory signals. In nature, Norway rats possess a complex social
system which includes reproductive, territorial and agonistic behavior. Rats,
like many other mammalian species including humans, utilize several channels of
communication in the integration of their social activities. While it is clear
that this species rely heavily on olfaction and tactile in their social
communication, acoustical communication plays an important role as well. Rats
communicate acoustically with ultrasonic vocalizations which are only audible by
sophisticated instrumentation. Dr. Barfield has defined several different
ultrasonic vocalizations that occur during different phases of reproductive
activity. He will now elucidate the role of these ultrasonic calls in
coordinating reproductive activity between males and females. The role that
vocalizations by males play in facilitating impregnation and fertility in
females will also be investigated. Rats serve as an important model system for
mammalian reproductive physiology and behavior. An appreciation of the role of
vocal communication in rat reproduction will enhance our general understanding
of reproductive coordination. The questions proposed by Dr. Barfield are of
theoretical importance and immediate relevance to research in the field of
behavioral neuroendocrinology.
