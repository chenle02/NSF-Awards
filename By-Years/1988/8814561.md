Professor F. Michael Christ of the University of California at Los Angeles will
be principal lecturer at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at the
University of Montana in August of 1989. The lectures will discuss recent
developments concerning Calderon-Zygmund singular integral operations and their
applications to function theory, including boundary value problems for Laplace's
equation on nonsmooth domains and analysis of functions of several complex
variables.
