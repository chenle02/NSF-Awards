This project is designed to enhance the laboratory learning experience in
courses populated by chemistry, biology, and pre- professional majors. Using the
requested Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) in several laboratories
(organic, instrumental, physical, biochemistry, and research), students discover
molecular and quantitative information about diverse chemical substances.
Several innovative experiments to enhance student learning result in the
discovery of the relationship between hydrogen bonding and physical state and
hydrogen bond strength and electronegativity; measurement of bond distances from
rotational energies and bond dissociation energies from overtone spectra;
qualitative and quantitative analysis of environmental samples; and examination
of changes in protein and nucleic acid secondary structure. The FTIR also
facilitates an ongoing research project to determine pesticide persistence in
environmental matrices. Through use of the FTIR in successive laboratories,
students headed for graduate study or the environmental workforce are well
prepared for the research and testing applications of academic, industrial,
private, and governmental laboratories.
