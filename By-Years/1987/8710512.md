This proposal seeks to develop an immobilized cell reactor in which a
recombinant DNA instability problem (plasmid instability) is overcome by
selectively killing cells without recombinant DNA (without a plasmid). This is
to be done using a toxin (colicin) to E. coli cells. A plasmid is to be used
that confers resistance of these cells to colicin as well as a receptor site on
the cell surface to this toxin. Colicin is to be attached to a column of
sepharose beads and act as a binding agent for the E. coli. Those cells without
the plasmid presumably will be killed and wash off the column while those cells
with the plasmid will presumably stay attached to the column. The advantage of
the above system to a suspension cell culture (fermentation) is twofold. - The
toxin is not in solution and will not wash out of the reactor thus saving on the
cost of the toxin. - The product of the bioreactor will not need to pass through
a purification step to eliminate the toxin. The PI is considered to be well
qualified to carry out the proposed research and I recommend funding of this
proposal.
