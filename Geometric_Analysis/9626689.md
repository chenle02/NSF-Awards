9626689 Leung The proposal lies in the area of complex differential geometry.
The investigator proposes to compute Seiberg-Witten invariants for complex non-
Kahler surfaces; to generalize Seiberg-Witten theory to include higher
dimensional manifolds. Additionally, he is to investigate the relationship
between the existence of Einstein-Hermitian metrics and stability of vector
bundles a la Gieseker. In 1995 Seiberg and Witten introduced a system of
differential equations on four dimensional spaces and defined certain invariant
quantities (they are solutions to these equations); this work significantly
impacted the classification theory of smooth four dimensional curved spaces. The
proposed research attempts to continue this line of investigation with an
emphasis on those four manifolds that are not algebraically defined.
