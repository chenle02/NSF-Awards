This award supports a project to search for hydrothermal vents in the Bransfield
Straits region of the Antarctic Peninsula. This region contains a rift which has
formed on thinned continental crust. Hydrothermal vents thought to be associated
with this rift contribute to heat and mass fluxes in this region of the ocean
and may host unusual communities of organisms. The vent survey will be
accomplished by towing an instrument package called the ZAPS sled near the
bottom, approximately 2 kilometers deep. The instruments on the sled measure
metal content of the sea water and other parameters that allow detection of
plumes from hydrothermal vents. When indications of a plume are detected, the
survey is altered to follow the plume back to its source. In this fashion, vents
should be located and a general map of hydrothermal emanations from the rift
will be constructed. When combined with the swath bathymetry, a sub-sea
topographic map with hydrothermal vents location will be produced. This
information will be used for assessing the contribution of the Bransfield Strait
rift to global heat and mass fluxes associated with spreading ridges and will be
important to assessing the potential for future research associated with vent
biota at high latitudes.
