Research on collective modes and dynamical transport coefficients of strongly
coupled plasmas using analytical techniques are carried forward. In particular
the Quasi Localized Charge Model developed during the last few years will be
applied to the calculation of dielectric response tensors and collective mode
structures for Coulomb liquids at strong coupling. Applications include dense,
hot plasmas, electron gas in metals, molten salts, liquid metals, two-
dimensional electron liquids at the interface of dielectric materials,
superlattices and binary ionic mixtures. The non- perturbative approaches used
in the current research allow computations where customary perturbation methods
are inadequate.
