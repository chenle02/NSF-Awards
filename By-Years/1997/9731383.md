9731383 Green This grant provides partial salary support for a technician at the
UC-Riverside Tectonophysics laboratory. This is a Phase II grant for technical
support under the EAR/IF program. The technician is essentially a machinist who
provides the necessary high precision fabrication of parts for continued
development of Dr. Green's modified multianvil device used in studies of the
deformation mechanics of deep mantle phases. This innovative and unique high
pressure multianvil device introduces shear stresses on samples contained in a
NaCl confining media, thereby reducing piston frictional effects and resultant
spatial temperature variations within the sample volume. Experimental results
using this device with germanate and titanate analogues of deep mantle silicates
has resulted in Green's hypothesis that deep-focus earthquakes within subduction
zones are the result of a phase change from olivine to a spinel polymorph. Work
in the arena of high-pressure phase change initiation of faulting continues with
synthetic silicates and improvements in the engineering design of Green's
modified multianvil device. These experiments hold considerable promise for our
understanding of deep earthquake mechanics. ***
