9315257 Passino This award of $153,000 is for curriculum development in
intelligent systems and control. The focus is on engineering analysis,
reliability, economics, and implementation of intelligent systems. Several
existing courses at Ohio State University will be combined and developed into a
new lecture-only course and a lecture- laboratory course. The first course will
introduce intelligent systems concepts, fuzzy logic and systems, contemporary
fuzzy and expert control techniques, and analytical techniques for intelligent
control systems, and will infuse research into the classroom through
introduction of current thesis topics that focus on industrial applications and
through guest lectures by colleagues in academia, industry and government
laboratories. In the second course, students will perform a series of
experiments for an introduction into experimental research and industrial
applications, and will complete a design project in intelligent systems that
includes laboratory implementation and practical economic and reliability
considerations.
