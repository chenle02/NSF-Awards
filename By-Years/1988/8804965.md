This award will fund the purchase of varied items of equipment to be housed in
a central shared instrumentation facility for members of the Department of
Biology at Stanford University. The items include a scintillation counter,
ultracentrifuges and rotors, an ELISA plate reader and a protein sequencer.
These items are of general use; all 20 members of the department will share in
their use. Recently, progress in many, if not all, areas of biological research
has depended on instruments and techniques originally developed for molecular
biology and immunology. These equipment items will augment the supply at
Stanford of instruments needed for a number of such techniques and thus
facillitate research by members of a department which is one of the best in the
country.
