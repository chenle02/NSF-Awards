This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a cost-
effective method for reducing the quantities of copper used for agricultural
crop protection. Currently, millions of pounds of copper are being sprayed onto
plants each year. This copper is released into the environment, resulting in
contamination of soil and waterways and deleterious effects on the ecosystem.
Furthermore, pathogens are becoming resistant to copper pesticides,
necessitating even higher rates of copper usage. The scope of the proposed
project is to optimize the structure of Agile Sciences? library of small, non-
toxic organic compounds, to provide an economically viable solution for reducing
the amount of copper released into the environment.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes both
environmental and economic considerations. Bacterial pathogens are becoming
increasingly resistant to copper, but farmers currently have few economically
feasible alternatives. Agile?s compounds enhance the efficacy of copper
treatments, so that the amount of copper released into the environment is
substantially reduced.
