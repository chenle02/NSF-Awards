CCR-ITR-0325808&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR: Formal Digital
Libraries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carsten
Schuermann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical knowledge is at the core of science
and engineering. The quantity of mathematical knowledge is growing faster than
our ability to formalize and organize it. The proposed research focuses on
developing Formal Digital Libraries (FDL), a common and open infrastructure for
managing and sharing mathematical knowledge and formal proof. Central to this
work is the design of a logical framework as a representation language for
logical formalisms, individual theories, and proofs, with an interface to
theorem proving systems such as PVS or HOL, that have been effective in
industrial practice. FDL emphasizes interoperability between theorem proving
systems, and the exchange and reusability of mathematical facts across different
systems. The FDL infrastructure is designed to be scalable with respect to the
size of the knowledge base as well as the diversity of
formalisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FDL project encourages industry and
academia to contribute, maintain, and use basic mathematical knowledge related
to formal methods in hardware, software, and engineering. The FDL project
contributes to the cyberinfrastructure by formalizing and organizing practical
mathematical knowledge in a readily usable form. Application areas for FDL
include education, computer-aided design, mathematical modelling, formal
verification, and scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;
