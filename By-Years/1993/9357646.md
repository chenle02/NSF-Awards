This research, supported by the National Science Foundation Young Investigator
award, will address theoretical and methodological issues in Bayesian
statistical inference. The first topic concerns information-theoretic
diagnostics to assess and construct prior distributions. The second topic
involves using function space derivatives to perform sensitivity analysis. The
National Science Foundation Young Investigator award recognizes outstanding
young faculty. This award recognizes the recipient's strong potential for
continued professional growth as a research mathematician and for significant
development as a teacher and academic leader.//
