The University of Wisconsin at Superior will initiate a six-week, residential
Young Scholars program in Ecology for 20 students entering grades 10,11. Through
a series of classroom, field, and laboratory experiences participants will
become acquainted with the techniques used to monitor the physical, chemical,
and biological health of aquatic communities. Students will also be introduced
to the fields of environmental toxicology and bioremediation. They will then be
challenged to use their knowledge to design and carry out a group assessment of
portions of the Lake Superior watershed. The training that students receive in
this program will enable them to develop independent study projects which will
be completed at their local schools.
