A central theme in geometric group theory is to classify finitely presented
groups up to quasi-isomtery. This gives rise to the study of properties of
groups which are invariant up to quasi-isometry. The primary focus of this
project is to study various quasi-isometry invariants which come from
``fillings'' in geometric spaces modeling the group. These include Dehn
functions, which capture the difficulty of filling loops with disks or other
surfaces, and divergence functions, which measure the rate at which geodesics
emerging from a point move away from each other. One aspect of the project is to
study these invariants and their higher dimensional analogs in a variety of
classes of groups, such as non-positively curved groups, Coxeter groups and
mapping class groups. Another is to understand the relationships between
different filling functions in a given group.

Groups are fundamental objects of study in mathematics. A good example of a
group is the collection of symmetries of an object. The result of composing
symmetries (i.e. performing them one after another) is again a symmetry. Many
groups can be specified by giving a finite presentation: a finite list of
generators, and relations which indicate when two orders of composing elements
give the same answer. Naturally, it is important to understand when two
presentations define the same, or similar groups, but this is not always evident
by examining the presentations. One of the themes in geometric group theory is
to use geometric tools to address the question of determining whether the groups
given by two presentations have the same large-scale features. The goal of this
project is to conduct a detailed study of a class of such tools called filling
functions. These investigations give us better insight into the structure of
finitely presented groups.
