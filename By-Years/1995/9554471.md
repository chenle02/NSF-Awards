This proposal requests partial NSF support for the participation of Eastern
Europe scientists, particularly from the FSU countries, in the 1995 Education in
Optics conference to be held in San Diego, California, June 9-10, 1995. The
conference will provide a forum for international educators to exchange
information about teaching optics. Session topics range broadly over the field
of optics education, from pre- college to graduate. Optics education is carried
out at an advanced level widely throughout the world, and many of those
educators have a great deal to contribute to a better understanding and
appreciation of the conference theme. United States educators will benefit from
learning more about the methods employed in these other programs.
