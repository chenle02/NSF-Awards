The investigator, a CEDAR post-doctoral awardee, develops an empirical global
ionospheric electric field model, using all available incoherent scatter radar
ion drift measurements and some satellite observations. His model includes
longitudinal, latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, solar cycle, and geomagnetic
variations of the ionospheric electric field, and extends from equatorial to
high latitudes from the E to the upper F region. High, mid and low latitude
results are extended to lower altitudes by theoretical model results. Mid, low
and equatorial electric field perturbations include prompt penetration electric
fields from high to low latitudes, and electric field effects of the ionospheric
disturbance dynamo. The model significantly improves and extends existing global
empirical electric field models, and also provides realistic electric field
estimates for applying global ionospheric electric field distribution.
