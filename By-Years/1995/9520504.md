9520504 Frey The Neutron Activation Laboratory in the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) at MIT is a facility dedicated to the
analysis of natural materials, principally terrestrial rocks and minerals. The
instrumentation of this facility has been incrementally updated, most recently
in 1990, with the financial support of NSF and MIT. This facility is used for
the NSF-sponsored geochemical research of Frey and colleagues and by a diverse
group of other U.S. scientists, including faculty and students from other
universities in the northeast and is highly regarded by peers. This grant
provides $29,730 as partial support of the costs of replacing two semi-conductor
detectors which were purchased in 1979 and are at the end of their useful life.
These detectors along with ancillary electronics including high voltage
supplies, amplifiers and analog to digital converters (ADC's) will aid in
improved precision as well as guaranteeing the continuance of this facility's
successful operation and service to the geochemical community. ***
