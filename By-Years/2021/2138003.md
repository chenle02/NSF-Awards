Memories make us who we are. They serve as repositories of all kinds of
information from our daily lives, from mundane details to extravagant theories
and personal musings. This information isn’t randomly loaded into a storage unit
as happens in a desktop computer. Instead, our memory system structures the
incoming information. Researchers have long suspected that memories of the same
space might be stored together or linked in some way. Others have suggested the
same thing for time, that we might have a special temporal index that organizes
what we’ve experienced. Some have proposed that our memory systems include
special brain cells, or networks of cells, dedicated to encoding spatial and/or
temporal information. Similar questions can be asked concerning how memory
evolved in vertebrates and other animals. How did memory come to work the way it
does? Did it emerge from a system initially involved in navigating space or
tracking the flow of time? Do space and time have the same status in structuring
memory or is one more fundamental? Answers to these basic scientific issues will
enhance understanding of memory disorders and guide interventions to improve
memory and ameliorate memory decline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop on
Memory, Space, and Time will take place in Tucson, Arizona, with a multi-
disciplinary group of speakers from philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, as
well as local contributors from the sciences and humanities. Selected graduate
student scholars working in related areas will receive travel stipends. This
workshop will initiate a collaboration on a volume or journal special issue, to
be released in open access form following the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
