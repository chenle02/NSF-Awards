This Presidential Young Investigator grant is focused on electromagnetic
chiralilty and its applications to integrated optical devices and microwave and
millimeter-wave components. Chirality refers to the handedness of an object or a
medium. It has played an important role in a variety of fields such as
chemistry, optics, particle physics and mathematics. The research will be
directed to the following projects: (1) chirostrip antennas. These consist of
microstrip antennas with chiral materials as substrates and/or superstrates.
Their novel properties and capabilities will be investigated. (2) Chiro optical
waveguides. Preliminary analysis has revealed interesting and unconventional
guiding properties for such waveguides, with potential applications to optical
communications. (3) Chiral materials for microwave and millimeter wave regime.
Such materials can be made with the benefit of recent advances in polymer
chemistry. (4) Use of chiral materials in optical components and devices, such
as optical isolators and modulators.
