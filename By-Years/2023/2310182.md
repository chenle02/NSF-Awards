Quantum computing describes an innovative approach to computing that utilizes
the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems in science and
engineering. Existing implementations of quantum computers are highly
susceptible to unwanted external disturbances, known as “decoherence”, which
result in the loss of quantum information. This decoherence poses a significant
constraint on the range of problems that can be simulated effectively on quantum
computers. The limitation is especially severe in the simulation of properties
of physically relevant and technologically significant quantum mechanical
systems, such as molecules or solids. However, substantial knowledge exists
regarding the mathematical and physical properties of these systems. This
project aims to leverage this insight to improve the accuracy of quantum
mechanical simulations on quantum computers. It will do so by designing precise
and practical methodologies for reducing noise and improving accuracy, thereby
promoting the progress of science.

All quantum computers built so far suffer from noise and decoherence issues.
When quantum computers are used to simulate the properties of molecules and
solids in condensed matter and quantum chemistry, the main property of interest
is the excitation information encoded in the spectra of response functions. This
spectral information has mathematical properties that severely constrain the
allowed response functions, and that can therefore be employed as a ‘noise
filter’ for quantum computing data. This project will investigate ways to employ
this mathematical information in practical algorithms to reduce noise of quantum
data. Implementations and tests with synthetic data and with data from present-
day quantum computers are proposed. In addition, an outreach collaboration with
the University of Michigan’s Museum of Natural History will introduce the public
at schools and libraries to quantum phenomena including quantum coherence.
