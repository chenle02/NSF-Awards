This proposal requests funds that will enable research groups of physicists and
students at Norfolk State University to develop and help to construct a
sophisticated tracking device: a Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for the
ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN, in Geneva,
Switzerland. This proposal will allow underrepresented minorities to participate
in the highest priority future experiment of the EPP program and associated
educational and outreach activities, in collaboration with physicists from other
universities in the US and abroad, and in collaboration with nearby Jefferson
laboratory.
