9727118 Ulmer This award provides funding for the development of an
electrochemical system for accurate pH measurements in hydrothermal solutions at
temperatures over the range 100-450 oC and at pressures of up to a kilobar. The
development of an accurate pH measurement system for use at such high
temperatures and pressures is expected to advance our fundamental understanding
of chemical processes in natural environments such as ocean ridge hydrothermal
vents and other volcanic areas where both the generation of life and the
formation of mineral deposits are of great interest. This development project is
to be accomplished as collaboration between principal investigator teams at
Temple University and Princeton University (this award), and the Pennsylvania
State University (through a companion award). ***
