The July 9-12, 2012 workshop "Towards in silico biological cells: Bridging
experiments and simulations" in Lausanne, Switzerland will bring together
researchers from two basic and complementary approaches for simulating the
dynamics of cellular processes within the cytoplasm of bacterial cells:
particle-based Brownian dynamics algorithms that have been used to describe the
diffusive transport in crowded environments and reaction-diffusion master
equations that have been used to describe stochastic kinetics of gene
expression, genetic switches and biochemical pathways functioning in modeled
biological cells. This Workshop will provide the opportunity to bring
researchers from the scientific fields of molecular simulations and system
biology together with experimentalists who are labeling and imaging cellular
components. We envision that this cross fertilization will lead to significant
scientific advances in the computational modeling of an entire cell, its
components, cell division and the coupling of universal processes of
transcription and translation to the response of the cell's metabolic network.
