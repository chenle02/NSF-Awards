The principal investigator, in a collaborative effort with David Yuen (Univ. of
Minnesota), will model binary solid-melt phase change problems in magmatic
systems. The solid, mush, and totally molten regions will be solved for
temperature, fraction solidified, velocity, pressure, and coexisting solid (if
present) and melt at every location and time. The model will be tested against
existing experimental data for various systems. Further, it will be used to
address fundamental questions about igneous processes for both basaltic and
granitic systems.
