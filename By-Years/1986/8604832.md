This equipment grant will support the construction of a high repetition rate
amplifier system for femtosecond dye laser pulses. The PI plans to investigate
the nonlinear optical properties of novel group II-VI semiconductor
superlattices containing magnetic ions, when subjected to short pulses of nearly
resonant high intensity laser radiation. The experimental work involves the use
of high power picosecond and femtosecond laser techniques at visible
wavelengths. Of specific physical interest are interactions in a dense exciton
gas from the standpoint of insulator-metal transition, including the presence of
an external magnetic field. Generally, such phenomena are associated with large
optically induced changes in the material transparency, thereby providing a
device connection to fast optical switches.
