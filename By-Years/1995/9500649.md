This research concerns the action of a Hopf algebra H on an algebra R. These
actions generalize the more familiar actions of groups as automorphisms, of Lie
algebras as derivations, and of coactions of groups which give group-graded
algebras. The principal investigator will study crossed products; duality
problems involving the action of a Hopf algebra; the structure of general
pointed Hopf algebras; the generalized Lie structure of associative algebras,
where this Lie structure means that the Lie bracket is taken in a category of
comodules of a suitable bialgebra; and extensions of Hopf algebras in
categories. This research is concerned with an algebraic object called a Hopf
algebra. While the area is quite technical, Hopf algebras are becoming of
increasing interest, even to non mathematicians. Hopf algebras are useful in the
type of knot theory that is of interest to molecular chemists. Certain types of
Hopf algebras are now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of their
applications in physics. Hopf algebras are used to study differential operators
and to make combinatorics more like calculus.
