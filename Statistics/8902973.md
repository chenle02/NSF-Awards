Research will be conducted on data-driven smoothing parameter selection and
assessment of the variability of nonparametric curve estimators. Methodology
will be developed for the free boundary problem in sequential analysis,
particularily for general priors. Attempts will be made to establish a
conjecture for the "bomber problem" (concerning defense allocation rates). A
pilot study for the general problem of estimating distortion will be applied to
encryption. In the case that a grid of data is partitioned by an unknown natural
boundary that separates data into two homogeneous groups, a nonparametric method
for estimating the boundary will be studied. To deal with dependent observations
and heavy-tailed observations, research will be carried out on modifications of
the bootstrap, a nonparametric technique for modelling the sampling distribution
of a statistic.
