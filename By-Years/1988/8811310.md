Strike-slip faults are common geologic structures that separate geologic
blocks. The North American-Caribbean strike-slip boundary provides a unique
example of a large offset (-1100 km), active transform fault that exhibits
characteristics of both oceanic and continental transforms. The plate tectonic
controls on the structure of this interplate boundary in Central America and the
western Cayman Trough remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relations between
strike-slip faults of the interplate boundary and a broad zone of active
interplate deformation - the Western Caribbean Extensional Province - have not
been explored with modern marine geophysical techniques. The interpretation of
this complex area has great implications for interpreting the structure of other
active oceanic and continental strike-slip zones as well as ancient strike-slip
faults now preserved in mountain belts. %%% This project involves a marine
survey of structure in the Cayman Trough along the North American - Caribbean
strike-slip boundary using the SeaMARC II high-resolution side-scan sonar. This
survey is designed to help resolve several long-standing questions in strike-
slip tectonics including how strike-slip faults and associated structures can be
interpreted in terms of the direction of interplate motion and the stress state
of the interplate area, and how the structure of strike-slip faults is affected
by continental vs. oceanic crustal type.
