A geometric modeling system is a basic building block in any computer-aided
design system for discrete products based on mechanical engineering. A number of
such systems have been developed. However, it is not yet possible to use them
effectively for establishing tolerances on dimensions of parts. This problem
will be addressed in three phases. In the first phase, tolerances will be
defined in mathematical terms. In the second phase, algorithms which verify
dimensional correctness will be developed. In the third phase, experiments will
be conducted to demonstrate that the tolerances can indeed be verified, and that
verification for assembly can be performed using machine vision inspection.
