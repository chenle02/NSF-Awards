This project will fund early-career US participants to attend a conference on
"Microlocal Analysis and Applications" to be held at Fudan University in
Shanghai in June 2019. This conference, the first ever in the field to take
place in China, will focus on the theory and uses of microlocal analysis, a
field of mathematics which studies how solutions to many equations arising in
physics and geometry may be analyzed in phase space, where one keeps track of
momentum as well as position. The project will enhance training in this
important field of mathematics and will facilitate international
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will fund junior US
researchers, primarily postdocs and advanced graduate students, but possibly
also tenure-track researchers from non-R1 institutions, to attend a meeting on
the theory and applications of microlocal analysis at Fudan University in
Shanghai in June 2019. Microlocal analysis, which is analysis of partial
differential equations by phase space methods, has roots in the development of
pseudodifferential and Fourier integral operators in the 1960s, but has of late
been experiencing a renaissance in the breadth of its applications across pure
and applied mathematics. The meeting will explore advances in fundamental
techniques as well as recent applications in areas as diverse as inverse
problems, general relativity, classical dynamics, and quantum chaos. The grant
will enhance US doctoral and postdoctoral training in microlocal analysis as
well as encouraging international collaborations in this and related
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://sites.math.northwestern.edu/fudan-

mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
