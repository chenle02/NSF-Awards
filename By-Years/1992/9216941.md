This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to apply existing
techniques in parallel processing to the problem ofplanning with multiple
agents. A model is designed which allows a view of the problem as a sequence of
interleaved tree search and satisfaction steps. The research investigates
various factors influencing the performance of this model when the search and
constraint satisfaction are performed on parallel computers. These factors
include partitioning the plan generation process among various processors, the
nature of various distributed data structures and the effect of ordering
heuristics on complexity of search space. The new models developed are
implemented and validated on the new generation CM% and the nCUBE2 parallel
computers.
