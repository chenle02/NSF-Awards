The PIs will investigate the effect of including the hydrodynamic effects due to
the large lakes in east Africa on climate variability of the region. Prior work
by the PIs has demonstrated that the hydrodynamics of Lake Victoria plays a
critical role in determining the coupled variability of the lake and regional
climate. Adopting the traditional approach in which the model formulation is
entirely based on thermodynamics and the motion in the lake is neglected, has
not proven satisfactory for this region. The PIs will also study the role of
coastal Indian Ocean thermodynamic forcing on climate variability of the region.
In addition, the physical mechanisms responsible for extreme climate conditions
over east Africa during the recent 1997-1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation event
will be examined. There is strong educational collaboration related to this
research between University of Nairobi, Kenya, and University of North Carolina
Raleigh. The work is important because it will lead to better understanding of
regional climate variability over east Africa. This has important societal
benefits.
