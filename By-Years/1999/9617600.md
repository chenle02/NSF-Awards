An integrated computational environment for computer-aided mechanical design
will be developed and tested. The environment will support the key design tasks
of function validation, dynamical simulation, parametric design, and functional
tolerancing for a broad range of mechanical assemblies, such as camera shutter
mechanisms, part feeders, robotic arms, and computer housings. The research will
address the fundamental task of computing the effects of part contacts on
function. Contact analysis is difficult and time-consuming even for experienced
designers due to the quantity and complexity of the contact constraints in
modern assemblies. The difficulty is greatest in assemblies with multiple
contacts, meaning that different parts interact at various stages of the work
cycle. There is no general purpose software for contact analysis. Contact
analysis will be studied within the configuration space representation of
mechanical function. Configuration space computation algorithms will be extended
to the full range of planar assemblies and to selected spatial assemblies.
Algorithmic support will be developed for the design tasks via configuration
space manipulation. The software will emphasize breadth of coverage, depth of
analysis, and robustness.
