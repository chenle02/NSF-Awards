The objective of this award is the development of novel methodologies for
treating cardiac arrhythmias associated with abnormal electrical activity in the
heart. This will include the computation of energy-optimal stimuli which drive
the states of myocardial cells to a region of phase space for which they become
nearly synchronized, thereby terminating spiral wave activity and preventing
spiral wave reentry. The algorithm used to accomplish this will involve new
computational approaches for finding appropriate target regions of phase space
and solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in higher dimensions. Another
methodology will use the action potential duration restitution curve, which is
an experimentally measurable function that describes the duration of an action
potential as a function of the time since the end of the preceding action
potential. Given this curve, the methods of dynamic programming will be applied
to determine an optimal pulse train within a family of possibilities for
synchronization of myocardial activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardiac arrhythmias
can disrupt the coordination that is essential for the effective pumping of
blood, and can lead to cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest often receive
an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), but defibrillating shocks from
ICDs can lead to fibrosis in the myocardium, making it necessary to use stronger
defibrillating shocks. The shocks can also cause adverse short-term side effects
such as intense chest pain and post-shock dysfunction. If successful, this
research will represent an early step toward the use of energy-optimal stimuli
for ICDs, which would reduce the need for surgical replacement of their
batteries,and might mitigate some of the deleterious side effects of
defibrillation. This work will also contribute to the development of
computational tools which can be used to find optimal control strategies in a
wide range of applications.
