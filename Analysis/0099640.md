This is a proposal to investigate aspects of low dimensional dynamical systems.
The most important long term project is to better understand a topological
description of C^r generic area preserving diffeomorphisms of surfaces where r >
1. In addition the proposer hopes to investigate the action of more general
groups than the integers or the reals on surfaces, and in particular area
preserving actions.

Professor Franks will continue his investigation of the dynamics of surface
maps. The study of such transformations, especially area preserving ones, has a
long history going back to Poincare and G. D. Birkhoff. There are numerous
applications of results in this area to classical mechanics as well as more
modern chaotic dynamics. The proposed research will address questions concerning
the existence of periodic behavior in area preserving two-dimensional discrete
dynamical systems and a topological description of the dynamics of such systems.
