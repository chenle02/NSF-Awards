&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop an innovative system for reliably and inexpensively attaching medium- to
heavy-weight equipment to thin-skin composite sandwich structures. This will be
accomplished with proprietary metallic foam (patent applied) and polymeric
partial inserts with functionally graded stiffness. This is different from the
stiffness of the sandwich material and is set to the stiffness and strength
required to carry the equipment. By varying the stiffness of the insert from low
to high, it will be possible to carry the weight of the equipment without
damaging the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) core material. Inserts of metal foam and
polymer composite with varying density and stiffness will be fabricated by a
patented extrusion, free-form fabrication technology. Due to the materials low
density, less than one or two pounds of the attachment material will be of
adequate volume for a composite attachment system. Thus, the material cost of
the attachment system will be small relative to the cost of a traditional
sandwich composite structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications are
anticipated in manufacture of vehicles for commercial transportation, e.g.,
buses, trains, small crafts, and aircrafts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
