This project supports the participation of junior researchers in the workshop
"Last Frontiers in Quantum Information Science (LFQIS)". Held in Talkeetna,
Alaska from July 18-22, 2019, LFQIS builds on a successful 5-year track record
(2013-2017) of bringing together junior and senior researchers to collaborate
and share knowledge in Quantum Information Science (QIS). LFQIS is the only
annual QIS event held in Alaska. This project will allow for the participation
in LFQIS of talented undergraduate students and teaching faculty at Alaskan
universities interested in QIS.

This project advances the objectives of "Quantum Leap", one of the 10 Big Ideas
for Future NSF Investments. The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of
U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing
problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known. This
project also advances objectives of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), a
coordinated multiagency program to support research and training in Quantum
Information Science (QIS).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
