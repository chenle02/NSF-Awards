Reactions and removal of tropospheric sulfur dioxide occur via a variety of
pathways. The dominant gas phase reaction path, with the hydroxyl radical, is
thought to be characterized by a sulfur dioxide half-life of 7-14 days. Reaction
on aerosol surfaces, and in haze and cloud droplets results in the direct
production of sulfate in cloud and precipitation water. Laboratory kinetic data
suggest that aqueous phase reactions of dissolved sulfur dioxide with peroxides
and ozone are the most efficient pathway by which sulfur dioxide is removed from
the atmosphere. To complement laboratory data, and because of the need to
understand processes which produce oxidized sulfur species in tropospheric
clouds, field studies are recognized as important objectives of atmospheric
chemistry research. Knowledge of the oxidants and processes responsible for the
conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid are essential if predictions of
precipitation composition are to be made. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide
dissolved in cloud droplets is thought to be affected by several factors which
make it difficult to extrapolate laboratory studies of aqueous sulfur dioxide
oxidation to natural cloud systems. In this research a set of unique experiments
designed to measure the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate in orographic
clouds will be carried out. These measurements will be compared to a detailed
cloud chemistry model using laboratory derived rate constants and cloud
composition measurements as input parameters. The experimental strategy is to
release pulses of sulfur dioxide into the cloud from a ground based generator
and to collect cloud water as a rime ice deposit during plume detection at the
mountain top observatory. This experimental design has been tested and shown to
be capable of producing usable results. Plume transport times will be measured
using several shorter pulses of an inert tracer during the sulfur dioxide
releases.
