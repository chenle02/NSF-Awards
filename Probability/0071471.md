0071471 Mountford Professor Mountford will continue investigating interacting
particle systems. Working in conjunction with Professor M. Bramson, he hopes to
show the existence of "blocking measures" for the exclusion processes where the
underlying random walk is finite range and possesses non-zero mean. If
successful, they intend to examine the question of characterizing the extremal
invariant measures for these processes. The key tool, the laws of large numbers
of Rezakhanlou, will, it is to be hoped, also play a role in establishing
convergence results for tandems of complicated Jackson networks. Professor
Mountford will also continue his research with Professor R. Dalang into path
properties of the Brownian sheet. In particular it is hoped to address how many
distinct bubbles at a fixed (or a random level) can meet at a point.

Professor Mountford will continue to work in the field of interacting particle
systems. These are random systems consisting of an infinite array of connected
values which evolve according to simple rules governed by the current state of
neighboring values. What makes these processes interesting, both mathematically
and scientifically, is that often there exist multiple, qualitatively different,
equilibria for the same process. A major task is finding or characterizing all
possible equilibria. Currently Professor Mountford is working on this question
for the exclusion process. This is a process where particles try to move
independently in a random fashion. The (interesting) interacting part of the
process comes from the rule that no two particles can occupy the same position
and so moves by particles that would result in multiple occupancy are
suppressed.
