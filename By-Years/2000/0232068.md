This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I researches a commercial
software application for personal computing devices. This commercial software
application for personal computing devices is called the AIR (Atmospheric
Information Remote). Its purpose is to provide consumers with an accurate,
convenient and inexpensive way of measuring air pollution in their locality. AIR
devices are used by people with atmospheric sensitivities. People with
atmospheric sensitivities are children under 14 years old, people with asthma,
heart disease or chronic respiratory disease, and the elderly. The AIR device
protects the health of people with atmospheric sensitivities by letting them
know when to go indoors or otherwise shelter themselves from the effects of
nearby polluted air. The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to
define the information infrastructure needed to support the commercial delivery
of the AIR application. Defining the information infrastructure involves
detailing the specifications of each component within the information
infrastructure. Some of these components exist, such as personal computing
devices. Some do not exist, such as project specific software. The results of
the component specification detail is a design document. This design document
determines the feasibility of further research and development based on
marketability and profitability.
