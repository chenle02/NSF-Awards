The project begins with a meeting of directors of recent and current NSF-funded
projects in statistics education and approximately ten other individuals with
relevant interest and expertise. The principal goal is for directors to exchange
information about their projects, with an explicit focus on ways the more
adventurous aspects of each project can enrich the thinking of other project
directors about their won projects, and wats to use evaluation and assessment,
in the spirit of statistical process control, to enhance the effectiveness of
the projects while they are still in progress. Follow up activities include
guided electronic mail conferences among the participants and the incorporation
of the fruits of the face-to-face and electronic conferences into a report to be
distributed electronically to the statistics community. In addition, the report
and excerpts from the report will be submitted to appropriate publications.
