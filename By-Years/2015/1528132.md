Data-centric technologies form an essential part of the nation's economy and
infrastructure. Coincident with the evolution of these technologies, the amount
of information that is being collected, stored and processed is growing at an
exponential pace. A sustainable solution for managing this explosion of data
should be guided in part by a fundamental understanding of how information can
be stored in a succinct manner that meets utility and access requirements. This
research seeks to quantify basic tradeoffs associated with information storage,
utility and accessibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information theory provides a
framework for quantifying what is and what is not possible in data compression
and transmission. The traditional information-theoretic framework, however, does
not readily address critical challenges inherent to modern data processing
applications and large data sets. In particular, information-theoretic analyses
generally ignore complexity constraints and encounter significant difficulties
when distributed settings are considered. Building on recent work by the
principal investigator on compression under logarithmic loss and compression for
similarity queries, this project will address these two issues by investigating
rate-distortion tradeoffs with the added dimensions of distributed processing
and complexity constraints. Specific goals of the project include (i)
characterizing the compressibility of an information source subject to the
constraint that elementary queries are supported in the compressed domain with
bounded complexity; and (ii) quantifying the performance of distributed
processing (relative to centralized processing) for compression and inference.
As a counterpart to the proposed theoretical analyses, the design of practical
algorithms that are capable of achieving the established information-theoretic
limits will be pursued.
