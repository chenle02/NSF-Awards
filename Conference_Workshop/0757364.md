Abstract Rodman

This award is for partial support of the International Workshop on Operator
Theory and Applications (IWOTA), which has met biannually since 1981 (and more
frequently in recent years) rotating among twelve countries on four continents.
These conferences have presented opportunities for young researchers to present
their work to an expert audience and to further their knowledge of the field by
interacting with more experienced mathematicians. In a combination of plenary
lectures by eminent mathematicians and experts in related applied areas, the
planned conference will cover a wide range of topics, including operator
inequalities, hyper-complex operator theory, model and structured operators,
operators and systems, multivariable operator theory, composition operators,
applications of indefinite inner product spaces, interpolation, moment problems,
factorization problems, structured matrices, orthogonal polynomials, special
classes of operators, financial mathematics, and core engineering. The planned
conference will also be held in conjunction with WONRA (Workshop on Numerical
Ranges and Radii and Applications), a topic that recently attracted particular
attention in view of its applications to quantum information.
