The goal of this proposal is to initiate a study of plant resistance to aphids
in a system consisting of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and the potato aphid
(Macrosiphum euphorbiae). Dr. Williamson has recently described a tomato gene,
Meul, that confers resistance to potato aphid. Meul is tightly linked to Mi, a
single, dominant locus that is present in some tomato lines and mediates
resistance to root- knot nematodes. Mi-mediated nematode resistance is
associated with a localized necrosis in the root within 24 hours of penetration
by the nematode. The mechanism of Meul- mediated resistance to aphids has not
yet been studied in detail. Preliminary observations, and comparison to the
nematode resistance, suggest that specific recognition of the aphid by the plant
is involved in the initial step of a signal transduction cascade that leads to
localized necrosis and production of defense compounds. This would represent the
first example of this mechanism of plant resistance to an insect. This proposal
seeks to establish the groundwork for a future proposal on characterizing the
recognition mechanism and signal transduction pathway of plant response to
aphid.
