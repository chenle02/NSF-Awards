This dissertation focuses on Canadian government programs of resettlement of
Inuit (Eskimo) communities: from Port Harrison to Resolute Bay and Grise Fiord
(1953-55), Ennadai Lake to North Henik Lake (1957-58), Nutak and Hebron to
southern Labrador (1956-59), and Killiniq to northern Quebec (1978). Field and
archival research will focus on government use of resettlement for sustainable
development, impacts on health, economic welfare, intergroup relations and
social change. The goal is to gain an understanding of the political processes
involved at the time and the long-term social and economic effects of relocation
on native populations in the Arctic.
