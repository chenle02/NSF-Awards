Abstract ATM-9320004 Pollack, Henry N. University of Michigan Title: Global
Database of Borehole Temperatures and Climate Reconstructions This research
award addresses the design, assembly, analysis and interpretation of a global
data base of geothermal observations on continents relevant to climate change
over the past 1000 years. This time interval spans both the pre-industrial and
industrial periods, and is relevant to an assessment of both natural variability
and anthropogenic forcing the Earth's surface temperature at the century to
millennial time scale. The database will comprise (1) basic geothermal
observations from field surveys, including borehole temperature vs. depth data,
thermophysical properties and site descriptions, (2) a ground surface
temperature history derived for each site by a standardized inversion procedure
operating on the basic field observations, (3) regionalized composite histories
derived by joint inversions and/or weighted averaging of individual sites, and
(4) cross references to local meteorological and other nearby proxy data. The
database will include data from several hundred sites distributed over six
continents.
