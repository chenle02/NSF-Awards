Researchers and educators at California State University Los Angeles (CSULA)
will initiate research in the area of fiber optic sensors, introducing students
to this vital field early in their educational experience by providing them with
a hands-on research experience. This work capitalizes upon a research
infrastructure investment made at CSULA in 1994, which helped establish fiber
optics laboratory.
