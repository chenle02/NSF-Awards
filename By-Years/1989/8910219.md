The objective of this project is to investigate the combined effects of
hydrodynamic lag and creep on the long-term performance of excavations in
saturated soils addressing the issues of stability and deformation behavior. To
achieve this objective, a recently developed excavation analysis solution
algorithm proposed by Borja, Lee and Seed which provides a theoretically correct
and analytically efficient solution to the basic problem of nonlinear elasto-
plastic modelling of incremental excavation will be extended to incorporate
hydrodynamic log and creep effects. No theoretically correct solution is
presently available for modelling important phenomena associated with the
problem of incremental excavation below the water table such as hydrodynamic
lag, free surface flows, and the viscous behavior of the soil skeleton itself.
The Finite Element program thus developed will be used to investigate the
influence of the above phenomena on the long-term performance of excavations in
saturated, creep susceptible soils.
