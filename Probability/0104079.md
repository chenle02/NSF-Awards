The investigator will study various analytic and probabilistic problems related
to finite and infinite differential geometry, especially Riemannian manifolds
with boundary and path and loop spaces over such manifolds. In the case of
Riemannian manifold with boundary, he will try to obtain a useful formulation of
the Feynman-Kac formula for vector bundles (mainly differential forms) which can
be used effectively in a number of problems. A formula of this type was obtained
before but is not easy to be applied to the problems. He will prove that the
derivatives of the heat semigroup can be bounded explicitly in terms of the
Ricci curvature and the second fundamental form of the boundary. The approach he
will adopt for the finite dimensional problems is intimately related to
stochastic analysis on path spaces over Riemannian manifolds. In the infinite
dimensional setting, he hopes to break new ground in path and loop space
analysis by studying the case when the manifold has a boundary, thus breaking
new ground. Specifically he will try to prove an integration by parts formula in
the path space for this case. This is a reasonable starting point for
investigating manifolds with boundary, for as it is well known that integration
by parts formula lies at the center of many interesting problems in path and
loop spaces. Stochastic analysis in geometry is an active research area in
probability theory. Its goal is to use stochastic methods (as opposed to
analytic methods) to investigate models with well defined geometric structures.
Many models studied in this area (e.g., path and loop spaces) are mathematical
abstractions of concrete models in physics and other related areas of science
and engineering (especially high energy physics and space technology). An
understanding of the mathematical structure of these models is usually the first
step towards their practical applications.
