This project introduces undergraduate Computer Science faculty to parallel
computing through a two-week course during the summer. Those completing the
course are not only prepared to develop an undergraduate course on parallel
computing, but also to assess the feasibility of establishing an undergraduate
parallel processing laboratory at their own college and the possibilities for
incorporating aspects of parallel computing into other courses. The two-week
course includes lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel computing and
instruction on the design and implementation of parallel algorithms. About half
the time of this course is devoted to hands-on programming. A one-week seminar
in January allows participants to present projects they have developed and used
and to discuss the practical aspects of teaching parallel programming to
undergraduates.
