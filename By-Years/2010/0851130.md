This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). This research will analyze serum samples and associated
morphometric measurements previously collected from well characterized
populations of wild baboons in the Awash National Park, Ethiopia. These sera
samples were collected over fourteen field seasons and include the entire
spectrum of ages within the populations. Using enzyme immunoassay techniques
this study will quantify levels of seven growth- and inflammation-related
hormones and proteins to test hypotheses regarding: 1) the endocrine correlates
of divergent growth trajectories in two species of baboons, including different
patterns of post-prime changes in body mass; 2) the hormonal underpinnings of
unique aspects of the hybrid growth trajectory; and 3) how wild baboon
populations compare to captive baboon populations with regard to the hormonal
correlates of growth and maturation. Intellectual Merit: The results of this
study will shed light on the physiological mechanisms underlying differences in
growth and adult size. They will also provide a basic framework for
understanding how shifts in timing and duration of developmental events can be
accomplished on a mechanical level. This addresses important questions regarding
plasticity and development and speaks to the evolution of growth, development,
and senescence thus furthering our understanding of the evolution of ontogeny in
primates. Broader Impacts: This project will employ one professional, full-time
technician, and a number of undergraduate and graduate students will participate
as research interns during the duration of the research. Further, a number of
aspects of this research project will be integrated into undergraduate and
graduate courses thus contributing to students' academic development and
training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
