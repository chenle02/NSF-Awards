This RUI program focuses on the development of a new
detector&lt;br/&gt;facility, the Forward Electron Tagger (FET), in Hall B at the
Thomas&lt;br/&gt;Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The main thrust of
the&lt;br/&gt;research, using the FET, involves studies of the structure of
mesons&lt;br/&gt;(meson spectroscopy) and the electromagnetic polarizabilities
of&lt;br/&gt;charged pions. Our goal is a better understanding of the behavior
of&lt;br/&gt;QCD (specifically, confinement), investigating the properties
of&lt;br/&gt;gluons and simple arrangements of quarks (mesons). The FET,
in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with the large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) in Hall
B,&lt;br/&gt;will allow the study of "photoproduction" using "almost
real"&lt;br/&gt;virtual photons via electron scattering at very small
forward&lt;br/&gt;angles. The proposed work will enhance the existing
research&lt;br/&gt;program of the Nuclear and Particle Physics group at Norfolk
State&lt;br/&gt;University and will provide an excellent opportunity
for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student involvement at the forefront of research
in&lt;br/&gt;nuclear and particle physics.&lt;br/&gt;
