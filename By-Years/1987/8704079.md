Belau is a U.S. Trusteeship in western Micronesia. The society has changed in
response to U.S. political control after World War II, and has been especially
affected by U.S. policy on nuclear armament. The proposed research will analyze
the response of the people of Belau to changing U.S. policy. It will focus
especially on the political participation of women and on how women characterize
the transformations that have taken place in their lives. For anthropology, this
project is part of a growing body of ethnographic research that attempts to
analyze changes in societies in terms of global context. It has methodological
significance in that it will combine social history with anthropological field
techniques. It will provide much needed information on South Pacific Islands
where nuclear enterprises have affected local people's environments. This
research will try to develop a new way for social scientists to understand the
debate on international nuclear arms. By understanding how individuals and
social groups come to grip with the threat of nuclear warfare and how they
respond to changing political policy, this project will help us understand
social processes within the international nuclear context.
