The Noncommutative Geometry Festival 2019 will be held at Washington University
in St. Louis from April 29th to May 3rd. This year, the theme of the festival is
Noncommutative Geometry and Representation Theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goals of the festival are to highlight some of the most significant recent
advances in noncommutative geometry, identify promising new research directions,
and acquaint graduate students and postdocs with the most current research in
the field. This year, topics will include index theory, hypoelliptic operators,
representation theory, and more. More information about the conference can be
