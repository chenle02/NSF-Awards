Disentangling contributions to language structure that are driven by learners
from contributions that are driven by the way language is used is difficult in
typical language-learning circumstances. This research program turns to
individuals in an unusual language-learning situation--deaf individuals who are
developing a manual communication system in the absence of input from a
conventional language--to address this question, and then complements the
fieldwork with an experimental study in the lab. The goal of the project is to
assess the degree to which linguistic structures can develop in a manual
communication system when it is--and is not--shared with others. In addition to
its theoretical importance in exploring properties of language that are so
resilient they need not be learned from a language model, the research program
has practical significance. Informed of the capacities that children bring with
them to language learning, educators may be better able to help deaf children or
hearing children with language disabilities learn a conventional language,
signed or spoken. Moreover, discovering how linguistic properties continue to
grow and become structured in the lab studies has the potential to provide
insight into conditions that promote the development of these properties in
children with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this
project are to determine which linguistic features are resilient to the absence
of linguistic input, which emerge only in the process of dyadic communication,
and which emerge only via transmission to a new generation of learners.
Homesigners are deaf individuals whose hearing losses prevent them from learning
a spoken language, and whose hearing families have not exposed them to a
conventional sign language. Despite their lack of input from a conventional
language, homesigners communicate and use gestures that have many of the
properties of natural language to do so.  In the first study, homesigners from
Guatemala who do, or do not, regularly interact with other homesigners will be
observed to determine the impact that sharing a communication system has on the
emergence of linguistic structure. In the second study, hearing adults will be
asked to describe scenes not by speaking, but by using their hands, in the
laboratory under three conditions:  on their own; in collaboration with another
gesturer; or after learning the gestures from another gesturer. This gesture-
creation paradigm is designed to mirror the naturalistic situations in which
homesigns are found:  homesigns created in an environment where there are no
other homesigners; homesigns created by homesigners in the presence of other
homesigners; and homesigns transmitted to a new generation of learners.
