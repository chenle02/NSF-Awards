Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to develop a ?Coded Aperture
Micro Mass Spectrometer? for ubiquitous real-time detection of environmental
hazards, chemical warfare agents and biochemical markers. This will be
accomplished by combining novel microfabrication technologies for ion sources
and detectors with coded aperture optics and algorithms. Achievement of such a
micro mass spectrometer will enable a new paradigm of sensing which
simultaneously provides high sensitivity and the ability to detect a broad range
of species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit of the proposed work includes advancing the state of the art of coded
aperture spectroscopy by confirming its value in ion-based systems and
developing algorithms for magnetic sector mass spectrometry. Determining the
interaction of ions with coded apertures and optimizing the algorithms for such
an ion-based system also holds scientific interest for future work in
computational sensing in ion based systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broad impact on future generations of
ion-based instruments which desire throughput and S/N enhancements. The ion
coding concepts are not limited to any one form of spectrometry and apply to all
particles with mass and/or charge. The educational impact of this proposed
research will also be very high for both graduate and undergraduate students. It
is a truly multidisciplinary effort requiring an understanding of electrical
engineering, physics, materials science and chemistry; thus, it is excellent
training for future scientists. It will leverage the Pratt fellows program at
Duke to bring research experiences to undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
