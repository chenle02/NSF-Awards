For the brain to operate correctly, the connections among nerve cells must be
appropriate. During embryological development, some of these "synaptic"
connections may be made because the cells are genetically pre-programmed to make
them. In other cases, however, the synaptic inputs to a nerve cell may influence
which other cells it, in turn, contacts. A knowledge of how peripheral targets
can influence synaptic connections in the brain is basic to an understanding of
how nerve cells originally make and then refine and maintain their proper
connections. Synaptic connections in the spinal cord between sensory and motor
nerve cells innervating muscles, the simple knee-jerk reflex, provide an
excellent experimental system for studying this problem at the level of single
nerve cells. In the spinal cord, these connections initially form with a high
degree of specificity. However, if a group of sensory cells is forced to
innervate a different target during development, the synaptic connections formed
within the spinal cord are appropriate for this new target. The experiments in
this grant are designed to explore, using anatomical and microelectrode
recording techniques, the following questions: When, during development, is a
nerve cell specified to have a particular function? To what extent is this
function determined by the previous history of the cell (its lineage) versus its
present molecular environment? These studies should provide useful information
concerning how synapses are made during normal development and even how they
might be repaired after spinal injury.
