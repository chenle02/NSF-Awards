This International Conference on Electrosensory systems will be held in
Montreal on August 6-8, l992 in conjunction with the International Society of
Neuroethology and which will include 29 invited speakers. It is the first such
conference on electrosensory systems in 20 years, a period which has seen major
advances in understanding this unusual and little-recognized sensory system. All
of the speakers are recognized authorities in this area, and the conference
provides an important and unique opportunity for the exchange and integration of
current knowledge. The proceedings of the conference will be published by a
high-quality journal, The Journal of Comparative Physiology.
