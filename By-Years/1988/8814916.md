A delegation of U.S. researchers attended the Eighth International Brick/Block
Masonry Conference in Dublin, Ireland, September 19-21, 1988. Members of the
delegation were selected from researchers who had submitted abstracts of papers
which were selected for publication and presentation. All of the delegation
members are also members of the NSF-funded "U.S. Coordinated Program for Masonry
Building Research (TCCMAR). Attendance at the conference permitted researchers
to participate in an international forum for the exchange of masonry
information. The delegation was exposed to researchers from all parts of the
world and their work and correspondingly, made researchers elsewhere aware of
U.S. research and progress in masonry materials and structures. Attendance at
the Conference facilitated establishing communication and dialogue between U.S.
researchers and those elsewhere.
