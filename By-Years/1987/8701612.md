This research will focus on the relation between vector bundles and the
geometry of space curves. In particular, it will consider questions about the
Hilbert scheme of smooth space curves and conjectures on the syzygies of the
generic canonical curves. Also work will be done on varieties with small dual
varieties and their relations to questions about varieties of small codimension
in projective space. This research is in the area of algebraic geometry, which
is the study of the geometry of sets of simultaneous solutions of systems of
polynomials in many variables. This subject is one of the most important and
venerable in all of mathematics and has in recent years been instrumental in
fundamental advances in many areas of core mathematics as well as applied
mathematics and computational mathematics. This research, by an extremely
successful and productive mathematician, will have a great impact on the field.
