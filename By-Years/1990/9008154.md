This Research Opportuniites for Women Research Planning Grant is in the general
area of inorganic chemistry. Dr. Edith J. Parsons of the Chemistry Department of
Clemson University will attempt to prepare a series of binuclear Mn, Mo and Ru
complexes in an effort to bind and deoxygenate carbon dioxide. The resulting
metal-oxo complexes will be used an oxygen transfer agents to organic compounds
such as cyclohexene. The ligands used in the complexes are polypodal and their
preparation is the first step in the project. If promising results are achieved
a proposal for sustained study of the system will be prepared.
