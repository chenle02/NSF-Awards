This project will support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting
scientists who are all working with faculty members at Carnegie-Mellon
University on various problems in the nonlinear theory of continuum mechanics.
The principal goal is to train the next generation of workers in the
mathematical aspects of materials science by providing them access to the
expertise and guidance of applied mathematicians and materials scientists who
are at the forefront of the application of advanced analytical and numerical
methods to problems involving phase transitions and microstructure. As an
illustration of the research to be undertaken in this grant consider the problem
of how to grow crystals as free as possible from defects. The solution of such a
complicated problem requires the cooperation of mathematicians and materials
scientists who are able to solve effectively mathematical models of crystal
growth and then use those solutions to design better manufacturing processes. It
is a truly synergistic relationship since the mathematicians need the physical
expertise of the materials people and the materials scientists need the
mathematicians to solve the models. Thus there is a real need to train young
scientists in this cross-disciplinary field by allowing them to work with the
best people in both applied mathematics and materials science.
