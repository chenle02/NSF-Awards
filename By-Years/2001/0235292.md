The overall goal of this project is to understand the fundamental mechanisms by
which a cell organizes a 24 h (circadian) biological clock. Central to models
for animal and fungal circadian clock timing are feedback loops involving clock
genes that negatively regulate their own expression. In the cyanobacterium
Synechococcus elongatus (PCC 7942), the model organism for prokaryotic circadian
biology, three genes (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC) are required for circadian clock
function. Data from mutants defective for, or that over-express, KaiA or KaiC
suggest that KaiA is a positive activator, and KaiC a negative regulator, of the
kaiBC promoter. However, other mutants of S. elongatus that change the relative
expression of kaiA and kaiBC expression suggest that this parameter is not
important for generating circadian rhythms. This project uses bioluminescent
reporter genes to track circadian expression from S. elongatus strains in which
kai gene expression has been manipulated to circumvent normal feedback loops.
Changes in molecular events that are predicted to lie at the heart of the timing
mechanism, such as the accumulation of each of the Kai proteins and their
messages, and the phosphorylation state of the KaiC protein, will be monitored
in mutant strains in which kai expression can be specifically manipulated. The
project will reveal molecular parameters that contribute to the generation of a
biological clock. The project will train postdoctoral and undergraduate
students, and will generate sophisticated genetic tools for this and other
cyanobacterial species, allowing a broader range of biological questions to be
addressed.
