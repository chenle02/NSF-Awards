Abstract Proposal No: 9709670 Proposal Type: Investigator Initiated Principal
Investigator: Giorgio Carta Affiliation: University of Virginia This grant is
awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the
Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport
Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Giorgio Carta of the
University of Virginia. The research is concerned with the characterization of
diffusional transport of proteins and other macromolecules in gel-composite ion-
exchangers and with the use of these materials in protein chromatography. The
materials are obtained by synthesizing functionalized polymer gels within the
pores of a rigid support matrix such that an essentially complete filling of the
pores is achieved. The gel is thus stable to mechanical forces and to changes in
solution conditions, allowing chromatographic operations at elevated flow rates
of the mobile phase. This research addresses the development of new technologies
for process scale protein chromatography. The fundamental understanding of
protein transport in gels will aid development of new protein separation
technologies, especially those oriented to high volume rapid separations.
