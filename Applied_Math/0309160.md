This project studies the theory of three-dimensional nonlinear gravity-capillary
waves in fluid bounded below by a rigid horizontal bottom and above by a free
surface. The research is focused on incompressible inviscid fluids of constant
density, moving under the influence of gravity and surface tension on the free
surface, with irrotational flow. The work centers on three problem areas. The
first will establish the existence of exact twin-soliton solutions, obliquely-
interacting identical two-dimensional solitary waves. Work in the second area
aims to prove the existence of three-dimensional propagating waves that decay to
zero in both propagating and transverse directions in water with large surface
tension. The third problem area concerns the existence of three-dimensional
propagating waves bifurcating from a two-dimensional generalized solitary wave,
a solitary wave with ripples at infinity, in water with small surface tension.
In this work, the exact fully nonlinear governing equations, rather than
approximate model equations, are employed to study three-dimensional propagating
surface waves in water. Interplay of theoretical fluid dynamics and applied
analysis is essential to the project.

The theory of water waves is essential for understanding and control of many
important natural phenomena, such as ocean waves generated by wind or
earthquakes, and waves generated by ships. This project focuses on the
mathematical theory of three-dimensional water waves. The research will
contribute to the design of ships with significantly reduced wave resistance, as
well as understanding of water-wave phenomena observed in experiments. Design of
ships with low wave resistance is especially important for eliminating giant
waves generated by fast ferries, which threaten coastlines and have been blamed
for many boat accidents.
