9526359 Srivastava A novel approach to optical chemical sensing is proposed in
this SGER effort. The glass-polymer structures in which dye doped polyimide wave
guide is deposited on a glass is proposed. A sensing layer is deposited on this
structure to interact with the environment to be sensed. This SGER effort will
explore the low cost fabrication of low cost polyimide guides for chemical
sensing. Various dye and the doping content in glass-polymers will be tested to
achieve the maximum sensitive compositons. The idea is novel and has not been
explored fully. %%% The glass-polymer structures in which dye doped polyimide
wave guide is deposited on a glass are proposed as a novel approach to optical
chemical sensing.
