Neutrons and protons, the constituents of the atomic nucleus, are composed of
quarks. We study the quark substructure of nucleons and also particles that
contain heavy quarks. We focus on approximate symmetries of quarks such as
flavor symmetry and charge symmetry, which would be an exact symmetry if protons
and neutrons were identical. We plan to study high-energy nuclear reactions that
produce heavy quarks, where we can differentiate between "extrinsic" quarks
produced by gluon splitting and "intrinsic" heavy quarks such as appear in
meson-cloud models. We will particularly focus on possibilities for observing
heavy-quark production at a future electron-ion collider. We will continue our
investigations of the effects of Regge exchange on hard exclusive processes.
Amplitudes that include Regge exchange violate the factorization theorem for
hard exclusive processes and thus acquire a measurable dependence on the four-
momentum transfer. We will carry out simulations of electrons or atoms moving in
small two-dimensional nanoscale systems, where the wave nature of particles
produces large effects. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work involves training of
undergraduates and postdocs, who become experts in complex systems with
application to technology, defense, communications and finance. Recent postdocs
have included several women. The principal investigator gives seminars on
advances in physics for non-scientists, increasing scientific literacy in the
general population. The PI is recently participating in a "Big History"
collaboration involving physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists and
anthropologists. This collaboration has produced two symposia, a museum exhibit
and a Web site, with plans to produce DVDs and a book in the future.
