ABSTRACT A conference on logic and linguistics will be held July 23- 24, 1989,
in conjunction with the Linguistic Summer Institute at the University of
Arizona. Although relations between logic and the study of language have a long
history, they are more vigorous and stronger today than ever before. A
conference on logic and linguistics will bring together in a single forum the
rich and varied contemporary work that unites these two fields and is often
carried out in widely separated academic departments.
