9310157 Bhattacharjee This research continues theoretical studies on the effect
of resistivity on current sheets in the solar corona. The work completed during
the last two years has led to significant new insights on where and how rapidly
in time current sheets tend to form in a long, thin coronal tube in the presence
of small but finite resistivity. The continuing effort will be based on 3D
coronal equilibria with high symmetry and a generalized Ohm's law that includes
not only resistivity but also other collisionless mechanisms of relevance to the
corona. The 3D equilibria will be investigated for separatrix formation,
analytically and numerically, since singularities tend to form at separatrices.
The inclusion of these collisionless mechanisms will introduce qualitatively new
dynamical effects and bring theory closer to observations.***
