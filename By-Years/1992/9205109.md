This Pittsburgh project, under the direction of Professor E. Newman comprises
the study of both the classical and quantum aspects of the properties of
gravitational waves. The novel feature of this study is due to a reformulation
of Einstein's equations in terms of certain new, non-local variables which
appear to be more adapted to the analysis of the phenomena.
