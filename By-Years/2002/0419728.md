This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop transgenic plants that are resistant to plant-parasitic nematode
infection and damage. The approach is to use phage display technology to
identify small peptides that bind to and interfere with the function of
important intestinal proteins.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of nematode
control of plants. With the phasing out of methyl bromide, which has caused
environmentally negative impacts, the agricultural community faces a major loss
of a product that protected plants against soil-borne pathogens including
nematodes. The development of transgenic plants that target plant-parasitic
nematodes will alleviate one of the major problems of growing crops.
Furthermore, the transgenic plants will reduce the amount of chemical
nematicides that are being used for plant-parasitic nematode control.
