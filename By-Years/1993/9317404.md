9317404 Stein This award supports a two-year cooperative research project
between Professor Richard S. Stein, Department of Polymer Science and
Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Professor Tisato
Kajiyama, Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kyushu University,
Fukuoka, Japan. Professor Muthukumar Murugappan, University of Massachusetts,
will also be involved in the project. The joint research will focus on the use
of polymer dispersed liquid crystals as display and light control devices. The
investigators will study the phase diagram for polymer-liquid crystal mixture
and the kinetics of phase separation. The studies will involve two phases: (a)
discrete systems and (b) bicontinuous systems. Preliminary studies have already
been carried out on the discrete systems. The purpose of the present project is
to extend these studies to bicontinuous systems, to more fully explore the
liquid crystals orientation distribution within domains and its change with
applied fields, to study surface anchoring forces between the liquid crystals
and the domain walls and the effect of surface modification on these, to study
and explain the time dependence of orientation changes and its effect on
scattering and to theoretically model these phenomena. ***
