Program performance is highly dependent on the amount of memory available to
the&lt;br/&gt;program. In traditional computing systems, the memory working set
of an application&lt;br/&gt;has a bounded size - providing more memory to an
application improves performance&lt;br/&gt;until its working set is met. Once
the working set is met, additional memory yields little&lt;br/&gt;or no benefit.
However, in the presence of garbage collection (a technique for
memory&lt;br/&gt;management where space that is unlikely to be reused by an
application is&lt;br/&gt;automatically reclaimed), the relationship between
program performance and memory&lt;br/&gt;allocation is more complex. Data is
managed at three levels: the compiler manages&lt;br/&gt;data objects at the
program level, the garbage collector manages the heap at the
virtual&lt;br/&gt;machine level, and the virtual memory manager manages virtual
memory at the&lt;br/&gt;operating system level. The middle layer plays a
critical role. Increasing an application's&lt;br/&gt;heap size can reduce the
frequency of garbage collections and improve performance,&lt;br/&gt;but too
large a heap may trigger paging and degrade performance.
