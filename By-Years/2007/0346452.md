A grant has been awarded to The Natural History Museum and Biodiversity Research
Center at the University of Kansas for rehousing the Invertebrate fossils and
microfossil collections. These fossil collections help to provide the principal
basis for our understanding of past life and are useful in the exploration for
petroleum reserves, coal, and mineral resources. The collection is integral to
the program in paleontology at the University of Kansas. It consists of some
850,000 specimens from all parts of the world including more than 6,500 type or
figured specimens that have been studied during the past 120 years. No space is
available, however, to expand the collection. To alleviate crowding and provide
space for expanding the collections, we will install a state-of-the-art, high-
density storage system. The new storage system will comprise manual, mobile
compactors that accommodate the existing cases and provide space for new storage
cases, ultimately significantly expanding the division's collection capacity.
This cost-effective, collection-improvement project will alleviate critical
crowding of the collection and solve serious problems that stem from that
crowding.&lt;br/&gt; Alleviating crowding will enable us to expand our
collections, to house properly valuable research and teaching collections now in
our possession, and to adopt orphaned collections that mesh with our long-term
goals of teaching, research, and public service. Achieving these goals will
enable us to develop both the breadth and depth of our collections, thereby
enhancing their global impact on research, education, and public
service.&lt;br/&gt;
