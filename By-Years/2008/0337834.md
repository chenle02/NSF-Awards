This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project acquires
information for and then designs the first commercial Automated Foam Index Test
(AFIT) instrument. AFIT automatically and quantitatively determines the
stability or instability of foams and emulsifiers. It innovates foaming and foam
stability measurements in industrial production systems. Currently, foam and
emulsifier stabilities are measured using visual or mechanical observations. The
research uses basic physical and chemical behaviors of foams and emulsifiers to
identify bubble stability and breakup activity. Computer-controlled experimental
methods are used to acquire and statistically assess data, and then correlations
are made with data obtained using currently accepted, manual methods.

Although this Phase I research focuses on an instrument for determining the foam
indices of cements and pozzolans, AFIT is a generic name for a suite of
instruments that would impact food and consumer product specialists and
manufacturers, wastewater treatment facilities, minerals industries,
petroleum/oil industries, fire retardant manufacturers and beverage
manufacturers.
