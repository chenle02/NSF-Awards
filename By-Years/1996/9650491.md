The Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering is purchasing equipment
to develop an undergraduate process safety laboratory. Specifically, this
project supports the purchase of: a mini flash-point tester, a flammability
testing apparatus, corrosion studies equipment, a reactive system screening
tool, vent sizing software, and supporting accessories. These items can be used
in laboratory experiments that expand upon and supplement the required process
safety course. This process safety course and the laboratory are providing a
model for developing similar courses and laboratories in other chemical
engineering programs and therefore may contribute to what should be the ultimate
goal of having process safety a required component of all chemical engineering
curricula in the United States. The results can be disseminated through articles
published in the SACHE newsletter and Chemical Engineering Education, both of
which now enjoy a wide readership among Chemical Engineering faculty.
