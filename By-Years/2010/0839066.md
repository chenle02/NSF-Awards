Cole-Dai/0839066&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to make continuous
major ion analyses in the West Antarctica Ice Sheet Divide (WAIS Divide) ice
core by sampling the brittle ice zone (approximately from 500 m to 1500 m). The
intellectual merit of the project is that these will likely be the only chemical
measurements on the brittle ice zone and, therefore, will bridge the gap in the
expected continuous records of climate, ice sheet dynamics and biological
evolution based on chemical measurements. High resolution sampling and analysis,
probably on selected portions and depth intervals in the brittle ice zone, will
help with the independent, high-precision dating of the WAIS Divide core and
contribute to the achievement of the major objectives of the WAIS Divide
project?development of high resolution climate records with which to investigate
issues of climate forcing by greenhouse gases and the role of Antarctica and
Southern Hemisphere in the global climate system. Planned collaboration with
other WAIS Divide investigators will develop the longest and most detailed
volcanic record from Antarctica ice cores. The broader impacts of this project
include a contribution to enhancing our knowledge of the climate system. Such
improvements in understanding of the global climate system and the ability to
predict the magnitude and uncertainty of future changes are highly relevant to
the global community. The project will support post-doctoral scientists and
graduate students, including those from under-represented groups, will
contribute to education, an help to train future scientists and promote
diversity in research and education. Public outreach activities of this project
will contribute to informal science education of school age children in the
Eastern South Dakota region.
