The primary goal of this proposal is to clarify the factors which lead to
variation in litter size and infant survivorship in a species of new world
monkey, Callithrix jacchus. This species is particularly interesting as it
habitually gives birth to twins, but will also produce litters with either one
or three offspring. From a theoretical perspective, the determinants of
variation will provide insight into the opportunity for the operation of
evolution through natural selection, as well as the stages in development at
which it occurs. Also, it will be possible to determine the degree to which
prenatal growth and number of fetuses effects survivorship in the period after
birth. Through statistical analyses, the investigators will be able to estimate
the genetic component to both litter size and infant survivorship. The basic
data will be gathered through the use of laproscopic examinations to determine
the timing of ovulation and ultrasound to determine the number of fetuses and to
follow the growth of the litters.
