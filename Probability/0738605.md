There has been a persistent pursuit during the past decade for generalizing
network calculus - a theory of deterministic queuing systems to its stochastic
counterpart. This research is to offer an answer for this pursuit and to
establish a possibility-based network calculus theory that further extends the
scope of this research line. The key methodology behind such a development is to
apply Legendre transform at the sample-path level. Pilot research has shown some
distinguished features that include: i) symmetric and decomposed
characterization for traffic and service; ii) removal of highly nonlinear
(min,+) convolution and de-convolution operators; iii) representation of single-
node and tandem system performance bounds by summation of random variables; iv)
recapture of effective bandwidth (capacity) and large deviations properties
defined through the momentum generating functions; and v) tight bounds and
improved scaling factor in the large deviations regime. It is expected that this
research will open a new frontier in queuing theory and practice.

The proposed research will lead to a new theory for performance guarantees in
queuing and other service systems that is expected to provide more accurate
assessment of system performance and better management of system resources. Such
a new theory will justify the vision of offering performance guarantees in
diverse engineering and social systems such as communications networks
(wireless, sensor networks and the high-speed Internet), supply chain and
logistic systems, transportation and healthcare delivery systems; empowers the
private sector to generate more value-adding business models (e.g. premium vs.
?best effort? service grades); and influences the public sector to construct
robust infrastructures and to effectively assume its critical social
responsibilities.
