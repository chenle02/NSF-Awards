9501322 Kaplan This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
will develop a superconductive demultiplexer (demux) designed to slow the data
stream from superconductive circuits and to serve as the interface with room-
temperature circuits. Phase I successfully demonstrated a modular architecture
that uses non-destructive read-out (NDRO) cells as well as a two-stage demux
equipped with two NDRO cells. Phase II is expected to demonstrate a transient
digitizer chip containing a flash analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a number
of demux units, which divert high-speed digital data into an appropriate number
of lower-speed channels. Each demux output channel can be clocked at a rate low
enough for room-temperature hardware to acquire and reconstruct the signal. This
technology will exploit the inherent advantage of superconductive ADCs whose
very large bandwidth is unmatched by semiconductor technology. A superconductive
demux will permit superconductive chips to be incorporated in semiconducting
system designs.
