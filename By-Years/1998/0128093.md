This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop a
high volume/high pressure RDR-MOCVD nitride production tool. Two fundamental
problems will be addressed. The first is the need for large area substrate
quality and the second is the need for large area/high volume MOCVD nitride
epitaxy production tools. This project will demonstrate a scaleable tool to meet
these needs.

The commercial applications of this project will be in electronics and
optoelectronic device markets.
