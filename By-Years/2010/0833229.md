The University of Texas at Dallas is establishing a Phase 1 Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program, focusing on increasing the number of undergraduate STEM
majors who enter the K-12 teaching profession. They are awarding a total of 45
$10,000 scholarships for juniors and seniors, 45 summer internships and 35
$1,500 graduate tuition scholarships over the five-year course of the project.
The program also includes support for Noyce Teacher Scholars during their first
years of full-time teaching. The University of Texas-Dallas is adopting the
UTeach model that has been very successful at the University of Texas at Austin.
The UTeach Dallas program provides the basic infrastructure and curriculum to
increase the number of STEM majors at the University of Texas-Dallas who go on
to become K-12 science and mathematics teachers. The initial partner school
districts are Garland Independent School District (ISD), Richardson ISD, and
Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD.
