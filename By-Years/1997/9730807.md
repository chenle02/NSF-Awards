Swift 9730807 Funds are provided to develop a platform independent version of
the OceanAtlas program that allows hydrographic data to explored on screen in an
interactive and flexible manner. OceanAtlas is used at sea to examine and
quality control data as they are being collected as well as by oceanographers,
teachers and students to study the distribution of ocean properties and
fundamentals of the ocean circulations. The new version written in the Java
