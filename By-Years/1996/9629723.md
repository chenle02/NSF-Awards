9629723 GOLDBERG This research will examine the effects of competition among
plant for limited resources such as light and water at the level of the entire
community. While competitive effects on individual plant performance are well
known, the general effects of competition on diverse and complex communities are
much more poorly understood. Using desert annual plant communities as a model
system, we will conduct a series of garden and field experiments to manipulate
the density of entire plant communities to determine how competitive
interactions lead to change in species' abundances and biodiversity. The
experiments will mimic a natural rainfall gradient from a desert to a much
wetter Mediterranean climate so that we can also investigate how the influence
of competition changes among environments. Because models of global climatic
change predict major shifts in precipitation patterns, these data are directly
relevant to general models of how vegetation will respond to global
environmental change.
