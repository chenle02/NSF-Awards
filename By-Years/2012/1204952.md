This project is developing unique and comprehensive career pathways that provide
students with the academic and technical skills needed to work in the mining
industry by blending credit and non-credit resources, improving the education of
science and engineering technicians, and providing students with a career
context for both STEM and mining-specific courses. It is bringing together the
public school system (K-12), post-secondary community colleges and universities,
workforce development, and industry to create comprehensive academic programs
with clear articulated career pathways and enhanced instruction. Four academic
programs, Electrical Engineering Technology, Mining Engineering, Mine
Management, and Mine Technology, are undergoing development, redefinition, and
implementation to become web- and media-enriched programs that include new
technologies and meet industry needs. Courses in the programs have specific
course articulations including both secondary education and post-secondary
education and enhanced instruction. Faculty are receiving professional
development training in instructional design and technology-mediated delivery of
courses to facilitate the implementation of the career pathways and strengthen
STEM education within the programs. The curriculum, lessons learned, and other
material developed by the project, have the potential to impact technical
education at K-12 and other postsecondary institutions in states across the
nation in which coal mining occurs.
