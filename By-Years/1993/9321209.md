9321209 Yu An investigation of ion-mixing of superlattices as a processing
technology for the fabrication of planar photonic integrated circuits shall be
undertaken. Ion-mixing has the promise of being a versatile, high yield
fabrication approach for photonic integrated circuits requiring only a singly
epitaxial growth step, and providing a planar structure. We have demonstrated
the feasibility of using ion-mixing to induce compositional disorder in
superlattice structures made of InGaAs/InP and AlGaAs/GaAs materials at
temperatures below 600{SYMBOL 176 \f "Symbol"}C with ions such as argon and
oxygen and with low ion doses. The following objectives will be pursued (1)
investigation of the device integration using a combination of ion-mixing and
solid phase regrowth for superlattice disordering, and photo elastic effects,
(2) extension of the technique to exploratory optoelectronic materials such as
InGoT/GaAs and InGoT/InAsP/InP, (3) incorporation of the techniques in the
fabrication of tunable lasers with distributed Bragg reflector, photo detector
with tunable filter, (4) improvement of fiber-waveguide coupling using ion-
mixing and related techniques, (5) incoporation of superlattice disordering in
the base of heterojunction bipolar transistor to improve performance and
manufacturability. ***
