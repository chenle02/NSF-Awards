The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
the security of a digital footprint by making a “hardware key” for two-factor
authentication wearable. Breaches due to weak or stolen credentials is a major
problem today, and phishing attacks and identity theft result in loss of assets
for millions of users and organizations. By increasing physical security and
solving the problem of low compliance of two-factor authentication, digital
security can be vastly improved. The proposed technology has the potential to
resolve the current issues with two-factor authentication and greatly lower
risks for breaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project aims to evaluate
the commercialization potential of technology that uses the body as a wire, and
in this proposal it will be applied to the case of secure authentication. Prior
work has shown that the proposed technology enables physical security by
preventing hackers from snooping the signal, unlike wireless technologies such
as Bluetooth. Prior research has established that it is possible to develop low-
loss communication at low frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
