This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist studying small
wood-working firms in Mexico. The research will examine a theory of
"institutional economics" concerning the costs of transactions within and
between firms. The theory predicts that these transactions costs determine the
shape and size of a firm, and this projects tests and advances this theory by
confronting it with data from small, often family-organized firms in a rural
area of Mexico. The theory was formulated to deal with all firms "in the
abstract", but with often unconscious bias towards the sorts of large firms one
finds in developed, industrialized countries. Confronting this theory with data
from small family firms in a less developed country like Mexico will reveal
logical inconsistencies and flaws that can be modified to improve its power and
generality.
