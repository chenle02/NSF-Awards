This project is aimed at determining the dynamics of third-order nonlinear
optical processes in molecular and polymeric materials. Research to be
undertaken will include: degenerate four-wave mixing and two-wave mixing pump-
probe experiments using amplified 60 femtosecond pulses; investigating the role
of two-photon absorption, bimolecular decay, and excitation saturation by
simultaneously monitoring both first-order and higher-order diffractions during
degenerate four-wave mixing; observing the relative roles of initially
photogenerated excitons and subsequently formed polarons in determining optical
nonlinearity in linear conjugated structures.
