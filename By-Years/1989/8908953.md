One type of production system that affects almost the entire population is
transportation. This research involves increasing the researcher's knowledge in
transportation engineering, particularly in the area of traffic engineering. The
application of computer simulation languages to traffic problems, particularly
to the interaction of automobiles and transit vehicles (e.g., light rail) on
city streets is to be investigated. A new approach to traffic simulation by
incorporating a simulation language with a computational language such as
FORTRAN is to be studied. Support of this work will aid in career advancement
and should also produce some meaningful results in a very significant problem
area.
