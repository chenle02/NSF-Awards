To address the problems of ineffective entry-level science courses and
inadequate preparation for pre-college science teachers, introductory
environmental science laboratory courses are being developed that utilize
investigative procedures and provides experiences for undergraduates interested
in science education. In the investigative laboratory students work
collaboratively in groups of 8-10 to identify a research question, develop and
carry out the protocol necessary to answer the question, analyze and interpret
the data, and communicate their results both orally and in writing to a general
audience. Each group is led by a student from the upper-level science education
course, who also receives instruction on teaching science methodology,
leadership skills, and strategies to stimulate enthusiasm for scientific
inquiry. The goals of this project are to 1) introduce the excitement of
scientific inquiry in an entry-level science course, 2) develop a model to
integrate entry-level science courses with upper- level courses on science
education, and 3) better prepare precollege teachers to teach the methods of
scientific inquiry.
