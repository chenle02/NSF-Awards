This project is concerned with developing a theoretical foundation for learning
in neural networks and artificial intelligence in the direction of statistical
decision theory and analysis of algorithms. The proposed work includes several
aspects. First, further extensions and applications of the statistical
techniques of Vapnik and Chervonenkis are pursued. Second, a coherent Bayesian
metholody is developed for learning that includes the Valnik-Chervonenkis theory
and the recent statistical physics approached to learning. Third, weighted
majority and other on-line learning strategies are developed, including
extensions to nonstationary learning environments. Finally, analysis and
application of unsupervised learning and feature discovery techniques are
performed.
