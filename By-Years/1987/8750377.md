This project is improving the undergraduate program in experimental Physiology
by introducing the use of video equipment and computer interface devices for
data acquisition and analysis. Students are being exposed to three current
methodologies: a video-image analysis system, an analog-digital converter
system, and an x-y digitizing tablet. Microprocessors are being used to analyze
the output from the three systems. The equipment is making it possible to
introduce strikingly new laboratory exercises that improve both the accuracy and
efficiency of data acqusition and analysis, and that give undergraduates hands-
on experience with highly current research and analytical skills. The project is
impacting students in eleven courses and in independent student research
covering three subdisciplines: Animal Physiology, Plant Physiology, and
Physiological Psychology.
