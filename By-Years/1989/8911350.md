Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists and biologists who are carrying out frontier research. The
Department of Chemistry of SUNY at Stony Brook will use this award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Instrumentation and Instrument
Development Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of
chemical and biological research that will be enhanced by the acquisition
include: 1) Synthetic and biological chemistry of physiologically-active lipids,
polypeptides and carbohydrates 2) Molecular receptors based on bile acids 3) NMR
studies of synthetic anologs for the active sites of metalloproteins and
heterogeneous metal-sulfide catalysts 4) Site-specific enzyme and DNA
modification 5) Heterocyclic synthesis and molecular recognition.
