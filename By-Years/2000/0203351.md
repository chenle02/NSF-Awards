This project will investigate the processes of sediment transport and
accumulation that lead to development of the shelf clinoform in the Gulf of
Papua off the Fly River. The study will include a variety of sampling and
monitoring stations from near the river mouth to the base of the clinoform that
will provide time-series observations on the spatial and temporal variation in
present day sediment transport and accumulation. The study will specifically
investigate the role of fluid muds as primary mechanism for across-shelf
transport of sediment that leads to clinoform morphology. Core studies including
radioisotope measurements will provide information of sediment transport and
accumulation on seasonal to millennial time scales.&lt;br/&gt;
