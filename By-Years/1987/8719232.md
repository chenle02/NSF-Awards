Through library searches and on-site visits, the PI's will identify science and
technology data sources, collect such information, and provide a baseline of
statistical data on S&T resources in the Pacific Rim nations of China, South
Korea, and Taiwan. The PI's will evaluate the comparability of various surveys,
measurements and indicators, and identify ways in which a set of common
scientific and trchnology-related indicators could be developed to aid the
United States in understanding the nature and pace of scientific and
technological progress, or lack of it, in these countries. NSF has the
responsibility to provide information and analysis of the scientific and
engineering resources of the United States and other countries. This project
will provide basic S&T indicator data for the Pacific Rim countries of China,
South Korea, and Taiwan. Very little quantitative information currently exists
on the S&T resources of these newly industrializing and important countries.
