The general objective of this project is the development of techniques in the
calculus of variations and in the regularity theory for systems of partial
differential equations. The applications that guide this work come mainly from
the areas of continuum mechanics of liquids and solids. Tools from geometric
measure theory, a theory for the study of generalizations of surfaces, will play
an important role. The analysis will be undertaken for time-dependent problems,
including in some cases certain idealizations where inertial effects are
neglected. The main focus will be on the search for the effective description of
materials with complicated composition, on the study of regularity properties of
solutions in the bulk and at interfaces, and on the prediction of their
oscillatory or hysteretic behavior as time evolves.

The research will be on the mathematical description and prediction of a range
of phenomena that occur in material science. This includes phase transformations
(between liquid and solid phases), the structure, nucleation and growth of such
phases, and fracture and defects in solids. An important part of this work will
be the study of mathematical models for novel man-made materials such as shape
memory alloys, ferroelectric, magnetic and magnetostrictive materials,
composites, liquid crystals, and thin films. Although unexpected, the
mathematical theory also provides new methods for image segmentation in computer
vision. The mathematical challenges lie in the description of the dynamics and
evolution of microscopic structures and of phenomena that occur at vastly
different temporal or spatial scales. They require recently developed
mathematical tools and the introduction of new mathematical techniques.
