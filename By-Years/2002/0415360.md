Professor Kermit Murray of Louisiana State University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to further the development and
application of infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass
spectrometry (IR-MALDI). IR-MALDI is not as widely accepted a method as MALDI
using ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but offers some advantages including the
ability to produce ions with less internal energy, the ability to produce ions
without the use of a matrix, and the ability to characterize low molecular
weight analytes without low mass interferences. Fundamental studies of IR laser
desorption, two-pulse IR/UV MALDI, and particle ablation are being conducted as
is the development of "direct from gel" IR laser desorption ionization
strategies for peptide characterization. The PI uses a novel web-based Virtual
Lab Tour to introduce college students to mass spectrometry and to introduce the
public to what scientific researchers do on a daily
basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry in various forms has proven
essential to the high-throughput highly accurate analysis of biological
molecules. Given the high impact the UV-MALDI-MS technique has as a sensitive
analytical technique (in particular in proteomics and increasingly in biomedical
analysis), prospects for IR-MALDI are promising. This project outlines
improvement of instrumentation and techniques in the area of mass spectrometry
of biological molecules, as well as development of new approaches and
applications that should expand the role of MALDI applications such as
biomedical research, clinical measurements, and synthetic polymers.
