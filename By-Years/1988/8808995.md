The project explores the development of neural networks for performing
complicated computations in (a) collision avoidance under known, static working
environments, and (b) manipulator dynamics, which is a mapping from joint
positions, velocities and accelerations to joint torques/forces. For collision
avoidance, the detection of collisions is treated as a pattern recognition
problem, which can be solved efficiently and easily by neural networks. For
computing manipulator dynamics, a three-layer neural network is being studied
for mapping between continuous- valued input and output. Collision avoidance and
manipulator dynamics are very computationally intensive operations. For real-
time control usage, these computations must be accomplished in an acceptable
time period, which is usually tens of milliseconds or less. Neural networks use
massive parallelism, which allows these computations to be possible in real
time. The proposed research represents a feasible approach towards these
problems.
