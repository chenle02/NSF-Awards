The principal investigator will conduct an experimental and field program on the
development of calc-alkaline magmas. In particular he is interested in the
controls exercised during fractional crystallization of magmas in continental
and oceanic crust, and the role of variations of pressure, water content, and
mantle residue bulk composition on melt compositions produced in the mantle
source region of subduction zone magmas.
