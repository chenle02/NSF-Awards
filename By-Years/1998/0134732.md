A grand challenge in neuroscience is to understand the biological basis of
information processing at the cellular and network levels. One major technology
barrier to continuing progress is the lack of adequate informatics and analysis
tools to enable exploration of the structural organization of complex neural
circuits, the discovery and understanding of emergent properties of neural
ensembles, the formulation of quantitative hypotheses about neural computation,
and the testing of those hypotheses experimentally. These scientists have
developed a prototype database system that provides many of the needed
capabilities, and have used this software system to study mechanisms underlying
neural encoding. The general goals of the work proposed here are to extend the
capabilities and general utility of this prototype system, to interface the
database with several additional tools for the analysis of structural and time-
series data, and to enable more effective data sharing between remote
collaborators. The core informatics and neuroscience research will be carried
out by a group of researchers at Montana State University. Collaborations have
also been established with researchers at several other research institutions,
to insure interoperability of this system with other data collections and
analysis tools and to facilitate the testing and refinement of this system. The
PI and co-investigators all study dynamic aspects of sensory processing at the
cellular and network levels in a variety of preparations, including the cricket,
cat, and monkey visual systems. The researchers all share the following general
neuroscience research aims: a) to understand the relationships between spatio-
temporal activity patterns in neural ensembles and the information they convey,
b) to understand how the spatio-temporal patterns at one processing stage are
decoded at the next processing stage, c) to understand how computations are
carried out on that decoded morphology, synaptic connectivity, and intrinsic
biophysical characteristics of the neurons in the ensembles. The software tools
developed here will be applied to these ongoing studies, enabling a substantial
increase in the breadth, depth, rigor, and rate of progress of those research
projects. That neuroscience research will, in turn, provide a rigorous basis for
the refinement, generalization and extension of the informatics tools.
