ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Billey, Sara
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0800978&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Washington&lt;br/&gt;Title: Computational/Combinatorial Considerations In
Topology, Coxeter Groups, and Representation
Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal outlines an
ambitious research program attacking problems in three areas: the affine
Grassmannian, fundamentals of permutations, and representation theory inspired
by complexity theory. The central theme is to facilitate computation and
understanding in these areas through study of very specific posets, Weyl groups,
generating functions, and partitions controlling the micro level structures
which we often overlook on the first glimpse of the
subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of algebraic combinatorics is the
philosophy that every aspect of mathematics can be made more precise, more
concrete and more computationally feasible by identifying key combinatorial
structures. Borrowing a term from analysis, this proposal is about ``micro local
mathematics''. All of the work proposed will have a broad impact in several
areas of pure math and theoretical computer science. All of the proposed work
will have a computational focus which will further develop computer proof
techniques. All of the proposed work will have a human impact component. The PI
has a strong track record of mentoring students at all levels and junior
faculty. This grant will greatly enhance the vertically integrated research
environment in the Combinatorics Group at the University of Washington and give
the group the resources needed to attack these hard problems.&lt;br/&gt;
