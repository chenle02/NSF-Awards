This project uses detailed data collected in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey
in Texas in 2017 business closures, credit card purchases, business recovery aid
data, and innovative modelling to study the effects of natural disasters on
businesses and consumer welfare. It also studies how public aid to businesses
after a natural disaster should be allocated to minimize the impact of these
disasters on businesses and consumers. The research develops a model of consumer
choice and firm re-entry to answer three questions: how large consumer welfare
losses after the hurricane were, how effective was aid facilitating business re-
entry, and what is the optimal way of allocating aid to help businesses recover
from disaster. The innovative research design will allow the researchers to
answer these questions effectively. The results of this research will guide
policymakers in developing disaster response and resilience efforts to
strengthen local economies and to mitigate the adverse effects of natural
disasters as well as consequences of climate change and help establish the US as
a global leader in business recovery policies after a natural
disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project combines
granular data on consumer behavior, flooding, and business closures to model and
estimate consumer preferences that allows the PIs to quantify welfare losses due
to business closures. At the heart of this part of the project is the
development and estimation of a discrete choice model that allows the PIs to
recover consumer welfare losses. The project then develops a model of firm re-
entry decisions to estimate the effectiveness of government aid to help business
re-entry, as well as measure heterogeneity in economic impacts across
neighborhoods and industries. Finally, the PIs use these estimates to design and
evaluate an aid allocation mechanism that distributes business aid to minimize
consumer welfare loss from business exit. The results of this research will
provide guidance in developing disaster response and resilience policies to
strengthen local economies and mitigate the adverse consequences of natural
disasters and climate change as well as help establish the US as a global leader
in business recovery policies after a natural
disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
