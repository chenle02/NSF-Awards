The cellular mechanisms used to regulate the rate of degradation of insoluble
vs. soluble forms of cellulose and starch by anaerobic bacteria in continuous
cultures are the objects of this research. A variety of cellulolytic anaerobes,
as well as some that are amylolytic will be analyzed in terms of: kinetics of
growth, substrate disappearance, and product formation; the production of
cellulase and cellobiase activities (for cellulolytic bacteria) and amylase and
malatase activities (for amylolytic bacteria); the realtionships between enzyme
activities and rates of substrate utilization; the influence of growth substrate
on enzyme production (constitutive vs. induced); and effects of particle size
and concentration on kinetics of insoluble cellulose decomposition. These
studies will aid in understanding a very important aspect of the global carbon
cycle--microbial growth on insoluble biopolymers.//
