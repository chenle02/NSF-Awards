With prior NSF support, Hatcher and Quinn have demonstrated that data-parallel
SIMD programs can be complied into code that executes efficiently on both
shared-memory and distributed-memory MIMD computers. In this project they
develop new compliation strategies that will enable data-parallel programs to
execute efficiently on future-generation multicomputers, including the
Touchstone Sigma. The starting point of this work is the new C* language
developed by Thinking Machines Corporation. Hatcher and Quinn extend the
language to provide a machine-independent means for specifying the distribution
of data among the physical processors' memories and to facilitate parallel I/O.
