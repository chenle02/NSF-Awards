Nearly every subdiscipline in biology is currently using recombinant DNA
technology as a research tool. With the advent of this important technology, it
is critical that both biology major and non-major undergraduate students gain
laboratory experiences in this technology. The goal of this project is to
introduce students to basic recombinant DNA laboratory experiences beginning in
the General Biology Course employing a set of bacterial recombination exercises.
The recombinant DNA experiences will continue in Cell Physiology where the
students will isolate plasmid DNA, perform restriction enzyme analyses, ligate
DNA inserts, and perform transformation assays. Completion of an original
research project is required of all Biology senior students. The new equipment
will allow students to participate in a wider variety of projects In addition,
acquisition of the requested equipment will allow the development and
presentation of a new course in molecular biology.
