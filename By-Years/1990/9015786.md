Dr. Dickel has planned several specific projects to answer questions about the
structural properties of filaments in supernova remnants and the generation of
their observed emission. The projects include searching for radio wavelength
emission from the remnant SN1885 in the galaxy M31, continuum radio observations
at more than one wavelength from remnants with different ages to evaluate their
spectra and their particle acceleration mechanisms, radio wavelength polarimetry
to study both the field strength and the relation of the field structure to the
morphology of the emitting regions, and some studies of emission measures to
investigate the depth along the line of sight and relate the emission to models
of variously shaped emitting features. Supernova remnants have a variety of
structures which can be observed in all wavelength regimes from the radio
through the x- ray. Young remnants show a few very thin optical filaments on the
outer periphery of the shell and then a thicker irregular shell at radio and
x-ray wavelengths. The older remnants have identical radio and optical
morphology consisting of a collection of sinuous filaments in a shell of more
diffuse x-ray and radio emission. The resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy of
modern aperture synthesis radio telescopes and optical detectors are now giving
us the opportunity to answer some important questions relating to the structures
of the remnants of supernovae. Dr. Dickel's research program is designed to take
advantage of recently available state of the art instrumentation to examine
supernova remnant structures in detail.
