This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of California
Berkeley acquire an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer
(ICP-OES). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including
the following: (1) semiconducting nanocrystals (2) bioremediation of metal
polluted ecosystems (3) metallobiochemistry (4) stereognosis metal ligands (5)
oxide superconductors (6) molecule-to-solid transformations in well defined
systems (7) C-H activation utilizing Ir, Rh, Re and Zr complexes (8) synthesis
of zeolites containin transition metal elements (9) volume change of soil-
forming reactings using Zr reference frame, and (10) growth of thermophiles
under geochemically relevant conditions. The inductively couple plasma-optical
emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) is used to determine the elemental anlaysis of
most elements. It uses an inert gas which serves an an atomization source that
excites many elements generating their characteristic emission, which is
detected.
