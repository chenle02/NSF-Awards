This research explores the links between childcare arrangements and work
outcomes among dual earner couples. The goal is to examine the effects of
responsibility for child care arrangements on the productivity, work commitment,
labor supply, and earnings of both men and women in dual-earner households. The
study will utilize data from a longitudinal study of 1972 high school seniors,
last interviewed in 1986. The study draws on economic theory regarding the
houshold division of labor and structural constraints at home and at work to
test specific hypotheses within a more sociological framework. Central
hypotheses concern the role of intervening mechanisms by which responsibility
for child care arrangements affects work outcomes. For example, its negative
effects should be greater in jobs that have greater opportunities for
advancement. Previous studies of childcare responsibilities have focused
exclusively on women; this study broadens the scope to look at both men and
women in dual-earner families. The project will make a real contribution to the
literature linking family responsibilities to work outcomes.
