This award to the Department of Biological Sciences, SUNY-Albany provides funds
for equipment to establish an advanced undergraduate laboratory course in
molecular biology and to update the molecular biology laboratory exercises in
the introductory biology sequence. The molecular biology laboratory course will
be taken in conjunction with an already existing lecture course in Advanced
Molecular Biology. The laboratory exercises will introduce the students to
recombinant DNA technology including: isolation of plasmid DNA, restriction
analyses of DNA, DNA blots, plasmid constructions, DNA sequence analysis and
computer analyses of sequence information, gene cloning by both complementation
and colony hybridization, TN 10 mutagenesis, and maxi-cell analysis of plasmid
encoded proteins. The course will also serve to prepare students for independent
research projects in molecular biology. Also, a placement panel, consisting of
the course instructors, will be assembled to identify, encourage, and place
promising students into reach labs. In this way, it is hoped the problems
presented by the large number of undergraduate biology majors which in the past
has precluded a systematic approach to providing the and maximum number of the
best students with research opportunities will be overcome. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
