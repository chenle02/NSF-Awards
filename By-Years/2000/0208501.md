This project will determine a well-defined set of rules for identifying periods
of Steady Magnetospheric Convection (SMC). An automated procedure will be
established to go through a large database of satellite and ground-based data to
identify SMC periods. Once a database of SMC periods had been generated the
project will then utilize that database to perform statistical analyses on the
conditions under which SMCs arise. If a clear set of solar wind and
magnetospheric conditions can be identified as the generators of SMCs, an expert
system will then be developed for making for detailed nowcasts and forecasts of
space weather.
