RUI: Distribution of Starch in Tissues of Source Leaves during Various Phases
of the Life Cycle: Dr. Fondy will test the hypothesis that starch in leaves is
heterogeneous with regard to location, structure and metabolism depending on the
function it is intended to fulfill. This will involve a multi-pronged approach
including biochemical, C-14 labeling, histochemical and electron microscopic
studies. Undergraduates will participate in the research. The results of this
research will contribute to an understanding of carbon distribution in crop
plants and how it is controlled on a daily as well as a seasonal basis. This can
form the basis of practices that increase proportions of photoassimilated carbon
sent to harvestable plant parts.
