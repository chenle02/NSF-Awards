Fluids transport and mix heat, chemical species, and contaminants. Accurate
simulation of fluid velocities for low viscosity fluids and for longer times is
essential for safety, critical prediction and design in engineering and science.
Accurate flow predictions are key to limiting damage of hurricanes (estimated to
be hundreds of billions of dollars in typical years) and to energy efficiency
optimization (85% of US energy is generated by combustion for which accurate
simulation of turbulent mixing is critical). Fundamental barriers to accurate
flow prediction will be addressed in this research. This research also develops
expertise of PhD students who will contribute to the next generation of applied
and computational mathematicians to address future challenges. This project will
support six graduate students per year and one undergraduate per year for each
of the three years of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
develop time accurate methods in computational fluid dynamics. Time accurate
prediction must improve current turbulence models because they are only
satisfactory at statistical equilibrium. The proposed research will extend them
to non-stationary turbulence, simplify the models and reduce the number of
calibration parameters by aligning them more closely to the true energy flow
between means and fluctuations. Since fluid flow has complex dynamics, pushing
out the limited predictability horizon requires reliable and efficient ensemble
simulations. The research will develop algorithms allowing larger ensembles
without sacrificing accuracy in realizations. Effective, adaptive time
discretizations are under used in computational fluid dynamics. This research
will develop new time stepping methods of low computational, space and cognitive
complexity that are stable, accurate and easily introduced into complex
codes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
