This MRI Proposal involves the procurement of an Ultra-High Resolution Electron
Beam (E-Beam) Nanolithography and Metrology System for research and education
programs at Lehigh University. The E-Beam system offers a unique capability to
university, industry and government researchers to fabricate novel device
structures and to characterize the nanometric features of materials. This E-B
earn system will provide an opportunity for researchers to realize
nanolithographic features for the fabrication of mesoscopic and quantum devices,
such as quantum-dot nonvolatile semiconductor memories, single electron
transistors, biosensors, and nanoscopic-instrumented, microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). In addition, the E-Beam system will provide exceptional
educational instruction into nanotechnology. The fabrication of devices requires
the integration of processes where literally several hundred operations are
needed to realize a final device structure. In order to accomplish this seamless
integration of processes an E-Beam Nanolithograpy and Metrology System must be
located literally within the same physical infrastructure. For example, the
close coupling of nanoelectronics devices and MEMS with the preparation of
biological samples is essential to accomplish tasks such as cell
characterization and electronic sequencing of DNA. Finally, the E-Beam system
will serve the surrounding community within the Lehigh Valley particularly the
local colleges and K-12 students to excite students into the emerging world of
nanotechnology.
