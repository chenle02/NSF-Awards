This award provides continued support for the activities of DOSECC (Drilling,
Observation, and Sampling of the Earth's Continental Crust), Inc. for 1990 and
1991. DOSECC is a nonprofit corporation consisting of 44 universities which was
formed to manage NSF's activities in continental scientific drilling. During
this award period, DOSECC will establish a drilling operations office at Texas
A&M University which will provide logistical and engineering support to
Principal Investigators whose drilling related proposals have been recommended
for funding by the Continental Dynamics Program. There will be close cooperation
between the DOSECC office and the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) engineering staff
who are also at Texas A&M.
