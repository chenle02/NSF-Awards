This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Robin Tan of the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, to conduct collaborative research with Dr.
Masato Tanaka for 24 months at the National Chemical Laboratory for Industry in
Tsukuba, Japan. Tan and Tanaka will utilize Tan's expertise in silicon chemistry
to synthesize new organosilicon compounds. With future applications for
lithography, new organosilicon compounds can be used to develop new polymeric
materials. Tan and Tanaka propose a new method to synthesize organosilicon
species by utilizing low valent metal complexes as catalysts. By varying the
starting silicon and unsaturated organic compounds, they will be able to form
many novel organosilicon compounds which will serve as important starting
materials in the synthesis of silicon-based polymeric materials. Dr. Tanaka's
experience in silicon-based polymeric materials and the instrumentation
available in his laboratory will complement Dr. Tan's experience in synthesizing
organometallic compounds.
