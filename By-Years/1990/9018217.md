This research is to apply seismic inversion methods to seismic refraction and
wide angle reflection data in order to obtain velocity, anisotropy and
attenuation model parameters. A seismic pulse model will be developed and used
to invert travel-times, amplitudes, and periods from refraction data for a
combined velocity and attenuation structure. These inversion techniques will be
applied to data from the 1986 PASSCAL Ouachita and 1986 GLIMPCE OBS experiments.
