A growing trend in chemical engineering curricula in the past decade has been
the introduction of biochemical engineering into undergraduate laboratory
courses. A biotechnology laboratory that incorporates studies in microbial
fermentation kinetics, enzymology, biochemical reactor analysis, and
bioseparation techniques is included in the chemical engineering curriculum to
acquaint undergraduates with these important experimental methods. Equipment in
this laboratory includes a batch/continuous fermenter, an ultrafiltration
system, chromatography and spectrophotometry units, and devices to monitor cell
growth such as densitometers and dissolved oxygen and pH probes. Such a
laboratory exposes undergraduate students in chemical engineering to many
important aspects of the new and emerging technology that biotechnology
represents.
