Catenanes and rotaxanes consist of two or more separate components that are
interlocked together and held in place by the mechanical or topological bond.
Macromolecular versions of these species are especially intriguing as they offer
new polymeric architectures to explore. Interlocked macromolecular structures
such as poly[n]catenanes and poly[3]rotaxanes have the mechanical bond as an
integral part of the polymer backbone which should impart unusual properties on
these materials. For example, they have the ability to expand/contract without
significantly altering bond or torsion angles and as such, the ability to
control such motions could result in new macromolecular actuators. Furthermore,
unusual viscoelastic properties, e.g. very large modulus loss, low activation
energy for viscous flow and rapid stress relaxation, are all predicted for such
structures. The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation supports the research
group of Prof. Rowan of Case Western Reserve University to develop novel
synthetic protocols to allow access to these interesting macromolecules. The
synthetic approach utilizes metal-ligand coordination as the thermodynamic
driving force for the polymerization step and different covalent 'fixing' steps
to access either the poly[n]catenanes or poly[3]rotaxanes.

The proposed research is truly a mix of different disciplines within the
chemistry arena and the integrated research approach will provide students, at
high-school, undergraduate and graduate levels, a broad research education base.
The outreach activities are designed to increase the fraction of
underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, integrate research and
education, provide an exciting learning environment, and create teaching
opportunities for the student researchers. Part of this is the expansion and
growth of successful outreach programs initiated by the Rowan group, for example
the "Natures Materials" program which is part of the Cleveland Museum of Natural
History's MLK day Discovery Day.
