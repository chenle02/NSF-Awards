The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP)
through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and
study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the
preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue
science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or
careers. The project at Delaware State University seeks to strengthen the
university's ability to recruit, retain, and graduate underrepresented students
in STEM by adding a Neuroscience minor to the existing degree programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals and scope of this project are to leverage the
current interest in neuroscience among biology majors, expand interest in
neuroscience to non-biology majors, increase the number of students
participating in neuroscience courses at the undergraduate level, and improve
the placement rates of graduating seniors from both biology and non-biology
majors into STEM graduate programs or the STEM workforce. To achieve these
goals, this project will introduce 2 new courses: “Introduction to Neuroscience”
at the sophomore level aimed to cover the basic concepts in Neuroscience, and
the Research-focused “Introduction to Neurophysiology” at the Senior level,
which will cover the basic concepts of electrophysiology, a technique to study
the function of ion channels, proteins that control neuronal excitability. The
evaluation plan includes a study on the trajectories of students majoring in
both biology and other STEM subjects with a minor/concentration in Neuroscience
to identify obstacles that students face during degree completion and modify the
program accordingly to improve retention and minor/concentration completion
rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
