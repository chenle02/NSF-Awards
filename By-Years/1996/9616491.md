Freeman 9616491 This award assists in the transfer of the mammal collection of
some 4368 specimens from Chadron State College to the University of Nebraska
State Museum. This is a significant collection, primarily from the Pine Ridge
area of Nebraska, and it complements the existing collection at the University.
The combined collection will be among the top 30 such collections in North
America, with good documentation of reproductive and ectoparasite status of the
specimens. The project is a partnership among Chadron State College (which is
covering 18% of the total), the University of Nebraska (which is covering 37%),
and the Research Collections in Systematics and Ecology program of NSF (which is
covering 45% of the total). This project has well- thought out procedures that
are time- and cost-effective, the transfer of ownership of the specimens has
been made clear in a Memorandum of Understanding, and the Chadron State curator
is deeply involved in the project. When complete, the mammal collection at the
University of Nebraska will contribute significantly to research and education,
as well as public outreach.
