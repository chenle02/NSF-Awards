9419115 Day In well-known metamorphic belts associated with continental
collisions, peak metamorphism commonly was reached during or after major crustal
thickening. In contrast, metamorphic belts formed at the boundary of
ocean/continent collisions commonly preserve low grade metamorphism acquired
prior to the final amalgamation of the orogen. This project will focus on the
metamorphism preserved in the western metamorphic belt of the Sierra Nevada
where ophiolite preserves metamorphism that pre-dates the Cretaceous Sierra
Nevada batholith and may be as old as early Jurassic. Results will help evaluate
the thermal effects of the late Jurassic, Nevadan deformation in the Sierra
Nevada. The outcome may also provide guidance in interpreting metamorphism in
other ocean/continent collision settings.
