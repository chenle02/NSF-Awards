This is a proposal to harness the special resources at Stony Brook to train
students and post-docs in geometry and its interaction with mathematical
physics. The plan involves a radical shift from standard curricula and should be
broadly appealing to young people who are considering the possibility of a
career in mathematics.

Stony Brook has a large, highly active (and interactive) group of geometers
representing nearly all aspects of the field from algebraic geometry to string
topology. A substantial part of the research of this group is related to and/or
inspired by modern physics, and there is a long tradition of interaction between
Stony Brook's mathematicians and physicists. This is represented in
collaborations, seminars, joint students, and conferences, as well as two major
programs in mathematics and physics, funded outside the NSF. This is a proposal
to use these resources in new, effective ways for the training of young
researchers.

The proposal aims at: (1) incorporating the high-level seminars and workshops
into the training of students at an early point by close mentoring, (2) bringing
students more quickly and effectively to the research level, (3) training
students and post-docs in the dual cultures of geometry and physics, (4) giving
undergraduates a taste of mathematical research at the interactive level.



If successful this could lead to an adoption of new models for undergraduate
development and graduate education. It should produce more effective researchers
and therefore lead to better careers in mathematics. A fundamental outcome would
be the attraction of more U.S. citizens into mathematics in general and these
fields in particular, because this program offers close personal supervision, an
interactive and challenging environment and strong intellectual appeal. Another
important outcome would be a new generation trained from the beginning in the
dual cultures of mathematics and physics. This should lead to even greater
communication between these fields in the future.
