Numerous examples illustrate how coextrusion of polymeric film with three or
more layers is economically used to achieve a desirable mix of end-use
characteristics. The recent development of layer- multiplying devices permits
continuous processing of sheet or film with hundreds or thousands of alternating
layers of two or more polymers and creates new opportunities for coextrusion
technology. Motivated by the need for new processing technologies for creating
engineered microstructures of incompatible polymers, a research program will be
developed to study the unique advantages that can be achieved with this
versatile process. New phenomena are expected as the layer thickness is
decreased from the macroscale (tens of microns) to the microscale (several
microns) and finally to the nanoscale (tens of nanometers). The complex behavior
of these composite systems will be analyzed in terms of interactive hierarchical
levels of structure with particular regard to effects of layer thickness and
adhesion between layers. The potential for enhanced mechanically properties is
only one possibility; the feasibility of creating film and sheet materials with
multiple functions, including unusual optical or electronic properties, seems
possible. This grant is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials Research
and of Mechanical and Structural Systems.
