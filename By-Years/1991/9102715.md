This award from the Synthetic Organic Program will support a series of three
annual "Workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry." These
workshops have the dual purpose of (1) providing an effective forum for informal
discussion among young scientists on current research in topical areas of
organic synthesis and natural products, and (2) assisting the Program staff in
identifying emerging areas and researchers. This process, in turn, will aid the
Program in long-range planning. The specific goals of the workshops include: 1)
Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis
and natural products chemistry among a small group (about 20) of active young
researchers in these fields. 2) Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among
individuals working in related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative efforts.
3) Stimulating participants to study new problems and methods in synthetic and
natural products chemistry. 4) Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific
and social interaction among participants will be both stimulating and pleasant.
