This award, funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program, will bring
together 30 accomplished researchers from US and India to identify important
problems in the area of systems and synthetic biology of relevance both
scientifically and societally, to highlight educational requirements and best
practices, and to identify bi-national collaboration opportunities that leverage
the scientific expertise available in both nations.

The workshop will be held November 9-12, 2014 on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru
University in New Delhi, India. Approximately 30 senior researchers who are
experts in the fields of systems and synthetic biology from the US and India
will be in attendance along with representatives from US and India funding
agencies. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will also be included. The
outcomes of the workshop will be a roadmap for future US-India collaboration in
this research area as well as a possible Science Across Virtual Institutes
(SAVI) proposal. Research associated with a SAVI in systems and synthetic
biology would build research infrastructure, create new educational
opportunities, and potentially contribute to the bioeconomy in both nations.
