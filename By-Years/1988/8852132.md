This award provides funds to modernize a Biochemistry teaching laboratory to
allow more effective instruction. Improvements, which focus in the area of
enzymology, protein, purification, and molecular cloning, will be incorporated
into an existing laboratory course required of undergraduate majors. A new
spectrophotometer and personal computer will permit expansion of a unit on
enzymology. The new instruments will permit each student to gather enough
accurate data to perform meaning full analyses of cooperativity and the effects
of allosteric efforts. New fraction collectors and conductivity meter will
permit a unit on protein purification to be expanded to allow quantitative
interpretation of chromatographic profiles. The ability to collect fractions
over extended periods or in the cold will also allow greater flexibility in
choosing enzymes to purify. Finally, incubators, and a microcentrifuge will
replace presently inadequate arrangements for working with recombinant plasmids
and their bacterial hosts. Instructors will be more readily able to grow cells
for starting materials. Students will be able to grow and analyze larger number
of cultures, and will have more ready access to their materials at all stages of
the experiment. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds
from non-Federal sources.
