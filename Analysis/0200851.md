Abstract Adams The representation theory of linear reductive groups, such as
GL(n) is a very active subject, in part because of applications to the
automorphic forms and the Langlands program. However important interesting
examples of automorphic forms come from non-linear groups, i.e. groups pwhich
can not be realized as a subgroup of GL(n). A fundamental result in the theory
of real reductive groups is Vogan duality. In joint work with Peter Trapa I plan
to extend this to non-linear groups. There are a number of interesting features
in this setting which are quite different from the linear case. In a joint
project with Rebecca Herb I propose to study the characters of real reductive
non-linear groups, by relating them to linear groups via a "lifting" theory.
This lifting is closely related to Vogan duality for these groups. In a project
with Niranjan Ramachandran I am studying the structure of non-linear p-adic
reductive groups. This is an important first step in studying character theory
for these groups. Finally Annegret Paul and I are working on a project to
parametrize the theta-correspondence over R for one-dimensional representations
as completely as possible.
