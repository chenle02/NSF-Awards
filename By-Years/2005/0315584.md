&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. David Pratt of the Department of
Chemistry of the University of Pittsburgh will conduct a series of experiments
designed to determine the three-dimensional structures and dynamical properties
of several large molecules and their weakly bound solute-solvent complexes in
the gas phase. To this end, high-resolution electronic spectra of several
systems relevant to the physical chemistry of life processes will be obtained by
combining the techniques of supersonic expansions, cw molecular beams, single
frequency UV lasers, spatially selective fluorescence detection, and high-speed
data acquisition. The application of electric fields to the sample will make
possible the measurement of the permanent electric dipole moments in the
combining electronic states. Specific problems to be addressed are the torsional
modes in intersystem crossing dynamics, the motion of helium atoms in van der
Waals complexes of tetracene, the geometries of exiplexes formed in the gas
phase between substituted naphthalenes, as well as other
topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students, as well as
postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research. Close
attention will be paid to the training of future teachers of K-12 science
courses. The participants in this research project will gain valuable skills and
knowledge in contemporary physical chemistry, as well as training in the
planning and execution of research programs.&lt;br/&gt;
