9508128 Delaney This research will measure precisely the ferric/ferrous ratios
in micrometer-sized areas of a suite of glasses using synchrotron microXANES
spectroscopy. Samples characterized by Mossbauer spectroscopy and wet chemical
analysis will be used to calibrate the relationship between synchrotron
microXANES measurements and ferric/ferrous ratios in the glasses. This technique
provides, for the first time, the possibility of measuring cation partition
coefficients for ferrous or ferric iron (instead of just elemental iron) because
measurements of oxidation state can be made in coexisting phases on a
petrologically realistic scale. To calibrate the influence of oxygen fugacity on
the ferric/ferrous ratio of glasses, several glasses will be equilibrated at a
range of superliquidus temperatures in a controlled fugacity atmosphere and
quenched to form glasses.
