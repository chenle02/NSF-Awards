This project will investigate the impact of swimming microorganisms on mixing.
As a typical phenomenon, small organisms in the ocean called copepods let
themselves slowly sink while agitating the fluid around them. Copepods form
massive colonies and their collective motion helps bringing up nutrients, which
are crucial to the organisms' reproduction, from deeper layers of the ocean. The
stirring of a fluid by such swimming creatures is called biomixing. We will
investigate biomixing from a variety of directions: we will model specific
microorganisms, and use novel mathematical techniques to quantify their impact
on fluid mixing. We will also compare the motion of these organisms as they sink
to the dynamics of sedimenting particles, to see which aspects of the
accumulated knowledge on sedimenting particles carry over to microorganisms, and
which new features are introduced.

It is well known that mixing is greatly enhanced by fluid motion--even the
simple task of heating a house would be almost impossible without air
convection. Biomixing has a wide range of possible applications, beyond
immediate relevance to the fluid dynamics of microswimmers. An understanding of
the impact of swimming microorganisms on mixing will help understanding
phenomena such as oil breakup by bacteria, which is crucial in the aftermath of
oil spills, or the life cycle of large colonies of organisms. The well-being of
these colonies has a profound impact on climate change, since they absorb vast
amounts of greenhouse gases. In addition, there are potential applications to
microfluidics, where stirring by microorganisms can assist mixing at small
scales. The inclusion of graduate students into this research, and their
interdisciplinary training are an integral part of this project.
