Research will continue on the relationship between the physical properties and
the structure of polymeric composite materials. Both thermoplastic and
thermosetting resins will be used along with carbon fibers to synthesize model
systems which approximate commercial products. These materials will be tested
using dynamic mechanical and fracture toughness tests to develop a better
understanding of the effects that processing conditions have on final product
performance.
