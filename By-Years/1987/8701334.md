The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative project between Dr. David
Schramm of the University of Chicago and Dr. Alexander Szalay of Eotvos
University is to examine theories in nuclear and particle physics for
implications to research in cosmology and astrophysics. Results may have bearing
on our understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe, dark matter
and galaxy formation, as well as solar neutrino flux. This project in the field
of extragalactic astronomy fulfills the program objective of advancing
scientific knowledge by enabling leading scientific experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents, pool resources, and share
research experience in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
