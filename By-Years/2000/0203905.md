AST-0203905&lt;br/&gt;Garnett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Donald Garnett, at the
University of Arizona, will study the problem of why recombination lines (RLs)
from twice-ionized oxygen (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and other heavy
elements yield much higher abundances than the corresponding collisionally-
excited forbidden lines (FLs) from the same species. This problem challenges our
confidence in abundances derived from planetary nebulae and ionized hydrogen
(HII) regions in the Milky Way and other galaxies and their interpretation for
stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution studies. In this project, Dr.
Garnett will (1) map the spatial distribution of RLs and FLs in a variety of
planetary nebulae and giant HII regions to determine how physical structures
affect their distribution, (2) study the hot gas content using data from FUSE
and X-ray satellite missions to see if the presence of hot gas is a contributing
factor, and (3) examine the spatial variation of electron temperature using a
variety of diagnostics to determine if large observed differences between the
temperature derived from the Balmer line/continuum ratio and the temperature
derived from forbidden line ratios are related to physical structures. This
project will use already existing and scheduled ground-based spectroscopy, FUSE
spectra and Chandra/XMM imaging, as well as new ground-based spectroscopy of RLs
in HII regions.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
