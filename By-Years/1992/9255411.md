The workshop will focus on lasers and their application to solving chemical
problems. The offering will consist of a one-week intensive exposure to both the
theory and practical application of laser technology to areas of interest to all
branches of chemistry. The course will include: (1) lectures on the fundamentals
of lasers and related topics, (2) laboratory experiments to illustrate the
principles presented in lectures, (3) lectures and laboratory experiments
dealing with current applications of lasers to chemically interesting problems,
and (4) an opportunity to engage in a special project of interest to the
participant, the technology of which will be transportable to the participant's
home institution. A major feature of this workshop is to provide exposure to
laser technology at a level appropriate for incorporation at the undergraduate
level.
