This Expedited Award for Novel Research will provide support for a research
effort using two industrial robots to demonstrate the positive effects of
judicious changes in mechanical systems on robot performance. The following
issues are addressed: low inertia/high effective stiffness combination link
design; mass counterbalancing; enhancement of transmission stiffness by design
means; validation of computer simulations of path deviations. Significant
performance improvements (100% to 150% increases in rated payload) are
anticipated.
