This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will be used by the Division of
Engineering and the Center for Advanced Materials Research at Brown University
to purchase components, instrumentation, and software in order to convert an
existing field- emission scanning electron microscope for use as a direct-write
electron-beam lithography tool. The e-beam lithographic capability will support
several investigators pursuing individual research projects that represent a
broad spectrum of materials, devices, physics, and technology, including
fundamental electronic, magnetic, and optoelectronic properties of lower
dimensional systems, II-VI and III-V semiconductor heterostructures and devices,
ultra-fine magnetic particles, mesoscopic normal-metal superconductor
structures, and Moire microscopy of layered microelectronic structures. The
conversion project entails installation of beam-blanking hardware in the
electron optical column of the microscope, enhancement of the microscope sample
stage, construction of a Faraday cup sensor, and configuring the computer and
controls for pattern generation and writing. Direct writing of feature sizes at
and below 1000 A will be realized. By making use of existing electron optics,
this project will provide a significant research capability to a
multidisciplinary group in a timely and cost-effective fashion. Specific
technological advances that are expected to accrue from the application of this
resource include the development of coherent electron transistors, high-density
magnetic recording media, optimized blue- green diode lasers, and a versatile
materials testing and failure analysis system for microelectronics. These new
technologies will emerge from ongoing substantive and comprehensive
investigations of the various underlying physical phenomena of quantum
confinement and transport, exciton-phonon interaction, and microstructural
mechanics.
