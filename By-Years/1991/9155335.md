ACTION PHYSICS is intended to train 60 New York City middle school teachers (20
per year for three years) in New York City in basic physics concepts. The
training will involve teachers in the development and implementation of a series
of activities which utilize the concepts of sports and dance and body movement
as the experimental context for learning. The project will strengthen teachers'
abilities to use a variety of teaching strategies to present physics concepts in
this motivating framework. The project is a cooperative effort of the Center for
Advanced Study in Education (CUNY), Brooklyn College, CUNY Physics Department,
The New York City Board of Education, the New York State Education and Research
Network (NYSERnet), the American Physical Society, the New York Academy of
Sciences, and The Institute for Schools of the Future. Participants, who will
receive graduate credit for some of the coursework taken, will have access to
computers in the classrooms and will be eligible for a New York City program
which loans computers to teachers for use in their homes. Access to the
computers will enable the teachers to participate in electronic networking among
themselves and with scientists associated with the project and with related
groups and persons who use the NYSERnet and Internet.
