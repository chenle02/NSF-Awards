Title: EAGER: Exploring Spline Theory for Shapes of Arbitrary
Topology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hong Qin, SUNY at Stony Brook (Stony Brook
University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
goal of this research is to clearly articulate a novel spline-driven
computational method (splines are piecewise polynomials that satisfy certain
continuity requirements) for the geometric modeling of shapes that are of
arbitrary topological type. In order to achieve this objective, the research is
exploring a new mathematical theory of splines over shapes of arbitrarily
complicated topology and geometry. The flexible and effective construction of
splines defined over an arbitrary manifold has immediate impact for computer-
aided geometric design, visual information processing, and computer graphics.
Moreover, this theory-centered research will enable a more accurate, more
efficient, and easier-to-use software system for processing geometric and
scientific datasets. The research is demonstrating that splines are a powerful
data modeling, analysis, and simulation tool that not only continue to be
applicable to geometric and shape modeling, but also have important extensions
to a general data modeling and analysis
framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, splines have their mathematical
root in approximation theory. Continuous representations such as splines can
enable compact representation, analysis (especially quantitative analysis),
simulation, and digital prototyping. In order to bridge the large gap between
conventional spline formulations and the strong demand to accurately and
efficiently model acquired datasets towards quantitative analysis and finite
element simulation, our research effort centers on the unexplored mathematical
theory of manifold splines that will extend popular spline schemes to
effectively represent objects over arbitrary topology. In particular, we are
conducting a comprehensive study of new theoretical foundations that can
transform the spline-centric representations to the accurate and effective
modeling of surfaces of arbitrary topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
