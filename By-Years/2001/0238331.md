&lt;br/&gt; Experiments and observations will be used to study the effects of
global and regional climate change at high altitudes in the Colorado Rocky
Mountains over the next five years. This study, initiated in 1973, now provides
one of the longest and most detailed datasets available for snowfall, the timing
and abundance of flowering by wildflowers, the emergence of animals from
hibernation, and the arrival of migratory birds in the spring. The 1998 phase
change of the North Pacific Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean appears to have
triggered a change in snowfall, and the consequences for plants and animals
appear to be significant. This new phase may last for the next two decades, and
initial results suggest that it is having significant effects on the ecology of
the Rocky Mountains. The researchers will continue a study where heaters are
used to simulate global warming, and demographic responses by the wildflower
populations measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader impacts of this research are
that it will provide a long-term dataset on effects of climate change for an
ecosystem that should be particularly sensitive to such changes, it will train
both graduate and undergraduate students, and support continued efforts to
communicate research results to the public. &lt;br/&gt;
