9523190 Brown An inexpensive, portable tungsten coil atomic absorption
spectrometer will be designed, constructed, and evaluated. This device will be a
combination of a reliable tungsten coil atomizer, a miniature
spectrometer/detector combination mounted on a PC card, and a near-line
background correction method. The instrument will be powered by a normal 12 volt
car battery connected through a car's cigarette lighter, and controlled with a
laptop computer. The detection of toxic chemicals in the environment is
extremely important. The proposed device will be attractive to a wide variety of
laboratories that are dedicated to the detection of these chemicals and perform
trace metal determinations regularly.
