Determination of the age-at-death of individuals from their osteological remains
is an important part of physical and forensic anthropology. In the past, age
determination has largely been treated as an `art,` with only minor attention
given to the statistical bases for estimation. In this project a large sample of
known age-at-death individuals from the Robert J. Terry Human Skeletal
Collection (currently housed at the Smithsonian Institution) are examined to fit
various statistical models for age estimation. Data previously collected by Drs.
Thomas McKern and T.D. Stewart on 375 U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean War
will also be entered into these analyses. The McKern and Stewart data are housed
in the Thomas Dale Stewart Papers at the Smithsonian. In addition to presenting
the results of the statistical analyses, this project will make the raw data
from both the Terry and McKern and Stewart sample available to interested
researchers faced with the problem of determining ages-at-death.
