With the recent demonstration of optical radiation having characteristics quite
different from those of the conventional laser or other types of traditional
light sources sources, there is a possibility of new and highly innovative
approaches to optical communications, sensing and detection. There is also a
considerable effort on the fundamental side due to this promise of
ultrasensitive detection. The development of such approaches depends upon new
and unique fiber characteristics, the development of new optical sources, and
possibly new techniques for the detection of radiation. The particular effort
discussed in the present proposal involves an integrated theoretical and
experimental investigation of new fiber and integrated optical systems based
upon these new possibilities.
