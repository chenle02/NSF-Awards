Along with the rapid development of Internet Protocol (IP) based technologies
and wireless networks, telecommunication and Internet services providers (SPs)
are showing great interests in technologies for integrating wireless access
networks, wireless backhaul networks, and Internet backbone into a seamless IP
solution. One of the fundamental issues towards this ambitious objective is that
each network along an end-to-end path needs to be properly dimensioned and
managed for quality of service provisioning, for which this project is expected
to make significant contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This
project will develop accurate capacity planning tools, efficient medium access
control protocols, and dynamic resource sharing techniques for highest resource
utilization in both wireless access and backhaul networks. In particular, all
the developments are neatly organized under a generic cross-layer framework,
where the complex interplay between the upper-layer IP application data arrival
process and the lower-layer wireless medium access control are accurately
captured and modeled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: On the education
front, this project incorporates theoretical studies in the areas of queueing
theory, optimization, and wireless networking, with practical investigations
including computer simulations and testbed experiments. This interdisciplinary
research will not only provide various training projects to undergraduate and
graduate students, but also inspire students to pursue high-quality research
with a creative, open-minded, cross-disciplinary perspective. On the industry
front, the success of this project will produce techniques that not only
facilitate the SPs to squeeze the most out of the wireless networks for highest
revenue, but also trigger new customer/SP interplay models and new network
integration models.&lt;br/&gt;
