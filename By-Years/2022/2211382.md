Today's cloud data centers struggle to keep up with the computing demands of
big-data applications (e.g., social media, video streaming, and artificial
intelligence) that form the backbone of our modern technological society. The
current status-quo of executing compute at the end-host servers while using
networks for routing packets only, restricts these data centers from scaling to
ever-growing distributed and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. In-
network computing scales and accelerate modern applications by performing parts
of the high-level computation directly inside the network switches. However,
todayâ€™s switches implement simple, stateless packet protocols (e.g., routing and
forwarding) and cannot perform complicated stateful operations needed to run
distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this challenge, the
proposal seeks to develop (1) a stateful switch architecture for flexible
management, computation, and sharing of applications' state in the network,
beyond just traditional packet processing; (2) a network-wide abstraction and
runtime to program and operate the proposed stateful switches collectively
within a data center; and, lastly, (3) a suite of representative applications
and test cases to guide the design and implementation of these stateful switches
by exploring their architectural trade-offs. This work has the potential to
significantly enhance large scale computation now used widely by researchers,
the government and businesses in every sector of the
economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
