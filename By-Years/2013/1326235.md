This award provides funding for laboratory experiments conducted by coPI Collin
Weigel under the supervision of Prof. Stanley Reynolds. The experiments test the
effects of clear economic incentives on individual decision making in dynamic
environments. Research in psychology and marketing suggests that people tend to
continue on a course of action once they have sunk resources into their
decisions, and that people continue even when it is no longer rational to do so.
The experiments test the hypothesis that a clearly defined environment and clear
economic incentives correct this tendency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous
scholars have argued that because people stick with their course of action once
they have 'sunk' resources, it is very difficult to change such a course of
action. This has been used as the basis for marketing campaigns and for efforts
to encourage the adoption of new technologies. The new research funded by this
award may result in new insights about how to market innovative products.
