This project is a renewal of one initiated under NSF Grant No. 87-01184 to
develop methods for recovery of the historical input record of pollutants from
analysis of sedimentary deposits obtained by coring lake sediments. In this
prior work, a frequency domain deconvolution method was developed to extract
past input fluxes of these types of pollutants from their sedimentary record.
Pollutants of interest include lead, zinc, cadmium, polychlorinated biphenyls
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This renewal will permit enhancement of
the experimental methods developed previously for analysis of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons and for the gamma-emitting radioactive tracer Cesium-137.
Sedimentary deposits of particle-associated pollutants can provide valuable
information for use in devising environmental models and in their validation.
However, these records are often distorted reflections of past fluxes because of
the variety of physical, chemical and biological environmental processes to
which the particles are subjected during and following their deposition. These
processes include mixing, biodegradation, radioactive decay and compaction. This
project has the potential for obtaining more information than is now possible
from an analysis of sedimentary deposits. This in turn may prove useful in
validating models of climate and hydrological processes as they relate to
pollutant deposition in coast regions of the United States.
