What atoms, molecules and solids can exist, and with what properties? Answers
are found from selfconsistent electronic- structure calculations within the
Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham density functional theory, which treats the Pauli and
Coulomb correlations between electrons in a perspicuous and tractable but
approximate way. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop and
test a semi-local generalization of the popular local approximation for the
exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density n(r).
Regarded either as a generalization of the gradient expansion or as a "linear
density approximation," the new functional should offer significantly increased
chemical accuracy over the local density approximation, at the price of a slight
increase in computational effort. The spin-density version will also be sought
and tested. Secondary goals include (a) a better understanding of fully nonlocal
and semi-local approximations, (b) an improved semi- local density functional
for the kinetic energy, which could be useful in exploratory calculations or in
early iterations of the selfconsistency loop, and (c) applied calculations for
metal surfaces and charged metallic particles.
