This award provides support for a workshop on Mathematical Biology and Numerical
Analysis. The objective of this workshop is to give interdisciplinary education,
training and research in the mathematical and biological sciences. It will
provide the participants with an overview of the necessary mathematical and
biological background that are essential for a good number of applications in
biological sciences.

The workshop is aimed at students and postdocs. It will be interdisciplinary in
nature, bringing together students and postdocs from mathematical and biological
sciences. The format of the workshop will consist of 12 invited speakers giving
a total of 24 lectures in two tracks in two days. There will be ample time for
the students to interact with the speakers on a one-on-one basis outside of the
formal lectures. The speakers will be asked to present overview lectures at the
level of a graduate course to ensure the audience takes away a working knowledge
of the material. Then some speakers will lead the hands on use of varied
mathematical biology tools in a computer laboratory. The topics to be presented
are: a) numerical simulations of ecosystems; b) systems biology of complex
traits; c) analysis of compositional heterogeneity among microbial genomes; d)
functional connectivity and neuronal network dynamics; e) reconstructing
metabolic pathways through network modeling of experimental data. Most of the
topics presented at the workshop are not typically covered in standard
curricula. Furthermore, the students, postdocs and professors will benefit
greatly from interacting with groups from different disciplines and from the
research that integrates mathematical and biological sciences.

The workshop is expected to have a substantial impact on the training of
students and postdocs already in the mathematical and biological sciences, as
well as for the recruitment of students from other disciplines into the
mathematical and biological sciences. Both groups will benefit from the quality
of the teaching in areas of major and active research by leaders in the field.
We will be working actively to ensure the participation of minorities, women and
students with disabilities at the proposed workshop.
