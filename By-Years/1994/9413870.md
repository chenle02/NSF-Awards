9413870 Aberbach This award supports research in commutative algebra. The
principal investigator will explore the structure of the absolute integral
closure of excellent local rings. He will also study the Cohen-Macaulayness of
graded rings for ideals of higher analytic deviation. This research is concerned
with a number of questions in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
Algebraic geometry studies solutions of families of polynomial equations. One
can either study the geometry of the solution set or approach problems
algebraically by investigating certain functions on the solution set that form
what is called a commutative ring. This dual perspective creates a close
connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
