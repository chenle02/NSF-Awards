This Small Buisness Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the
urgent need to improve control of the blast chemical reaction. These blasts are
produced by drilling boreholes into the overburden and filling them with an
ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) mixture. These explosive charges are then
ignited to push the overburden into a previously excavated trench. This Phase II
project will complete the design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype
detonation system to be deployed in surface mining boreholes to preferentially
initiate detonation of the powder column, thus insuring a high efficiency blast
without the unwanted release of toxic air pollutants.

This project will lead to commercialization of a method of improving the
efficiency and environmental quality of the cast blasting technique used by the
surface mining. The market for this detonation system is any mining that
involves cast blasting, primarily the surface coal mining industry. The United
States is one of the two world leaders in coal production with nearly one
billion tons of coal being produced in 2001.
