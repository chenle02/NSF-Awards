Dwarf galaxies, the most common type of galaxy in the Universe, are
kinematically simple systems, which makes them ideal laboratories for studying
how star formation occurs on local, rather than global, scales. This work will
focus on characterizing the neutral hydrogen component of the interstellar
medium in dwarf irregular galaxies, as part of a large multi-wavelength study
headed by Dr Deidre Hunter of Lowell Observatory. To understand how dwarf
galaxies form stars, it is essential to determine the location, morphology, and
kinematics of their gas reservoirs, relative to regions of current and past star
formation. High resolution interferometric data will be reduced, imaged, and
analyzed, and used to constrain star formation models, as part of the overall
project.

This work is a collaboration between faculty at a minority (Hispanic)
institution, and staff at a private observatory. The researcher will extend
existing involvements with graduate and undergraduate students, and present
public talks, often including material related to the project. Being actively
involved in research enables a scientist to bring the excitement of discovery to
the classroom and to the public.
