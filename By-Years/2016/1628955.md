This project funds research into the interaction between liquidity, asset
prices, and aggregate activity with a focus on financial intermediation, crises,
and macroeconomic policies. The goal is to develop new modeling frameworks that
will improve our understanding of the interactions between financial
intermediation, balance sheet adjustment, and aggregate production. These
macroeconomic frameworks incorporate the possibility of actual bank runs and
anticipation of bank runs. As a result, the research can improve our
understanding of financial crisis events. One part of the research program will
analyze balance sheet adjustment including both financial and real assets, and
provides new insights into how a financial crisis may lead to slower aggregate
economic growth. The results of the research will give policymakers better
insight into how to best promote financial and macroeconomic
stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has several parts. The first is
joint with Kosuke Aoki and Gianluca Benigno, and it investigates a small open
economy with financial intermediaries which fund capital investment by borrowing
from home and foreign agents, exploring the role of monetary and financial
policies. The second project is joint work with Mark Gertler; it builds a
macroeconomic model of banking which incorporates a financial accelerator and
rollover risk to examine financial crises. The third project with John Moore
studies systemic risk when many financial intermediaries lend and borrow from
each other.
