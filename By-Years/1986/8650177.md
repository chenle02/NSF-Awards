This Leadership Activities project will provide preparation for 30 middle/junior
high school teachers and for up to 60 school administrators in the use of
zoological collections in science education. Instruction will be conducted at
the Bronx Zoo by education staff from the zoo, collaborating with experienced
teachers and science administrators. Curriculum materials during the workshop
will include the Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education (Project WIZE) developed
with National Science Foundation funding. This award-winning curriculum was
designed to link classroom study with zoo field work. The project will include
experiences with JungleLab, a classroom/laboratory over-looking lush tropical
settings in JungleWorld, which is a massive indoor exhibition of Asian habitats.
JungleLab provides unique opportunities to observe wildlife in a setting much
like that experienced by research biologists in the field. Participants will be
selected based upon their leadership skills in teaching, their experiences in
biology, and the willingness of their school districts to support project
activities. We anticipate that following the workshop each of the leadership
teachers will conduct appropriate
