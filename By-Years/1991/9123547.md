This research will continue spectrophotometric measurements with the Charge-
Coupled Device (CCD) spectrograph and direct imaging camera of the emission line
and continuous spectra of nebulae, Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, other
active galactic nuclei, and quasars. Direct images will be taken with the CCD
system through various emission-line and continuum filters. These measurements,
in conjunction with X-ray, radio, ultraviolet and infrared data will be used to
analyze the physical conditions in the ionized gas in all types of active
galactic nuclei. Information on ionization, abundances, temperatures and
densities will be emphasized in this research. The internal velocity fields and
energy-input mechanisms will also be investigated. These data, and their
interpretation, will add to our knowledge of the structure, nature, origin, and
evolution of active galactic nuclei. The Principal Investigator is regarded as a
world leader in this field of research.
