Funding is provided for an education and planning workshop under the MARGINS
initiative to be held in March 2001 on the Red Sea. Red Sea and Gulf of Suez
area is one of the two chosen "focus" areas selected by the MARGINS community to
study the fundamental processes of rupturing continental lithosphere to form new
ocean basins. The workshop will be held in Cairo and Sharam el-Sheikh and will
provide a forum for interaction between US scientists and potential
collaborators from countries surrounding the focus study area. The workshop
includes a 2-day field trip along the Suez rift followed by a 3-day seminar in
Sharam el-Shiekh that will summarize the state of the knowledge about the area
and discuss further research need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
