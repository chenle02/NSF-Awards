The laboratory has been using monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to study the topology
of selected proteins associated with photosynthesis in higher plants. This is
done by isolating and cloning hybridomas which secrete MAbs of interest. Once
obtained, the ability of the Mabs to bind to various preparations (rightsideout
thylakoids, insideout thylakoids, isolated Photosystem II membranes, isolated
proteins, etc.) can be asessed and in so doing it is possible to determine the
exposure of the specific epitopes to which the MAbs bind. By cross correlating
our Mab binding data and epitope determination with hypothetical models of
protein topography based on hydropathic analyseSs of protein primary structure,
more topologically correct models of photosynthetic protein complexes of the
thylakoid membrane can be developed.
