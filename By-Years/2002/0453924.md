The vertebrate immune system serves to protect individuals from disease and
neoplasm. It is composed of innate and adaptive characteristics that have been
well-studied in mammals but very little is known about the processes governing
the development of the immune repertoire in lower vertebrates, such as fish.
Thus a fish model can provide an evolutionary perspective into the processes
that have shaped the vertebrate immune system. Cytotoxic and helper T-cells are
derived from a common T-cell precursor that commits to either of these two
lineages after receiving specific signals in the thymus through a process known
as T-cell development. Two different models have been put forth to explain
T-cell development in mammals. It is the goal of this study to examine this
process in rainbow trout to provide a comparative approach for examining the two
models. This study will assess the pathways and signals that lead to development
of the two T-cell subsets in fish. Specifically, this proposal will allow for
the development of tools such as monoclonal antibodies that can be used to
follow the developmental program that trout T-cells utilize during their
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also serve to train and
educate high school and undergraduate students in critical thought and current
techniques in molecular biology and immunology. It will also show students the
value of using comparative studies to solve fundamental paradigms in biology.
Overall, the major objective of this project is to provide a basic understanding
of the processes governing T-cell development in fish with a long-term goal of
ascertaining the extent of conservation for this process in all vertebrates.
These studies will have ramifications for research dealing the development of
T-cells in mammals while also providing basic research and tools that can be
applied to the preservation and maintenance of salmonid
fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
