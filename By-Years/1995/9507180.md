9507180 Baldwin Leaf damage by herbivores in Nicotiana sylvestris (Solanaceae)
produces a damage signal which dramatically increases de novo nicotine synthesis
in the roots. The increased synthesis leads to increases in whole-plant nicotine
pools, which in turn make plants more resistant to further herbivore attack.
Because signal production and the response to the signal occur in widely
separated tissues, this whole-plant induced defense represents an ideal system
in which to study the signal transduction cascade and how the biotic and abiotic
environment influence this induced defense. It has been demonstrated that the
damage signal has the characteristics of a slow-moving phloem-transported
chemical cue and that jasmonic acid (JA), an octadecanoid- derived
cyclopentanone, is an important component of the damage signal transduction
pathway in this induced defense. In this project Dr. Baldwin will critically
examine the hypothesis that wounding increases shoot JA pools which either
directly through transport or indirectly through a systemin-like signal increase
root JA pools, which, in turn stimulate root nicotine synthesis and increase
whole-plant nicotine pools. To achieve this objective Dr. Baldwin will determine
the chirality of the induced jasmonate pools in shoot and roots, examine the
plant's nicotine responses to intermediates in the octadecanoid pathway and
synthesize jasmonates in the native stereoconfigurations. By understanding the
processes responsible for signal generation and transport it may be possible to
understand how herbivores consume plants "stealthily" and apparently lessen the
induced defenses activated by their feeding.
