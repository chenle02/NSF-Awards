The proposed research seeks to improve our understanding of the lower layers of
the atmosphere associated with tropical cyclones (hurricanes and tropical
storms). This study will use also investigate the band of thunderstorms, near
the equator, termed the "Intertropical Convergence Zone (or "ITCZ"). This band
of storms can often be the source region for developing tropical storms and
hurricanes. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the
complexities of the lower atmosphere associated with these destructive storms,
as well as potentially improve our ability to better forecast the track and
intensity of these storms. This research will train a graduate student at the
investigator's home institution and new knowledge will be shared with other
investigators through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. This new
knowledge will also be incorporated into courses taught in the investigator's
department, training a new generation of students in tropical meteorology.

This study seeks to further our understanding of the dynamics of tropical
cyclones (TCs) and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) through the use of
theory and simplified analytical models. Fundamental questions of tropical
atmospheric dynamics to be addressed are: (1) the development and evolution of
key structural components of TCs, (2) the feedback between boundary layer
shocks, Ekman pumping, and TC structure/intensity change, and (3) the processes
by which concentrated Ekman pumping develops in the ITCZ boundary layer. This
investigation will extend simplified models to higher dimensions/levels of
complexity, and by developing numerical methods to find solutions to these
models.
