Dr. Timothy Rowe of the University of Texas at Austin will devote his time
during the five years of this Presidential Young Investigator Award to using
phylogenetic systematics to explore the evolution of mammalian ontogeny. This
work logically follows from previous research, which analyzed skeletal evolution
in the major groups of Mammalia and the closest extinct relatives within
Synapsida (early reptilian forms ancestral to true mammals). Nearly 1,000
historic transformations of the skeleton were summarized as a result. It is now
possible to refer to this information while examining skeletal development in
living mammals. Cladistic methods will be used to analyze skeletal development
in selected mammalian and tetrapod species, phylogenetic transformations and
sequences of transformations that recapitulate in ontogeny, and disruptions or
deletions in transformation sequences. To accomplish these goals, it will be
necessary to acquire developmental information from cleared and stained embryos
of extant mammal species; serial sections, and images (from nuclear magnetic
resonance techniques, from rare or endangered species) will also be processed
and incorporated into the data set. The research described above has exceptional
potential for generating new data and for syntheses with previous observations
to solve long-standing problems in evolutionary biology. In addition, it
highlights the importance of systematic biology in supplying a unifying theme to
threads from the disparate fields of molecular and developmental biology,
comparative anatomy, and paleontology.
