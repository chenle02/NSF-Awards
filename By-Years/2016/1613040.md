The goal of this program is to study the epoch of reionization (EoR) through the
redshifted hydrogen emission line at rest wavelength 21 cm. The EoR is one of
the last unexplored phases in the history of the universe. Broader impacts of
the work include training of women and underrepresented minority students
through a program called Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates
(RENTU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide support for the US-based
imaging power spectrum analysis team, which has been at the forefront of
analyzing data from the Mileura Widefield Array telescope in Australia, and will
provide one of the cornerstone analysis pipelines for the new Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA), an NSF-supported radio telescope in South Africa.
