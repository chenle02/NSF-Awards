A series of workshops in Puerto Rico will lay the foundation for the development
and deployment of an island-wide regional research and education network. The
workshops will be staged as three related events:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) the
first workshop will provide an introduction to the potential of a regional
educational network in Puerto Rico and the feasibility, need and advantages of
creating one,&lt;br/&gt;(2) the second workshop will provide a hands-on
strategic technical planning session for interested campuses; and&lt;br/&gt;(3)
the third workshop will provide a hands-on strategic funding planning
session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each workshop will be one day to one and one half
days long to maximize participation. The workshops are tentatively scheduled for
November 2002, January 2003, and March 2003 to ensure that the participants have
sufficient time to galvanize commitments between each workshop.
