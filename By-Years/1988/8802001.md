The research in this grant concerns the theory of p-adic Hecke algebras. This
theory attempts to give a systematic way to construct p-adic L-functions
associated with p-adic or complex cusp forms and their Galois representations
over power series rings with coefficients in the p-adic integers. Also the
principal investigator hopes to find arithmetic relations between these Galois
representations and the constructed p-adic L- functions. This theory has been
developed for the rational numbers but much remains to be done over general
number fields. There will be applications to the Iwasawa theory of imaginary
quadratic fields. The p-adic theory of modular forms is the subject of this
research. Modular forms are functions that transform in certain ways and are at
the center of much research in number theory today. The p-adic theory replaces
the usual real or complex numbers with the number theoretic p-adic numbers.
Obtaining analogs with the usual theory is a major focus of this research.
