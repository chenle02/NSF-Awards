Harvard College Observatory proposes to create teacher training videos and
workshop materials which will help science teachers understand and cope with
misconceptions in science. Building on a body of research which has been done in
this area, a series of teacher-training video tapes will be developed and made
available to teachers on a nation wide basis. Six 28-minute tapes will address
misconceptions in the fields of biology, chemistry, earth science, engineering,
mathematics, and physics. An additional set of six 30-minute workshop tapes will
contain sample student and teacher interviews and samples of both effective and
ineffective teaching methods, and will be accompanied by activity books. A panel
of six teachers with a background in misconception research will serve in summer
workshops as an advisory group in the development of the materials. The video
tape series and workshop materials will be derived from the work pioneered in
Project Star; the tapes will be an extension of the pilot video, A Private
Universe. There is a cost-sharing is 37% of the amount requested from NSF.
