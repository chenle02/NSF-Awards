This project will support a workshop for Principal Investigators (PI's) in the
Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of Materials Research.
The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA in late May or early June 2016 and
will provide PI's with a venue to interact with each other and program officers
and to gain valuable information on best practices for broader impacts which are
an important component of the grant evaluation criteria for NSF awards. Broader
Impacts cover the societal benefits of NSF funded research and a foundation wide
conference recently focused on the various activities that comprise the broader
impacts of an NSF award. These include the development of a trained STEM
workforce, impact on other fields, education of students at all levels and
outreach to the public. This workshop will focus on the development of effective
broader impacts for grants, best practices in these areas and methods to develop
effective communication among PI's and with the general public. This workshop
will help to create a more knowledgeable, sophisticated and successful CMP
community.
