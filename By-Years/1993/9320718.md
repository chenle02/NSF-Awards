This project to develop geminal-based methods in molecular electronic structure
theory is supported jointly by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program and the the Advanced Scientific Computing Division. Methods will be
developed for the computation of accurate, ab initio, small molecule, electronic
wavefunctions using contracted Gaussian geminals (predetermined linear
combinations of explicitly-correlated, two-particle, Gaussian basis functions).
Geminal parameters for molecules will be extracted from optimized atomic
wavefunctions. Scalable algorithms will be developed for implementation on
parallel computers. The quantum mechanical electronic wavefunction is a
mathematical function of the spatial and spin coordinates of all the electrons
in the atom or molecule. These many-body functions are traditionally expressed
in terms of orbitals, i.e. functions of the coordinates of a single electron.
Orbital-based concepts and computational methods play a central role in modern
chemical theory, but there is a practical limit to the accuracy attainable in
orbital-based computations using existing supercomputers. The goal of this
project is to develop improved computational methods using geminals (explicit
functions of the coordinates of a pair of electrons) rather than orbitals. If
successful, this will significantly increase the accuracy of theoretical
predictions of gas phase reaction rates such as those required for improved
computer models of the earth's atmosphere.
