We are adding several new experiments to the UC Berkeley Physics 111 Laboratory
in an effort to expose students in this upper-division classroom lab to modern
developments in science. Earlier, the 111 Lab allowed students to experience
elaborate experiments in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics; however, these
experiments represent "state-of-the-art" science as of 30 years ago. We are
introducing new experiments, including Nonlinear Laser Spectroscopy and Magneto-
optics, that will enhance the curriculum by bringing it up to date with modern
developments in these fields. The 111 Lab offers students a formative experience
in experimental science, and the addition of these new experiments constitutes a
vital step in improving the undergraduate physics curriculum. These improvements
are an extension of curriculum development efforts taking place in our lower
division courses. The resulting work will be made available to the physics
community through journal articles, meetings via the World Wide Web, and a
planned summer institute program. *
