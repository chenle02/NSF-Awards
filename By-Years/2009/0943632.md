This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the &lt;br/&gt;R/V Blue Heron, an 86 foot
Coastal vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large
Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. The award includes three
items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Sediment Traps&lt;br/&gt;2)
Fluoroprobe&lt;br/&gt;3) Kullenberg Coring System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use
instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition
of the sampling equipment coupled with underway seawater analysis tools and a
sediment sampling device will enhance the capabilities of R/V Blue Heron, the
only vessel working under the UNOLS umbrella in the Great Lakes, to support a
wide range of marine scientific disciplines.
