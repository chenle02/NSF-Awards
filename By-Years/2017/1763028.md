This project develops, implements and tests a new quantitative resilience
modeling framework to support operational and strategic decisions for improving
the resilience of water infrastructure systems during normal and emergency
operations. This framework integrates conceptual, structural, simulation, and
optimal decision-making models for resilience investment prioritization. The
newly developed quantitative resilience performance metrics that result from
this modeling effort can influence the way that water infrastructure systems
resilience investments are evaluated and compared to identify optimal
improvement actions. Rapid failures and slow system deterioration in water
infrastructure systems continue to present challenges in reliably and cost-
effectively meeting service needs. Thus, this scientific research contribution
supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our
national welfare with benefits that will optimize investments in the nation's
critical infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new quantitative resilience
modeling framework will: 1) be reusable for multiple hazard and decision
scenarios; 2) be able to integrate existing simulation and modeling tools; and
3) be useable within different decision-making strategies. Major contributions
include: computational libraries for civil infrastructure resilience analysis
using a standardized modeling language to represent inter- and intra-system
dependencies; specific instances of these libraries for water infrastructure
systems; a prototype of a system simulation model that incorporates SCADA-data-
infused hydraulic models for performance assessment for a real system; a set of
new quantitative metrics for assessing and comparing alternative plans for
improving system-level resilience considering short- and long-term performances;
and a case study of the new framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
