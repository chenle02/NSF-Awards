9417711 Peacock The geology and structure of many metamorphic core complexes is
reasonably well-known, however rates and duration of extension and thermal
effects, particularly in the upper plate, are not well- constrained. This
project will utilize the well-characterized Catalina metamorphic core complex to
address these questions by determining apatite and zircon fission-track ages and
track length distributions for samples collected from both the upper and lower
plates. Results will help constrain the timing, duration and rate of extension,
the magnitude of crustal extension and thermal effect of extension on the upper
plate. A rigorous thermal modeling program will guide interpretation of the FT
data and should increase our understanding of the thermal evolution of the crust
during extension.
