This award supports purchase of three major instruments to be used for
analytical biochemistry in research and teaching efforts at a predominantly
undergraduate institution. The award, to a group of faculty with related
interests in information processing in complex biological systems, will permit
acquisition and operation of a high pressure liquid chromatography system, an
elemental analyser, and a phospoimaging system. These instruments will be placed
in a central shared laboratory where they will be maintained by an experienced
research technician. Expected research uses include the following: studies of
nutrient movement within fungal mycelia; long-term analysis of soil chemistry in
the New Jersey Pinelands; analysis of the effects of circadian rhythms and
sleep-waking cycles on distribution of thyroid hormones and related CNS
neurotransmitters; clarification of the neurotransmitter histology of a unique
feeding circuit in Pantadon buchholzi, a fish with an unusual eye that receives
light simultaneously from air and water; and others. In addition, the equipment
will be used to enhance numerous graduate and undergraduate course offerings in
biology and chemistry. The availability of this equipment will allow student
researchers at both graduate and undergraduate levels to have hands-on
experience with sophisticated research instruments. Courses that will benefit
from the new equipment include biochemistry, cell physiology, molecular biology,
general ecology, practical field ecology, and a proposed laboratory course in
neuroscience and others. The equipment will also benefit several outreach
programs that bring participants into the research laboratories of
Rutgers/Camden faculty.
