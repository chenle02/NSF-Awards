9555764 Lopez The Teacher-Scientist Alliance Institute is a series of workshops
that are part of a national initiative of the American Physical Society (APS)
and the American Association of Physics Teachers to mobilize interested
scientists and engineers to assist local school districts as they implement
systemic reform of elementary science education. This series of week long
workshops over three years will prepare scientists to become effective partners
in the reform of elementary science education on both a strategic/planning and
tactical/implementation level. In addition, the education division of the
American Physical Society will help to broker these scientists with school
districts who need their support. Other shorter workshops in this series will be
supported by the Society. Cost sharing will be 68% of the NSF funds.
