Dr. Daniel Rabinovich, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina -
Charlotte, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Program of the Chemistry Division to study Tetrahedral Nickel Thiolate
Complexes. The goal of the project is to develop models of the nickel site in
[NiFe] hydrogenases, a group of bacterial metalloenzymes that catalyze the
reversible oxidation of dihydrogen to protons. In order to obtain data on
species that closely resemble the architecture of the active site in [NiFe]
hydrogenases a series of tetrahedral nickel complexes having a single terminal
thiolate group will be synthesized and characterized. In order to stabilize
these compounds, sterically demanding tripodal ancillary ligands will be
employed. The reactivity of these complexes will be studied with regards to
protonation and alkylation reactions, redox chemistry, and the production of
thioesters.

The compounds studied in this project are significant because of their relevance
to the properties of nickel in biological systems. The results of the research
will refine our understanding of the relationship between molecular geometry and
reactivity in [NiFe] hydrogenases. This project will provide a meaningful
research experience to students with a variety of backgrounds, interests, and
abilities. This will include high school, undergraduate, and masters level
students. A number of these students will be women and/or from underrepresented
groups.
