This project is a three year program that will provide teacher enhancement to
150 elementary and secondary school teachers from Long Island, New York. The
project which will have a strong minority focus, consists of five components:
three week summer institutes for elementary teachers and secondary biology
teachers; research experiences in biological sciences for secondary teachers;
videotaped exchange sessions between master teachers and less experienced
teachers (both elementary and secondary); seminars and workshops during the
school year on issues in science and science teaching for secondary teachers;
and a teachers network for science teachers in high minority school districts.
The summer institutes will be held at SUNY - Old Westbury. The first year
institute, for secondary teachers, will address conceptual and pedagological
issues in Neurobiology. The second year institute, also for secondary teachers,
will focus on local ecology and related environmental issues. The third
institute, for elementary teachers will provide basic knowledge in the natural
sciences and introduce the method of conceptual change as a means of introducing
scientific concepts into the elementary classroom. Cost sharing equals 6.7% of
the NSF award.
