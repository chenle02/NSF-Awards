This action funds a National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship for FY 2012. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in
a host laboratory for the Fellow to focus her studies in plant genomics with an
emphasis on quantitative genetics, modern breeding approaches, and
bioinformatics. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship
to Malia A. Gehan is "Improving Environmental Stress Tolerance in the Grass
Model, Brachypodium distachyon." The host institution for the fellowship is the
Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Todd
Mockler.

This project focuses on temperature perception and stress (cold and heat) under
circadian regulation in Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant for wheat and
other important food and biofuel crops. The specific aims include 1)
transcriptional profiling of B. distachyon across a range of stress and sub-
optimal temperatures; 2) prioritizing transcription factor genes for
misexpression in B. distachyon by filtering differentially expressed genes found
in Objective 1 by their circadian patterns; 3) assessing the responses of
misexpression lines to various abiotic stresses; and 4) identifying additional
targets of temperature-responsive genes using yeast one-hybrid, ChIP-seq, and
microarrays to develop comprehensive gene networks. Training objectives include
bioinformatics and plant genomics. Broader impacts include capacity-building and
advanced training for students from the United States to engage in
interdisciplinary research in plant improvement and associated sciences such as
physiology, quantitative genetics, and computational biology. Outreach focuses
on developing an online-accessible teaching module based on this research.
Assessments and improvements of the teaching module, made throughout the
duration of this fellowship, will be documented online.
