The 10th International Symposium on Computer Arithmetic will be held June 26
through June 28, 1991 in Grenoble, France. The Symposium Chairman is Dr. Jean-
Michel Muller of LIP-IMAG. This international symposium is the tenth in a series
and the third to be held outside the U.S. It is crucial to U.S. researchers to
be able to attend this symposium. Travel funds requested in this proposal will
allow more U.S. researchers to participate in the symposium, to present research
results, and to exchange research ideas with their European colleagues.
