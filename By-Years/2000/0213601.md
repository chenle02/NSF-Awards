This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the
novel application of cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to determine the
carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide emitting from deep-sea hydrothermal
vents. Although, this isotope ratio has recently been identified as an indicator
of biological activity, the currently used analytical methods are expensive and
inaccurate. The aim of this Phase I proposal is to design a portable cavity-
enhanced absorption spectroscopy system to accurately determine isotope ratios
of deep-sea samples in situ. Preliminary results suggest that the system can
determine isotope ratios to better than 0.1 percent, which is sufficient to
determine the presence of biological activity.

This effort will provide an accurate determination of carbon isotope ratios in
an inexpensive, portable device. It will also have significant commercial impact
in medical diagnostics, the petroleum industry, and environmental monitoring.
Projected sales of the ratiometer in the former two areas alone are expected to
exceed $65M over the next five years. Moreover, the proposed prototype can be
readily modified to monitor various industrial gases, further increasing its
commercial impact.
