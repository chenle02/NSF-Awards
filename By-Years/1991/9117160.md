This grant is to support a symposium to be co-sponsored by the Developmental
and Structural Section of the Botanical Society of America at its annual meeting
in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Biological
Sciences in Honolulu, HI, 9-13 August 1992. The goal of the symposium is to
present an overview of the current knowledge of root development and structure
and to stimulate research on plant roots. Topics will include gene expression
patterns related to cell and tissue differentiation in root apical meristems and
tissues, cell cycle regulation, root cell and organ elongation related to plant
growth regulators, graviperception, root apical meristem organization, and
control of differentiation processes. The presenters will also discuss technical
and protocol advancements which have helped to elucidate their research
problems, and they will discuss the importance of their research within the
world of plant biology.
