The research project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Xiaodan Yu, MD,
PhD, Professor of Pediatrics, at Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University
in Shanghai, China. The project will apply novel statistical methods developed
from the researcher?s biostatistics dissertation research to an ongoing study of
children?s environmental health in Shandong, China. The dataset complements the
researcher?s dissertation research, in which the researcher has developed a
novel, computationally efficient statistical model to flexibly study the time-
varying exposures of chemical mixtures and their effects on health, as well as
identify critical exposure windows of chemical mixtures. The researcher will
refine the statistical method through analysis of the dataset, develop subject-
matter insights through analysis, and develop an open-source software package to
bring the statistical method to a wider research community.

The project aims to analyze data from an ongoing study of children?s
environmental health in Shandong, China, in which investigators have followed
mother-infant pairs in Shandong over time and recorded children?s exposures to
heavy metals and other chemicals, and collected neurodevelopmental health
outcomes. A statistical method, called Mean Field Variational Bayes for Lagged
Kernel Machine Regression, which was developed by the researcher, will be
applied to analysis to study the cognitive effects of exposure to mixtures of
chemicals during early child development. The researcher also aims to develop an
open-source software package to bring ease of use of the statistical model to a
wider environmental health research community.

This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and
China?s Ministry of Science and Technology.
