The focus of the proposed study is to characterize the gene regulation networks
underlying notochord differentiation in a simple chordate, the ascidian Ciona
intestinalis. The research plan includes three specific aims. First, the Snail
repressor appears to inhibit notochord differentiation in the presumptive tail
muscles. This will be tested by misexpressing both wild-type and mutant forms of
the Snail protein in electroporated embryos using defined tissue-specific
enhancers. Second, two different target genes of the Brachyury activator, Ezrin
and Meg1, have been implicated in mediating cell shape changes during notochord
differentiation. The activities of the encoded proteins will be investigated by
expressing different dominant-negative forms of the proteins in the notochord.
The third line of research will explore the basis of T box specificity, whereby
related T-containing transcription factors control the differentiation of
distinct tissues. Particular efforts will focus on Brachyury and Tbx6, which
regulate distinct sets of target genes in the notochord and tail muscles,
respectively.
