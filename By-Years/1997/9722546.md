9722546 Yuan A basic goal of physics is to explain the workings of the natural
universe with the most simple, elegant theory possible. In addition, a good
theory must also make concrete predictions that can be tested by experiments. In
these regards, the standard model of particle physics has been an outstanding
success. However, there are certain questions that the standard model cannot
address, the most basic of which is the origin of the particle masses. To go
beyond the standard model, we need input from new high energy colliders, such as
the Large Hadron Collider, which is currently under construction in Europe. In
this project the group at MSU and colleagues at Tsinghua University, Beijing,
will study the problem of mass generation, and how it can be probed by these new
colliders. Theoretical arguments predict that new physics must arise at these
high energies. In this project, both specific models will be used as well as
model-independent analyses to show how the data can shed light on the more
complete theory. Both groups bring complementary expertise to bear on the
problem; both groups will involve graduate students in the research programs.
