Mobile animals often move through complex environments on regular migratory
routes between their shelters, feeding places, and breeding sites. The
mechanisms underlying such migrations are poorly understood. Coral-reef fishes
that migrate daily between different places in one local area offer an
outstanding opportunity to study these mechanisms. The doctoral-dissertation
research of Anthony I. Mazeroll will investigate the mechanisms underlying the
local daily migrations of brown surgeonfish during the summer spawning season in
the northern Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba, Israel). Mr. Mazeroll will conduct
experiments designed to reveal the roles of learning, memory, and cognitive maps
in these migratory movements. This research will provide valuable information
about the various factors influencing local migrations of animals. It will also
reveal details about the abilities of animals to learn and remember physical
features of their environments, and will thereby contribute to a small but
important body of knowledge about the role of learning in natural populations.
