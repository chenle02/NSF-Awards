This award provides partial support for the international conference "Geometry
and Topology of Singularities", held in Budapest, at the Alfred Renyi Institute
of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, May 27-31, 2019. The
objective of the meeting is to bring together senior and junior researchers and
interested PhD students from all over the world to present and discuss old
problems, new developments and current research perspectives in the areas of
algebraic geometry, singularity theory and low dimensional topology. The
international meeting and networking opportunity provided by the conference will
contribute to the dissemination of scientific results in different countries,
among young researchers and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Singularity theory studies the classification problems of non-generic
situations of functions, maps, and spaces. It lies in the crossroads of
geometry, algebra, and topology. Ever since its emergence in the second half of
the 20th century it benefited from its central role, connecting methods and
notions between different areas. The invited plenary lectures given by prominent
mathematicians whose work has special connections to that of Andras Nemethi will
cover many faces of singularity theory, such as differential topology, geometry,
algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, enumerative geometry, as well as
the global theory of singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information can be
