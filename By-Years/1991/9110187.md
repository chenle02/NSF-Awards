This proposal will develop algorithms, based on constrained optimization, for
removing blur from or sharpening star field intensity, and will evaluate the
performance of these new algorithms through analytical and comparative studies.
The novelty of this approach lies in the use of the 1p quasinorm (p &lt; 1) for
measuring image sparseness in the optimization constraint(s).
