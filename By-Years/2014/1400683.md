This award is made as part of the FY 2014 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and
training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including
applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring
scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Aaron M. Silberstein
is "New Techniques in Anabelian Geometry and Applications to Algebraic Cycles
and Rigidity in Complex Algebraic Geometry." The host institution for the
fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr.
Madhav Nori.
