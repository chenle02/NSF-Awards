The principal objective of this project is a detailed understanding of the
origin of magnetospheric plasma waves and the influences these waves have on the
dynamical behavior of trapped magnetospheric particles. The path integrated
growth rate and damping mechanisms for plasma waves will be studied in realistic
model environments using a hot ray tracing code. This will establish the
conditions for significant wave gain and the effectiveness of energy transfer,
via the waves, to other components of the plasma. New codes will be developed to
evaluate the rates of pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion of resonant
radiation belt particles with each important class of wave. Quantitative
calculations will be made of the rate of particle precipitation loss to the
atmosphere and of the time-scale for stochastic acceleration under different
levels of geomagnetic activity. The time-scales for loss and local acceleration
will be incorporated into a radial diffusion code, to model the structure of the
electron radiation belts and their variability during geomagnetic activity. The
excitation of plasma waves and their effect on energetic ion and electron losses
will be examined as will the mechanisms responsible for acceleration of
energetic electrons to relativistic energies during magnetic storms. The project
will lead to a global understanding of dynamics of the ring current during
magnetic storms. A synoptic model of the wave-particle processes will be
developed for future integration into a Geospace General Circulation Model.
