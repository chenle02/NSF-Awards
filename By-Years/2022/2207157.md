This award provides partial funding for the Space Weather Workshop to be held in
Boulder, Colorado or online in April 2022. The annual Space Weather Workshop,
supported by NOAA, NASA, and NSF, has been our nation’s premier meeting on this
topic since 1996. It brings together researchers, infrastructure operators, and
policymakers to share actionable information on space weather, whose modeling
and prediction remains a current challenge for science and societal resilience.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Space Weather Workshop highlights the remarkably
diverse impacts of space weather on today’s technology including electric power
systems, communications, navigation, aviation, and spacecraft operations. It
explores recent scientific advances in predicting conditions in the space
environment and the breadth of space weather research to operations and
operations to research opportunities. The workshop promotes undergraduate and
graduate student participation in space weather science and gives them insights
into our nation’s space weather priorities, thus developing the next generation
of space weather professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
