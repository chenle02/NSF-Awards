This grant will provide for the initiation of a new National Research Council
(NRC) activity, a Board on Engineering Education. The Board will be one of the
major units of the NRC with oversight jointly provided by the Commission on
Engineering and Technical Systems and the Office of Scientific and Engineering
Personnel. The primary purpose of the Board will be to provide a continuing
capability to assess the environment for engineering education in the United
States and to develop strategies for shaping and implementing national
engineering education policies at all levels. The Board will serve as an
institutional focus at the national level that can coordinate, monitor, and
advocate action for the advancement of engineering education.
