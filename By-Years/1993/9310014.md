With this project, the precise molecular influences of supporting surfaces on
receptor association rates and binding affinities to immobilized ligands are to
be elucidated. Kinetic models of receptor binding are to be developed which
incorporate the molecular details of interactions. The kinetics and equilibrium
binding of receptors to functionalized surfaces will be studied by: (1)
evanescent fiber optic fluorescence spectroscopy; (2) quantitative fluorescence
microscopy; and (3) radiolabelling. Receptor adsoption and desorption rates and
binding affinities will be determined by evanescent fiber optic spectroscopy.
The uniformity of specific receptor binding will be assessed by fluorescence
microscopy. Binding affinities to both functionalized planar surfaces and
vesicles will be determined with radiolabelled proteins.
