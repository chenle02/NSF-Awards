9614698 Langston This research involves the use of existing teleseismic data
sets from the GSN and WWSSN to investigate the effect of 3D heterogeneity and
layered anisotropy on teleseismic waveforms. Earthquakes, as a rule, occur in
geologically interesting areas with clear evidence of structural heterogeneity.
There is evidence that near-source heterogeneity can have significant effects on
radiated teleseismic waves form earthquakes and that these effects will map back
into inverted source parameters such as the spatial/temporal distribution of
fault slip and source orientation. The frequency dependence of the near-source
effect will be investigated theoretically for proposed structure models
constrained by detailed geological and geophysical studies in the literature.
The teleseismic data from observed earthquakes will then be modeled using
forward calculation and inversion techniques to determine source parameters and
to determine the influence of heterogeneity and anisotropy. ***
