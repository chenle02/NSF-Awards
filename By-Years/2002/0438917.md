This action joins the University of Michigan with the Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Lasers and Plasma in Advanced Manufacturing in
collaboration with the Old Dominion University. The center will develop a
fundamental understanding of laser aided intelligent manufacturing to reduce
lead-time for "concept to product" for manufacturing for U.S. industries by
establishing the science base for laser materials processing along with test bed
for process development. A major outcome will be education of university
students and industrial personnel in both the basic and cross-disciplinary
science and latest technology.
