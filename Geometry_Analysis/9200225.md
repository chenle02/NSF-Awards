The PI is one of the world's leading authorities on spectral analysis/geometry
and commands a reputation for superb technical expertise. Following on from
previous work on heat equation methods, the PI will continue his work on the
nodal sets of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds and
particular boundary-value problems of Dirichlet-Neumann type.
