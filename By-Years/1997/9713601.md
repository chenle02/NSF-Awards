This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Rice University supports
the research of Professor Scott F. Singleton. The research focuses on a
molecular understanding of the strand exchange process mediated by the RecA
protein of Escherichia coli, a nucleic acid recombinase. The work formulates
specific structural and mechanistic models for the strand exchange process based
on chemical kinetic investigations into, for example, the influence of
nucleotide modifications on the kinetic parameters. Transient and steady-state
kinetic experiments are performed using DNA strands which contain nucleotide
analogs that introduce conservative changes in the stabilities and conformations
of the substrate, product, and intermediate species. The results allow
characterization of the relationships between the kinetic and thermodynamic
parameters associated with each identifiable step in the exchange process and
the physicochemical properties of the participating DNA molecules. The research
advances the a molecular level understanding of homologous genetic
recombination, a biological process important in DNA repair, replication,
regulation, and differentiation.
