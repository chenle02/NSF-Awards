Science and Mathematics for All (SMA) is a Howard University School of Education
and College of Arts and Sciences scholarship program funded by the National
Science Foundation. The program is ameliorating the shortage of qualified
science and mathematics teachers in urban, high-need areas by producing thirty
teachers with exceptional content knowledge in mathematics and the sciences. The
SMA program recruits qualified graduate students who earned undergraduate
degrees in the sciences or mathematics and who are dedicated to teaching in high
need schools in Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS). These graduate
students receive intensive summer training toward certification, are paid
tuition for twenty-one credit hours towards a Master of Arts in Teaching degree
at Howard University School of Education, and commit to a two-year teaching
contract with the partnering school district, PGCPS. SMA also provides extensive
induction support for new teachers including in-school mentors and Howard
University faculty mentors.
