` Abstract 93 53311 Bock This is a proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of
essay questions in biology designed to test the student's understanding of three
main aspects of scientific work inquiry, explanation, and confirmation. Scoring
protocols based on ratings of content knowledge and process skills will be
developed and tested for feasibility and reliability. In addition, a form of
holistic scoring based on comparative judgment rather than rating will be
investigated as a possible teacher based method of scoring essay test questions
in science. The procedures will be evaluated in a field trial associated with
the California Golden State Examination in Biology.
