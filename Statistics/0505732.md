Abstract for DMS - 0505732 PI: Professor Wing Hung Wong INSTITUTION: STANFORD
UNIVERSITY TITLE: Evolution and Energy Domain Monte Carlo algorithms and their
applications

This project will develop two new algorithms for Monte Carlo simulation and
applied them to several problems in science and technology. The first method,
called Evolutionary Monte Carlo, was introduced by the PI's laboratory under
prior NSF support. It has been applied with excellent results in challenging
problems such as the HP model in protein folding and Cp-based model selection.
Here, it is proposed that Evolutionary MC be developed for the computational
inference of network structure for directed acylic graphical models (DAG). The
second method, called equi-energy sampling, is in an early stage of development
by the PI and his collaborators. The idea is to generate samples from the equi-
energy rings each of them having the energy lying within a restricted interval
of values. An energy-temperature duality is exploited to allow the estimation of
a Boltzmann average (i.e. averages corresponding to a fixed temperature) from
estimates of the micro-canonical averages (i.e. averages within equi-energy
rings). In addition to giving estimates of Boltzmann averages, this approach
also provide estimates for the "density of states" function and the partition
function. Thus equi-energy sampling can provide information for all
thermodynamic quantities in a single run, and for this reason it should be a
very attractive algorithm in physical applications such as protein folding.

Recent development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods has allowed the
application of statistical modeling and inference to more and more application
areas. For many important applications such as DNA motif sampling, protein
folding, and statistical inference of causal network structures, Monte Carlo
computation has become an indispensable tool. The work proposed in this project
will result in significant improvement of the performance Monte Carlo algorithms
in problems with complex energy landscapes, and therefore will make it feasible
to apply this method to a wider spectrum of problems.
