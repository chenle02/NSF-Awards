In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the NSF Division of
Chemistry, Professor Aaron Aponick of the University of Florida is developing a
new class of biaryl ligands that will expand the current capabilities of state-
of-the-art chemical synthesis through improved catalysis. The fine chemical
industry has a multi-billion dollar annual market that heavily relies on
catalysis as a means of production. As such, there is a global need for the
development of new catalysts and ligands, especially for enantioselective
reactions where it is important to be able to modify the structure to finely
tune the reaction outcome. This research pursues ligand and catalyst designs
with enhanced reactivity and selectivity. The broader impacts of this work stem
from gaining an understanding of the fundamental science and application to more
advanced systems. The tools developed are widely applicable in a variety of
settings and also provide a fertile environment to train students in state-of-
the-art techniques for future academic and industrial endeavors. Chemistry Day
at a local mall--an informative and educational outreach program--will present
science in a public forum known for its wide demographics. The intention is to
break down some of the perceived barriers with science among the general public.

The proposed research aims to incorporate heterocycles, a class of compounds
that are extremely easy to prepare, into a chiral biaryl scaffold. This new
class of biaryl ligands capitalizes on an original concept for atropisomerism
whereby pi-stacking increases the barrier to rotation and enables the
incorporation of electron-rich, 5-membered ring heterocycles in chiral biaryl
ligands. The resulting ligands have different steric and electronic properties
than known ligands and are readily modified by a highly convergent preparative
route. Biaryl ligands may be able to drastically alter the catalytic properties
of a system in a predicable and tunable manner.
