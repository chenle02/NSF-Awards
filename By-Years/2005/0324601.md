NSF-CMS: Dendrimer-Based Nanocomposites for Nanotribological
Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: M.L. Weaver (Metallurgical &amp; Materials
Engineering)&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: S.C. Street
(Chemistry)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
focuses on developing a fundamental science-based understanding of the influence
of dendrimer interlayers on the nanomechanical, nanotribological, chemical, and
morphological properties of the ultrathin metal overlayer films. The
technological motivation for this research is grounded in the desire to develop
novel coatings that will increase the capability and durability of critical and
emerging engineering structures based on thin film technology such as MEMS and
NEMS (micro- and nano-elecromechanical systems) devices, and new materials for
microelectronic packaging. Furthermore, a basic understanding of the changes in
properties induced by dendrimer underlayers on films deposited with carefully
controlled grain sizes, grain morphologies, and coating thicknesses can open new
horizons in the development and application of thinner, more durable coatings.
Educational efforts include the training of graduate students from the
departments of Chemistry and Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and the
integration of undergraduate students from the freshman and sophomore classes at
The University of Alabama and from neighboring HBCU's into multidisciplinary
research activities. This will provide those students with practical laboratory
experiences above and beyond that normally associated with their academic
coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
