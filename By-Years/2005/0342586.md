The goal of this project is to design, demonstrate and evaluate a new kind of
alkaline fuel cell (AFC). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several types of fuel
cells. Among the most popular operating on H2/O2 as fuels are: the widely
researched Proton Exchange Membrane as an electrolyte (PEMFC); the alkaline fuel
cell (AFC) that uses an alkaline electrolyte; the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
that uses solid oxides as electrolytes and operates at very high temperatures
(&gt;&gt;100 oC); the phosphoric acid electrolyte fuel cell that operates at
high temperature (&gt;100 oC) and has the problem of catalyst instability; and
the molten carbonate electrolyte fuel cell that operates at very high
temperature (&gt;&gt;100 oC) and presents a problem of material stability. The
most promising candidates to operate at lower temperatures are PEMFCs and
AFCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one has demonstrated in the open literature
successful stable hydrogen-air operation of an AFC without replacement of
electrolyte (every 1000 hours of operation). The choice of AFCs solves the
problem of expensive catalysts. Therefore, to improve the performances of AFCs
when using "dirty" fuel (such as reformed methanol), the solution is to design
new electrodes that allow the AFC to run with "dirty" fuel and to optimize the
alkaline electrolyte concentration such that will yield optimal operation
outputs-high efficiency for long time by using "dirty" fuel operating at ambient
conditions (25 oC and atmospheric pressure), and with affordable materials as
catalytic metals (not highly priced metals).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will design AFC electrodes that operate with "dirty" fuel for long periods and
at high levels of efficiency, using a combination of new technology derived from
a study of chelates and of older but less-known technology derived from earlier
work at Allis-Chalmers and Exxon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
