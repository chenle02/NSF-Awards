Abstract for award DMS-0401525 of Gunnells

This proposal concerns problems in number theory, algebraic geometry, and
representation theory in three broad areas. First, the PI is focusing on topics
related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas, such as geometry of
locally symmetric spaces and their compactifications, modular curves and rings
of modular forms, and special values of L-functions. Second, he is investigating
the geometry of canonical Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine Weyl groups. Finally,
he is joining F. Hirzebruch and D. Zagier in the updating of their book, The
Atiyah-Singer theorem and elementary number theory.

This proposal deals with number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation
theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, and
is the oldest branch of mathematics. Algebraic geometry studies geometric
figures that can be defined by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.
Representation theory is the systematic study of symmetry, through the
development of simple mathematical objects that encode the fundamental
irreducible pieces of symmetry. Today the questions and phenomena addressed by
these subjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary mathematics
research. Moreover, the subjects have contributed many applications in such
diverse areas as codes and data transmission, robotics, chemistry, physics, and
theoretical computer science.
