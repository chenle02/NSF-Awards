This award, to Dr. Lisa C. Cliggett of the University of Kentucky, is to support
an international, multi-disciplinary research workshop in Lusaka, Zambia. The
workshop will bring together scholars who share a research focus on Southern
Province, Zambia, where scientists have been doing research for over half-a-
century. The workshop participants will include anthropologists, sociologists,
geographers, ecologists, and economists, from the United States, the United
Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa, Japan, and Zambia. The participants
comprise both senior scientists who have conducted research in Zambia for as
long as six decades and graduate students at the start of their careers. The
workshop is thematically organized around longitudinal population dynamics,
ecological change, agricultural trends, political integration, culture, and
responses to social stress such as relocation and epidemics. The goal of the
workshop is to take stock of what has been accomplished and to plan for the most
urgent future questions, so that research will be focused and efforts not
duplicated needlessly. The workshop's accomplishments will be summarized in
planned publications.
