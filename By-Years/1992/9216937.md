Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBPCase) is the enzyme
responsible for nearly all carbon fixation on this planet and is the major
carboxylating enzyme in the phytoplankton of the world's oceans. Additionally,
RuBPCase may play a global role in modulating one of the greenhouse gases, CO2.
Knowledge of the regulation of this enzyme is important for understanding
control of primary production in the oceans and phytoplankton response to
environmental perturbations or long term change. Dr. Paul and his collaborator,
Dr. Tabita, will focus on the molecular regulation of this enzyme in
picoplankton in coastal and oligotrophic oceanic environments. They have
recently developed a method for extraction of mRNA from phytoplankton and have
detected RuBPCase gene expression in natural populations. These biomolecular
techniques will be used to study diel and light-dependent regulation of the
RuBPCase gene in cultured Synechococcus spp. and prochlorophytes, and in natural
populations. The second objective is to identify and characterize the key
primary producers by amplifying RUBPCase mRNA for cloning and sequencing from
natural populations. Amplification of mRNA will result in clones that originated
from transcriptionally active phototrophs. Sequence data will be compared to
RuBPCase data bases to identify the active species. If novel phototrophs are
encountered, parsimony analysis will be performed to relate these forms to their
evolutionary closest relative. In summary, the project will provide fundamental
information on the control of the RuBPCase genes in response to environmental
factors and identify key phototrophic organisms in oceanic picoplankton.
