Dr. Zenderland is examining the controversies which surrounded psychological
tests of "intelligence" during the decade in which they were first introduced
into American society (1908-1918). She focuses on the work of psychologist H. H.
Goddard, America's first intelligence tester, as he disseminated these new
mental measuring devices into hospitals, prisons, courtrooms, and schoolrooms in
the years before World War I. Her research is based on the published and
unpublished papers of psychologists, biologists, physicians, and educators most
active in these early testing debates. She argues that the earliest American
promoters and critics of intelligence testing cannot simply be dichotomized as
believers in "nature" or "nurture"; instead, their work needs to be explained
within a multidimensional context emphasizing a range of scientific,
professional, and political controversies of the progressive period. To carry
out this research, she is examining papers on this topic at the Archives of the
History of American Psychology. The study resulting from this grant will be both
the first biography of Goddard and the first detailed examination of the
intelligence testing movement in its early years in America. As the debates
about the nature of "intelligence" continue to this day, this project promises
significant contributions in placing the debate's origins in proper perspective.
