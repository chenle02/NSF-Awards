The overall focus of this research is to apply scattering techniques to examine
the phase behavior and kinetics of order-disorder and order-order phase
transitions in multiblock copolymers in selective solvents using small angle
neutron scattering (SANS), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), and computer simulation methods. A major focus of this
research will be to use synchrotron based time-resolved SAXS to follow the time
evolution of structural features, and relate them to theoretical models of
nucleation and growth kinetics of disorder-order transitions and of transitions
between different ordered states. We will also initiate preliminary studies
using AFM imaging to characterize the surface morphology of films of these
micro-phase separated materials. The proposed research will provide detailed
insight into the kinetics of the phase separation mechanisms involved in these
different transitions, as well as in the mechanisms involved in the growth of
micelles themselves.

An understanding of the phase behavior of multiblock copolymer solutions and
gels is important to their numerous applications in materials science and
technology. An exciting potential application is to use them as templates for
nanolithography of solid state devices. The proposed AFM and SAXS studies of
block copolymer films have direct relevance to the potential application of
these films in nanolithography. The research will also lead to advances in
designing and building specialized components for use at beam line facilities
and data analysis programs with a wide range of applicability. The proposed
studies will lead to the Ph. D dissertations of two graduate students (including
one female American student) and provide research opportunities for
undergraduates. The project also involves international collaboration with
scientists in Czech Republic.
