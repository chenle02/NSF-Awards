This award from the Academic Research infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at San Diego State University acquire a 400 MHz NMR
spectrometer which will be used in research. The research activity to be
supported includes the transmetallation of organic groups between boron and
metals, designing new helical metal ligand systems for use as asymmetric
catalysts, the synthesis of bromofluoroalkanes, studying the electrochemistry of
redox-dependent receptors of organic molecules, and hormonally- regulated
integral membrane ecto-ATPase. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize
specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers and
catalysis, and in biology.
