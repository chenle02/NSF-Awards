Ashbaugh DMS-9500968 The research that Ashbaugh will conduct concerns finding
optimal bounds for the eigenvalues of the classical partial differential
operators arising in mathematical physics and differential geometry. Specific
examples include Rayleigh's conjecture for the lowest eigenvalue of the clamped
plate for all dimensions, and the Payne-Polya-Weinberger conjecture on the ratio
of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an arbitrary bounded domain in
Euclidean n-space. Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical
modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is not so much
to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions. This may include answers to questions about
uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often develops methods
for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
approximations.
