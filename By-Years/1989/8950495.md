The Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) is used to introduce undergraduate
chemistry students to an important instrumental technique for material
characterization. The DSC is used in an already established course in organic
chemistry and is also used in a newly developed advanced integrated laboratory
course in analytical, inorganic and physical chemistry. Students in the senior
thesis program use the DSC to study the structure- function relationships in
biomembranes. This DSC exposes our undergraduate chemistry students to modern
equipment similar to that which they experience in industry or graduate school.
The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
