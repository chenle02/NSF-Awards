The investigator studies the continuous-time fractionally-integrated
&lt;br/&gt;Auto-Regressive Moving-Average processes and their variants, based
on&lt;br/&gt;recent advances in stochastic calculus of fractional Brownian
motion.&lt;br/&gt;Such models provide a general framework for analyzing
univariate or &lt;br/&gt;multivariate discrete-time data sampled from an
underlying &lt;br/&gt;strongly-dependent continuous-time process. In particular,
the &lt;br/&gt;investigator develops methods for studying volatility, fractional
&lt;br/&gt;co-integration and temporal aggregation of long-memory
time&lt;br/&gt;series data. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Time series data are data
collected sequentially over time, and &lt;br/&gt;they abound in science and
other fields, e.g., finance.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies new methods for
analyzing time series data&lt;br/&gt;with long-memory temporal patterns. The
developed methodologies furnish &lt;br/&gt;general tools for analyzing changes
in the volatility pattern in the data, &lt;br/&gt;exploring structural
relationships within a set of time series data, and &lt;br/&gt;assessing effects
of aggregating the data over longer observational periods.&lt;br/&gt;These
methods have applications in various fields, e.g., pricing of
financial&lt;br/&gt;derivatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
