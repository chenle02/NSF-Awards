A workshop on coping with complexity will be held in January, 1990 on the
campus of the University of California at San Diego. The purpose of this
workshop is to bring together a group of researchers to reflect on the current
state of the subject (how to deal with NP-complete problems), discuss possible
future directions for research, and to work intensively together on specific
problems.
