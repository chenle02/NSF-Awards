This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic
Chemistry Program, deals with the mechanistic based development of catalysts for
alkane carbonylation and the reverse process, aldehyde decarbonylation. Several
approaches to the development of catalytic systems will be studied including
novel radical-based photochemical and thermal systems, photochemically activated
trans-carbonylchloro- bis(trimethylphosphine)rhodium(I), and other thermally
activated compounds of rhodium and ruthenium. Both experi- mental and
theoretical approaches to catalyst design will be utilized. %%% Selective
functionalization of hydrocarbons under mild conditions remains as one of the
most significant, but elusive, goals of modern chemistry. The technological
implications of selective, and energy-efficient reactions of hydrocarbons are
enormous. Recent discoveries by organo- metallic chemists have indicated that
certain transition metal complexes will react with hydrocarbons under mild
conditions. This project will attempt to extend these earlier studies to
generate catalytic cycles in which metallated hydrocarbons react with carbon
monoxide to produce aldehydes, which can serve as precursors to a wide variety
of other types of compounds.
