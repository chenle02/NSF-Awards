This NSF award aims to address foundational questions in quantum information
regarding entropy inequalities such as the monotonicity of quantum relative
entropy and strong subadditivity. These entropy inequalities are at the core of
quantum information and more generally physics, underlying various capacities of
quantum communication channels, entropic uncertainty principles, and certain
formulations of the second law of thermodynamics. PI Wilde and collaborators
have recently established the strongest refinements of these entropy
inequalities in the 40 years since Lieb, Ruskai, and Lindblad proved them in the
1970s and in the 30 years since Petz characterized their equality conditions in
the 1980s. These refinements have interpretations in terms of recoverability and
Markovianity in certain setups to which the original entropy inequalities
apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, armed with these new theorems and other
tools, will address fundamental questions regarding recoverability and
Markovianity in quantum systems. These questions have been awaiting answers
before the refined entropy inequalities were available. Since the use of quantum
relative entropy is so widespread all throughout quantum information, there is a
vast territory to explore in terms of recoverability and Markovianity, which may
lead to fundamental insights into the nature of quantum information. The work
developed with this NSF award may also influence other areas of physics, given
that Markovianity and recoverability are such fundamental notions permeating all
of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this proposal is in line
with the NSF Mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the
national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and
for other purposes." Indeed, research at the intersection of physics, computer
science, and mathematics has advanced science in remarkable ways, pushing the
limits of what is possible in principle and in practice. A major goal of this
proposal is to enhance the training of graduate students at LSU.
