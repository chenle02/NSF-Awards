Proposal Number: CTS-0102747&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: S.
Majetich&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie Mellon U.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Coated
Monodisperse Magnetic
Nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
project is on fabrication of well-ordered coated monodispersed Fe nanoparticle
arrays with enhanced magnetic and electronic coupling between particles. This
will result in collective phenomena such as exchange ferromagnetism, insulator-
to-metal transition, and extremely large magnetoresistance. The PI is focusing
her effort in this project on preparation of ultrathin but impermeable coatings
on Fe nanoparticles, precise control over interparticle spacing, nanoscale
structure-property relationships and their correlation to larger length
scales.&lt;br/&gt;
