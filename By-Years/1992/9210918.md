Human-machine interaction is a critical component of complex, highly automated
systems such as space shuttle ground control and flexible manufacturing systems.
In such systems, typically a team of human operators acts as supervisory
controllers: monitoring data, adjusting parameters, and detecting, diagnosing,
and compensating for failures. In the past, most research efforts in this area
have focused on a single human operator: modeling one operator's interaction
with a complex system; designing single- user displays, and so forth. With the
advent of knowledge-based technology, more "intelligent" tools are appearing in
the context of monitoring and supervisory control. Still, such tools are
designed for use by a single operator. The intent of this project is to build
models and methods to support cooperation between human supervisory controllers
and between humans and "intelligent associate systems" in supervisory control.
Specifically, the three objectives of the proposed are to: 1) Develop a
framework for modeling distributed supervisory control; 2) Develop prototype
knowledge-based tools based on the modeling framework; and 3) Apply the modeling
framework and collaborative knowledge-based tool design concepts to supervisory
control environment: satellite ground control at NASA Goddard Space Flight
Center.
