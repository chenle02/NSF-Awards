Summary: This project will determine subsurface reservoir ages of waters around
New Zealand by dating planktonic and benthic foraminifers associated with
tephras in marine cores. The study will focus on dating samples associated with
the Kawakawa tephra (ca 22,590 14C yr). The Kawakawa ash is easily identified
and is widely distributed which will allow dating of intermediate and deep
waters along the tephra isochron. Trace element measurements on foraminifer
shells and stable carbon isotope measurements will also be done as a cross check
on circulation changes derived from the 14C age distribution.&lt;br/&gt;
