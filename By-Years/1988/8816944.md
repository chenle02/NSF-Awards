The Mojave Desert occupies an important position in models for the geologic
evolution of the southwestern United States during the Mesozoic and Tertiary.
These models have been difficult to test because the nature of Mesozoic and
Cenozoic deformation of the Mojave block is poorly known. This work, in
collaboration with workers at the University of North Carolina and the
University of Kansas, will address the extent, kinematics and timing of
deformation at three localities in the Mojave - the Cronese Hills, Alvord
Mountain and Waterman Hills. Results will help provide constraints on Mesozoic
compression and Cenozoic extension in this region.
