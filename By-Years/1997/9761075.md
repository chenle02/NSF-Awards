This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
thermal neutron detector from boron phosphide (10BP) that will combine the high
boron density of a solid with the efficient creation of large response to the
neutron interactions. The new detectors will be rugged, compact, highly
sensitive to thermal neutrons, relatively insensitive to gamma radiation, fast,
and capable of low bias operation. Phase I will develop the innovative technique
of MOCVD growth of high quality BP films on graded composition Gap substrates.
Films will be grown to thicknesses of several tens of microns and examined for
physical structure. After fabrication into detectors, the basic electrical
properties will be tested at Spire and then the detectors will be sent to Sandia
National Laboratory for radiation testing. Phase II will extend the technology
for optimized detector performance and thicker film deposition for greater
sensitivity. The overall goal is to achieve a highly neutron sensitive
semiconductor detector that is compact, versatile, and potentially capable of
imaging applications. The proposed research effort will result in high
efficiency, boron phosphide thin film thermal neutron detectors. Their compact
size and low voltage operation will make them aptly suited to replace cur-rent
gas or scintillator detectors that need to operate portably or under constrained
conditions. The novel design of these detectors will also find extended uses in
neutron radiography and dosimetry, environmental monitoring, nuclear
nonproliferation, and monitoring reactor operations.
