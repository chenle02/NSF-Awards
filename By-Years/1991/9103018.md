Professor Milne will work on Shimura varieties. He hopes to extend the results
on the conjugation of Shimura varieties to mixed Shimura varieties; to extend
the proof of the conjecture of Langlands and Rapapport from Shimura varieties of
PEL-type to other Shimura varieties. He also hopes to see whether the properties
conjecturally defined by motives hold. This project falls into the general area
of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
