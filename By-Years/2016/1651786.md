This study seeks to investigate the relative roles of downdrafts and surface
rotation in the "seed" formation of rotation in tornadoes. This research will
lead to explanations of the fundamental processes that lead to the formation of
tornadoes in different situations. Specifically, the role of surface friction
will be quantified using several numerical simulations as well as different
realizations of friction parameterizations. In addition to the training of
graduate students, this study will engage the public through radio segments
discussing the research and severe weather in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
investigate these problems, a vorticity decomposition technique will be applied
to high-resolution full-physics simulations of thunderstorms as well as to
idealized downdraft simulations. The research will apply a vorticity
decomposition technique along trajectories to idealized numerical simulations.
The mathematical treatment of the problem will introduce aspects of differential
geometry into the severe storms community and offer a new perspective on the
formal description of vortex dynamics.
