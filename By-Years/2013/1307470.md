This proposal is concerned with the development of an analytic/geometric theory
of random fields, primarily those that arise from stochastic PDEs [SPDEs].
Special emphasis is placed on two extremal universality classes of SPDEs that
are driven by fully non-linear multiplicative noise. The Investigators have
developed ideas, based in geometric-measure theory, for the analysis of non-
Markovian Gaussian and stable random fields. And they have introduced renewal-
theoretic and coupling techniques for the asymptotic analysis of solutions to a
large class of nonlinear SPDEs. They plan to continue their investigation of
precise quantitative connections between random fields, potential theory,
stochastic PDEs, and the geometry of random fractals. And they believe that
further pursuit of these connections will ultimately yield novel insights into
the structure of random fields, physical multifractals, and related stochastic
PDEs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic PDEs and random fields play a central role
in various areas of pure and applied mathematics, mathematical oceanography,
stochastic hydrology, geostatistics, mathematical physics and other scientific
areas. It is significant and challenging to characterize the fine local and
asymptotic structures of SPDEs and related random fields. The Investigators
believe that the proposed research will have sufficient novelty to solve a
number of long-standing open problems in the theory of stochastic PDEs and
related random fields, and also further promote their applicability in various
scientific areas. Moreover, the proposed activities will also help to train
graduate students and to develop their careers in the mathematical and
statistical sciences.
