Karin Ruhlandt-Senge, Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, is supported
by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for her work
with organometallic complexes of calcium, strontium and barium. Sigma-bonded
alkyls, aryls and thiolates can be prepared and studied by using ancillary
ligands that can stabilize these large, highly electrophilic metal centers. One
important goal of this work is to obtain details about the ionic or covalent
character of the metal-carbon or metal-sulfur bond and to investigate periodic
trends down the alkaline earth family. Another goal is to exploit the unique
reactivity of these complexes to prepare desirable organic structures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental studies of bonding and reactivity of these
alkaline earth compounds will lead to an increased understanding of the
organometallic chemistry of these relatively unexplored metals. In addition,
undergraduate and graduate students involved in the work will learn valuable
skills in synthesis, characterization and catalysis by studying these reactive
species.&lt;br/&gt;
