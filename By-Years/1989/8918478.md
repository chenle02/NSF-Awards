This research concerns the interactions between ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
subsp. scopulorum) and four species that feed upon it. These include the Abert
squirrel (Sciurus aberti), the porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), the dwarf
mistletoe (Arceuthobium vaginatum) and the bark beetle (Dendroctonus
ponderosae). Researchers will compare trees that are fed upon by one (or two) of
these species to trees that are left alone. The comparisons involve biochemical
and morphological features of phloem and xylem, growth and reproduction, and
genetic constitution of damaged and undamaged trees. The primary purpose of the
research is to test the hypothesis that each of the four species selects
different ponderosa pine individuals. Results will provide a test of the idea
that herbivores and parasites can create diversifying selection within plant
populations. The project will act as a pilot study to allow the investigators to
analyze existing data and perform trials to gather preliminary, `proof-of-
concept' data. This information will facilitate the development of a full-scale
project using the ponderosa pine system.
