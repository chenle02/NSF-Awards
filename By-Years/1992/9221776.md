El Nino (ENSO) events occur periodically and vary greatly in both intensity and
spatial magnitude. ENSOs are characterized by local increases in water
temperature, sea level elevation and reduce water column nutrients. Despite
these biologically significant features, and especially considering their
influence on pelagic assemblages and coral reef ecosystems, the impact of ENSOs
on mid- to high-latitude, nearshore benthic assemblages remains ambiguous. The
rocky intertidal assemblage characteristic of the exposed coast of Washington
State has been experiencing ENSO conditions since at least January 1992. Dr.
Paine will examine how changes in nutrients availability effect algal
productivity, recruitment and growth. A relative new technique will be employed
using terra cotta flower pots. In a balanced, replicated design, some pots will
be filled with nutrient-rich materials, some protected from benthic grazers by
anti-fouling paint and others left untreated. Comparison between treatments
should allow a statistical analysis of the influences of terrestrial inputs,
nutrients and grazers on algal productivity. Repetition in a non-ENSO year will
identify the possible contribution of water column recruitment of three kelp
species.
