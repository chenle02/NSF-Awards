This award supports participation in a meeting on mathematical logic, titled a
Very Informal Gathering of Logicians, held February 1-3, 2019, at the University
of California, Los Angeles. This is the twentieth in a series of biennial logic
meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid-1970s, has been one of the most
important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast.

The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss
important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on
scientific projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards
for graduate students and early-career researchers. Sharing of information among
meeting participants will have a positive impact on their research and teaching.
The meeting's webpage is at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~ineeman/Conf/VIG2019/

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
