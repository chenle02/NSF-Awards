Long Island University will conduct a three-year program for 900 middle and
secondary school mathematics teachers in New York. This project, called "Fellows
for the Advancement of Mathematics Education2 (FAME2)", builds on a highly
successful and widely replicated NSF project FAME that has been ongoing over the
past three years. Participants are Fellows (leaders) and the middle group of
teachers considered as possible future Fellows. Enhancement activities will
include training of under-prepared teachers by the Fellows. The Fellows will
serve as school building leaders and form mathematics resource teams, with
responsibilities for inservice and parent training, pupil assessment,
promulgating the Standards, curriculum development, recruitment, and the
selection and training of under-prepared teachers. The project includes the
development of a network of schools, universities, and educational agencies. The
project includes features designed to increase the participation of under-
represented groups in mathematics. Long Island University and the participating
districts are contributing an amount equal to 90% of the NSF request.
