The study of fundamental defects in amorphous semiconductors is to be undertaken
in four general areas of activity. The proposed work will investigate the nature
of the D defect in its different relaxed and unrelaxed states using spin
transient measurements and in intrinsic a-Si:H using capacitive transient
methods. Doping multilayers will be investigated to study contamination effects
and electron trapping into thin regions of the lower gap material. The nature of
the c-Si/a-Si:H interface will be examined to understand the effects of the
substrate on the a-Si:H electronic structure in the near interface region. The
distribution of interface defects will be correlated with ESR and opitcal
generation studies. The defect density will be determined in semiconducting
transition metal chalcogenides to help develop samples with optimized electronic
properties.
