The University of Hawaii's Outreach College will continue management of the 26th
and 27th Dissertations Symposium in Chemical Oceanography (DISCO), a conference
originally begun in 1978. These symposia provide recently graduated or soon to
graduate, PhD level chemical oceanographers with an opportunity to present their
dissertation research in front of their peers, and forge professional
relationships that will facilitate their future research and academic careers.
The meeting will also offer participants the opportunity to interact with their
peers in physical oceanography given the Physical Oceanography Dissertation
Symposium will run concurrently with DISCO. Attendees engage in discussions with
agency personnel to better understand funding mechanisms, proposal writing
strategies, and how to request shiptime. DISCO XXVI and DISCO XXVII will be held
in Kona, Hawaii in October 7-11, 2018 and October 4-8, 2020, respectively.
Applicants eligible for participation in a given DISCO meeting are those
individuals who have received their doctoral degrees in ocean chemistry within
one year preceding the symposium or who are certified by the degree-granting
institution as graduating within one year after that symposium. An applicant
pool will be developed for the meetings following announcement of the symposia
to chemical oceanographers at academic institutions and via websites such as
GEOTRACES and Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry Program. From this pool, agency
personnel, as well as the invited speaker will select the invitees. This
symposium is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. As in previous years, the
DISCO Symposia will aid in furthering the professional development of early
career chemical oceanographers, both U.S. and international, who will play a
critical role in improving our understanding of ocean and earth science
processes.
