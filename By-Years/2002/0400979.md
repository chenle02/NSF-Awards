The PI proposes to organize a multi-disciplinary symposium that will examine the
roles that learning and instruction can play in how people reason with data: the
kinds of representations they form, their understandings of measurement, of
statistical noise, of graphical displays, and how they understand and use data
to explain phenomena and make decisions. The proposed symposium will be the
first of its kind to bring such a diverse group of junior and senior researchers
together to forge common ground. It will allow them to exchange state-of-the-art
work from their different disciplines, to seek converging results and common
principles, and to discover research needs or gaps based on current work. At
present, work in the disciplines of developmental psychology, statistics,
decision analysis, and science and math education proceed with little
interaction or sharing of insights. One of the focuses of the symposium is to
bring current theoretical insights to bear on practice (in business and in the
schools), as well as to make insights derived from the field available across
field boundaries in order to allow it to advance the theoretical work.
