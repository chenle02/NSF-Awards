This award provides funding for an investigation of the normal subgroup
structure of groups of rational points of algebraic groups over general as well
as over special (primarily, global) fields. The principal investigator attempts
to prove a new conjecture on solvability of finite quotients of the groups of
rational points of simple algebraic groups over arbitrary infinite fields. He
also plans to analyze finite quotients of the multiplicative group of a finite
dimensional division algebra in order to obtain their reasonable classification.
Another central problem is investigation of the Margulis-Platonov conjecture for
special unitary groups over global fields. The principal investigator
collaborates on these problems with Gopal Prasad, Yoav Segev and Gary Seitz. He
also plans to work with Gopal Prasad on a joint book project in the congruence
subgroup problem.

Questions related to the normal subgroup structure of linear groups have
historical roots in the 19th century (Galois, Jordan, Dixon), and have been an
area of active research in the 20th century. Recently, new techniques for
analyzing this problem for anisotropic groups over general fields have been
discovered in the joint work of the principal investigator with Y.Segev and
G.Seitz. These techniques enable one to investigate groups over general fields
using methods of the theory of valuations, which were previously used only in
the number-theoretic setting of global fields. This approach fits into the
general area of investigation of the congruence subgroup problem, which is
connected with other fundamental problems in number theory, currently applied in
data transmission, data processing and communication systems.
