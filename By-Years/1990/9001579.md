The stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) is an issue of immediate
global importance because the ice sheet contains enough water to raise sea level
over 5 meters. If the ice sheet experiences a rapid collapse, the accompanying
rapid rise in sea level will have dire consequences along coastlines worldwide.
The urgency of assessing the stability of the WAIS is fueled by the recent
discoveries made by the Siple Coast Project (SCP) of significant changes taking
place in West Antarctica. However, the SCP has had a glaciological focus and has
not properly assessed the important meteorological and oceanic effects. which
play a major role in determining the behavior of the ice sheet and its impact on
global climate. What is needed is a multi-disciplinary study of the WAIS where
studies in all relevant disciplines are conducted. A plan to integrate these
separate investigations is a necessary first step to achieving the goal of
understanding the global role of the WAIS and its stability. What is proposed
here is to bring together experts from the important polar disciplines for a
workshop to formulate a rational plan for the study of the WAIS. The acronym
SEARISE (Stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Environment) has been chosen
for this program because it provides an identifiable focus of public concern.
