The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation â€“
Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project addresses deteriorating air quality in
urban areas and increased energy demand. The proposed core technology is a new
thermodynamic power cycle for power generation with high efficiency, while
producing no air pollutants. This new technology will offer an affordable and
reliable power source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project addresses the
challenge faced by the power sector regarding the intermittency of renewable
energy: an increasing demand for cost-competitive, clean dispatchable power.
This new demand can be met by a breakthrough in power generation technology
called the Argon Power Cycle (APC). This project will conduct experimental and
theoretical studies to demonstrate this technology's capability to deliver
higher energy conversion efficiencies through the engineering and assembly of a
laboratory argon power cycle prototype, design and development of dedicated
controls, and integration of membrane gas separation
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
