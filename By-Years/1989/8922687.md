Syntactic and structural pattern recognition methods emphasize formal models of
image or signal content. This workshop, under the auspices of the International
Association for Pattern Recognition, will be a small, 100%-participation seminar
studying the interpretation of document images. Leading industrial researchers
will join with international theoreticians to study the visual interpretation of
complex printed and handwritten material -- including text, maps, music
notation, and engineering drawings. This grant will support travel scholarships
for participating U.S. graduate students and for senior U.S. participants who
otherwise could not attend.
