DMS-0203045 Mladen Bestvina

The project encompasses different aspects of geometry, topology, and geometric
group theory. The unifying theme is the geometric and topological study of
spaces with large symmetry groups. Sometimes it is the group that arises first,
for example as a symmetry group of an algebraic object, and then a space is
constructed with symmetries reflecting this group. This allows for
geometric/topological methods to be used in algebra. Another aspect of the
project involves finding hyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds. The
possibility that all (compact) spaces that locally look like our ordinary
3-dimensional space are in fact geometric objects was first conceived by W.P.
Thurston and verified in many cases. Yet another aspect involves Diophantine
geometry over groups. This is about a study of logical statements that hold for
a particular class of groups. Surprisingly, as shown by the work of Z. Sela,
topology enters this study; for example, surfaces appear naturally when one
considers free groups.

More specifically, the topics of the project are: Singularities of character
varieties and topological dynamics on character varieties, Explicit bounds in
the compactness theorems for spaces of discrete and faithful representations,
Weak hyperbolization conjecture and immersed surface laminations in 3-manifolds,
Constructions of Kaehler groups of low cohomological dimension, Diophantine
geometry over groups, Finiteness properties of the Torelli group, Rigidity
theorems for Coxeter, Artin, and related groups.
