9561221 Biter This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is for
computer interfaces, practical finger and hand force sensors which are necessary
to provide force feedback control for positioning cursors, manipulating objects,
etc. since they transmit the user's hand and finger motion. Other applications
range from medical applications to robotics, advanced manufacturing and virtual
reality simulation; any man-machine interaction where accurate positioning is
required. Existing sensors can not satisfy these needs. The sensors cannot be
used in an array and are pressure sensors and cannot measure shear forces. The
proposed sensor array being developed can meet most of the requirement for a
tactile array. It uses a magnetoelectric film with a resolution that could
exceed 20 elements/inch. The sensor array under development is a totally new
approach to a sensor system. It measures the strain in a magnetrostrictive film
by the coupling between the magnetic field and the magnetoelectric element.The
output is an amplitude modulated signal with good dc response and high
sensitivity. It can also measure shear forces but the most interesting property
is the ability to matrix address the array and actually measure all elements
simultaneously. The phase I program will design, fabricate and test a sensor
array suitable for the tactile interfaces to a computer. The magnetoelectric
material is a new material which can be used in arrays, including ultrasonic
imagers, sonar arrays, pressure mats, etc. The proposed tactile interface will
have wide use in systems that require feedback from hand motion, including
robotics, smart manufacturing and numerous medical/diagnostic applications as
well as computer interfaces.
