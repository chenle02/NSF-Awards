This research proposes a small exploratory study to design and develop an
improved set of analytical models to assess the interaction among human
managers, technical infrastructure, and a dynamic population of users. Such
problems create extraordinary challenges for public agencies that have
responsibility for maintaining continuity of operations and security for
metropolitan regions. The complexity of the interactions increases as conditions
change or sudden, unanticipated events disrupt the performance of the technical
systems. Human managers, responsible for the management of technical systems,
need to intervene to reduce damaging consequences for the users. These are
complex systems that require an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to
modeling the dynamic behavior of the population of users and managers in their
interaction with the infrastructure. Existing models, based on single
disciplinary approaches, are inadequate for this
problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address the problem of disruption
in complex transportation systems. It will make three contributions to the
management of critical infrastructure at risk from extreme events. First, it
explores an interdisciplinary approach to building computational models of real-
time decision making that have not been done before in a workable manner. This
approach draws upon knowledge and techniques in civil engineering, public
policy, and computer science to develop models of rapid assessment of risk and
allocation of resources and time that can inform decision processes by
practicing managers who confront danger and need to take urgent action. Second,
the models, when developed in detail, will yield tested metrics for
characterizing sociotechnical infrastructure in reference to urban
transportation and emergency management networks. Third, the theoretical
approach offers a method of assessing the interaction of cascading dysfunction
in damaged technical systems countered by informed adaptation in organizational
emergency response systems to provide enhanced decision support in managing
disaster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
