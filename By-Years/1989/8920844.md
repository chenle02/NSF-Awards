The goal of this research is to obtain a detailed understanding of indentation-
induced flaw nucleation in ceramic materials. A unique high temperature
microhardness tester, capable of operating up to 1600 0C, will be used to
produce indentations. Indentation sites will be characterized by SEM and TEM in
order to determine effect of crystallography, load, and temperature on the
deformation mechanisms leading flaw nucleation. Initially, single crystals of
alumina, magnesium oxide, and barium titanate will be used, followed by
bicrystals.
