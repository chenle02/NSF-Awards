Each September and October the Logic Group at Rutgers University organizes a
visitor program that attracts participants from all career stages from all over
the world. The key goal of the program is to foster collaborations and to share
ideas among researchers in the field of logic as well as related mathematical
areas. The program, which also includes a series of seminars, has been very
successful in generating many important research results. This award supports
participation in the visitor program activities during 2018 -
2020.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary topics of the visitor program are set
theory and model theory, and their applications to algebra and combinatorics. An
important feature is the yearly involvement of Saharon Shellah, who is a leader
in these fields of study. This award supports participation of approximately ten
researchers each year, ranging from graduate students to leaders in the field,
in a program that is a major asset for U.S. logic and contributes vigorously to
the development of the subject on many levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
