This award supports a program to develop observationally testable models of the
formation and evolution of galaxies by a leading young computational
astrophysicist. Self consistent numerical models including both stellar and gas-
dynamical effects will be constructed to take advantage of recent advances in
hardware and software. In addition to generating testabnle predictions, the
codes to be developed will be made available to the astronomical community to
ensure widest possible use and testing.
