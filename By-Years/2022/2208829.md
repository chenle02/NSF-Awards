This award will provide support for work on the ATLAS experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a particle physics laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland. The LHC machine and ATLAS, a large particle detector facility, were
built as basic science tools using funds from NSF and other agencies around the
world. The 2012 discovery, at the LHC, of a Higgs boson with mass close to 125
GeV represents both the crowning achievement of the Standard Model of particle
physics and a hint beyond it - how can a light Higgs boson possibly survive
huge, destabilizing quantum effects without new, undiscovered physics? The next
step in the experiments is to look for evidence for physics Beyond the Standard
Model (BSM) that might, for instance, account for the presence of the mysterious
"Dark Matter" that makes up so much of the mass of the universe. The LHC is
currently just starting a new phase, Run 2, at higher energy and increased event
samples. It is possible that evidence for BSM physics could emerge in the next
couple of years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide tools for
detecting new BSM physics through searches for Higgs decaying to heavy tau
leptons. Taus can only be seen through the decay products which themselves are
difficult to detect. The PI will apply new machine learning techniques to
extract these Higgs decays which have a large momentum transfer from the
colliding protons. This class of Higgs is especially sensitive to contributions
to new BSM particles. The proposed studies also have the potential to further
improve the capabilities of the ATLAS detector to detect hadronic decays of the
Ï„ lepton. The broader impacts of this award will be in outreach activities in
local Seattle high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
