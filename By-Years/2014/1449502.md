Oregon State University proposes to develop and evaluate a model for making
modern robotics software techniques, platforms, and models accessible for
education. The Open Source Robotics Foundation's (OSRF) Robot Operating System
(ROS) is a widely used software architecture for academic robotics research.

The project will: 1. develop and curate open-source curricular materials that
will allow educators to more easily deploy ROS in their classes at all levels;
2. ensure that these materials are accessible to both the students in a formal
education setting and also to non-traditional learners in an informal setting;
3. provide concrete advice and guidelines for overcoming the common logistical
problems of deploying and running a robotics class with ROS; 4. work with robot
retailers to develop a "classroom pack" of hardware and software that integrates
with the curricular materials to reduce the overhead of starting a new class
using ROS; and 5. start to build a community of educators and learners, at all
levels, invested in using ROS in their classes and other educational activities.
