Two workshops on statistical methodology in quality and product improvement are
to be conducted. The first workshop will focus on the identification and
exploration of a broad range of research problems involving statistical science
and its use in addressing problems in process quality and productivity. Typical
problems range from the development of process diagnostics to detect processes
out of control or deterioration of machines or tools used in these processes to
new experimental design techniques to improve the quality of processes having a
large number of control variables to techniques related to the development of
large scale software products and project management. The workshop will look at
specific problems involving response surface methodology in very high dimensions
with vector outcome variables and will address the issues arising in combining
observational data analysis with designed experiments to learn the shape of the
response surface and optimize the production process. Statistical graphics
techniques as well as computer science methods of artificial intelligence (e.g.,
neural networks ) will be explored.
