The Gateway Coalition proposes to open new "gateways" for learning by altering
engineering education from a focus on course content to the development of human
resources and the broader experience in which individual curriculum parts are
connected and integrated. The scope of the program includes four major parts:
curriculum structure, human potential development, instructional technology and
methodology, and evaluation measures. Gateway efforts will broaden, expand and
enrich emerging innovations with new issues and a pervasive framework. The
intellectual threads will weave together: 1) the introduction of engineering and
its functional core "up-front," 2) a unified and connected supportive knowledge
"as needed," 3) the integrative aspects of the engineering process, and 4)
instructional technologies. Representing a diversity of institutional cultures
imbedded in regions of significant underrepresented minorities population, the
Coalition will impact engineering education through structure, content, and
interinstitutional linkages. The program will emphasize engaging students in
engineering from the day they matriculate; making the study of engineering more
attractive, exciting and fulfilling; developing students as emerging
professional leaders with the knowledge base and capability for lifelong
learning; increasing the the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities and
the disabled participating in engineering; and drawing engineering faculty to a
dedicated investment in the teaching of undergraduate students.
