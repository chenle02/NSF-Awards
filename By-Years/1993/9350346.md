9350346 Dasgupta This PI intends to continue his work in the area of robust
stability. Robust stability mainly concerns the design of controllers which are
guaranteed not to go unstable, so long as the plant to be controlled is linear
and its parameter are known to lie within some fixed but wide interval. Many
theorems have already been proven demonstrating stability for parameter sets
within certain kinds of interval; the PI will attempt to develop techniques to
help evaluate known intervals of uncertainty, to help determine whether they
actually meet the required criteria. In addition, he intends to investigate
whether Lyapunov stability theory can be applied to systems with parametric
uncertainty particular types of nonlinear feedback. The PI also intends to
perform theoretical analysis of signed adaptive filters for signal processing,
and of the properties of Hopfield networks. He intends to explore robust
stability theory as an alternative to learning or adaptive methods in channel
equalization. He also plans to apply discrete event models to the modeling of
cell growth. *** v s t tability mainly concerns the d $ $ ( F / S S / 1 Courier
