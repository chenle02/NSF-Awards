This project lies at the interface of geometry and partial differential
equations. The PI will further the study of natural geometric evolution
equations designed to understand aspects of four dimensional geometry and
topology. One project is to understand the singularity formation and long time
behavior of geometric flows on almost Hermitian manifolds, previously introduced
by the PI in joint work with G. Tian. One aspect of this is to fully understand
how the long time behavior of the pluriclosed flow relates to the classification
of complex surfaces. Another project is to understand the subcritical behavior
of the gradient flow of the Yang-Mills energy of a Riemannian metric. One major
goal here is to understand the possible singularities which can develop on four-
manifolds with small initial energy.

The use of geometry and curvature in understanding spaces is a fundamental idea
in mathematics and science. Frequently the relevant curvature properties are
closely related to equations relating to the laws of nature. Geometric evolution
equations of the kind proposed here arise frequently in various physical
contexts, and see application to various areas including image analysis and
material science. The proposed research will advance fundamental geometric and
analytic ideas which are the foundation of such applications.
