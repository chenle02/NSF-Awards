The ability to sense and respond to nutrient levels in the environment is
essential for the survival of organisms. One strategy employed by single cells
is exemplified by Dictyostelium, which survives a food shortage by initiating a
simple, yet elegant, developmental program resulting in the formation of spores.
How do Dictyostelium detect that food has become limiting and then initiate
their developmental program? The available data indicate that they sense changes
in the levels of an uncharacterized secreted factor(s) that allow them to
monitor the ratio of Dictyostelium cells to their food source, bacteria. Failure
to secret this factor(s) results in a lack of response to a loss of food, and
the cells do not develop spores. A Dictyostelium mutant that fails to initiate
the developmental cycle because it does not secrete the critical factor(s)
required for monitoring food levels has been identified. This mutant is a useful
tool that will be exploited to identify the factor(s) that triggers the onset of
development in Dictyostelium. Two aims will be pursued: (1) A biochemical
approach will be used to isolate and fully characterize the factor; (2) The
molecular basis for the mutant phenotype will be determined. The mutant gene
encodes a novel type of myosin. The role of this motor protein in the secretion
of a critical developmental factor will be investigated. The successful
completion of this project should provide fundamentally important information
about how Dictyostelium employs a secreted factor(s) to initiate development and
the role of a unique myosin in the process. Identification of this triggering
mechanism should then serve as a paradigm for how secreted factors are used to
monitor an organism's environment as well as initiate key developmental
processes. This project will provide research training for post-doctoral
associates, graduate students, and undergraduates.
