The importance of deep convection in the tropics to the global circulation has
been recognized for some time. In 1986 a pilot experiment termed the Equatorial
Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX) was held off the northern coast of Australia to
obtain measurements of the characteristics of deep convection in that part of
the world and the effect of that convection on the larger scale environment. The
Principal Investigator will produce quantitative descriptions of the wind,
thermal and moisture profiles within and in the immediate environment of
equatorial cloud clusters. Similarities and differences of the results from
earlier field experiments will be noted and, if appropriate, new conceptual
models developed. A major goal will be to investigate the effects on the large
scales of motion of the vertical profile of latent heating and sea-air
exchanges.
