Dr. Randy S. Duran and other members of the Chemistry Department of the
University of Florida are being supported to continue a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For the period 1995-97, ten
undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in
research projects designed to provide new knowledge to the field, technical
training to the student, and an opportunity to co-author publications and
present work in talks or posters. A special feature of the program is an
industry-sponsored seminar series. The program has garnered impressive cost-
sharing from University sources and from corporate contributions, bringing the
total number of undergraduate participants to 15 each summer.
