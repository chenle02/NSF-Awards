A computer upgrade for the University of Maryland Intermediate Energy Nuclear
Physics Group will be carried out. This system will be used in (1) massive
event-mode data replay and analysis, (2) state-of-the-art
theoretical/phenomenological calculations including distorted wave calculation
of scattering, knock-out, and absorption reactions for nucleons, pions and
photons, and (3) Monte Carlo simulations of CEBAF, SLAC, and FNAL experiments
for proposal generation. The current computer system is not adequate to meet the
current and planned research objectives.
