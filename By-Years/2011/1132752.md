The U.S. GEOTRACES North Atlantic zonal section cruise was scheduled for 15
October through 5 December 2010. Because of a major irresolvable mechanical
failure of the ship's propulsion system, the expedition had to be terminated in
the Cape Verde Islands on 4 November after completing about one third of the
planned track. This required on-the-spot changes in return travel for all sea-
going investigators as well as in shipping arrangements for all their samples
and equipment. The funds requested in this proposal address the PI's need to
cover salary costs to prepare for the cruise and shipping costs to get his
supplies to the ship and back to his home institution after the cruise. The
dissolved and colloidal trace elements determined as part of this study (Cd, Fe,
Mn, and Zn) would improve coupled ocean/atmosphere carbon and nutrient cycling
models and yield new insights on the role of the atmosphere in depositing metals
to surface waters and their transfer to the interior ocean.
