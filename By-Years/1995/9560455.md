This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
feasibility of developing a personal authentication system for database and
network security based on dynamic signature verification. Previous work on
database and network security has focused on cryptographic methods such as
digital signatures, and various security management techniques to protect files
and transmissions over the network-- all of which is important and essential to
creating a secure database and network, but it is not enough. In any security
system the biggest weakness is ultimately the people who have access to the
system. This problem has been recognized in such areas as health care, where new
standards are being drafted that include personal authentication as well as
cryptology for maintaining secure databases that meet legal requirements (ASTM
draft E31.20). It is felt that personal authentication based on signature
verification best satisfies the requirements of compliance with legal
regulations, low cost, high performance, and user acceptance. The proposed Phase
I work includes: 1) collection of signature data; 2) research into signature
verification algorithms for enrollment, signature matching, and updating (with a
current prototype signature verification technology as a starting point and
baseline); 3) development of a real-time prototype; 4) thorough testing and
evaluation of performance and feasibility; 5) investigation into how to
effectively integrate signature verification into database and network security
(in particular, integration with cryptographic methods such as digital
signatures). The market for personal authentication systems is potentially very
large, including database and network security, general computer security,
access control to sensitive areas, financial transactions, and anywhere else
sensitive information is electronically stored. For electronic transactions to
become widely accepted, a computer-based personal authentication system such as
signature verification is needed..
