Under the aegis of the AGS-PRF (post-doctoral research fellowship) solicitation,
the researcher aims to produce multiple, quantitative paleo-precipitation
reconstructions, spanning the last 1,500 years, across an east-west transect of
lakes in western North America. Specifically, the researcher will use hydrologic
and isotope mass balance models to quantitatively interpret existing (Washington
and British Columbia) and new (Montana) lake sediment isotope records to develop
regional precipitation reconstructions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and
the Little Ice Age.

These reconstructions will be used to investigate hypotheses regarding
contrasting aridity patterns and to assist in ongoing experiments using
perturbed physics ensemble runs of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that govern
potential changes in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and their associated impacts on
extra-tropical precipitation and drought patterns.

The broader impacts involve supporting an early career scientist and helping
reduce the uncertainty in probabilistic future projections of the El Nino-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
(AMOC) phenomenon and helping to constrain predictions of future hydroclimatic
conditions in the arid regions of western North America.
