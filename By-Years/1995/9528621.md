9528621 Ehrenfeld In this research, systems models will be developed that
simulate the evolutionary, learning characteristics of typical loop-closing
structures. Loop-closing structures in industrial ecology are those that
incorporate materials recycling as well as product reuse and remanufacturing to
minimize the demands on the complete ecosystem. This work aims to build on
individual product- or process-focused research to develop a better description
of the dynamic evolutionary behavior of the larger socio-technical-ecological
system. Organizational and cultural norms and preferences need to be considered
to determine critical information linkages as well as primary economic and
material flows. Two cases will be developed: aluminum use in automobiles; and
alternate materials choices for durable products and components. Modeling of
complex interactions among economic, institutional, and contextual variables
could improve understanding of the nature of industrial ecological systems. This
understanding could enable a transformation of traditional industrial processes
to loop-closing processes in which all components are environmentally conscious
of the entire system. More effective design, strategic, and policy choices in
manufacturing could result.
