9501285 Franzoni This CAREER award deals with research and educational
development in the area of structural dynamics and acoustics with a special
emphasis on the Asymptotic Modal Analysis (AMA) method. This method is
particularly suited for a study of complex dynamic systems in the middle-to-high
frequency range with moderate -to- large levels of damping such as in the case
of transportation and flight vehicles. The currently available AMA method is
extended to AMA - hybrid method, which predicts responses of moderately to
highly damped systems. This is a combination of AMA and perturbation methods
that yields physical insights into the role of modal coupling and damping and
closed form solutions. The educational component includes teaching, mentoring,
outreach, and extension activities aimed at pre college students,
undergraduates, graduate students, and practicing engineers. Examples include
administering a summer program for high school students, supervising
undergraduate research projects, mentoring graduate students, and organizing
technical meetings with tutorials for the exchange of ideas between the academe
and the industry.***
