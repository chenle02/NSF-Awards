9421744 Kolata The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will
administer a travel grant program for U.S. mathematicians to attend the third
International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 95). ICIAM
95 has proved to be an effective way to foster the interaction of U.S.>
mathematicians and industry on a world wide basis. It is especially important
for young researchers and graduate students who are near completion of their
thesis to establish these connections. These grants will help young faculty and
students make new connections in the world-wide community of researchers and
practitioners that they normally would not be able to make. They will also help
U.S. mathematicians keep pace with the advances in applications of mathematics
to technology and science. Women and minorities will be especially encouraged to
apply for grants.
