Most languages have restricted rules that apply only to a subset of eligible
words: thus, English has words like thie[f]/thie[v]es alongside chie[f]/chie[f]s
and pee[v]e/pee[v]es. Another famous example comes from Russian, where vowels
delete in some words when a suffix is added (veter/vetr-a 'wind/of wind') but
not others (kater/kater-a 'a boat/of a boat'). Even though Russian deletion has
received a lot of attention from phonologists over the past forty years, it has
never been studied using quantitatively robust methodology, and some important
generalizations were missed. The rule was thought to apply unpredictably, so
linguists marked the deleting vowels as abstractly different and focused on how
deletion interacted with other rules of Russian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research investigates the hypothesis that people do have unconscious
knowledge about the shapes of words that undergo restricted rules, and they can
demonstrate this knowledge in experimental settings. Recent experimental work by
the PI and colleagues shows that Russian speakers know that disyllabic words are
more likely to have vowel deletion than monosyllabic words: even though there
are words like [rot/rt-a] 'a mouth/of a mouth', they are a small minority in the
lexicon. Russian speakers also pay attention to syllable structure, contrary to
traditional descriptions: even though Russian has some rather exotic consonant
clusters, people reject them when they result from vowel
deletion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned experiments, conducted in Russia and
in the US with native Russian speakers, will investigate phonological and
morphological alternations in existing and hypothetical words of Russian, with a
focus on noun inflection and diminutive formation. The project will yield
extensive quantitatively robust data on this longstanding problem. It will also
train graduate and undergraduate students in experimental and corpus
methodologies, which are becoming increasingly important in phonology.
