This award will help defray costs of publishing a multi- authored volume
entitled Systematics, Historical Ecology, and North American Freshwater Fishes,
which is the result of a symposium held in 1988 at the meetings of the American
Society of Ichthyology and Herpetology. This monograph will be a landmark volume
on the ecology, historical ecology and systematics of American freshwater
fishes. As the only compendium of it's kind, it will be an invaluable reference
work and textbook for professionals and students who study fishes. The monograph
will also bear on studies of freshwater resources and fish management in North
America.
