In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, a team from
PolarOnyx, Inc. and University of California at Davis will develop an integrated
femtosecond (fs) high energy fiber source for high throughput photonics device
fabrication, such as waveguide couplers, WDM components and
filters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed device if successfully commercialized
will enable a broad range of applications ranging from materials processing to
healthcare.
