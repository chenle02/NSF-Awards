Occidental College Biology Department proposes to develop an REU site that will
bring together a diverse group of undergraduates to do summer research in cell
and molecular biology. The research will be supervised by the three faculty
members involved in the Cellular and Molecular Emphasis, whose research areas
are: molecular biology of aging, molecular immunology, and neurobiology. These
faculty members are strongly committed to encouraging women and students of
color to consider science as a career. The students will be recruited from
Occidental itself, a highly selective liberal arts college with 40% minority
enrollment, and from other colleges. Particular recruiting efforts will be
focused upon the surrounding community colleges with which we already have ties.
The program will allow each student to become familiar with the literature,
perform a project, interact with the other students and the faculty in the
program extensively, prepare and present a poster on their project, and interact
with several off campus speakers, including alumnae/i who are presently graduate
students at CalTech, USC, and UCLA.
