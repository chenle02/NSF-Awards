Over the next five years, two experimental programs with related research goals
will be pursued. The first will better characterize the natural radio
environment of the earth at LF-HF frequencies. Significant natural emissions
have been detected above the ionosphere in this band, but the study of natural
emissions from the ground have been relatively few. The second research goal is
to undertake experimental studies of non-linear plasma physics processes in
space. Examples include wave-wave and wave-particle interactions, plasma
turbulence and non-linear structures such as solitons. Both kinds of experiments
will develop new software technologies along with wave receives instrumentation.
