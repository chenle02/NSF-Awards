ABSTRACT Paul Ho University of Texas Austin Proposal No. CTS-9512657 Two Central
facilities will be created on campus, the Ultra High Vacuum facility (Scanning
Electron Microscopy, Scanning Tunneling and Atomic Force Microscopy with
development of Nearfield Scanning Optical Microscopy) and the ambient probe
system (including Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy) for studying wet
surfaces. Sixteen faculty are involved for seven departments, which cut across
both science and engineering. Some of the proposed state-of-the-art instruments
were originally developed by the principal investigators, and development of new
extensions are proposed. The Ultra High Vacuum Facility will be used to
investigate fundamental properties of semiconductor devices and chemical
catalysis. The ambient probe facility will characterize materials which cannot
be fabricated under vacuum, such as polymer films. Both photonic and magnetic
materials with implications for information storage will be investigated.
Another area of focus will be biological research. The project will establish
state-of-the-art imaging capabilities for advanced materials research and
education.
