This project studies the feasibility of using speech as a novel biomarker for
concussions, based on insights obtained from prior research that have shown
links between impaired brain functioning and speech. Mild traumatic brain
injuries (mTBI) such as concussions are arguably one of the most pressing
concerns in sports today, with an estimated 2-4 million cases every year in
youth sports alone. The potential short- and long-term impacts on the health and
well-being of individuals with brain injuries are extensive. Untreated
concussions can lead to diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, an
elevated incidence of Alzheimer's disease, and dementia developing at a higher
rate and a younger age. It is therefore imperative to accurately detect and
appropriately treat mTBI, especially among adolescents, whose brains are still
developing and more prone to long-term damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research advances the understanding of the relationship between brain injuries
and acoustic features in speech and lays the foundation for novel and accurate
concussion screening tools. Initial results based on voice collections from more
than 300 boxers (25 of which were concussed) have been promising and indicate
that speech may have the potential to serve as a new, easy-to-capture biomarker
for mTBI. Using mobile technologies such as smartphones and tablets, brief
speech recordings from youth athletes are being captured. With the help of
speech recognition techniques, each word is isolated and acoustic features are
extracted for each phoneme in each word. Features that are being analyzed
include temporal characteristics of speech (e.g., speech duration per word or
phoneme or articulation rate) and frequency spectrum characteristics (e.g.,
pitch, formant frequencies, and mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients). Using
state-of-the-art statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, these
features are then analyzed for their potential as marker for mild forms of brain
injuries.
