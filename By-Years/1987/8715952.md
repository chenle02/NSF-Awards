Adiabatic shear banding is the name given to a localization phenomenon that
occurs during high-rate plastic deformation, such as machining, shock impact
loading, ballistic penetration, and metal forming processes. As shear bands are
believed to be precursors to material fracture, a knowledge of these phenomena,
and of factors that inhibit or enhance their initiation and growth, is essential
to the production of durable materials. The study will concentrate on: a)
developing efficient algorithms to integrate the governing field equations, b)
identifying the most appropriate constitutive model for the study of such
problems, c) studying the effect of different ways of modeling a material
inhomogeneity, d) identifying material parameters that affect significantly the
initiation and subsequent development of shear bands, e) studying the effect of
the loading path on the initiation and growth of a shear band, f) investigating
the interaction among two or more bands, and g) assessing the damage caused by a
shear band to the material.
