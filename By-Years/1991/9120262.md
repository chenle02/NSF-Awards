A new neurophysiological method for studying signal processing in the hearing
or auditory system has been developed for recording the electrical responses of
the auditory nerve when sounds are presented. This electrical response is called
the "peristimulus compound action potential", or PCAP. The PCAP is being used to
investigate the neural basis of the phenomenon known as "forward masking".
Forward masking is the reduction in the ability to hear one sound as the result
of an immediately preceding sound. Forward masking plays an important role in
speech communication and is also used in a large number of procedures that
assess hearing performance. The results of these studies will contribute to a
better understanding of the function of the auditory portion of the nervous
system. In addition, because some of these electrical responses can be recorded
in a noninvasive way from the ear canal of humans, it will be possible to expand
these studies from laboratory animals to humans.
