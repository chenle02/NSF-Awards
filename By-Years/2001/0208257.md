This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Transformation
of neural signals across single neurons." This project addresses the
physiological and biophysical mechanisms of individual neurons that underlie
phase-coding in barn owls, specifically how they encode time. First, it will
focus on verifying the presence of a subthreshold presynaptic code in
postsynaptic cells. Second, morphological and physiological characteristics of
the synapse will be determined.
