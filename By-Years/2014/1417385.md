This award funds the research activities of Professor Sarah Shandera at
Pennsylvania State University. There is excellent, if indirect, evidence that
our universe underwent an early period of very rapid expansion (inflation) which
set the stage for the evolution to the cosmology we currently observe. Although
we expect that inflation can be explained in terms of particle physics, we do
not yet have a precise understanding of the nature of the particles responsible.
Particle interactions can be constrained by the way they induce couplings in
observable properties of the cosmic density field on different scales. This
research project examines the implications of coupling between scales that are
observable to scales that are outside of our current cosmological window. In
particular, the PI will study how observations made in a finite volume of the
universe constrain particle physics models of inflation which make predictions
about statistics in a much larger, unobservable, volume. The PI will also
develop workshop modules for elementary and high school students based on the
theme of understanding the size and dynamical evolution of the universe.

The PI has already shown that when the curvature inhomogeneities on very
different scales are coupled, our observed universe is likely to have biased
statistics compared to the mean predicted for a larger post-inflationary volume.
In other words, there is a new source of cosmic variance in comparing
observations in our Hubble volume to theory. Through this grant, the PI proposes
to further develop the framework for constraining interacting inflation
theories, compatible with observations in a finite universe. She will map out
the extent to which the cosmic variance from coupling to superhorizon modes can
add new uncertainties in comparing measurements of the primordial scalar
curvature inhomogeneities to predictions from theory. She will work out which
qualitative aspects of particle physics scenarios for inflation can be mimicked
or obscured by cosmic variance.
