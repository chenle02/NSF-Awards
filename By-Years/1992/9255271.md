Support is provided for a retreat in May 1992 to develop a national Hispanic
agenda on science and mathematics education. Participating will be leaders of
Hispanic science and community organizations. During the retreat a plan of
action to impact policymaking about programs that impact Hispanic science and
mathematics education will be developed which will draw on discussions about
barriers that inhibit Hispanic participation in science and mathematics, extant
"exemplary" programs that have been developed to address these issues, and
proposal evaluation policies and processes. A report and followup strategy will
be products of the retreat.
