The objective of this research is to develop basic understanding of the effect
of vibrations on phase separation of immiscible contaminants in soils saturated
with Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) and water. Exploratory studies conducted by
the principal investigator indicate that vibrations induced in a soil medium
saturated with NAPL and water can successfully separate and dislodge the NAPL
phase. The proposed study will include a series of laboratory tests to evaluate
the vibratory phase separation of NAPL ganglia as a function of vibration
frequencies. The attenuation of vibratory phase separation will be assessed
Dynamic criteria will be developed for phase separation and mobilization of
immiscible ganglia in Soil-NAPL-water systems.
