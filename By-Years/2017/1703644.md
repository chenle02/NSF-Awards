Web-based applications executed via web browsers are ubiquitous in everyday
life. They underlie our banking, communications, shopping, social networking,
tax payments, insurance transactions, and health care interactions.
Unfortunately, malicious actors can take advantage of vulnerabilities in web
browsers to exploit the user's computer. The consequences of a web browser
attack can be severe: web content can execute arbitrary code on the victim's
machine. This research project studies how web applications use the features
provided by web browsers and how user systems can be protected by restricting
unnecessary browser features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses web
browser security by reducing the browser feature footprint, thereby reducing the
browser attack surface and mitigating many classes of attacks. The researchers
are building a feature-instrumented browser that reports what functionality is
used by a web application. Then, they leverage that information to automatically
identify when web applications diverge from their expected behavior and attack
the user's browser. To enable users to use the most up-to-date browsers, while
protecting them from unnecessary and risky browser features, the research team
is building a system to decouple features from the browser.
