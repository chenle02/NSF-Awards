This grant supports an international and interdisciplinary forum for the
exchange of research by and for representatives of Inuit communities and
researchers and scholars principally from the U.S., Canada, Greenland, Denmark,
and the USSR. The Conference theme "Looking to the Future" focuses on current
cultural and social changes facing northern and indigenous communities. This is
the first time the biennially convened Conference will be held in the United
States, is expected to attract more than 400 participants and will have over 80
presenters. The Conference and its proceedings will enhance international
cooperation among arctic nations and its people. Agency funding of this
Conference directly supports the intent of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of
1984 and provides the opportunity for the National Science Foundation to develop
the objectives of its recently approved Arctic Social Science Research Program.
