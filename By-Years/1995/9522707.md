The Fourth World Conference on Engineering Education, to be held in Minneapolis,
MN in October 1995, will bring together scholars from all parts of the world to
discuss current international issues in engineering education. This grant will
provide a third of the funds to be used to bring up to 50 international scholars
to this meeting. Presentations and discussions at the meeting will focus on the
increasing need to develop greater understanding of engineering education in
other countries and to seek collaborators for educational initiatives that will
enhance their institution's program offerings.
