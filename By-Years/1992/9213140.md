Although there have been enormous advances in communications over the past
several decades, the vast majority of personal communications today is still
done through wired systems. However, with the coming of age of personal
communications networks (PCN) and digital cellular communication, more and more
communications will be wireless, or untethered in the future. A major
consideration in PCN is the multiple accessing technique, and it appears that
spread spectrum code division multiple access (CDMA) is the best choice. This
research deals with the CDMA environment, and a modified design of the standard
receiver that results in enhanced system performance is presented. The redesign
is based around the signal processing technique of transform domain processing
and will result in a receiver which more closely approximates an optimal
detector than does the conventional correlation receiver. The research will
involve analysis an numerical simulation.
