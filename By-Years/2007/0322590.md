The research objective of this award is the creation of new ultrafast tool
servos, which are to be used in conjunction with precision diamond turning
machines for the rapid production of surfaces with nanometer-scale resolution
requirements. The approach to accomplishing this is to invent novel
electromagnetic actuators based upon the variable reluctance principle. The
project will develop techniques to avoid problems with actuator nonlinearities
that have, until the present, prevented such actuators from being used with any
significance in fast tool servos. In association with the novel actuators, the
project will study control algorithms that allow very high bandwidth,
acceleration, and accuracy simultaneously. These techniques will be
experimentally proven in a precision diamond turning
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project will have significant
benefit to society by enabling more efficient production of nanosurfaces, and so
impact industrial production of new classes of devices using these surfaces. It
will also facilitate transfer of novel enabling technology to suppliers of
precision production machines, impact the teaching of courses by using the early
fast tool servo prototypes, models, and experimental results as example problems
and lab experiments, and facilitate training of undergraduate and graduate
students with special attention to the attraction of members of underrepresented
groups.
