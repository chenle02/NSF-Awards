9407617 Bandurski This investigator has cloned and sequenced a gene for the
enzyme catalyzing the reaction: IAA+UDPG ----- 1-0-IAA-glucose+UDP. This gene is
important because the synthesis of IAA-glucose is the first step in the
biosynthesis of the conjugates of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in Zea mays and
because this is the first higher plant gene of IAA metabolism to be cloned and
sequenced. Homologous sequences are present in Arabidopsis and tobacco and in
all the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants tested to date. The overall
goal of this work is to control the size of the endogenous pools of the plant
growth hormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, auxin), by genetic means. All plants
examined contain most of their IAA in a conjugated, and presumably, inactive
form. It is the free acid which appears to be the active hormone. The ability to
regulate the concentrations of free, versus conjugated, growth hormone levels,
will be of value in understanding how IAA levels are regulated in plants; will
possible provide information concerning how the tip of the shoot regulates shoot
elongation; and will be of possible agronomic value in promoting or reducing
plant growth without application of growth-regulating chemicals. During this
granting period, the cDNA and genomic homologs of the corn cDNA encoding for
IAGlu synthetase will be identifed and sequenced from Arabidopsis or tobacco;
transgenic Arabidopsis and/or tobacco plants will be constructed with the IAGIu
synthetase gene placed under a promoter in an antisense orientation to block
expression of mRNA involved in synthesis of IAGlu synthetase; reported gene
constructs will be prepared in Arabidopsis to study the time and localization of
expression of the IAGlu synthetase gene; and, two different cDNA clones believed
to encode genes controlling hydrolysis of 1-0-IAGlu and 6-0-IAGlu will be
sequenced and their enzymatic activity characterized in an E. coli expression
system. ***
