9409370 Chen This a research planning award to investigate interactive machine
learning techniques which integrate modern human-computer interaction technology
with machine learning theory and applications with the purpose of building more
powerful and flexible machine learning systems. The purpose in the integration
of these two technologies, which up to now had been developed mostly in
isolation from each other, is to obtain machine learning, inferencing, and
interaction with teachers via multimodal interfaces which may incorporate
natural language and other modalities in an integral system. The planning
process includes an extensive literature search, study of possible interfaces
for integration with learnability models, identification of critical issues in
interactive learning research and learning algorithms, and preliminary design of
a prototype for assessing the effectiveness of such learning systems.
