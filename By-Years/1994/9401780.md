9401780 Knop The main goal of this project is to generalize the theory of
symmetric spaces to other spaces where one makes only one assumption on the
symmetry group: It should be a semisimple Lie group. Under this condition one is
able to define the notion of a flat and of a little Weyl group. There exist
three different constructions of the Weyl group. The first is by looking at the
boundary of the space. For spherical varieties, there is a canonical
construction of a compactification and one part of the project is to prove that
it has no singularities. The second construction is accomplished by looking at
the action of a certain subgroup of the symmetric group. The principal
investigator will find a way to reconstruct all other data needed to describe
all compactifications of the space. Finally, there is a construction
accomplished by looking at the moment map on the cotangent bundle of the space.
A major problem of the project is to obtain a better understanding of the moment
map. Many different algebraic objects can be represented as algebraic sets of
transformations of other algebraic objects. Through these representations their
structure can be determined. This project is concerned with the representation
theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras. The study of these algebras has
applications throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. ***
