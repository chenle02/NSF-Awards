9419233 Carlis Many of the observations made by brain scientists, from molecular
physiology to behavior, can only be understood when they are placed within the
context of the brain's anatomical structure. With this award, a group of
computer scientists and neurobiologists, headed by Dr. John Carlis, will design
a prototype architecture for storing high resolution images of brain structure.
These images will be organized (1) so that they can be viewed globally, but also
so that the operator can zoom in on very fine details, and (2) they will be
organized as network accessible files so that they can be shared over the
internet. This work will advance the emerging field of bioinformatics and will
improve the ways in which scientists store, share, and analyze experimental data
about the brain.
