This research focuses on issues involved in the development of a generic
architecture for intelligent networked colocation in concurrent engineering.
Constraints networks have been identified by the principal investigators as an
elegant and powerful technique that can be used as basis for concurrent
engineering. In previous work, the basic constraint specification language and
constraint processing algorithms were determined, implemented, and tested. The
utility of this approach has been demonstrated via applications to numerous
domains. Currently, this scope is being widened with particular emphasis on
early system decision making as well as detailed design for electronics
packaging. By investigating application to this subject area in depth, it is
expected that generic techniques will be determined that will apply both here
and to other areas of engineering design. As part of this effort, research is
being conducted in constraint-based language issues such as optimization,
alternative modes of abstraction of knowledge, seamless interfaces to point
design tools, learning, and uncertainty.
