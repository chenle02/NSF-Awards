U of Connecticut The proposed activity is a conference which focuses upon the
topic of analytical economic geography and regional change. Six areas have been
isolated for discussion. These are: regional impacts of international trade;
investment in infrastructure; environment, resources, and regional wealth;
clusters, linkages and industrial networks; hedonic and adjustment models; urban
and regional growth models. The conference theme is prompted by the recognition
that new changes in regional fortunes are evident and these invite immediate
query to both mechanisms and measurement of how these occur. The project will
result in a conference report that will be electronically distributed to
appropriate communities of scholars.
