A cohesive methodology for the design of flexible fixtures for machining centers
utilizing a group technology (GT) approach will be undertaken. The research will
entail six major steps: determine what tolerance and fixturings information
should be included; determine an appropriate GT classification and coding scheme
which can depict this information and be appended to standard codes; given
standard GT information and the tolerance/fixturing information, etermine
appropriate algorithms to automatically create part families; determine
strategies to design flexible fixtures for a part family; implement a reul-based
software system to design flexible fixtures; and validate procedures developed
by designing, building and testing fixtures.
