Professor Walsh will continue to investigate cell-like decompositions in
dimension four with the ultimate goal of providing a characterization of four-
manifolds comparable to that available in higher dimensions. Current focus is on
a version of a disjoint-disks-property that, in spite of its apparent
simplicity, can be extremely difficult to detect even in relatively "simple"
examples. The project includes investigating the cohomological local
connectedness of decomposition spaces associated to decompositions consisting of
absolute neighborhood retracts and investigating the local homology of compact
finite- dimensional absolute neighborhood retracts with the goal of resolving
the conjecture of Bing-Borsuk that homogeneous finite- dimensional absolute
neighborhood retracts are generalized manifolds.
