Experiments are just now reaching the level where the true effects of single
light quanta can be seen. The work will contribute to the fundamental
understanding of these procedures with a focus on nonlinear effects and explore
potential applications in fields ranging from quantum information science to
extreme low-light level engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum optics and
quantum information science appeals to both physics students and the general
public. This work will attract and train talented students and postdocs in this
active area of research. Particular effort is made to attract women and
minorities to those fields. In addition, many of the effects studied in this
work have the potential to impact future applications of quantum
computing/simulation as well as nano-engineering.
