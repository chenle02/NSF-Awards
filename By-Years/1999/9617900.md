The existing literature on dissident movements has not addressed the question
of how rhetoric can be used to mobilize potential adherents to social movements.
This project hypothesizes that rhetoric takes place within particular
communication `frames` and is more successful at mobilization when legal and
political pressure increasingly is directed against the dissident group. This
research uses a content analysis of the Black Panther Party's newsletter
(published weekly between 1967 and 1980) to determine the content of this
dissident group's rhetoric. These data are correlated with local, state and
federal responses. These data are estimated using standard econometric
techniques. The project sheds light on the circumstances under which authorities
respond to attempts at political mobilization. It sheds light on how dissidents
recreate their rhetorical statements in response to actions by authorities.
Finally, it sheds light on the dynamic interaction between mobilization attempts
and domestic political responses.
