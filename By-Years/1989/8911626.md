The dynamic and thermodynamic effects of the Tibetan Plateau on atmospheric
general circulation has been recognized for some time. Additionally, the Plateau
has a pronounced influence on the local weather. One of the most interesting
meteorological phenomenon produced over the Plateau is a mesoscale atmospheric
disturbance known as the southwest vortex. During the warm season, vortices of
this type are among the most important rain- producing systems in China and are
often responsible for severe flood events. These weather systems appear to bear
some resemblance to the mesoscale convective systems that occur in the United
States and other locales, but it is not clear if they are the same phenomenon.
The Principal Investigators will use previously collected special data sets in
diagnostic and numerical modeling studies of southwest vortices. Specifically,
they will attempt to determine what meteorological factors are important to the
formation and intensification of southwest vortices and how these systems relate
to mesoscale convective systems.//
