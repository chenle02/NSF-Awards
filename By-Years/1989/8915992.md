There are two main thrusts to the research. The first is to support
collaboration between the Principal Investigator and Professor Claude Allegre,
University of Paris, on the interpretation of isotopic and other geochemical
data in terms of mantle convection and related processes. The object is to
understand how mantle dynamics leads to the geochemical signitures of mid-ocean
ridge basalts, ocean island basalts, island arc volcanism, and continental
volcanism. An important question is whether mantle convection is "chaotic" and
the implications of chaotic convection. A second major thrust of the research is
to support collaboration between the Principal Investigator and Professor David
Spence, Imperial College, on the mechanisms of magma fracture.
