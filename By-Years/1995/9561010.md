9561010 Fernandez This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will
develop a novel in situ fluorescence lifetime-based sensor for determination of
small-scale phytoplankton distribution and physiological status. A method will
be developed to determine phytoplankton physiological status from determination
of cholorophyll a fluorescence lifetimes, and an inexpensive, rugged, compact
instrument will be designed to implement the method in situ. Lifetime sensing
will be performed using phase fluorometry. The instrument implementation is
based on the use of a cross-correlation method using a modulated light-emitting
diode (LED) as a light source and digital data acquisition an analysis. A
resolution of the order of 10 ps will permit accurate determination of
cholorophyll fluorescence lifetime changes that are know to occur under various
physiological conditions. This may be the first oceanographic phytoplankton
sensor to exploit fluorescence lifetime sensing. Potential commercial
applications range from oceanographic sensing to laboratory research. Potential
markets include plant nursery, breeding, tissue culture, plant genetic
engineering, on -line process analysis in bioreactors, and aquaculture.
