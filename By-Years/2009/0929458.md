This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF support for equipment upgrades and
components form an integral part of continuing the vital role of the Arizona AMS
Laboratory and maintaining our equipment at modern standards. The facility's two
machines are in need of vacuum equipment and computer upgrades to bring them up
to modern equipment standards. These upgrades to the Arizona AMS Laboratory will
allow us to improve these AMS facilities to 21st century conditions. This will
facilitate our service role for NSF-sponsored research projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists at the Arizona AMS Laboratory contribute to
many fields of research on radiocarbon dating and studies of other
radionuclides. These upgrades will improve the operational conditions of the AMS
machines at Arizona and allow us to continue our research with less down-time
due to equipment problems and failures. The laboratory will also be in a better
position to provide service to NSF researchers using our facility.
