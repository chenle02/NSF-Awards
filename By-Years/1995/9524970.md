ABSTRACT CTS-9524970 This proposal attempts to develop an environmentally
acceptable and economically viable process to separate magentically zinc iron in
the dust produced in certain steel making operations. The PI proposes to promote
the magentic separation of the zinc in the form of zinc ferrite (ferrimagnetic)
from the iron by conversion of the zinc ferrite to paramagnetic zinc oxide by a
heat treatment process.
