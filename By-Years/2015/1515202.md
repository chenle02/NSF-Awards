Knowing the location and evolution of transport barriers within a fluid provides
an important tool in predicting how particles disperse, a prime example being
how an oil spill spreads on the ocean surface. A turbulent, two-dimensional
fluid, like the surface of the ocean, can have distinct regions where the fluid
does and does not mix, which determines how particles are transported across the
surface of the fluid. Those non-mixing regions are known as transport barriers,
as particles outside cannot move into or across the transport barrier. This
project will use laboratory-produced two-dimensional turbulence to
experimentally test and refine recently developed, novel mathematical methods
for identifying transport barriers. This research will be conducted in
collaboration with Dr. Hua Xia, an expert in experimental two-dimensional fluid
turbulence, at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.

Historically, identifying coherent structures (transport barriers) in a fluid by
way of finite time Lyapunov exponents is an intensive task that requires
detailed resolution of the fluid velocity field. Recently, mathematical methods
for identifying coherent structures based on braid theory have been developed
and applied to several test cases. These methods are advantageous as they can
identify coherent structures from a small number of surface particle
trajectories, decreasing the computational cost and increasing the method
applicability. This research will implement and improve the braid-theoretic
identification scheme by testing the algorithms with surface particle
trajectories taken from experiments in which turbulence is driven by Faraday
waves. This project aims to develop a computational framework that can then be
applied in situ to surface particle trajectories both inside and outside of
laboratory experiments.
