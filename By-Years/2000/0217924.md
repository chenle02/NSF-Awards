Flexibility allows firms to compete more effectively in today's world of
substantial price and demand uncertainty, product variety, short product life
cycles, and rapid product development. In order to benefit from flexibility,
managers and manufacturing systems must react to events as they unfold. The real
options approach seeks to quantify just how valuable flexibility really is. It
incorporates both the uncertainty that is inherent in business and the active
intervention required for a strategy to succeed. The purpose of this research is
to develop an evaluation approach to quantify flexibility in manufacturing
operations in order to improve operational decision making. Specifically, the
objectives are to (1) capture and (2) value that flexibility using a real
options framework. In order to accomplish these objectives, the first research
task will be to develop a model for multi-period options because there is
usually a lag between the time when a decision to exercise an alternative option
is made and when that alternative option can be implemented. The second research
task is to develop a Monte Carlo simulation approach for valuing multi-time
period options that allows switches among several choices during a decision
horizon. Thus the third research task is to develop an efficient heuristic for
fast approximation of option values so that the approach will be practical for
industry application.&lt;br/&gt; This research is expected to make several
contributions. Foremost, it will bring state-of-the-art financial option
research to the area of manufacturing enterprises and emphasize realism by
collaborating with industry partners. Additionally, as the methodological
approach for valuing flexibility in manufacturing enterprises is developed,
software tools that can execute the valuation calculations will also be
generated. These tools and their research contexts will be incorporated into the
engineering curriculum. Finally, this work will promote the careers of
underrepresented faculty and students.
