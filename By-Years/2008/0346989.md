Many critical systems, including operating systems, embedded systems, and
communications systems, are low-level. That is, they require careful control
over hardware resources to implement needed functionality and to perform well.
Low-level software is increasingly common, so it must be reliable and secure,
but its increasing complexity makes doing so quite
difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is working to develop, implement,
apply, and evaluate programming language technologies to ensure the security and
reliability of low-level systems. The approach is to employ novel static
analysis techniques, mostly novel type checking and inference systems, for
automatically checking proper usage of idioms common to low-level software.
These idioms include manual memory management, concurrency, and dynamic
reconfiguration; their incorrect usage can lead to service failures, data
corruption, and security exploits. For assessment, the new techniques are being
incorporated into a new C-like programming language called Cyclone, which is
then used to build or port real low-level software, including device drivers,
network packet processors and servers, and embedded control software. These
systems are experimentally compared against traditionally-developed systems to
evaluate their flexibility, usability, and
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will result in new tools and
methodologies for building more reliable and secure low-level systems. By
validating these techniques on real low-level software, they will have strong
relevance and impact. All results will be presented in public forums
(conferences and journals) and as part of graduate and undergraduate education.
All developed software will be freely available, and usable to non-experts in
industry and education.&lt;br/&gt;
