ABSTRACT 9727102 This research focuses on ethnically and linguistically mixed
communities of northeastern Siberia to analyze past and present processes of
social and cultural exchange. The three communities chosen for study share
several features linked to Russian colonization of Siberia. Study methods
include archival research, semi-structured interviews, collection of oral
histories, and participant observation. The fieldwork compares concepts of
ethnic identity, social status, and political power across the three
communities. Results will be analyzed in a comparative perspective to shed light
on ethnic identity and the recognition of indigenous status in the circumpolar
north.
