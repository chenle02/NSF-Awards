This is a feasibility study for using hollow fibers for cyclic gas separation.
Hollow fibers of polypropylene with high surface area and low pressure drop are
used to replace packed beds. Two specific studies are undertaken in this
program. The first involves using hollow fibers filled with fluorocarbons to
absorb oxygen from air. During the high-pressure half cycle, enriched nitrogen
will be produced. During the low-pressure half cycle, enriched oxygen will be
produced. In the second study, 5A zeolite hollow fibers will be fabricated.
These hollow fibers will be used to replace packed beds in the separation of
alkane isomers. Branched isomers are produced during the high pressure half
cycle while n-alkanes are produced at low pressure. Success of these ideas would
lead to new and more efficient gas separation processes.
