The Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Professor Patrick L. Holland of the University of Rochester and
Professor Brian Edelbach of Monroe Community College for the investigation of
three- and four-coordinate iron-nitrene complexes. Their research shows the
influence of the coordination number and geometry of a metal on the rate of
hydrogen atom abstraction by the nitrene fragment. Oxidation-resistant
supporting ligands are designed to enable spectroscopic and crystallographic
studies on the reactive nitrene complexes. These studies lead to new designs for
amination and other catalytic reactions of iron. Undergraduate students from
Monroe Community College participate in summer research at the University of
Rochester. These students contribute to the synthesis of new ligands and gain
exposure to cutting-edge inorganic chemistry. The catalytic chemistry of iron
provides an inexpensive alternative to toxic, expensive heavy metal catalysts,
and thus this research provides a pathway to cheaper, safer routes to useful
chemicals. &lt;br/&gt;
