The College of Engineering at the University of Maryland College Park is
establishing seven fellowships to recruit women, minorities, and/or persons with
disabilities. Five departments in the College that will participate in this
program are aerospace; chemical, nuclear and materials; civil; electrical; and
mechanical engineering. The Dean of Engineering has appointed a Project Director
to head this effort. The program will be administered by a committee made up of
faculty members and administrators. The College, through the Graduate School,
will provide matching funds for seven fellowships; and the Dean of Engineering
has made commitments to continue the effort after NSF support ends by setting
aside fifteen graduate assistantships or fellowships.
