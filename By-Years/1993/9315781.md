George Stell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to continue his work in statistical mechanical studies of
liquids. The research focuses on understanding and predicting thermodynamics,
structure, and transport properties as a function of the underlying interactions
among the constituent molecules with a special focus on ionic and dipolar
fluids. The methodology which is used includes: 1) Ornstein-Zernike formalism
for treating molecular correlation functions between pairs of particles; 2)
Boltzmann's method which yields a hierarchy of equations relating molecular
distribution functions; 3) "replica" methods which enable one to relate
quenched-annealed systems to an equivalent class of fully equilibrated systems;
and 4) computer simulations. Studies to be conducted include: 1) phase
transitions and critical phenomena in ionic, dipolar and off-lattice spin
fluids; 2) Quenched-annealed binary mixtures; 3) Random sequential addition to
surfaces; and 4) spin glasses. Stell's research provides an important molecular
level understanding of the detailed interaction of molecular species in
condensed phases. This level of understanding is important in the field of
chemistry since the large majority of chemical reactions take place either in
aqueous solution or in the liquid phase. A more thorough understanding of the
thermodynamic and transport properties of condensed phase systems, particularly
ionic and polar fluids, will aid in the design and engineering of efficient
chemical engineering processes.
