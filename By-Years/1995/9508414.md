9508414 Royster The Department of Mathematics at the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte will purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated
to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be
used for several research projects, including in particular the work of three
Numerical Analysts and two Statisticians. The department started a new Ph.D.
program in Applied Mathematics in August, 1994. The new equipment purchased will
also be used to support research in the new doctoral program in computational
mathematics and applied statistics.
