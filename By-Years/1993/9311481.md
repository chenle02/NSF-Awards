9311481 Russell This research is an investigation of the establishment of
photosynthetic endosymbionts in algae. The symbiotic relationship between the
freshwater dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium acidotum, and the cryptophyte Chroomonas
will be used as a model system to study: 1) the mode of ingestion used by the
dinoflagellate; 2) the alterations of the dinoflagellate membrane following the
acquisition of the cryptophyte; and 3) the morphological changes occurring in
the cryptophyte chloroplast following ingestion. %%% There are no studies that
offer experimental evidence for adaptations that promote the acquisition of
chloroplasts in exchanges involving endosymbionts. This research is one of the
first investigations to examine this acquisition at the cellular level. The
results may provide an explanation for how different divisions of algae obtained
their chloroplasts. ***
