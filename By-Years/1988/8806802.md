Dr. Aigner and her colleagues will combine archaeological excavation with
analysis of historical documents to reconstruct pre- and protohistoric Aleut
social organization and determine how this changed over time. They will excavate
two sites located on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian archipelago. The older of
the two, the McLees Lake site, contains a number of individual household
dwellings. The more recent Reese Bay site preserves two multihousehold
longhouses. Large areas of both sites will be stripped and house boundaries and
inner partitions mapped. Cultural and faunal remains will be collected,
analyzed, and dated. The goal of the research is to trace the development of
social complexity among Aleut hunters and gatherers in the Aleutian Islands.
Both archaeological and ethnohistoric information suggest that in prehistoric
times Aleut society changed from a relatively egalitarian form of organization
to a more complex form characterized by a social and political hierarchy. Dr.
Aigner postulates that the McLees Lake and Reese Bay sites represent earlier and
later phases of this process. Through spatial analysis of house forms and burial
and material remains, one can determine the extent of hierarchical organization.
Unequal distribution of living space and an association of high prestige items
with specific burials or living areas indicate social inequality. This research
is important for several reasons. Many anthropologists believe that growth of
social complexity is a byproduct to the Neolithic revolution and that it was the
domestication of plants and animals which began the process which resulted
societies as we know them today. Others argue that complexity can develop in
groups which subsist by hunting and gathering, and this research will directly
address this issue. Secondly, in the passage of the Arctic Research Act, the
U.S. Congress has recognized the importance of a broad program of Arctic
research. Dr. Aigner's project will help to further this goal.
