The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2
of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program
Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;The Program recommends an award of $40,399 for the
purchase of the following: &lt;br/&gt;Ashtech ADU800 $10,374&lt;br/&gt;Network
Infrastructure Upgrade $5,400&lt;br/&gt;Niskin Bottle Refresh $24,625&lt;br/&gt;
