9319223 St. Johns In supporting the operation and development of the Interagency
Internet, the agencies of the Executive Committee of the Federal Networking
Council (FNC) incur a number of mutually chargeable expenses. To minimize funds
transfers, a "book" is kept on each agency and, when all potential mutual
expenses are known, a single net transfer of funds is made. This proposal
constitutes the reconciliation for FY93; it shows that ARPA is the creditor
agency and that NSF's share of the debt is $90,000.
