Crowdsourcing has had extraordinary success in solving a diverse set of
problems, ranging from digitization of libraries and translation of the
Internet, to scientific challenges such as classifying elements in the galaxy or
determining the 3D shape of an enzyme. By leveraging the power of the masses, it
is feasible to complete tasks in mere days and sometimes even hours, and to take
on tasks that were previously impossible because of their sheer scale.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the question of whether the same
kinds of successes that crowdsourcing is having in revolutionizing other domains
can be brought to software development. As compared to crowdsourcing in other
domains, however, software is particularly challenging to crowdsource: it is
inherently non-uniform, steeped with dependencies, difficult to describe in
terms of the functionality desired, and can be implemented in any number of
ways. The fundamental question that we address in this research, then, is how
the nature of software impacts what may and may not be possible in terms of
crowdsourcing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific outcomes from this research will
include: (1) theoretical understandings of crowd programming in terms of whether
it can be achieved, in which form(s), under what conditions, and with which
benefits and drawbacks, (2) a publicly available crowdsourcing platform,
CrowdCode, that offers a tool set specifically designed to address the
intricacies of crowd programming, and (3) lessons learned from our project that
could well influence crowdsourcing research in other domains, as the broader
crowdsourcing community is actively seeking to understand how to support more
complex, interdependent tasks.
