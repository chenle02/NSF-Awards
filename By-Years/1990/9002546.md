This investigation is concerned with automated theorem proving in the typed
lambda calculus and with properties of the lambda calculus. The typed lambda
calculus is a formulation of higher-order logic well suited to the formalization
of mathematics and other disciplines. The lambda calculus is both a logical
theory and a model of computation. It is fundamental to both higher-type theorem
proving and functional programming language design. Previous research has shown
that one can search for a proof of a theorem of typed lambda calculus by
searching for an expansion proof in natural deduction style. Research will
continue on methods for finding expansion proofs, on various aspects of the
lambda calculus, and on related problems and questions. Development of an
existing computerized theorem proving system called TPS will continue. It will
be enhanced as a practical and convenient tool for investigating methods of
searching for expansion proofs, translating back and forth between expansion
proofs and natural deduction proofs, and constructing and checking formal proofs
interactively, semi-automatically, and automatically.
