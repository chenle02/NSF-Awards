9503701 Xiao A packaged commercial dilution refrigerator will be acquired and
its usage will be divided among four research projects requiring experiments at
millikelvin temperatures. One project studies quantum phase- coherent transport
in normal-superconducting metal mesoscopic structures. The new quantum transport
phenomenom reveals itself in the low temperature range. A second project
investigates semiconductor devices exhibiting quantum transport effects such as
resonant tunneling, ballistic transport over macroscopic distances, and Coulomb
blockade. Low temperature transport measurements will be performed on
semiconductor nanostructures of adjustable dimensionality and lateral extent. A
third project will use the dilution refrigerator to test ultra-sensitive
millimeter-wave detectors developed to study the background radiation of the
universe. To achieve the required sensitivity, these detectors have to be
operated at millikelvin temperatures. The fourth project studies phonon
propagation in layered compounds and the effects of disorder on the scattering
of phonons in crystalline solids at very low temperatures. %%% The acquisition
of a single instrument for experiments impacting a wide range of fields is very
cost effective. Quantum transport phenomena play an important role in small
structures that are the result of the ever- decreasing dimensions of
microelectronic devices. ***
