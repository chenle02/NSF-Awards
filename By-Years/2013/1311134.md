The 9th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day,
directed workshop on "Geometry and Groups after Thurston", to be held at the
Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 27-31, 2013.
The workshop will consist of a two-day minicourse for graduate students and
junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. This past year has
seen the passing of William P. Thurston (1946-2012) whose work and conjectural
program infuenced much of the research in the field over the past three decades.
Also, recent progress has seen most of Thurston's conjectural program now
solved. This year's workshop aims to consider new directions of research and new
problems which will direct future research in the spirit of Thurston's original
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton
Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques
among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to
support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring
together leading researchers in geometry and topology with graduates students
and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to group
theory and low-dimensional geometry to investigate questions at the forefront of
research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will
result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of
the participants. The workshop website is located at
