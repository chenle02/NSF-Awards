The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry, with
co-funding from the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program in the
Division of Biological Infrastructure, supports Prof. Darryl Bornhop of
Vanderbilt University to enhance understanding and extend application of
backscattering interferometry (BSI) to investigate molecular interactions that
are difficult to study by other methods. Specifically, Dr. Bornhop's group is
testing applicability of BSI for quantifying the influence of immobilization and
structural modifications on molecular interaction binding affinity, and for
studying interactions and chemical reactions in non-aqueous solvents.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students in the
interdisciplinary Bornhop group will participate in the research, results of
which will be disseminated via the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science as
well as by conventional means. By enabling study of molecular interactions in
solution at physiological or biochemically relevant concentrations, and with
nanoliter samples, this work will allow consideration of a wide array of
biological and chemical problems previously considered intractable. Broad
societal impact may result, including enabling of sub-micron scale synthesis.
