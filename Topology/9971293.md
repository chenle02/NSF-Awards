9971293 Klein Let P and N be manifolds, where P is compact. This project
analyses the homotopy type of E(P,N) = the space of embeddings from P to N. The
aim will be to establish ``multiple disjunction'' results for spaces of
embeddings. Applications of multiple disjunction are to include:

1. the finite generation of the homotopy groups of E(P,N) in positive degrees
when N is euclidean space,

2. bordism theoretic obstructions to embedding beyond the metastable range, and

3. the study of higher order linking phenomena.

Manifolds are spaces having a homogeneity property: they locally ``look like''
euclidean space. Manifolds are fundamental objects of mathematical research. One
approach to studying them is to try to decide when one manifold ``sits inside''
another one. This gives rise to the notion of ``embedding.'' Specifically, an
embedding of a manifold P in a manifold N is a function from P to N such that no
two points of P are mapped via the function to the same point of N. The set of
all embeddings from P to N forms a topological space E(P,N), called the
``embedding space.'' The goal of this project is to understand better the space
E(P,N) by importing techniques from the field of algebraic topology. ***
