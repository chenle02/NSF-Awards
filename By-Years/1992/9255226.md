The American Chemical Society will send twenty participants to the Twelfth
International Conference on Chemical Education to be held in Bangkok, Thailand
17-21 December, 1992. Ten of these participants will be selected from the area
of K-12 chemistry education; the other ten from the area of undergraduate
chemistry education. Attendance at past conferences in this series, funded in
part by NSF, have been fruitful for chemustry education in the United States as
a result of the interactions of people, information, and ideas. Teachers and
professors selected for this project will be assigned specific information-
gathering tasks and will follow-up after the conference by disseminating the
information at the local, regional, state, and national levels. In addition,
each participant will write a paper to be submitted for publication. Ten of
these papers will be selected for presentation at a 1993 meeting on science
education.
