9451529 Davis Chesterfield-Marlboro Technical College, a small (1,020-student),
rural two-year college engaged in technician education at the Associate degree
level, proposes to improve its approach to Machine Tool Technology instruction
through the development of a laboratory course in Integrated Manufacturing
Systems. The new course will provide a laboratory environment centered around a
modular integrated manufacturing cell, permitting students to perform
experiments and develop scientific and technical skills in the fields of applied
metallurgy, precision measurement, statistical process control, robotics,
metalworking, computer numerical control, and programmable logic controller
theory in any integrated format which simulates the interactive, process-based
technology of modern manufacturing. While the college presently teaches the
individual skills described above, there is no opportunity for students to
perform experiments and projects which apply these techniques in the
collaborative, integrative structure which is typical of a modern production
environment. The equipment required to develop the proposed course includes a
lab-scale Computer Integrated Manufacturing cell, together with a personal
computer for process input and statistical process control data analysis, and
two computer output devices.
