Translation is a key which gene expression can be regulated. Mutations that
alter translation initiation in yeast have been defined positive (GNC) and
negative (GCD) translation regulators of the transcriptional activator encoded
by GCN4. The objective of this proposal is to determine the basis for genetic
interactions between two of these translational regulators, those encoded by
GCN3 and GCD11. GCN3, which has been characterized at the molecular level, also
exhibits both genetic and biochemical interactions with translation initiation
factor eIF-2. We have cloned the GCD11 gene and now propose to characterize
GCD11 at the molecular level by determining its nucleotide sequences, its
requirement for viability, and its patten of transcription and translation. We
will raise antibodies against GCN3 and yeast eIF- 2, to seek physical evidence
for interactions among these gene products. These studies are important for
bridges the gap between extensive in vitro biochemical analyses of translation
factors and their proposed roles in vivo.
