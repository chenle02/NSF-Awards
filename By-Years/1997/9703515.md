Abstract Xia Xia will study certain automorphisms on the full Toeplitz algebra
which are induced by homomorphisms of the unit circle. He will study the problem
of simultaneously diagonalizing all the Lipschitz functions on a given metric
space modulo norm ideals of compact operators, and the dynamical systems related
to a class of Schrodinger operators. Another line of research involves
Hamiltonian operators in various physical models. One example of this is the
two-dimensional Coulmob interactions in a homogeneous magnetic field which arise
in the study of fractional quantum Hall effect. The study of linear operators
acting on Hilbert spaces can be viewed as an extension of linear algebra to an
infinite dimensional setting. It has historical origins and applications in such
fields as partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics.
The work of Xia is concerned with certain operators that arise from physical
considerations and have significant application.
