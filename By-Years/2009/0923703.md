This U.S- Guyana Planning Visit proposal will support PIs Dr. Neil Whitehead and
Dr. Michael Heckenberger on a planning visit to Mr. George Simon from the
University of Guyana and coordinator of the Ameridian Research Unit, August of
2009. The primary goal of the visit is to do collaborative preparation and a
pilot study to assess archaeological deposits around the Lokono traditional
village of Hitia, Guyana that will provide the groundwork for developing a
comprehensive, multi-year project. The interdisciplinary team proposed for
future research involves faculty researchers from the University of Wisconsin
and Florida, the Florida Museum of Natural History, and the Land Use and
Environmental Change Institute at UF as well as individuals from other
universities and organizations in the U. S and abroad. The project will provide
diverse opportunities for student participation and will promote understanding
and interest in issues of conservation, development, and the interplay of
cultural and natural processes in the Neotropics.
