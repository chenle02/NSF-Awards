This special award will give graduate student Xavier Lopez additional
flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and research initiation in
geography. The award will permit this student to take additional technical
courses and to attend a professional meeting. His research will focus on the use
of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for assessing the environmental impacts
of urban development. This award grows out of a special program in the NSF
Biological, Behavioral, and Social Sciences Directorate to enhance the graduate
education of previous applicants for minority fellowships who were awarded
honorable mention ratings. This award should strengthen research participation
in geography and regional science by a promising student who is a member of an
underrepresented minority group.
