It is important to continue searching for new approaches that will allow the
economic recovery of proteins via plasma fractionation. The proposed workshop
will bring together experts from industry and academia to probe the many
questions concerning protein recovery and attempt to lay out a workable strategy
for protein recovery that will consider the many pitfalls in this competitive
industry. Many people are suffering and dying from hereditary diseases caused by
protein deficiencies or imbalances. There are more than one dozen known plasma
proteins that might be recovered with the application and refinement of existing
and/or developing separation and purification techniques. Most of these proteins
are high molecular weight (<50,000) and therefore, it is purely speculative as
to when or if ever they will be manufactured by rDNA techniques or chemical
synthesis.
