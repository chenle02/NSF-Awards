This conference will highlight scientific as well as engineering aspects of
enzyme technology. The program will include sessions devoted to improved
biocatalysts through genetic engineering, new biomolecules with enzyme- like
properties (for example, catalytic antibodies), applications of enzymes in
synthesis, and biocatalyst and bioreactor design.
