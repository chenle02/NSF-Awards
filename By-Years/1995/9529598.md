This investigation aims to develop a time-dependent theory of magnetospheric
substorms, with correct time scales for the growth phase, the pre-onset interval
and the expansion phase. The study will use an analytical model and a two-
dimensional, low- dissipation, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model developed under a
previous award. The model includes the geometrical and dynamical features of
current sheets in the early growth phase and the pre- onset interval, and
clarifies the role of forced reconnection. The investigation involves the study
of the role of collisionless effects, the role of ideal ballooning/kink
instabilities in the magnetotail, and the role of ionospheric boundary
conditions. Emphasis will be on obtaining the correct time-history and spatial
signatures found by observations in the growth and expansion phases of
substorms.
