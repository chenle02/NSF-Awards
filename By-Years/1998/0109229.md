This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding
how membrane proteins involved in sporulation reach their proper locations." All
cells can target proteins to specific locations, but the mechanism for this
process is poorly understood in bacterial systems. During sporulation in
Bacillus subtilis, many membrane proteins are specifically localized within the
cell to division sites. Through mutant analyses and fluorescence microscopy
using GFP fusions, this research is gaining a more detailed picture of how
bacteria send proteins to specific regions of the cell.
