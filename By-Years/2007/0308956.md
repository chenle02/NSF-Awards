The mechanism by which circulating estradiol initiates a surge of luteinizing
hormone (LH) from the pituitary, thereby triggering ovulation, has remained a
mystery of human physiology, despite two decades of intensive biological and
medical research. The transient resonance model developed by the PI and her
collaborators is the first mathematical model of the LH surge to unify the
experimental data on multiple time scales with the surprising hormone
replacement pulse frequency characteristics required to treat infertility
disorders such as Kallmann's syndrome. The model predicts that the pituitary
gland has an intrinsic rhythm that depends on levels of circulating steroids,
and that pituitary response to pulsatile hypothalamic stimulus depends on
frequency interactions between the hypothalamic and pituitary rhythms. The PI
will spend a year working in the McCobb lab in the Department of Neurobiology
and Behavior at Cornell University. The objectives are: (1) Learn the language
and basic techniques of experimental neuroscience. (2) Experimentally test the
model predictions by driving whole pituitaries in different steroid environments
in vitro. (3) Collect preliminary data to develop mutually driven mathematical
and experimental approaches to local (small cell networks) and global (whole
pituitary) investigation of the broad ranging questions raised by the model
about frequency interactions between different endocrine axes within the
pituitary. Understanding the fundamental structure through which the
hypothalamus and pituitary interact has a wealth of medical applications. For
the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis alone, these include ovarian and breast
cancer, the passage to menopause, hormone replacement therapy, infertility
diagnosis and treatment, and contraception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS
