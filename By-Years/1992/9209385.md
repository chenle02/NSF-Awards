The PI's long term goal is to study fault activity in southern California using
geodetic data. The first step is to determine a velocity model for southern
California. The three geodetic data types which she plans to use are very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI), the Global Positioning System (GPS), and
electronic distance measurements (EDM). The second step is to convert these
surface measurements to infer slip on known faults in southern California.
Faults contribute differently to the measured surface velocity depending on
their slip rate and geometry. She has worked with GPS data and VLBI solutions
since 1988. She will visit and work at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park
where EDM data collection in California was directed.
