This research investigates distributed trust management as
an&lt;br/&gt;alternative to traditional authentication and access control
schemes&lt;br/&gt;in dynamic and pen computing environments such as multiagent
systems,&lt;br/&gt;web services and pervasive computing. Distributed trust
management&lt;br/&gt;handles security with techniques used in human societies,
where people&lt;br/&gt;are judged on their abilities, assets, relationships and
reputations.&lt;br/&gt;Authorization decisions are made through the application
of relevant&lt;br/&gt;security and trust policies, expressed in a high-level
declarative&lt;br/&gt;language. The policies define rules and constraints on
agents (human&lt;br/&gt;or software) and the actions they can take on objects in
terms of&lt;br/&gt;their credentials and properties. This work extends the
principles of&lt;br/&gt;trust management with deontic notions of rights,
obligations, and&lt;br/&gt;prohibitions. An ontology grounded in a semantic
language (e.g., RDF,&lt;br/&gt;DAML or OWL) is used to represent security
information constituting&lt;br/&gt;credentials, policies, beliefs, and proofs as
well as relevant&lt;br/&gt;domain-specific properties to characterize the
agents, actions and&lt;br/&gt;objects. An important results will be a better
understanding of how&lt;br/&gt;the semantic web can address the critical issues
of security, trust&lt;br/&gt;and privacy in distributed open environments. The
new concepts and&lt;br/&gt;techniques will be evaluated and demonstrated through
the&lt;br/&gt;implementation of prototype tools and applications&lt;br/&gt;
