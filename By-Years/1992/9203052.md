This is grant is directed to experimental research on icosahedral phase
formation and stability in selected alloys. Emphasized are (1) determination of
the atomic structure of the bcc Ti-Cr-Si approximant from precision powder and
single crystal X-ray diffraction studies; (2) expansion of the investigation
into related phases discovered in the Ti-Zr transition metal alloys; (3)
measurement of low and high temperature resistivity in bcc Ti-Cr-Si to compare
with the transport properties already measured in Al crystalline approximants;
(4) estimation of the glass-to- icosahedral phase and glass-to-alpha phase
interfacial energies in Al-Mn-Si; (5) extension of an atomic model for Al-Mn to
predict the structure of Al-Co-Cu. %%% Research on icosahedral phase structure
and stability provides an important link to metallic glasses and complex
intermetallic alloys. Understanding formation of these phases is required for
improved metal alloy design.
