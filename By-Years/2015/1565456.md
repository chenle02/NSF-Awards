Industries in America continue to throw away millions of CO2 into the
atmosphere. This team aims to develop a modular, low-capex reactor that converts
CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals that are cost-competitive with
conventional products. At Stanford, the NSF-funded graduate work demonstrated
electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ECO2R) into 16 different fuels and chemicals.
The top eight products represent nearly $400 billion in global market size. An
ECO2R device could bolt onto any existing source of industrial CO2 emissions,
and with only water and electricity as inputs, transform CO2 onsite into some of
the world?s highest-volume chemical products.

The goals of this project are to identify and validate the customers, key
partners, channels and revenue streams the team would need to take the proposed
technology to market. The team plans to interview various CO2 emitters such as
corn ethanol plants, steel manufacturers and oil refineries. The team will
target liquid fuels initially, specifically ethanol, because it has identified a
strong value proposition in a large initial target market, the technological
feasibility for ethanol is high, and the economics for ECO2R are compelling
relative to conventional ethanol manufacture
