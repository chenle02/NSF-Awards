This grant funds the San Diego group for work on Fermilab Experiment 665, Muon
Deep Inelastic Scattering. This experiment has taken several years to construct
and is now ready for major data-taking runs. It will measure nucleon structure
functions in ranges of momentum and energy transfers not reached before in other
experiments. Studies will be made of quark and diquark fragmentation, and the
use of different nuclear targets will permit further exploration of the quark
momentum distributions in nuclei. The experimental measurements done in this
project use high energy charged particles to probe the structure of the proton
and of nuclei. The measurements can be analyzed to determine the behavior of the
quarks, the constituents of the proton. This type of experiment was one of the
first to reveal the existence of quarks and continues to provide new information
about the way protons, neutrons and nuclei are put together.
