Jackson State University will establish a virtual proposal development center
(VPDC) to support small and midsized Historically Black Colleges and
Universities by providing guidance to faculty at participating institutions in
pre-proposal activities, including identification of appropriate funding
opportunities and development of research concepts. The project aligns with the
goal of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program
to provide assistance to its community to increase faculty research capacity.
The project's potential for transformative impact is based both on its
uniqueness as an approach to supporting small, resource-impoverished
institutions and on the promise it offers to increase collaborations between
scholars at different institutions. The structure of the project will encourage
collaborations between institutions and across science, technology, engineering
and mathematics disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of
the VPDC are the following: (1) identifying the specific pre-proposal and
proposal preparation needs of the targeted institutions; (2) developing
mechanisms for identifying appropriate funding opportunities for the targeted
institutions; (3) building a repository of proposal preparation materials; (4)
assisting faculty at targeted institutions to develop concepts in line with
published solicitations; and (5) establishing mechanisms for self-sustaining
proposal development at participating institutions, including peer-mentoring,
peer review teams, and mentoring relationships between faculty and sponsored
research personnel at participating institutions. Each cohort of faculty and
sponsored-research staff will complete a twelve-week online course and take part
in at least one three-day writing retreat. An ongoing evaluation will assess
whether or not the VPDC meets the specific needs of the participating
institutions.
