9319451 Magasanik This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on integrative
approaches to molecular biology. The organizers are Professor Boris Magasanik of
MIT and Professor Julio Collado of the Center for Research on Nitrogen Fixation
in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The workshop intends to bring together experimentalists
and theoreticians from the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and Europe to discuss the
possibility of an integrated approach to current and future problems in
molecular biology. As progress in the field of molecular biology continues,
there is need for more integrated approaches that will permit better use of
increasing data and results. In this context, the workshop will include
discussions of artificial intelligence and genome projects, theoretical and
experimental approaches to gene regulation, metabolism and integration in
bacteria, protein analysis, and evolution. An expected outcome will be a
monograph containing the discussions and conclusions of the meeting. ***
