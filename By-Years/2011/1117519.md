The project exploits the sophisticated and robust machinery of bacteria for
actuation, sensing, communication, and control of a new class of micron scale
robotic systems called BacteriaBots. This is achieved through (1) computational
modeling of bio-actuation and sensing, (2) use of quorum sensing-based
behaviors, and (3) use of mobile networks of
BacteriaBots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort contributes to the critical
understanding required to advance the science of bio-hybrid micro-robotics and
distributed control at reduced length scales. This holds enormous promise for
socio-economic benefit by significantly impacting the fields of bio-sensing,
medicine, micro-manufacturing and assembly, microelectronics, and bio-materials.
A multi-tier education and outreach plan integrates research elements and
discoveries into multi-disciplinary educational research experiences for K-12,
undergraduate and graduate students.
