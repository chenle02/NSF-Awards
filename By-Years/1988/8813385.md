The insect collection of the American Entomological Institute, containing
822,000 specimens, emphasizes parasitoid Hymenoptera. As natural enemies of
other insects, hymenopteran parasitoids are extremely important as biological
control agents of agricultural pests. The Entomological Institute's holdings of
Hymenoptera are among the largest in the world, and the collection is used
heavily in research. This award will provide funds for a collection manager for
three years, to keep the collection available to visitors, process loans of
specimens, catch up with a backlog of specimens to be mounted, labeled, and
sorted, enhance the taxonomic arrangement so that specimens are more readily
available, and keep up with the normal influx of specimens into the collection.
The award will also provide new collection storage equipment to accommodate
near-term expansion.
