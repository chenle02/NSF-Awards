The three dimensional structure of the proteins involved in the
phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) will be determined by
x-ray crystallography. This complex multi-enzyme system is one of the few
transport systems whose components, including some of the membrane bound ones,
have been purified. The crystallography will complement the molecular biology
and biochemical aspects of a collaborative effect to study the mechanism by
which bacteria employ a protein phosphoryl transfer chain to regulate sugar
transport across the membrane. The structure determination of the various
proteins will facilitate the analysis of the nature of regulation by protein
phosphorylation, and the conformational transition that accompanies such
processes. Since the PTS is unique to bacteria, the information obtained may
pertain to our ability to take advantage of the PTS therapeutically. At this
state, the focus is on the soluble proteins. Similar approaches will be used to
obtain information about the phosphorylated structures of the other PTS
proteins. Structure determination will be done either by the Multiple
Isomorphous Replacement or by the Molecular Replacement methods, depending on
the problem. For better accuracy, the determined structures will be refined to
the highest resolution possible. Once structures become available, mutants that
probe the protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions will be designed
and analyzed biochemically, and selected interesting mutants will be
crystallized and their structure determined.
