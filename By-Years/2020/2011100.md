The Topology Students Workshop (TSW) will be held at Georgia Institute of
Technology during June 6-10, 2022. This conference is a 5-day research and
professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of
geometric group theory, geometry, and topology. Its primary goals are to a)
expose graduate students to a wide range of current research in topology, b)
build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills, and c) give
guidance on necessary but typically untaught aspects of the profession.
Approximately 50 graduate students will participate, guided by 10 mentors, who
come from a wide range of career stages and represent a broad array of topics
within geometry and topology including contact and symplectic topology,
3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The
conference provides the participants, especially those from underrepresented
groups, with many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the
highest levels, in graduate school and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For many of
the students, the TSW is the first conference they attend and at which they
present their own results. The workshop is designed to facilitate this
experience (for instance, our first professional development session is an
introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them). The goal is to
build confidence and research potential among students, as well as to build
community. The skills addressed here are not typically taught in grad school and
can be disproportionately beneficial to students from minority groups, as
indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the
program. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in
tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas. The workshop includes
structured sessions on networking and etiquette, the job application process,
communication skills, and a panel discussion on career paths (which also
involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and
private high schools). Mentors also give research talks, both to model good
communication and introduce their research areas (deliberately chosen broadly)
and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career.
Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to
workshopping presentations in small groups; the final presentations are
videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance. The web site for the conference

statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
