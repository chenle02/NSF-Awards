An important sensory appendage for insects is the flagellum of the antenna,
containing thousands of receptors called sensilla that have been classified into
types, including some specialized for chemosensory functions. The nerve from the
flagellum contains many nerve fibers, or axons, which form particular groupings
when they enter the brain and terminate in distinctive structures called
glomeruli. Each glomerulus is a sphere-like complex in which nerve cells make
functional contacts called synapses, where interactions occur between incoming
and outgoing information, modulated by local nerve cells. The glomerular
structure in insects has several similarities to the glomerulus also found in
the vertebrate olfactory bulb, and it is believed that this structure forms an
information processing module for synaptic interactions. This work will focus on
how olfactory information is mapped in the glomeruli, to see whether in insects
olfactory receptors are represented in different glomeruli according to their
functional tuning, their antennal location, or both. Light microscopy and
electron microscopy will be used to clarify the architecture underlying the
connections between neurons that provide input and output, and the convergence
and local circuits that process olfactory information. The insect system offers
an advantageous model because it is possible find uniquely identifiable single
neurons in the brain. Results from this work will be valuable to understanding
information processing in general, to chemosensory neuroscience in the
vertebrates as well as invertebrates, to studies on insects as model systems
during neural development of highly specific neural connections, and to
agriculturally related studies of insect feeding or reproduction which have
chemosensory components.
