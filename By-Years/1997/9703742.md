ECS-9703742 Khalil It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output
feedback control of a class of nonlinear systems. The class of systems to be
considered is the class of input-output linearizable systems, which arise in
many applications such as robotic manipulators, aircraft control, and electric
machines. The design procedure starts with the design of a state feedback
control followed by the design of a robust observer to recover performance
achieved with state feedback. The performance of such observers are usually
hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively large
transient response. The principal investigator has shown that the undesirable
transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback control to be
globally bounded. This proposal aims at developing a comprehensive theory for
the design of globally bounded output feedback controllers. Problems to be
investigated include nonlinear separation principle, adaptive control,
multivariable systems, application to induction motors, and implementation
issues.
