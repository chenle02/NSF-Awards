April 21, 2003 is the closing date for NSF's High Performance Network
Connections (03-529) solicitation. HPNC proposals are complex documents that
include many nuances and requirements. This workshop will take the participants
through the proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing
their proposals. This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and
research justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget,
format and narrative requirements.

The workshop will be a one day event, facilitated by experienced individuals.
The workshop is open to all potential PIs. PIs who have not had previous
experience writing a proposal and PIs from institutions underrepresented in the
advanced networking environment are particularly encouraged to attend.
