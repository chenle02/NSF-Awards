9316937 Grossman This award provides 35% of the funding required to purchase an
automated carbonate reaction system for the preparation of samples prior to mass
spectrometric analysis. The equipment is to be installed and operated in the
mass spectrometry laboratory in the Department of Geology at the Texas A &amp; M
University. Texas A &amp; M University is committed to providing the remaining
funds needed for the purchase. The Principal Investigator and colleagues are
engaged in research to understand the relations between climate changes and
isotopic variation signals as seen in the carbon and oxygen isotopic composition
of carbonate shelled organisms living in the ocean. The work requires analysis
of large numbers of small carbonate samples for which the new automated sample
preparation system is needed. ***
