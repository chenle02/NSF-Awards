Sean Seymore, Department of Chemistry, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.
Seymore's research includes the synthesis and characterization of new metal-oxo
and -nitrido complexes supported by sulfur-rich tripodal ligands. Ligands such
as phenyltris((methylthio)methyl)borate (PhTt) and
hydridotris(methimazolyl)borate (Tm) provide a "softer" ligand environment than
the more common nitrogen or oxygen donor ligands. The change in ligand may
result in enhanced reactivity or unusual electronic properties in the metal-oxo
and -nitrido complexes.

Metal-oxo and -nitrido complexes are of interest as possible models of important
reactive intermediates in catalysis, nitrogen fixation, and many other
biological processes. Minority Research Planning Grants are intended to
strengthen the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new investigators
and to facilitate preliminary studies and other planning activities related to
the research.
