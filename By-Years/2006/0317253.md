This project will examine the onset and evolution of collisionless magnetic
reconnection in plasmas. It will utilize a variety of techniques, including a
finite-element stability analysis, particle simulations and new classes of self-
consistent kinetic models of thin current sheets. The 1-D finite-element
analysis will be extended to 2-D cases and will be used to locate the position
of the initial X-line in plasma systems that are realistically representative of
the earth's magnetotail. The studies of X-line reconnection onset will focus on
the role played by transient electrons. Another form of reconnection, with the
Y-line topology, becomes possible due to concentration of the current density in
thin current sheets. In these cases, the onset of reconnection is driven by
current instabilities and the reconnection is promoted via anomalous
resistivity. These studies will be directly relevant to the problem of
magnetospheric substorms, but the underlying basic plasma physics will make the
results applicable to a broader range of plasma phenomena from laboratory
experiments to astrophysical phenomena such as the magnetospheres of compact
objects (neutron stars, black holes). The project will involve a graduate
student.
