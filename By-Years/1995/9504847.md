9504847 Comfort Research will be carried out in pion charge exchange and elastic
scattering reactions at the Los Alamos National Lab pion beam facility, and in
studies of the nucleon and few-nucleon systems using the electron scattering
facilities at MIT/Bates and at NIKHEF in Holland. The pion data will be used to
measure chiral symmetry breaking effects and give insight into the quark
structure and dynamics of the nucleon. The electron scattering work will focus
on deformation of the nucleon, charge structure of the neutron, flavor structure
of the nucleon, and the structure of few-nucleon systems. These experiments have
high priority within contemporary nuclear physics. Development, construction,
and utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment is integral to this
activity. Education of graduate students is a strong component in every aspect
of this grant. ***
