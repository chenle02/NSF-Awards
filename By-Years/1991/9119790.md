This action provides partial support for the Seventh International Workshop on
Fission-Track Thermochronology to be held during the week of July 13-17, 1992 at
the University of Pennsylvania. This field has experienced rapid development
since the last workshop on this subject four years ago and the outcome should be
of considerable benefit to Fission-Track geochronologists in their efforts to
date tectonic events by this method.
