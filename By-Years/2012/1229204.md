This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a radio-
frequency console for a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be operated at the
high-field NMR facility of the University at Buffalo (UB), The State University
of New York (SUNY). The new console will enable researchers to acquire NMR data
of unprecedented quality with high sensitivity and accuracy. Moreover, it will
become possible to detect NMR spectra of different types of atomic nuclei
simultaneously. The newly developed operating software installed on the console
will greatly simplify routine data acquisition and opens new opportunities to
implement outstandingly complex NMR experiments. As a result, the new console
will enable cutting-edge research in the areas of NMR-based (i) methodology
development, (ii) structural biology, (iii) metabolic profiling to diagnose
diseases, (iv) studies of organic structures of high interest for
nanotechnology, (v) studies of reactive intermediates of enzymatic reactions,
(v) investigation of novel types of materials such as solution-derived graphenes
and bottle-brush copolymers, (vi) detection of intermediates in organic
syntheses and characterization of complex alkaloids related to drug development,
and (vii) elucidation of novel reactions to chemically modify proteins in vitro
and in vivo. The UB NMR facility is accessible to other academic institutions in
the greater Buffalo area, such as the Roswell Park Cancer Research Institute and
colleges such as SUNY-Fredonia. Hence, the new console will greatly strengthen
the scientific infrastructure of Western New York. Furthermore, undergraduate
and graduate students as well as post-doctoral researchers will receive
excellent training in applying modern NMR spectroscopy to solve challenging
scientific problems of the 21st century. Undergraduate research is aggressively
promoted through NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) sites
and UB's Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) funded by the
State of New York State to provide services and resources to talented
underrepresented minority students. Research results obtained by using the new
console will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications, conference
presentations such as posters and talks, and internet based portals, such as the
NSF supported NMR 2.0 site (http://www.nmr2.buffalo.edu).
