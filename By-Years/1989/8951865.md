This award is made as part of the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program. This Program funds innovative new projects for undergraduate physics
laboratories. The project supported here will develop an experiment in radio
astrophysics, which will allow students to map various portions of the sky at 21
cm wavelength (the hydrogen hyperfine frequency.)
