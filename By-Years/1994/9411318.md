This project constructs a digital library testbed and pursues fundamental
research addressing the scalable organization of large digital collections. The
testbed contains a digital collection containing journals and magazines in the
engineering literature in structured SGML format plus pictorial materials
obtained from commercial and professional publishers. The associated information
systems initially centers about NCSA Mosaic for document display and network
access of other resources. Basic research encompasses both technical and social
aspects of the testbed capabilities, usage and usage patters including:
sociological analysis (including ethnographic observation, surveys and other
instruments); economics research over a range of issues. A general goal of the
efforts is to enable the design and analysis for digital libraries
infrastructure capable of scaling to very large systems.
