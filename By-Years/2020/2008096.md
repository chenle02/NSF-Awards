Modern information-processing systems handle large volumes of data that are
produced in real time and need immediate analysis. These real-time data analyses
are used to extract insights and enable decision-making in various application
domains, such as business intelligence and patient monitoring. Existing systems
for processing real-time (streaming) data focus on providing efficient and
scalable execution over a distributed computing infrastructure. A common problem
with these systems is that their behavior is not clearly specified, which makes
it difficult to reason about their correctness. In many cases, the distributed
execution of a streaming data analysis gives rise to unpredictable behavior that
is not reproducible. The project's novelties are the development of a formal
framework for specifying the behavior of real-time data-processing systems and
the use of this framework for ensuring the reproducibility of computations. The
project's impacts are advances in the practice of programming trustworthy and
repeatable streaming data analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops a
novel programming foundation that encompasses the semantics of data-stream
processing, the associated principles of query-language design, and a robust
distributed implementation. A denotational semantics is described using a type
discipline that captures various notions of data models and data invariants.
Basic programming abstractions for stream processing are identified, which
enable the modular specification of complex streaming analyses. An
implementation is developed that guarantees efficient and reproducible
distributed execution. The usefulness of the framework is established with case
studies from the domains of enterprise business intelligence and patient
monitoring in healthcare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
