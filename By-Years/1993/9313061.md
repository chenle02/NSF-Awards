9313061 Przymusinski This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. The main goal of the proposed research is to conduct a comprehensive
study of non-monotonic formalisms and logic programming semantics for the
purpose of developing and implementing formalizations that achieve greater
expressive power by allowing various forms of disjunctive reasoning.
Specifically, the following objectives will be achieved: 1) Study the basic
principles on which disjunctive reasoning should be based and develop extensions
of non-monotonic formalisms capable to properly represent disjunctive
information. Investigate relationships between different approaches and
determine their application domains. 2) Bridge the gap between non-monotonic
reasoning and disjunctive logic programming by investigating and developing
semantics for disjunctive logic programs and deductive databases that naturally
correspond to non-monotonic formalisms. Attempt to develop proof-theoretic
characterizations and computational techniques for these semantics and identify
classes of theories in which they are tractable. 3) Develop methods of
translation of broad classes of non-monotonic formalisms into disjunctive logic
programs and implement an experimental inference engine for non- monotonic
reasoning based on translation into disjunctive logic programs. 4) Apply the
resulting techniques to the domain of software engineering by using disjunctive
logic programming as a tool for software specification and verification of
program correctness. If successful, the proposed research program should not
only improve our understanding of basic foundations of non- monotonic reasoning,
but it also should move us closer towards the actual implementation of common-
sense reasoning systems by applying the increased expressive and computational
power of disjunctive logic programming. It should also facilitate the extension
of the logic programming paradigm to the class o disjunctive programs.
