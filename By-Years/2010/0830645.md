The following is a revised summary of the specific tasks that will be addressed

through this effort:



Develop automatic sparsity detection techniques for Jacobians and Hessians.

Implement the techniques in the Automatic Differentiation tool ADOL-C.



Further develop the coloring software package COLPACK and enhance it with

new bicoloring algorithms.



Apply Automatic Differentiation to a class of problems in chromatographic
separation techniques

in chemical engineering.



Develop interfaces between the software packages COLPACK and ADOL-C, to enable
its

wider applicability to optimization codes.



Develop efficient algorithms for the directed acyclic graph reversal problem in
adjoint computation.



Contribute to education and training in combinatorial scientific computing and

Automatic Differentiation by developing

a graduate level course, organizing mini courses and tutorials in conferences,
and

by writing expository articles and book chapters.





The PIs will make every attempt to meet the scope and level of effort of the
revised project.
