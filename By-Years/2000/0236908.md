OIA-0236908&lt;br/&gt;Richardson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to the
Potomac Institute For Policy Studies to conduct a study to define and document
likely S&amp;T trends and their impacts on national security over the next 20
years. In order to address the goal the following questions will be
addressed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-What S&amp;T trends are most likely to yield
products to benefit national security?&lt;br/&gt;-What S&amp;T trends are likely
to pose dangers to our society? &lt;br/&gt;-How are the important trends likely
to evolve and what indicators will herald new and significant capabilities or
threats?&lt;br/&gt;-Who will be the most likely producer of the necessary
capabilities and threats?&lt;br/&gt;-Are there roadblocks in the way of
scientific or technological progress that may deter these capabilities and
threats? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At least six S&amp;T areas will be examined
during the conduct of this project: Advanced Materials; Nanotechnology; Life
Sciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Energy; and Information
Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will feed into a
larger study (under multi-agency sponsorship) aimed at suggesting ways to
improve the quality of science and technology information involved in making
decisions on S&amp;T-laden issues at the national security level. This will
significantly enhance the nation's ability to develop strategies and policies on
issues with important scientific and technical content.&lt;br/&gt;
