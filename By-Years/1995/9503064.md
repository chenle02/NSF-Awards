9503064 Hollan This award provides support for visualization facilities, servers
to support distributed simulation, and a high-speed cluster network. In addition
the University of New Mexico will establish a National Information
Infrastructure (NII) Experimental Laboratory in the Science and Engineering
Library to serve as a shared research testbed, as well as to facilitate efforts
in distributed simulation and research collaborations in Biology, with the Santa
Fe Institute and the National Laboratories. The Laboratory equipment will
include graphics workstations connected via a high-performance local area
network to high-end symmetric multiprocessing systems, an SGI Power Onyx and
Power Challenge, and to remote high-performance facilities at the Maui High
Performance Computing Center's IBM SP-2, the Sandia National Laboratory's Intel
Paragon, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory's CM-5. The University will
build on its existing strengths in adaptive computation, human computer
interaction, information analysis, and simulation to focus on adaptive
multiscale interfaces; distributed computation, communication, and security for
network-based applications; data mining and filtering; and improved access to
distributed simulation.
