This SGER award is for the preparation of the molecular mechanics program
DUPLEX for release to the academic community of scientists. The program computes
energy minimized structures of DNA, and of DNA covalently modified by foreign
substances. It has several unique features that distinquish it from other state-
of-the-art molecular mechanics. These features make it particularly valuable to
scientists from various disciplines who wish to generate atomic resolution views
of such DNAs. Urgent requests for the code have had to be deferred because the
program is not ready for use by workers who cannot code in FORTRAN for a Cray
Supercomputer. DUPLEX, fully documented and automated to operate without
requirement for any FORTRAN coding will distributed via a suitable mechanism
such as the Quantum Chemists' Program Exchange.//
