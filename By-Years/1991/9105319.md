This project is for a geochemical and isotopic study of basalts and
differentiated lavas of two Samoan shield volcanoes. This will be the first
systematic evaluation of the full chemical stratigraphy of a Samoan shield
volcano, and will provide an important comparison to several volcanoes studied
in this way in Hawaii and Tahiti. The study can be accomplished using samples
already in existing collections, but the PIs also have the opportunity to carry
out some additional sampling and field studies in September, 1991. The effort
will focus on obtaining new isotopic data on 20-25 additional samples selected
on the basis of trace-element data, and acquisition of a much needed set of
rare-earth abundances throughout the range of lava compositions. These will be
particularly important to compare to analyses obtained by ion microprobe on
clinopyroxenes in Samoan ultramafic xenolith and on lava phenocrysts. This award
will also allow completion of a doctoral dissertation at Scripps Institution by
Julie Dieu.
