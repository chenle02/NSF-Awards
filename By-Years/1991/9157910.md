Theoretical and experimental studies of heat transfer phenomena will be
performed involving complicated microscopic interfaces related to (1) the
contact resistance problem and (2) solidification front evolution. The challenge
results from there being no separation of scale between the micro- level and the
averaging level, and the failure of microscopic measurement techniques in the
presence of delicate microstructures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be
used for non-invasive microscopy, concentration and velocity measurements close
to the solidification front, with a goal of achieving one micrometer spatial
resolution and velocities down to 0.1 mm/s. For the contact resistance problem,
an analytical model based upon a random distribution of finite area contact
spots will be developed. MRI will also be used in this problem to identify the
appropriate geometric parameters at the interface. Heat transfer problems of
significance to the development of miniaturized microelectronic components, to
advanced materials for the aerospace and biomedical industries, and to the
further understanding of the solidification of binary alloys in metal casting
will all be tackled by a unique application of MRI technology. This technique
will reveal new information previously unobtainable at the micrometer level.
