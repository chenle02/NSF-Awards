This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the
preparation and characterization of polymer based biodegradable nanoparticles of
novel inhibitors of cell proliferation. The development of polymer-based
biodegradable nanoparticles is guided by the desire to improve overall survival
and quality of life by increasing the bioavailability of drug to the site of
disease, containing delivery to the cancerous tissues, increasing drug
solubility, and minimizing systemic side effects. We have recently discovered
novel anti-cell proliferative compounds with specific and unique properties that
make them an ideal treatment for solid tumors. The main aim of this study is
preparation and characterization of nanoparticle formulations of our compounds.
The compounds studied in this project have a high chance of success during
clinical development because of the drugs are administered locally, which has
very little change of producing toxicity, but also the molecular targets of the
compound are proven to be safe therapeutic targets. Development of such novel
formulations will allow sustained delivery of novel inhibitors of cell
proliferation in the tumor site. The broader impact/commercial potential of this
project: Development of novel therapeutics that could be delivered locally into
tumor site is critically needed for several types of human malignancies.
Successful development of nanoparticle formulations of the compounds studies in
this project will, if successful, reduce healthcare costs by reducing the cost
of cancer therapy and by improving the survival and quality of life for many
patients under cancer chemotherapy. The nanoparticle formulations developed
under the proposed studies could replace several combination chemotherapy
regimens that have numerous side effects in addition to being very expensive.
