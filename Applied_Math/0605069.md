In this project we continue research on key mathematical problems related to the
study of entanglement in quantum mechanical systems, with potential application
to quantum computation. A central goal is to extend results on determining when
a system is truly in the quantum rather than the classical realm -- the
separability problem. These refinements will lead to a better understanding of
the mathematical models and the quantification of quantum information, and the
results may have impact on the design of experiments.

In the mid-nineties Peter Shor and Lov Grover announced quantum-computer based
algorithms that are provably more efficient than comparable algorithms based on
classical computers. Construction of a workable quantum computer is a major
challenge that requires a clear understanding of both theoretical and technical
issues. This research will contribute to that goal by further expanding our
understanding of the theoretical models of quantum information and the
applicability of those models to quantum computation.
