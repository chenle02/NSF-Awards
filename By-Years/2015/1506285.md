From robotic kits to modular electronic learning tools for sale on the market,
none of them offers miniature device building blocks. This I-Corps team proposes
a modular kit aiming to provide the users with a tool to shorten capsule robot
design and development time. It is similar to constructional robotic kits and
modular electronic learning tools currently available on the market, but
implements each module/device building block at the centimeter scale. The
proposed toolkit is expected to have a significant potential for
commercialization in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics (STEM) education, where it can provide an engaging learning-by-doing
experience to high school, undergraduate, and graduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed the STORM Lab
Modular Architecture for Capsules (SMAC). As a modular kit for capsule robots,
SMAC offers more than just rapid prototyping. It comes with a software
environment as a medium for everyone to study, understand, and adapt its
inherent open source knowledge into creative small-scale robots. Creating a
miniature device with SMAC is as easy as combining snap-on hardware modules,
while the software keeps track of any changes in the background and stays in
sync. This feature is the key element of SMAC's modular kit. It drastically
reduces the time required for hardware reconfiguration and software rework. The
commercial impact of SMAC may be comparable to the National Instruments Data
Acquisition hardware that has become the de facto standard of signal and data
acquisition, beyond the traditional analog hardware prototyping.
