9351000 Gutnikov In order to maintain the strength and currency of our
undergraduate analytical chemistry program, we are incorporating into our
curriculum practical work based on capillary electrophoresis (CE). This is
enabling our students to gain proficiency in this recently developed technique.
The experiment which is being carried out in the Separations Methods course has
been carefully designed to illustrate the complementary nature of CE to HPLC by
demonstrating its utility where liquid chromatography fails. An automated unit
is permitting students to develop awareness of the greatly increased workload
achievable with a state-of-the-art instrument. Students also are being compelled
to revise their notions concerning the planning and design of experiments in
order to fully exploit the productive capacity of a computer- controlled
instrument. The objectives in our ongoing research programs and mandatory senior
projects are being realized much more expeditiously with the CE instrument. ***
