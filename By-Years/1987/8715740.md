Computer simulations are another way of obtaining fundamental information about
interacting condensed matter in addition to traditional theoretical and
experimental approaches. Development and refinement of large scale computer
simulation approaches to study phase transitions in systems with competing
interactions, which are both more realistic as well as more difficult to treat
analytically than more simplistic models, will continue. Approaches which will
be used include Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo Renormalization Group, Molecular
Dynamics; and Spin Dynamics methods. Models which will be considered are
expected to be relevant to magnetic materials, cubic binary alloys,
physisorbed/chemisorbed monolayers on crystalline substrates, and disordered
media. Additional effort will be devoted to the study of linear and non-linear
excitations in low dimensional systems. The results will be compared with those
of theory and/or experiment.
