A thermodynamic model for equilibrium affinity partitioning will be developed
and tested experimentally. Critical experiments have been carefully devised to
test the model for the first time in the ideal case with 1:1 binding interaction
and minimal charge effect present. The evaluated model will facilitate study of
the interdependence of charge and affinity effects and allow determination of
the effective number of binding sites in more general cases. A secondary
objective of this project is to optimize the isolation of industrially important
antibiotics using the proposed model. The result of the research could lead to a
simple model which could be used for the development of new affinity
partitioning processes for large scale separation and purification of
biomolecules.
