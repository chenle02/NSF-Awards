The objective of the proposed SGER effort is to explore, develop, and evaluate
concepts for mobile robots with mobility, power, navigation, and communication
capabilities that enable deployment of mobile instrument networks on the
Antarctic plateau and that can be used in Arctic regions comprised of similar
terrain. The proposed research focuses on the design of robots that can deploy
such networks economically, with high reliability, and with minimal
environmental impact. Tasks target mobile robots designed for year-round
operation, with network deployment occurring during summer months, data
collection initiated after deployment and through winter months, and the network
returning to base or redeployed to new locations during the following summer.
The designs will be scalable for deployment of small (up to five kg) instruments
to large (greater than 25 kg) sets of instrumentation. A single robot will be
constructed and evaluated for mobile robot-based fluxgate magnetometer
deployment. Mobile robots capable of reliable, long-term operation on the
Antarctic plateau have the potential to enhance scientific research in
Antarctica through instrument deployment, mapping, and providing portable,
mobile power to field scientists. This research offers training opportunities
for students at all levels in the design, construction, and evaluation of robot
platforms suitable for operation on the Antarctic plateau
