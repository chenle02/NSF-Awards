9724991 Kang This proposal is on research to establish a safe, non- invasive,
and rapid computer aided diagnostic technique for the detection of malignant
skin tumors utilizing near infrared (NIR) multiple wavelength information (8
wavelengths from 450-800 nm at a 50 nm interval). The research objectives are:
(1) early detection of malignant skin tumors, which can not be confirmed by the
physician without biopsy, and (2) malignancy identification from multiple
suspicious moles (hundreds) from patients with atypical mole syndrome or with
dysplatic nevus syndrome. A preliminary study has been completed using
experimental tissue models with skin tumor models at four different hemoglobin
concentrations. The experimental results suggest that multi-spectral analysis of
NIR images can differentiate the four experimental models. The planning grant
seeks to carry this research to a point where a regular proposal can be
submitted. ***
