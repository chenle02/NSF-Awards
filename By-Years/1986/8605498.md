This grant will enable the purchase of a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrometer for use as an HPLC detector. This instrument (FTIR-HPLC) will allow
the principal investigator to elucidate the complex reaction chemistry of
biopolymer materials in supercritical fluids. The research objective is to
identify reaction conditions which selectively produce high value chemicals and
feedstocks from biopolymer materials.
