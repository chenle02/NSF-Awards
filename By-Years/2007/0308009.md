In today's organizations, many people have to work together even though they are
not collocated, using email, video and audio conferencing, voicemail, etc.
Remote team members typically feel that they suffer from having not only less
contact overall, but less rich information as well. How much of a disadvantage
do remote people have compared to those who are collocated? How much
productivity, trust and social capital is lost? This program of research
measures various losses using a new research vehicle, the long-term
organizational simulation. Participants engage in a task in which they simulate
buying and selling things to each other in a competitive market for weeks at a
time. In the course of buying and selling, they form impressions of each other,
make long standing deals, favor some suppliers over others with speedy reactions
and lower prices. Various theories predict how the losses will vary when the
numbers of remote people and their locations vary, and how various interventions
will help. This research will not only allow us to sort out predictions of some
major theories of relationship formation and social capital, but will advise
managers of distributed teams how to improve efficiency, effectiveness and the
morale of these teams.
