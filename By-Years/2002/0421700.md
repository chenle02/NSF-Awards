This project continues and expands a successful two-year-old CSEMS project. It
targets women and minorities through special recruiting efforts and includes
extensive student performance tracking. Special activities include a weekly
lunchtime colloquium and active ACM and Upsilon Pi Epsilon chapters. The current
CSEMS project is successful at retaining students and improving their academic
performance.
