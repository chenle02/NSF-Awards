Computers are increasingly used to monitor and manage many aspects of our daily
lives. These systems are often required to work together to solve complex
problems that are rapidly changing. Current approaches to addressing these
situations develop tailored distributed protocols that are verified through
empirical testing. This project increases the practical applicability of
distributed problem solving techniques by developing a theoretical model of
these problems based on thermodynamic theory. Using this model, a protocol's
performance can, for the first time ever, be predicted under previously untested
conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This theoretical model is validated through
extensive empirical evaluation and this project develops a new protocol that
alters its problem solving strategy to maximize the trade-off between deliberate
and reactive decision making based on environmental dynamics. This protocol is
applied to address a pressing practical problem: allocating telescopes for
tracking objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). With nearly all of our manned space
missions and satellites in LEO, effectively monitoring space debris has broad
implications to society at large and scientific progress along numerous
directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This transformative research combines cross-
disciplinary ideas from artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and
statistical physics. The educational initiatives in this project directly
address the recruitment and retention of students, especially focusing on women
and minorities, into Computer Science by generating excitement through the
Heartland Gaming Expo and by utilizing a new peer outreach program, called
Engineering Ambassadors.
