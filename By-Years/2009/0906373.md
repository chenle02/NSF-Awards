Professor Ronald W. Fawcett of the University of California-Davis is supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
study the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, and the anodic methanol oxidation
reaction. The reactions will be investigated using decorated catalysts in
aprotic media to separate the effects due to interactions of the reactant with
the catalyst surface from effects due to reactive intermediates arising from
water. The experimental work will involve electrochemical tecniques, including
cyclic voltammetry and faradaic admittance studies. In addition, FTIR
spectroscopy will be used to identify reactants and reactant intermediates at
the electrode / solution interface. Oxygen reduction occurs at the cathode of
every fuel cell and methanol oxidation to carbon dioxide and water is an
important area of fuel cell research. Students will be trained in this important
area of alternative energy research.
