This study comprises laboratory based investigation of phytoplankton decay in
which quantitative chemical measurements are conducted in tandem with
examinations of microbial activity. This information on selected algae in the
laboratory will assess the most appropriate methods for tracking microbial
activity. The aims of the project are: 1) To determine the changes in
phytoplankton as it is degraded in the water column in the laboratory under both
oxic and anoxic enivronments. 2) To explore the relationship between microbial
metabolism and production and the transformation of algal carbon during
decomposition. 3) To compare the rates of alteration in classes of phytodetritus
organic matter with microbial activities for the construction of lability
indices for both individual and specific classes of organic matter.
