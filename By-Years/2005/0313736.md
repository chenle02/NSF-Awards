The focus of this research involves the synthesis of hydroxy phosphonates with
high enantiomeric excess, the structural elaboration of hydroxy phosphonates and
synthesis of phosphonates via palladium coupling to P(O)-H and P(O)-Cl systems.
The reactions developed for the elaboration of allylic hydroxy phosphonates will
be applied to the synthesis of ceramide analogs. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With
this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Christopher D. Spilling in the Department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis. Professor Spilling will
focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the catalytic,
asymmetric phosphonylation of aldehydes and on the discovery of new
transformations of allylic hydroxy phosphonates for the synthesis of
biologically active molecules. The research has broader impact for medicinal
chemistry and the agricultural industry. Further, the project will provide an
excellent opportunity for the training of undergraduate and graduate students.
