For much of prehistory, hunting and gathering was the primary means of making a
living throughout the world. The purpose of this study is to examine the
adaptation of eleven late prehistoric coastal estuarine populations inhabiting
the eastern United States. We will document several indicators of nutrition and
health in order to interpret the biological correlates of coastal adaptation,
particularly with reference to the foraging and consumption of marine foods.
These populations inhabited two estuarine zones and two chronological periods
which will allow us to investigate similarities and differences in nutrition and
health, and the role of a marine-focused economy in the transition to maize
agriculture. Comparisons also will be made according to age and sex. The results
of this study are important for integrating coastal forager adaptation within
the broader context of hunters and gatherer studies and for understanding the
role of coastal subsistence strategies in the important transition to
agriculture in late North American prehistory.
