SU M zLr G O L ^ 3 t 2 W ? Abstract The State/Industry University Cooperative
Research Center on Rock Mechanics (RMMC) was established in 1992 with matching
funds from the NSF, the State of Oklahoma and a consortium of 14 oil and gas
producing companies. The Center's objectives are to apply and integrate advanced
geoscience and engineering concepts to issues related to the oil and gas
industries. The Center's research program addresses both short and long term
goals to solve the geological problems associated with unstable rock formations
that cause collapse of boreholes, reservoir compaction and subsidence. The
information generated in the Center's research will be used to develop improved
drilling technologies in geologically difficult and unstable oil and gas fields.
The State of Oklahoma through Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and
Technology (OCAST) assists RMMC in developing technical cooperation to solve the
problems of small businesses in the State. This award is to support the Center
for in the second year of its operation.
