The purpose of this study is to explore the use of existing technology in expert
systems, particularly in the area of knowledge acquisition, for the development
of more advanced design tools for structural engineering. The study will look at
both sources of knowledge acquisition using an existing system, HI-RISE, as a
basis. HI-RISE is an expert system for the preliminary structural design of
high-rise buildings. The study is divided into three tasks. The first task
involves the calibration of HI-RISE with recognized experts in the domain of
structural design of high-rise buildings. The second task involves the
development of an automated knowledge acquisition module for structural design
problems. During this task, a generic expert system framework for structural
design will be developed using the basic representation and control strategy in
HI-RISE. The third task is the incorporation of machine learning in HI-RISE
using some of the elementary mechanisms developed in the artificial intelligence
community.
