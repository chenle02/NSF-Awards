This project will support students to attend SustainIT conference to be held in
Palermo, Italy on Oct 30-31, 2013. The SustainIT conference focuses on
applications of information and communication technologies (ICT) for
Sustainability. SustainIT 2013 will include Ph.D. forum, work in progress
session, poster session, industry track and keynotes. Extended versions of
selected papers will be published. The conference will provide an opportunity
for students to interact with researchers, particularly computer scientists,
working on applications of ICT for sustainability. The students will be selected
based on applications that explain how they will benefit from the conference.
Preference will be given to minority students and students with accepted papers
in SustainIT.
