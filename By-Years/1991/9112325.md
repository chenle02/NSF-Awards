This award is to provide renewed support for the National Research Council's
Committee on Natural Disasters. The committee has a multidisciplinary membership
to carry out its function of investigating the impacts of various types of
disasters on engineered and institutional systems. Disasters investigated by the
committee include those caused by earthquakes, strong winds and floods. Results
of the committee's studies are published in reports which are made available to
the public. These reports identify lessons that are learned that have
implications for hazard reduction and planning for disaster response.
