A "Workshop on Computational Sciences, Mathematics, and Engineering" is planned
for the fall of 2002. The purpose of the workshop is to develop a planning
document for future research directions and resources needed to advance the
solution of a limited number of significant problems of national interest. These
"core problems," which will be selected by the workshop participants, will
provide a focus to define the generic issues of a computational science
discipline. The core problems will be addressed through collaborations among
application scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.
A workshop report will be produced and disseminated that will summarize the
discussion and conclusions of the workshop. A web site is planned as part of the
effort.
