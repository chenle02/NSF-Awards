This research is to carry out tree-ring studies that have been proven to yield
information, absolute year dates and zones of rupture, for prehistoric
earthquakes. The testing does not damage the trees. Paleoseismology is essential
for establishing a long enough record of earthquakes to enable estimation of
probabilities for future major earthquakes. The immediate future is likely to be
similar to the most recent past. Coastal redwood trees or well-preserved stumps
exist along several faults in northern California and some ages extend back over
600 years. The research will concentrate on two main project areas, the San
Andreas fault north of San Francisco and the Little Salmon Creek fault zone at
the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
