Hormones integrate behavior and physiology by responding to environmental
signals and altering gene expression in target tissues in the brain and the
body. However, when the environment of a species changes, the most adaptive
response might be to lose hormone sensitivity at some of the target tissues. An
open question is whether hormone-mediated traits can be decoupled in such a way.
This research will focus on the steroid hormone testosterone and its integrating
effect on the behavior and physiology of males and females of a songbird
species, the dark-eyed junco. The relative importance of phenotypic integration
or independence of hormonally mediated traits has significant implications for
the evolution of life histories, sex differences, and the formation of new
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will help to train future scientists
of diverse backgrounds in the conduct of laboratory and field research that
combines techniques and perspectives from multiple disciplines. Potential
societal implications of the research include greater knowledge of the impact of
hormonally active agents in the environment, and the ability of natural
populations to respond effectively to environments altered by climate change.
