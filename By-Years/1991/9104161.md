A series of 5 deep (&lt; 4000 m) current meter arrays will be deployed across
the Samoan passage and an additional current meter mooring will be set across
the Robie Ridge for a two year period (7/92 to 7/94) to measure the deep water
exchange between the South and the North Pacific. This experiment is part of the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
