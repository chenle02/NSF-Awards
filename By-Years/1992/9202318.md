This award is intended to enable a major improvement in contour accuracy and
surface finish in diamond turning. This will be carried out by researching and
developing a force-tool-surface finish relationship in diamond turning and
supplementing the existing position feedback system of a diamond turning machine
with force feedback. The implementation of a fast tool servo system on the
diamond turning machine will enable the system to correct for high-speed spindle
vibration. Further, the fast tool servo system, in combination with the dynamic
and static force feedback, will be used to control and improve deterioration in
surface finish as the cutting tool wears or vibrates during the turning process.
Diamond turning is an operation that has a very significant impact on a variety
of critical industries including the manufacture of optical components. The
enhancement of accuracies in the manufacture of optics had reached a plateau and
this research is necessary to achieve accuracies beyond those currently
feasible.
