This small grant will provide for pilot testing, preparation of instruments, and
consultations among principal investigators for renewal and extension of the
investigators' prior NSF-supported study on rule systems in Japanese and
American schools. The aim of the new research is to expand and refine the study
of socialization into rule systems in Japan and the United States by focusing on
children's development of a sense of obligation. This planning grant will
constitute the initial stages of a major project. The anticipated design calls
for exploration of developmental and cultural differences in the sense of
obligation to either follow the established rules and norms or adhere to one's
own internalized values. This grant will also provide support for an
undergraduate student, under the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Program, to work on the development stages of a potential large-scale, cross-
cultural study. This research promises to continue the investigators' previous
successful line of research on legal socialization and classroom motivation. How
rule systems develop and function and produce different patterns of conduct and
accomplishment in Japanese and American youths has profound implications for
understanding not only law-abiding behavior in citizens but also achievement and
academic motivation in youth.
