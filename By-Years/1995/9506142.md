With National Science Foundation support, Dr. John Terrell and his colleagues
will conduct archaeological research in the coastal Aitape region of Papua New
Guinea. During a 1993-4 survey, surface collections were made at selected
locations along 265 km. of coastline in a region where no prior archaeological
work had been conducted. The team will now return to these sites to: establish
the age for pottery making in the region; test and refine a proposed ceramic
sequence; and document how often pottery, stone and other materials from outside
localities occur in the region. To accomplish these goals stratigraphic
excavations will be conducted at several locations. Datable materials will be
collected to establish a reliable radiocarbon chronology. Finally, chemical and
petrographic analysis will be conducted on obsidian and ceramics to determine
points of origin. The Aitape region has long been of interest to anthropologists
because of an apparent paradox. Linguistically the region is extremely diverse
and large numbers of different cultural groups who speak different languages
live closely side by side. However ethnographic evidence indicates that there is
extensive trade among them and that they are quite similar in terms of
traditional material culture. Anthropologists wish to understand how diversity
in several basic cultural realms is maintained in the face of forces which lead
towards unity in other areas. The goal of Dr. Terrell's archaeological research
is to trace the emergence of interaction over time and to gain insight into the
present pattern through the understanding of how it developed. The area is
archaeologically unknown and the date of its first occupation has not been
established. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide
data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on the
prehistory of the Pacific and increase our understanding of how cultural
diversity develops and is maintained.
