Private information retrieval (PIR) is one of the most fundamental cryptographic
primitives to protect user privacy online. It has many applications including
anonymous communication, privacy-preserving media streaming, and private look-
ups for safe browsing. PIR is also closely related to other important privacy-
preserving cryptographic tools, such as private set intersection, which has been
used in password monitoring and harmful content discovery.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After decades of research, single-server PIR schemes still
have performance limitations. The main bottlenecks include high communication
costs, heavy computation, and large server storage. The performance further
worsens if the database has many entries but each individual entry is small -- a
common scenario in real-world applications. Unfortunately, many of these
obstacles are fundamental in the standard setting of PIR. This project presents
new paradigms for single-server PIR, including homomorphic encryption
composition, vectorized batch PIR, and stateful PIR. The goal is to
substantially improve single-server PIR in all aspects: communication,
computation, storage, and range of supported database parameters, to eventually
make it practical for a wide range of real-world
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
