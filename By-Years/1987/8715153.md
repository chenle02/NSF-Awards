This research deals with the development and implementation of algorithms for
numerical solution of large-scale constrained nonlinear optimization problems.
Three major topics are being considered: (1) techniques for improving the
efficiency of sequential linearly constrained methods for nonlinearly
constrained optimization, (2) active-set methods for sparse linearly constrained
problems, and (3) application of sequential quadratic programming methods to
sparse nonlinearly constrained problems. Drs. Gill, Murray, Saunders, and Wright
are well known for their work in computational optimization procedures. Stanford
University provides an excellent environment for this project. An award is
highly recommended. This award is to be jointly supported with the Numeric and
Symbolic Computation Program in the Division of Computer and Computation
Research.
