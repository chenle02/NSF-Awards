In order to apply emerging technologies (e.g. dynamic spectrum sharing) to
address the wireless spectrum shortage problem, there is a critical need to
understand global RF spectrum usage trends. To accomplish this, a three-pronged
approach is being pursued: 1) deployment of geographically dispersed, temporally
coordinated RF spectrum observatories in multiple U.S. locations, and through
international collaboration, in Finland. The spectrum observatories use a common
platform generating a single RF spectrum measurement dataset. 2) Development of
empirically validated, statistical models of spectrum utilization for different
wireless application types based on this dataset. 3) Use of "big data"
analytical techniques to mine the dataset to discover temporal and spectral
correlations not obvious using traditional approaches. As the models and
relationships are refined, they will enable temporal and spectral occupancy
predictions to support spectrum sharing for various circumstances and wireless
applications.

The generation of a high-resolution, multi-location, multi-national spectrum
usage dataset using a common, consistent measurement and storage approach is
unique and allows direct, unambiguous comparisons of spectrum usage across
geographies and demographics. The statistical models of spectrum utilization and
the identified similarities and differences between regions and wireless
services are unique and inform dynamic spectrum sharing research and related
regulatory action with "real-world" data. Importantly, this is the first time
that "big data" analytic approaches are being systematically applied to RF
utilization data providing new insights motivating novel dynamic spectrum
sharing approaches and improved spectrum efficiency.
