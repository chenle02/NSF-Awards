This project involves the dual pursuit of core theoretical investigations in
computational geometry and experimentation with geometric codes. Theoretical
investigations will address lower bounds, geometric sampling techniques and
derandomization. Experimentation will involve the implementation of algorithms
as well as the development of tools to make future implementations easier.
Special emphasis will be given to problems of simplification and multiresolution
of shapes in 3D, sampling and optimization, algorithm animation and
experimentation tools.
