The focus of this research is in the development of synthetic methods for the
synthesis of deoxysugars and glycosides from enantiomerically pure substituted
beta,gamma-unsaturated delta-lactones. Using recently published methods
involving olefin metathesis followed by epoxidation, the PI aims to provide
highly efficient syntheses of a number of important deoxysugars of emerging
biological importance, including 2,3,6-trideoxysugars, 2,6-dideoxysugars,
3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxysugars, 4,6-dideoxysugars, and some 6-deoxysugars.

With this new award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Peng (George) Wang of the
Department of Biochemistry at the Ohio State University, Columbus. Professor
Wang will focus his research on the development of new ways to synthesize
natural products bearing unusual sugar groups. This research will contribute to
the fundamental understanding of the role these sugars have in biological
activity. Biochemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral
level will be trained in Professor Wang's laboratory.
