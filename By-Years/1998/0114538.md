0114538 Suki The objective of this research is to extract information about the
structure and function of the lung from noninvasive acoustic measurements. The
specific aims of this research are: (1) to measure sound waves produced during
airway opening (crackle sound) and the lung pressure-volume (P-V) curve in
normal and surfactant depleted lungs from several species with distinctly
different airway geometry, (2) to analyze the airway structure from the crackle
sound and the P-V curve and compare it to available morphometric data, and (3)
to use airway tree models to predict the relationships between lung mechanics,
lung function including Computed Tomography images, and the mechanism of lung
injury during mechanical ventilation.
