Distributed systems are becoming ever more important as they provide information
support for basic infrastructures such as electrical and telephone service, and
as a means for corporations to manage worldwide operettas. They are also
becoming ubiquitous because many applications demand greater computational power
and require distributed resources. The net impact is that a vast amount of data
needs to be shared across a broad array of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposal plans to investigate the long-term issues of mobility and efficiency in
the design of scalable middleware for distributed systems. The effort will
include the implementation of a distributed middleware for mobile environments.
Specific research themes to be pursued are:&lt;br/&gt;- formalization and
implementation of consistency requirements for middleware&lt;br/&gt;- algorithms
for data placement and replication&lt;br/&gt;- protocols for support of conflict
resolution and the support of mobility, and&lt;br/&gt;- incorporation of stream
data in a computational framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these
investigations will be the development of an experimental prototype that uses
the researched algorithms and protocols. In order to experiment with the
prototype, a number of applications will be implemented in a campus environment.
The goal of the research is to help guide long-term development of middleware at
large scale.&lt;br/&gt;
