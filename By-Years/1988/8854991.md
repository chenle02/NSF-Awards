The Department of Computer Science at Northeast Louisiana University will
conduct a three-week computer science workshop for twenty eighth and ninth grade
girls. Participants primarily selected from a two hundred mile radius of
Northeast Louisiana University will be involved in a multi-faceted program
including computer science, other scientific areas, ethical questions and
policies, and industrial tours. The computer science topics will be the latest
concepts and will offer opportunities to participate in small group projects. A
visiting speaker program will present a broad view of careers in science and
mathematics.
