North Carolina State Univ. Dr. James D. Martin and other members of the
Chemistry Department at North Carolina State University are being supported to
establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in chemistry. For
the period 1997-99, eleven undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each
summer actively engaged in basic research projects in synthetic chemistry
ranging from organic natural products to solid-state chemistry. In addition,
students will be exposed to the interdisciplinary relevance of chemical
synthesis through weekly seminars by participating faculty mentors and site
visits to industrial and private laboratories in the neighboring Research
Triangle Park. Participants are recruited primarily from the southeast,
midatlantic, and midwestern United States.
