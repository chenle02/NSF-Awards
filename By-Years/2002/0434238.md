Supporting the attendance of graduate students at this symposium will provide
these future leaders with broader and better information on research areas, as
well as momentum and clarity in their career pursuits. The unique approach
proposed in this application is to provide graduate students with opportunities
to learn about state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research and to interact with
academic and industrial leaders. Symposium planners are organizing a special
session to provide graduate students with presentations and discussions with
leaders in academia and industry. The purpose of this session will be to give
the students a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities to
pursuing a career in either academia or private industry. The PI for this
proposed project has been involved in organizing over 40 national and
international conferences and symposia as a chair, session chair, program
committee member, and advisory committee member. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
effort described in this proposal will blend research and educational activities
for the graduate students who attend. By participating in the symposium, these
students will be exposed to state-of-the-art research topics and will interact
with academic and industrial leaders. They will learn how to best use their time
in graduate study and how to be prepared for their future career. The graduate
students chosen will come from underrepresented groups, such as women, African
American and Hispanic students, and from universities that lack financial
resources, which will be targeted in the publicity for the symposium. After the
symposium, the chairs and program committee members will evaluate the success of
the project and share project activities and feedback with planners of other
conferences and symposia in the field of engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
