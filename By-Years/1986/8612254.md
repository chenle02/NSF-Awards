This research has two related goals, as follows: continued improvement of the
high resolution scanning ion microprobe analysis system and its application to
improved understanding of aluminum-lithium alloys. The program is directed
towards quantitative determination of the distribution of lithium in aluminum-
lithium alloys. It requires initial studies on the spatial resolution of
secondary ion mass spectrometry, creation of standards for the lithium and
aluminum ion signal ratios as a function of lithium concentration, and
determination of detectability of lithium in aluminum-lithium alloys. Aluminum-
lithium alloys will be examined to measure the distribution of lithium in second
phases, at grain boundaries, and at fracture surfaces to gain understanding of
the segregation of lithium in these alloys. Results will be correlated with
transmission electron microscopy studies at Lehigh University. Phase stability
in the system will be determined using samples undergoing ion implantation and
ageing treatments. Results will be correlated with studies using neutron depth
profiling at the National Bureau of Standards.
