This is a companion project with CCR-95-28973 (entitled ``Optimization and
Learning over Convex Sets'') and is an award under the Software Capitalization
Program. The project's goal is to upgrade and update software that had been
produced. These upgrades and updates are based on algorithms developed under
support of CCR-92-08597. The software is for executing random walks that produce
a sample from certain multi-variate probability distributions. An update of the
software involves simply changing the ``number of steps'' parameter in the
random walk. Applications of this discrete probabilistic software (i) to
contingency tables and (ii) to the membership oracles for optimization over
convex sets, are investigated. With good planned dissemination (for example, on
the world wide-web)and well thought-out testing, other applications of this
software are anticipated. ***
