A mentoring network linking college science, mathematics, and engineering
students with grade 4-8 urban students in Philadelphia has been successfully
established on a pilot basis. This project will build on the pilot and will
increase the emphasis on participation in the network by school science teachers
and by science faculty from the University of Pennsylvania. The focus of the
mentoring network is an intervention model in science and mathematics education
which includes classroom and after-school activities. Mentors engage students in
hands-on activities in non-threatening and fun learning environments and work
with pupils and teachers to form science clubs, participate in science fairs,
and embark on a variety of field trips. An important part of this project is a
research component which will be used to evaluate the monitoring network model
and to build and maintain a data base to be used for further studies. Cost
sharing in the amount of $18,504 is 3% of the NSF contribution to this project.
