9510738 Coakley Abstract This award provides funds for a workshop to address the
scientific potential of a nuclear submarine as a geophysical research platform
in the Arctic Ocean. Use of a US Navy nuclear submarine for civilian
(unclassified) scientific research in the Arctic Ocean has been made possible
through a Memorandum of Understanding between the US Navy, the Office of Naval
Research, the National Science Foundation, the US Geological Survey, and the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. The general concept of
using a submarine platform for marine geophysical work is intriguing and there
is clearly enough potential to warrant serious consideration. The first step in
consideration of a possible cruise dedicated to geophysics is to determine the
sort of geophysical work that is achievable from a submarine and if the specific
scientific problems that might be addressed are important enough to encourage
the research community to submit proposals for consideration by the Foundation.
Essentially, the potential role of a nuclear submarine in Arctic Ocean
geophysical investigations must be determined. This workshop will address this
issue and provide their recommendations to the Foundation.
