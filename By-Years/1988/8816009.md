This project will study the coastal current flowing south along southern New
Jersey and Delaware using data collected during an intense field program.
Specific objectives include determina- tion of the spatial structure of the
current, including details of the merging of its New Jersey and Delaware
branches near or within Delaware Bay, and the existence of wave-like or eddy
structure in the current. Further objectives include assess- ment of the across
shore and alongshore momentum balances using CTD, acoustic doppler, and current
meter data.
