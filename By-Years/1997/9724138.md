BaBar is a new detector under construction at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. It will provide important tests of the `Standard Model` primarily
through analyzing states composed of heavy quarks such as the charmed and beauty
quarks. In this project, the PI will work with two undergraduates in simulating
and analyzing events containing heavy quarks, and also in running the
experiment.
