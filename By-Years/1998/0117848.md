New initial paleornagrictic results froni ODP Leg 72 estimate the pattern of
secular variation for the entire Brunhes Epoch and identi I'v 13 Brunhes-aged
magnetic field excursions. This is the first data set that allows ~i directional
look at secular variations over such a ]on - time interval and a! lows
consideration within the framework of excursions and paleointenslt~. Detailed
anilysis ol'thc individtitif excursion records suggests that there are two
basically different types ol, cxcursions, one t\ t~c that is closely related to
normal secular variation and another type that nilght he considei Cd an aborted
reversal. The project will analyze and s\ nthesize PIVVIOLIS palcornagnetic
rcults and make selective new discretesample ineastirements on cleven exci-ii-
sions and fh(,iii, contiguous secular
variation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
