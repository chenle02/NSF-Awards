This investigation is designed to continue experimental and analytical studies
of the large scale dynamical phenomena in the heliosphere resulting from the
solar polar magnetic field polarity reversals , and to study solar flare charged
particle acceleration in the present solar cycle. The first objective will focus
on charged particles as probes of heliospheric magnetic fields, whose origin is
the solar magnetic field carried throughout the heliosphere by the solar wind.
The second objective will consist of experimental investigations for solar flare
particle acceleration using measurements of the energy spectrum and elemental
and isotopic composition of the solar flares obtained from spacecraft data. Both
objectives will require extensive use of neutron monitors and of data from a
network of instruments aboard several spacecraft. The proposed research will
therefore include continued operation and maintenance of neutron monitoring
stations at Climax, CO and Huancayo, Peru, with the possible addition of a new
station in Maui, Hawaii. This latter station will eventually replace the one in
Peru.
