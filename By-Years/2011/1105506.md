Humans depend on social structures that range from dyads and families to groups,
communities, and cultures. These structures likely evolved hand in hand with the
neural, neuroendocrine, cellular, and genetic mechanisms that support them
because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive,
reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long rnough that they too
reproduced. Social neuroscience is a field of research that has grown over the
past two decades to investigate these neural, neuroendocrine, cellular, and
genetic mechanisms and the social structures, factors, and processes with which
they interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides NSF funding for
graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend an upcoming conference on
Social Neuroscience that will bring together scientists from the United States,
Europe, and Asia, speaking on the topics 1) Imaging, lesion, and behavioral
studies of social cognition; 2) Neurobiology of affiliative behavior; 3) Social
perception; 4) Neural bases and neuro-embodiment of social processes; and 5)
Neural bases of real-time social interactions. The junior investigators funded
to attend this conference will be exposed to cutting edge research in social
neuroscience and will have their own work showcased during a special poster
session. The product of the conference will be an edited volume submitted to MIT
Press for the Social Neuroscience Book Series.
