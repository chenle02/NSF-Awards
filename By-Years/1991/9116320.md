This award will support the participation of seven U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Microfabrication and Biosensors, to be held July 21-24,
1992 in Anchorage, Alaska. The co-organizers are Howard Weetall, Biotechnology
Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and Professor
Isao Karube, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of
Tokyo. The seminar participants represent a broad base of biosensor technologies
presently under development in the United States and Japan joining
microfabrication technology and biology to produce new and exciting biosensor
technology. Since the previous meeting on this same subject held in 1989, major
changes have occurred in the research area regarding new and important
technological breakthroughs, as well as in the combination of electronics and
biology. In this seminar, participants will focus on new research directions and
areas for collaboration between U.S. and Japanese scientists.
