The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) is conducting a grant
writing workshop for Tribal College and University (TCU) personnel. The workshop
focuses on the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship and the Advanced Technological
Education programs and is part of a larger effort by AIHEC to expand TCU
participation in NSF programs beyond the Tribal Colleges and Universities
Program (TCUP). During the 2-day workshop, participants (TCU faculty, staff, and
administrators) hear presentations from NSF program officers about the two
programs, and the elements of a successful proposal. In addition,
representatives with currently funded Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship and ATE
grants discuss their respective projects, including the planning,
implementation, and impact on their students and enhancements to the
institution's academic program. A key outcome of the workshop is an expected
increase in the successful submission of proposals by TCUs. The workshop
contributes toward the development of an effective model for providing technical
support to TCU personnel leading to a greater number of TCUs participating in
NSF programs and contributes to the ongoing effort to promote broader
participation of the nation's underserved and underrepresented minorities in
STEM education and professions.
