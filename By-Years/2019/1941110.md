This project is focused on the development of a flexible modeling framework for
multiphase atmospheric chemistry. The new framework has the potential for
significantly decreasing the computational cost of atmospheric modeling and for
improving the understanding of the role of atmospheric particles in influencing
climate. This will be an important contribution to reducing the uncertainty in
the predictions of future climate change, a subject of great impact for
society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the research is to understand how
per-particle multiphase chemistry impacts aerosol mixing state and thus climate,
with a focus on mixed organic/inorganic aerosols. The distribution of particle
compositions and morphologies (the physicochemical mixing state) can impact gas-
aerosol partitioning, chemical aging, and aerosol water uptake, and in turn,
impact aerosol impacts on climate. The flexible modeling framework for
multiphase chemistry (MultiChem) will be used within an ultra-detailed particle-
resolved aerosol model (PartMC) and standard sectional/modal models in both box
and 3-D regional simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science questions that
will be addressed by this research are: (1) How is per-particle composition and
morphology impacted by aerosol-gas phase partitioning of inorganic and organic
species and the resulting changes to water uptake? (2) How do these impacts on
per-particle composition and morphology propagate into aerosol climate impacts,
in particular aerosol optical properties and cloud condensation nuclei activity?
and (3) How do these impacts depend on meteorological conditions and the
transport of particles and gases in the atmosphere?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
