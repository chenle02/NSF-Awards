This project carries out field measurements of seismic responses of ground
motion and pore pressure buildup in a seismically active site in Lotung, Taiwan.
The Lotung site is in a seismically active region prone to large earthquakes and
has potentially liquefiable soil deposits at shallow depths below the ground
water table. Additional field instrumentation for this project will include the
installation of pore pressure transducers at depths up to 20 meters below the
surface. Laboratory testing of soil samples from the site will be made to
characterize the dynamic soil behavior. ;itA priori;ro analysis will be
developed to predict the pore pressure responses to soil. The analysis results
will be compared with actual field data.
