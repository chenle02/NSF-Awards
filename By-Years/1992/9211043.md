Markov chain models of complex stochastic systems are often characterized by
large stat spaces, resulting in computational difficulties in their numerical
solution. Rank reduction algorithms alleviate the diseconomies of large\scale by
decomposing the given problem into a set of smaller subsystems. This work
facilitates the implementations of various iterative rank reduction algorithms
with respect to efficiency and usability. A major contribution of this work is
the development of heuristic methods for decomposing large state of spaces into
small subsets. The main approach is based on analyzing individual errors.
Scientists and engineers attempting to analyze complex stochastic systems will
benefit from the availability of powerful, user friendly methods such as the
ones developed in this work.
