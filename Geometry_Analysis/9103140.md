The principal investigator will study Ricci deformation of the metric on
Riemannian manifolds. This technique was introduced by Hamilton in 1982 and has
since become a useful and well known method in differential geometry. The goal
of the research supported by this award is a better understanding of the
topology of manifolds which satisfy restrictions on curvature and Ricci
curvature in particular. The theory of parabolic partial differential equations
will be used to obtain estimates on the solution of the Ricci deformation which
should then lead to additional topological information. A physical example of
parabolic deformation of curvature is the deformation a stretched rubber band
would experience if it were immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. It is
possible to show that the band would asymptotically deform to a circle if the
enclosed area were renormalized to one. This method can be used to study the
topology of a surface or manifold in more complicated situations. The principal
investigator will try to obtain precise estimates for the size of the
deformations and use that information to obtain topological information.
