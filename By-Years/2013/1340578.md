The investigators propose to develop a form of assessment in natural selection
-- and a computer based system to implement such -- that would use Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) and hot term extraction as a means of transforming rich,
open ended student responses into scores that are usable by faculty yet retain
the complexities of the learning assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LSA
approach will be compared to interview and multiple choice methods of
assessment. Some comparative cost analysis will be performed. The project will
be performed at OSU with undergraduates (both white students and students from
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should this
research be successful, it will create a new and more informative way to assess
students? knowledge -- one that takes into account all the knowledge he/she
brings to bear on the study of STEM education. This could provide instructors,
and the students themselves, with more helpful and powerful information to
improve teaching methods and learning approaches, respectively. &lt;br/&gt;
