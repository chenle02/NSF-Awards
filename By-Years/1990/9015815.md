Dr. Scheraga is carrying out a combined experimental and theoretical research
program designed to elucidate the energies and mechanism of the folding of a
polypeptide chain into the native conformation of a protein, and of the action
of the resulting protein (enzyme or hormone) on a substrate or receptor. While
current potential functions are sufficiently accurate for several of the
applications that he has made, his analysis of these potentials (and also of
others in the literature) indicates that it is time for a completely new look at
the underlying form ( and parameterization of the potentials); this is the first
goal of the proposed work. Secondly, some very successful methods have been
developed to surmount the multiple-minima problem for small polypeptides and he
will devote his efforts to improving them, and extending them to globular
proteins containing of the order of 100 residues. He will test the methods on
crambin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and then use them to compute
the structure of interferon. He will also treat large assemblies of fibrous
proteins, viz. collagen.
