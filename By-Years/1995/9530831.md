AST 95-30831 P.I. Phillip Ianna Fundamental Properties of Nearby Northern and
Southern Stars. The characteristics of stars populating our galaxy are broadly
inferred from the observational properties of nearby stars. This is the sample
we might expect to be known most completely, and to have the best observational
data. In fact many of the nearest stars lack measurements of the most basic
kind, such as colors, spectral types, or especially, distances. A stellar
parallax is the most fundamental piece of information needed for calibrating the
luminosities of a wide variety of stars and so providing the foundation for
setting up the distance scale for objects beyond the nearby sample. Dr. Ianna
will continue to direct a program to determine the distances to selected nearby
star candidates by the trigonometric parallax method emphasizing CCD
observations from the southern hemisphere.
