The Chemistry Department is purchasing a 60 MHz NMR Spectrometer for use in the
organic chemistry laboratory course, and in a variety of upper-division
laboratory courses. In sophomore organic chemistry, students use the instrument
to analyze a variety of products of chemical synthesis. In the junior organic
course, the NMR is used to demonstrate aromatic ring currents as part of a
synthesis of tin-prophorin complexes. The instrument is also used in connection
with the senior level instrumental analysis course, the inorganic and
biochemistry laboratories, and the senior research program. The fourier
transform capability of the instrument is of particular importance to the
Department since it provides students with valuable experience in the techniques
of FT-NMR spectroscopy, as well as the opportunity to demonstrate the
interdisciplinary importance of mathematics in the sciences.
