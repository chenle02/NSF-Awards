This engineering education research initiation grant makes a comparative study
of situated learning between the two professions of nursing and engineering.
Situated learning takes place when learners are placed in an authentic context
such as engineering internships. The researchers plan to study how situated
learning impacts students ability to construct complex ideas and how it
motivates them to continue in their chosen discipline.

The broader significance and importance of this project will be to inform other
programs on the effects of situated learning, which is increasingly used in
engineering degree programs. By understanding the effects of situated learning,
it will be possible to better transition students from degree programs into the
workforce. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the
frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities
and expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
