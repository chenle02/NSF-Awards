This EAGER project aims to address a controversy regarding the role of
phosphorylation on neurofilament (NF) transport. Neurofilament phosphorylation
has long been considered to regulate their axonal transport rate and in doing so
to provide stability to mature axons. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal
extension of the largest (NFH) of the 3 NF subunits is classically thought to
slow NF transport. This project proposes that phosphorylation inhibits transport
by fostering NF-NF associations leading to formation of NF bundles too large to
transport. Other approaches involving NF subunit knockout or truncation have
advanced the notion that phosphorylation does not regulate transport. This
project is set out to address this controversy by expressing the NF-H sidearm in
transfected cells. They will manipulate cdk5 activity to alter sidearm
phosphorylation and monitor the influence on association with NF bundles. The
proposed experiments should provide the first direct comparison of the impact of
sidearm phosphorylation without the complications that have compromised prior
studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide training and mentoring
of undergraduate and graduate students, fostering their publications, and
introduce them to the scientific community at large by supporting their
attendance at international meetings. This research also has broad impacts
regarding the field of cell biology, in that it will continue to provide novel
information regarding the "load-bearing" aspect of intermediate filaments in all
cell types.
