INT 9722819 White This U.S.-Hungary research project between J. Michael White of
the University of Texas, Austin, and Frigyes Solymosi of the Hungarian Academy
of Sciences' Institute of Solid State and Radiochemistry, Szeged, will examine
heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon
molecules on single crystal transition metal surfaces. Specifically, Hungarian
participants will study reactivity of surface complexes that are key
intermediates in catalytic reactions. To accomplish this they will employ ultra-
high vacuum chambers. The U.S. team will focus on the dynamics of photon-driven
oxidation reactions involving adsorbed reaction precursors by using a suite of
surface sensitive spectroscopic methods. Results are expected to contribute to
our basic understanding of a broad range of oxidation reactions that occur
between hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons at heterogeneous interfaces that have
considerable societal impact on a global scale. This project in analytical and
surface chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
