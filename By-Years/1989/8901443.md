The principal investigator will study the geometry and topology of tight and
taut submanifolds. In particular, he will investigate tight submanifolds that
are either analytic or orbits of an orthogonal action. Furthermore, the
difference between the topology and geometry of two special cases, Dupin and
isoparametric hypersurfaces, will be the subject of particular attention. Tight
and taut submanifolds are the topological analogues of geometer's minimal
surfaces. These in turn are mathematical models for everyday soap films. A soap
film, while in the process of being blown is neither tight nor taut. Prior to
being blown, the film had both these properties. The principal investigator will
solve several mathematics problems which arise from the study of such films.
