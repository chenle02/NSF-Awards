A five-day international number theory conference is planned for March 17-21,
2016, at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Research in number theory has a
long history going back to the ancient Greeks. Recently research in number
theory has made significant advances and has made important applications to
other areas such as physics, computing, and data security. One such advance has
been on gaps between prime numbers. The conference will feature three lectures
by James Maynard on this topic. The conference continues a 15-year tradition at
the University of Florida of conferences in number theory. There will be over
thirty 40-minute and several 20-minute research presentations. Special effort
will be given to support undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral
scholars, women and minority participants, and those who have no other support.

The conference will cover the following topics: q-Series, partitions and modular
forms, analytic number theory, and algebraic number theory. Historically the
synergy between analytic number theory and the combinatorial/algebraic world of
partitions and q-series has been extremely fruitful, starting with the
collaboration of Hardy and Ramanujan. Throughout the twentieth century and into
the twenty-first, we have seen each area enrich the other. For example, mid-
twentieth century workers like Dyson and Atkin found fruitful interactions
between these two areas, and the potential for further interactions along these
lines by the participants in this conference is significant and tantalizing. The
talks and papers of the conference will be widely disseminated by making
presentations and abstracts available on the conference web page and by
publishing a refereed conference proceedings. More information can be found at
