This award provides funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
site that will host a total of fourteen students per summer during twelve weeks
of summer research. The REU program is based on the theory that mentoring and
networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a
profession and for training young researchers. Students will be working with
researchers at one of three estuarine and coastal research sites, including Horn
Point Laboratory (HPL), Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) and the Academy
of Natural Science Estuarine Research Center (ANSERC). Organizers of the program
have four main goals including, 1) to foster a close student-mentor relationship
2) to have students develop and complete a scientific project, 3) to have
students communicate their scientific findings, 4) to ensure students understand
ethical issues involved in scientific research. Matching funding is provided by
the Maryland Seagrant Program (MSGP).
