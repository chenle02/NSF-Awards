Dr. Patrick Holland, Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of
the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a
Career Award to utilize coordination chemistry to uncover novel modes of
reactivity and address issues in enzymatic, surface and solution catalysis.
Three-coordinate transition metal complexes will be used to develop knowledge
applicable to metalloproteins and catalysts. A particular focus is on modelling
the reduction of unsaturated organic compounds by the enzyme nitrogenase.
Research and education will be integrated by training undergraduates to be
involved in the research effort and incorporating team learning into
undergraduate and graduate inorganic chemistry courses at the University of
Rochester.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research cuts across such fields as biology
and chemical catalysis and focuses on metal sites with less than a full
complement of ligands. Dr. Holland's research aims at a fundamental
understanding of the reactivity of such sites that will aid in understanding how
enzymes function and in developing new types of catalysts. Team learning in
undergraduate and graduate courses will involve students in chemistry as a
social activity to better integrate science into their lives.&lt;br/&gt;
