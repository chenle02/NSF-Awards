Many theories have been advanced recently for actively controlling flexible
mechanical systems. However, experimental verification of these methods has not
kept pace with the theoretical development. This project provides for equipment
to evaluate some of the theoretical work and hopefully to identify new research
directions in the area of control/structure interaction. The equipment comprises
two components; an Integrated Systems Incorporated (ISI) MAX 100 and a Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAXStation II. Together, they form a real time
digital controller, a data acquisition system, as well as a powerful computing
resource. Four projects have been identified which can benefit from use of the
equipment. The first deals with control-structure-actuator interaction where the
intent is to understand the effect of the dynamics of the actuators themselves
on the entire system. A second project deals with design of spacecraft
controllers consistent with the low total energy budget of the spacecraft
system. A third project develops methods for testing the accuracy of a large
class of existing multibody simulation tools. The fourth project focuses on
testing theoretical models developed for advanced structural composite
materials.
