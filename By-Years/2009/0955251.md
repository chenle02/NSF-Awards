0955251&lt;br/&gt;Young&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of the
current application is to elucidate the mechanism by which metabolic changes
activate apoptotic signaling in hepatic cells exposed to elevated saturated
fatty acids (SFAs).The central hypothesis is that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress induced by SFAs leads to altered coupling between central carbon
pathways, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) resulting in apoptosis. The rationale for the proposed
research is that, once it is known how metabolic pathway fluxes impact lipid-
induced apoptosis, these pathways can be modulated by therapeutic interventions
that target the underlying metabolic factors causing lipotoxicity. The plan is
to test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims. First,
to determine the mechanism by which SFAs induce ROS accumulation in hepatic
cells. Second, to identify the lipid intermediate responsible for inducing ER
stress in SFA-treated hepatic cells. These aims will be accomplished using a
systems approach that focuses on integrated metabolic pathways versus individual
reactions and where the concept of the metabolic network is of central
importance. The approach involves both GC-MS metabolic profiling to track the
relative concentrations and isotopic labeling patterns of many different
intracellular metabolites simultaneously, as well as metabolic flux analysis
(MFA) to reconstruct comprehensive flux maps that represent the dynamic flow of
material throughout the network. By subjecting hepatic cells to a variety of
treatments aimed at perturbing lipid and central carbon metabolism, they will
dissect the pathways involved in SFA-induced lipotoxicity.
