A microprocessor-controlled electrochemical system has been recently acquired by
the Chemistry Department of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, allowing the
use of this instrumentation for a number of applications in analytical,
inorganic, and organic chemistry. These include a convenient and logical
examination of electrode processes via the oxidation of various organic
molecules in the cyclic voltammetry mode, enhanced ability to determine trace
levels of ions via stripping and square wave techniques, and the availability of
a new and powerful way to introduce students to free radical organic chemistry.
Undergraduate students in analytical chemistry compare various analysis methods,
and investigate indicator blockage by transition metal cations in EDTA
titrations, whereas undergraduates in inorganic courses study catalytically
active substances and carry out small-scale electrochemical syntheses.
