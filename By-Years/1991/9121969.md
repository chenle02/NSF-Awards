This award is for the purchase of equipment and accessories for testing VLSI
analog and digital integrated circuits. The research projects include design of
novel, regenerative comparators, on-chip voltage generators, low- voltage, low-
power OP amp for switch capacitor filters, and low power mixed-signal integrated
circuits for biomedical applications. The equipment and accessories requested in
this proposal will be used by the principal investigators and their students to
test VLSI analog and digital integrated circuits for a variety of applications
ranging from signal and image processing, to biomedical, space and mobile radio.
Their specific research topics are divided into the areas of digital signal
processing integrated circuits, analog and mixed signal integrated circuits, and
analog integrated circuit synthesis.
