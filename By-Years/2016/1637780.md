The Multi-Scale Metabolic Modeling and Engineering Workshop will be held at the
Virginia Tech National Capital Region (NCR) campus in Arlington, VA, during
August of 2016. This workshop will synthesize the latest academic developments
in metabolic engineering into useful and translatable information for the
bioprocessing industry.&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will be a
combination of industrial and academic researchers who identify as bioprocess
engineers, metabolic engineers, protein engineers, and synthetic
biologists.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;The application of metabolic engineering
methodologies to industrial fermentation can have significant impact on the
efficient production of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and biofuels. The workshop
will explore how to better integrate metabolic engineering principles and
modeling with industrial bioprocess engineering models through the following
topics: 1) Use of SuperPRO Designer to evaluate bioprocess economics and assess
the impacts of metabolic engineering on improving and enhancing these bioprocess
model predictions, particularly for fermentation co-products; 2) Genome-scale
metabolic flux modeling; 3) Development of metabolic engineering strategies
through modeling; 4) Techniques for DNA manipulation and assembly along with
genome editing; 5) Synthetic circuit design and pathway expression optimization;
6) 13C-based metabolic flux analysis; and 7) Optimizing a metabolic pathway
during fermentation, considering reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and fluid
mechanics in a large scale fermenter. The workshop outcomes are also expected to
have significant impact on the biofuels industry, particularly for biorefinery
operations where both biofuels and valued co-products are made through
fermentation processes.
