The goal of this research is to make fundamental measurements of physical,
chemical and photochemical heterogeneous processes that could affect the
composition of our atmosphere. Spectroscopic techniques in well-defined vacuum
environments to characterize the growth and reactivity of atmospheric aerosols.
Experiments will be performed both on model thin-film samples and on actual
particles we fabricate in the laboratory. Measurements of model particle
composition, nucleation and growth rates, heterogeneous chemical and
photochemical reaction rates, and condensed-phase optical properties will be
carried out.
