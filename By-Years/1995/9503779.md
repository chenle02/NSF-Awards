9503779 Kareem One objective of the project concerns the design and development
of control systems to maintain optimal dumping levels in sloshing dampers (TSD)
and in tuned liquid column dampers (TLCD) under varied loading conditions.
Presently installed systems are not operating at an optimal level of damping at
all times thus, this project will develop semi- active systems involving
variable opening screen or baffles for TSDs and variable orifices for TLCDs for
maintaining optimal damping values. Analysis of these designs will include
single dampers as well as multiple slightly detuned damper configurations to
benefit from their favorable dynamic characteristics. The other objective
addresses the shortcomings of current passive liquid dampers, i.e., their
sluggishness in responding to sudden loads. Initial liquid oscillations will be
introduced experimentally to make the inertial damping system more effective.
Numerical models and physical scale models will be used to evaluate the
performance of the next generation of liquid dampers. Advances in the design and
development of these systems will result in increased safety and decreased
structural and economic losses. ***
