This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green University in the purchase of a 400
MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This new
instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of areas including the
following: 1) Electron-transfer across artificial B-sheets, 2) Allosteric
regulation of water soluble receptors, 3) NMR studies of the structures of
branched nucleic acids, 4) Photosensitized energy and electron transfer
reactions in surfactant bilayers on colloidal inorganic supports, 5) NMR studies
of rapidly polymerizing multifunctional monors. %%% A nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information about molecular structure (what
types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms are present, what are the relative number
of each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another in the molecule)
and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the moleule moving.
This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern synthetic chemistry
research program.
