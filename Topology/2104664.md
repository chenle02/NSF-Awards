Understanding 4-dimensional shapes called smooth 4-manifolds is a fundamental
challenge in the mathematical fields of geometry and topology and is intimately
related to theoretical physics through the framework of gauge theory. Surprising
results from the 20th century indicate that classification of 4-manifolds is
qualitatively much different, and more difficult, than corresponding questions
in both higher and lower dimensions. A fruitful approach to studying 4-manifolds
is to cut them into simpler pieces along 3-dimensional manifolds, so that
effective tools and techniques available from the comparatively simpler study of
3-manifolds can be brought to bear on the 4-dimensional realm. This research
project aims to deepen understanding of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds using
this approach, employing tools called "Floer homologies," which stem from gauge
theory and mathematical physics. The project will address questions that lie at
the border of 3- and 4-dimensions. For instance, it will explore algebraic
structures called homology cobordism groups, which allow 3-manifolds to be added
and subtracted by considering certain 4-manifolds that interpolate between them
like frames of a movie. The project will address several fundamental questions
on these structures and refine them to account for symmetries of the spaces
involved. The project will involve graduate students in the research.

This project studies topological and geometric objects in low dimensions, with
the aid of tools from gauge theory and symplectic geometry. Specific goals
include the development of techniques for studying smooth equivariant homology
cobordism groups, application of these techniques to long-standing questions on
knot concordance, and characterization of knots that bound complex curves in
Stein domains. The project will also create resources for students and
researchers seeking to learn the tools employed in pursuit of these goals.
Specific objectives in this direction include the completion and dissemination
of an informal introductory text on Heegaard Floer homology. The project draws
on methods from homological algebra, gauge theory, knot theory, contact
geometry, and the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.
