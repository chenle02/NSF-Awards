As part of the Foundation's initiative to strengthen research environments in
primarily undergraduate institutions, the Division of Networking and
Communications Science and Infrastructure considers proposals to defray CSNET
dues and operating expenses under the research instrumentation category of the
Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Program. Southeastern Massachusetts
University has met both RUI and CSNET membership requirements and demonstrates a
genuine need for network access. The CSNET connection will provide the
University quick access to the National Science Foundation's MOSIS integrated
circuit fabrication service and also provide University researchers access to
timely research information.
