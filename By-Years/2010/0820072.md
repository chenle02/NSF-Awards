NSF Proposal 0820072&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Verification of Open-Loop
Embedded Control Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rance
Cleaveland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops automated techniques for
efficiently analyzing the correctness of open-loop embedded control software.
Such software is widespread in the real-world, in automotive, flight-control,
medical-device and other human-in-the-loop applications, where environmental
behavior is unpredictable. The research effort is based on the observation that
such software can be effectively modeled using a particular mathematical
formalism called timed automata. The specific topics being studied include: 1)
Model checking: novel on-the-fly algorithms, in which system behavior is
explored in a demand-driven manner, are being developed for checking properties
of timed automata. 2) Industry-standard modeling and model checking: strategies
are being devised for adapting the model-checking tools to industry-standard
modeling notations such as SimulinkÂ© and for exploiting model structure to
enable verification of large models that arise in practice. The significance and
impact of the work derive from the more thorough verification of control
software the new technologies will enable. By automating formal validation
activities and supporting widely used modeling tools, the research will empower
engineers to conduct more intensive analyses of their control-system designs
earlier in the life-cycle than current techniques allow.&lt;br/&gt;
