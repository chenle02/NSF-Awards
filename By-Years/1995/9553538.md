*** 9553538 Morrell Atlanta Metropolitan College will initiate a 5-week,summer
commuter, Young Scholars project in chemistry and mathematics for 36 rising
students entering grades 7 and 8. The goal of Project SMART is to spark the
sense of wonder, intrigue, and challenge concerning mathematics and the sciences
in students who have been identified as having potential in these areas. This
goal will be accompllished through classroom lectures and discussion, laboratory
and field experiences stemming from an investigation into the chemistry of the
environment and an investigation into the mathematics arising from these
experiences. Students will also investigate the concepts involved in
mathematical modeling. ***
