The Department of Mathematics at the University of Maryland will purchase high-
end workstations and equipment which will be dedicated to support research in
the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular: 1. Adaptive Finite Element Methods for
Adaptive PDEs 2. High order upwind schemes for systems of conservation laws and
computational fluid dynamics 3. Deformation theory of discrete groups and
geometric structures 4. Theories of bifurcation and continuation in variational
principles
