This grant will support The Cornell Topology Festival for the next three years,
starting in Spring 2006. The Festival has been a strong force in the
mathematical life of topologists and geometers in the northeastern United States
for the past 42 years, providing a significant arena for the development and
dissemination of a broad array of results from within the areas of algebraic,
differential, and geometric topology and allied subjects. Each year
approximately one-third of the talks will be in a particular area of emphasis.
Recent examples are geometric group theory (2003), 3-manifold theory (2004), and
symplectic geometry and topology (2005). Each year's Festival will include two
introductory workshops in the area of emphasis, to provide a point of entry for
interested non-experts and a sense of involvement for all participants. It will
also include a broad-ranging panel discussion by the invited speakers, to
provide a forward-looking perspective on new developments not covered in the
talks.

The broader impacts of the Festival include (a) a more broadly-trained community
of topologists, able to transcend the boundaries of sub-specialties; (b) a more
diverse mathematical workforce; (c) a more rapid integration of younger
topologists into areas of current research; and (d) the enhancement of
collaboration among researchers in different areas of topology. There is an
outreach and support program to encourage the participation of underrepresented
groups and young researchers. The training effects of the Festival will be
extended by dissemination of lecture notes from the workshops and a summary of
the panel discussion; themain vehicle for this is the Festival web site, which
has been maintained continuously since 1997.
