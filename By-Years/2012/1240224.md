This is an EAGER project to support fieldwork targeting 360 million year old
rocks in western Mongolia. The field trip will be led by Dr. Yarinpil
Ariunchimeg, who is a senior scientist at the Mongolia Academy of Sciences in
Ulaanbaatar. The goal of the fieldwork is to examine these ancient outcrops to
locate rocks that are full of fossils that expose a boundary in time called the
Frasnian/Famennian boundary as well as other key intervals that show important
evolution and extinction events. The investigators hope to expand their
knowledge of the key biotic and geochemical events during this time interval
including the Kellwasser and Hangenberg oceanographic events, that reflect the
possible depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
