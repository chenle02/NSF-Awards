New designs of high performance integrated circuit chips require innovative
packaging methods to accommodate their increased size, complexity, speed and
heat flux. Severe limitations in the performance of future VLSI-based systems
are predicted unless substantial progress is made in the electrical, thermal and
thermo-chemical capabilities of chip- and board-level packaging.
