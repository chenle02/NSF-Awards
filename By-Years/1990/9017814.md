The aims of the proposed study are to determine if peripheral and central
osmoreceptors regulate the release of arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin
(MT) from the fowl neurohypophysis and to begin a characterization of the
afferent and efferent circuitries of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The
effects of stimulating putative intracranial and cardiac osmoreceptors on the
release of the hormones will be observed. Release of catecholamines at the PVN
in response to peripheral stimuli will be related to the character and loci of
adrenergic receptors in the anterior hypothalamus. Evoked changes in
neurohypophysial and autonomic functions will be compared with release of AVT
and MT at nerve terminals in the brainstem and the properties and loci of
peptidergic receptors. Adrenergic and peptide receptors will be studied using
radioligand assays on membranes and tissue sections. AVT and MT are measured by
radioimmunoassays. The neural circuitry is studied using stereotaxic and
intracranial microperfusion techniques. The results of the proposed study will
increase our understanding of the physiology of AVT and MT in the fowl and the
role the peptides play in regulating the endocrine and autonomic mechanisms that
maintain homeostasis.
