At Carnegie Mellon University, the VIGRE program of the Department of Statistics
will involve all trainees in supervised, cross-disciplinary research, where they
will learn how to translate a research question into well-posed statistical
problems, solve these problems, and translate the results back into a product
that is accessible to the relevant scientific community. This skill is also
central to learning basic statistics and forms a conceptual link between
research and education, facilitating their integration. At the graduate level
experience in the process includes a year-long project, typically with a faculty
member in another domain, while a Statistics faculty member serves as advisor;
provides a series of steps to improve communication skills and teaching
effectiveness, and mentors in the area of professional growth. The graduate
curriculum will be modified to make it more effective in building cross-
disciplinary skills. Undergraduates will have several new courses available and
will be involved in a capstone research project, and we will run a summer
program, emphasizing minority students. Postdoctoral fellows will be involved in
research projects, and will co-teach courses with senior faculty. They will also
participate in structured mentoring sessions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral trainees will be
integrated in research teams. The Carnegie Mellon VIGRE program in Statistics
will (i) train postdoctoral fellows for careers emphasizing research in settings
that require versatility, (ii) recruit and retain U.S. graduate students,
avoiding excessive time to complete Ph.D.s while providing students with a high
probability of success after graduation, and (iii) help increase the numbers of
U.S. undergraduates, including women and minorities, with advanced training in
statistical science. While maintaining a strong disciplinary foundation for
statistical practice, the program emphasizes cross-disciplinary research and
understanding the needs of statistical novices.
