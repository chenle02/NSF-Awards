ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;05 May 2008&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0819707&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Duke University&lt;br/&gt;PI: B.
Corliss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal requested three Shipboard Scientific
Support items for the R/V CAPE HATTERAS; namely winch wire monitoring system up-
grades to comply with new UNOLS standards, 50 new personal flotation devices
(PFD?s), and a new rescue/utility boat. All are important safety and operational
support pieces of equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The R/V CAPE
HATTERAS supports federally and state funded scientific research on the east
coast and routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing
oceanography. CAPE HATTERAS completed 22 NSF sponsored days in 2007. &lt;br/&gt;
