9405278 Ellis The basic premise of plate tectonics that plates more as rigid
bodies with deformation occurring only at boundaries between plates is violated
locally within continents, as demonstrated by the existence of broad zones of
diffuse strain. This study intra-plate strain focuses on the northern Walker
Lane in the Basin and Range province of the Western United States. Prior work
has delineated fault-bounded blocks, identified units that will yield useful
paleomagnetic results and documented the orientation and sense of slip an major
faults, some of which are nearly orthogonal to each other. This work will test
for vertical-axis rotations of the identified blocks and will develop a
kinematic model of this example of intra-plate strain including block rotations.
Results will also provide insight into the relationship between intracontinental
strain nd plate-boundary interactions.
