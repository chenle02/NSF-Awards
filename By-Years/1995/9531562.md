Abstract 9531562 May The GT-SUPREEM is an eight week summer REU Site program
designed to attract qualified minority students into electrical engineering. Ten
students will be recruited annually on a nationwide basis and paired with
faculty and a graduate student mentor to undertake research projects in
electrical engineering. Examples of research projects include: 1.) Theoretical
studies of electronic state in finite quantum wells and superlattices, 2.) Four-
wave mixing: cross talk behavior in optical fiber, 3.) Focal plane image
processing and signal amplification, 4.) Implementation of context cache for
pica architecture, and 5.) A quadrature oscillator using sliding modes.
