9402033 Detrick This project continues work on a multichannel seismic and ocean
bottom seismograph study of the southern East Pacific Rise between the Garrett
transform and 20 degrees south. Questions that will be addressed include: (1)
the significance of the rapid increase in P-wave velocity at the base of seismic
layer 2A, (2) the physical properties of the melt lens, (3) the dimensions and
physical properties of the low velocity volume in mid and lower crust beneath
the axial magma chamber, (4) the nture of Moho in the axial region, and (5) the
variation in axial crustal structure across an overlapping spreading center. ***
