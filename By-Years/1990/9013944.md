This dissertation research award will support a graduate student in
anthropology in a field study of the role of secrecy and knowledge in a highland
group in Papua New Guinea. Most previous studies have examined reciprocal
exchanges as the basis of social life in this sort of group; this research looks
at the refusal to exchange, by keeping secret valuable practical knowledge, to
see how that constrains social relations. Methods include participant
observation and structured interviewing. This research is important because it
modifies the position that shared knowledge is the basis of social life in small
societies. In fact the possession of secret knowledge is an important fact in
every social system, and this project will shed light on how one small-scale
society uses secrecy to establish and maintain social relations. The case study
will be valuable as a comparison to small-group studies of knowledge exchange in
group process.
