The purpose of this project is to examine the flux and deposition of zooplankton
fecal pellets in the Black Sea. Samples will be obtained from box cores, gravity
cores, and sediment traps above and below the oxic/anoxic boundary in the water
column. Seasonal and spacial variability in the flux and composition of modern
pellets will be determined and compared to the flux and content of the pellets
buried in laminated Black Sea sediments. This study will provide a model of the
factors controlling fecal pellet sedimentation in an anoxic basin. The results
may be used to model the paleoflux of pellets in other basins where the pellets
are poorly preserved due to microbial activity, oxidation, or bioturbation which
are largely absent in the anoxic Black Sea sediments.
