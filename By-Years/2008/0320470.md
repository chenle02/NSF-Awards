This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involves the
development of a robust, field-portable gas analyzer capable of determining the
carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide emitting from deep-sea hydrothermal
vents. These vents provide access to water that has been trapped under the ocean
in a unique, anaerobic environment that is devoid of photosynthesis and emulates
the conditions believed to exist under the ice crusts of Europa and Callisto,
beneath the surface of Mars, and on primordial Earth. Preliminary carbon isotope
studies suggest that biological activity takes place in such an environment and
novel instrumentation is sought to provide further evidence. The Phase II
analyzer, based upon our proprietary Off-Axis ICOS technology, will determine
the isotope ratio in-situ to within 1 angstrom, which is sufficient to
discriminate between biogenic and geological carbon sources, and may provide
evidence for a Subsurface Lithotrophic Microbiological Ecosystem (SLiME). The
proposed instrument, which will interface with the Medusa seafloor sampling
system developed by NASA Ames, will operate autonomously and be able to
withstand the harsh underwater conditions found near deep-sea vents. The Phase
II work will involve scientific development to enhance the prototype's
specificity, deep-sea packaging to permit underwater deployment, and testing to
demonstrate the analyzer's capabilities. &lt;br/&gt; One of the most promising
markets for our novel Off-Axis ICOS technology is in industrial process control
(IPC). The Phase II instrument can be directly converted to an IPC analyzer due
to its ability to autonomously operate in harsh environments, integration of
compact control system, and use of sophisticated chemometric algorithms. Within
the $1.67B IPC market, the targeted markets will be those in which current
technology is either too expensive or insufficient, such as the niche in the
fast analysis of acetylene contamination in ethylene.&lt;br/&gt;
