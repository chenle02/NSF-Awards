To address environmental problems in the educational sphere, the Lawrence Hall
of Science located in Berkeley, California will be conducting a three-year
project consisting of five summer institutes. The institutes will serve a total
of 125 teacher-leaders who will incorporate a course in Global Systems Science
into existing high school programs in their regions. Further, these teacher-
leaders will assist in the education of their colleagues across the nation. The
project will begin by inviting 25 teachers to pilot test the Global Systems
Science materials during the summer of 1992. These participants will help shape
the instructional materials and several of them will return as staff members
during the subsequent summer institutes. During 1993 and 1994, a total of four
additional institutes will last three weeks and accommodate 25 teacher-leaders.
The Global Systems Science course materials will form the core curriculum.
Participants in all five institutes will visit laboratories and learn "first
hand" about the work of professionals who investigate such topics as global
climate change, energy efficiency, ozone depletion, and other topics. These
participants will also receive instruction in how to assess learning, and how to
become a leader in their district.
