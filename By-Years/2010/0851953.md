This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This post-doctoral fellowship award
supports a project to determine the spatial extent of metamorphosed snow, and
the amount of grain growth due to metamorphism in firn on the East Antarctic
Plateau. This will be combined with satellite-based mapping and data from
surface traverse-acquired radar profiles in order to improve the physical
understanding of depositional processes and their impact on the character of
radar signals from areas of extensive snow metamorphism. The intellectual merit
of the research is that it combines previous surface work on firn metamorphism
on the East Antarctic Plateau with the wealth of recent traverse and remote-
sensing based information on firn physical properties and surface topography.
The objective is to fully document the location and character of megadune areas
on the Plateau and create a comprehensive, plateau-wide context for megadune
occurrence. The broader impacts of this work are that it will provide technical
and career development opportunities for the PI by introducing her to the use of
remote sensing techniques that provide spatial context for understanding the
depositional and metamorphic processes in firn that she has previously studied.
This interdisciplinary approach combines previous work with mentoring in remote
sensing research at the University of New Hampshire with sponsoring scientist
Mark Fahnestock. The research will also make a contribution toward understanding
mass accumulation over East Antarctica - a fundamental problem faced by
researchers trying to access the present mass balance of the ice sheet. The
project will also involved informal science outreach, with emphasis on Arctic
communities.
