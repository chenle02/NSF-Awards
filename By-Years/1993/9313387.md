9313387 Hutzler The Environmental Engineering programs at Michigan Technological
University have grown substantially over the past ten years. To accommodate this
growth, the university has assigned research space that has been vacated by the
Department of Metallurgical Engineering. While some of the space is adequate for
environmental engineering research, much of the existing facility is either
outdated or unsuitable for research activities. Those laboratories that are
adequate for research were equipped in 1968 when the building was constructed,
and thus are severely limited for modernized research use. Much of the present
research is conducted at several locations on and off campus. This ARI award
will provide funding for the renovation of this space to bring it to the
standards necessary for the increasing volume of research being conducted by the
environmental engineering faculty and students. This includes the renovation of
laboratory space, installation of laboratory utilities, and the acquisition and
installation of fixed equipment. Once the renovations are completed, faculty,
students, and staff will be capable of performing research that they are
presently committed to as well as conduct research that they would like to do
but cannot within the existing infrastructure. The facility will be able to
accommodate additional faculty and students in the renovated area, allowing for
continued growth and increased productivity within the Environmental Engineering
program. ***
