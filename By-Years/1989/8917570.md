The overall objective of this proposal is to contribute to a basic understanding
of the functional properties of biological macromolecules as revealed in
accurate atomic models. Such models are significant for the generation and
testing of hypotheses directly related to biological action in diverse systems.
Diffraction studies on crystals can provide detailed and comprehensive
structural information on proteins and other macromolecules, and
multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is emerging as an alternative source of such
information. It is important that the atomic models derived from these
experiments be defined as accurately as possible. Dr. Hendrickson is seeking
here to develop methods for optimizing the accuracy of experimentally determined
atomic models, to apply these refinement methods to specific biochemical
problems, and to analyze in detail the structural and dynamic properties of the
resulting models. In particular, (1) he will refine a number of significant
biological macromolecules against x-ray diffraction data, and analyze the
structural and dynamic properties of the resulting models, (2) he will identify
attributes that characterize reliably determined structures, (3) he will attempt
to enhance the efficiency and convenience of crystallographic refinement
procedures, (4) he will strive to develop appropriate treatments for dynamic
properties in crystal, (5) he will extend the method of stereochemically
restrained refinement to problems in 2D NMR spectroscopy, and (6) he will
continue to maintain and distribute a system of refinement programs.
