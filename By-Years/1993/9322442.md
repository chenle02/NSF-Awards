9322442 Woodin The focus of the project is the relationship between large
cardinal axioms and determinacy axioms. This is interpreted somewhat broadly and
is meant to include, for example, the study of a new class of models. These
models are generated as forcing extensions of models in which the axiom of
determinacy holds. They are interesting because they provide the first examples
of canonical models in which the Continuum Hypothesis is false. One consequence
of Kurt Godel's results of 60 years ago is that there will always be
mathematical problems which cannot be solved. This first became a practical
concern 30 years ago when Paul Cohen showed that Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis
cannot be settled. Since Cohen's work, numerous problems have been shown to be
unsolvable. The large cardinal hierarchy provides in many cases a resolution to
the problem of independence. This is done, not by resolving the question, but
rather by calibrating the degree to which it is unsolvable. This hierarchy of
axioms, each of which asserts the existence of a new infinity, emerges as the
fundamental mathematical reality. The investigator intends to study this
hierarchy in its many manifestations. ***
