Two major pieces of equipment are required for the comprehensive undergraduate
surveying engineering program. A total station which combines all aspects of the
survey field measuring system in one unit and a data collector which enables
digital storage of measurements followed by downloading of the data into a
microcomputer for processing is one area. The other area involves the ERDAS
digital mapping, image processing, geographic information system. ERDAS will be
the core unit in the remote sensing area of the curriculum. Processing and
display of remotely sensed data using this system will expose the student to the
capabilities of modern equipment in the rapidly evolving area of surveying
engineering. The understanding of the relationship of all forms of spatial
information collection and analysis is a key goal.
