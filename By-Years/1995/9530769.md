AST 9530769 The Allegheny Observatory Astrometric Program. The Allegheny
Observatory astrometric program utilizes unique instrumentation to determine
very high precision parallaxes and masses of astrophysically interesting objects
within 250 parsecs of the Sun. Combining the Multichannel Astrometric Photometer
(MAP) and the new optical system of the Thaw refractor, the astrometric program
has sufficient precision to obtain reliable trigonometric distances of several
open star clusters as well as other luminosity standards in most parts of the HR
diagram. Combined with data from a 70 year baseline photographic plate
collection, the MAP/Thaw system has sufficient precision to delineate portions
of the mass-luminosity relationship previously outside of the domain of
trigonometric techniques, and to make signfiicant improvements in our
understanding of the effects of age and chemical composition on the energy
output of stars. ====================================
