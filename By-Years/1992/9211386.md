As individuals age and pass through different stages of life, their responses
to the world around them change in both predictable and unpredictable ways.
These changes often involve how well, how rapidly, and what an individual
learns. One of the most challenging problems in biology is to understand how
changes in brain structure relate to development of behavior in adults; of
particular interest are age-related changes in behavior involving learning and
memory. Dr. Robinson and Dr. Fahrbach will capitalize on exciting data that
indicate changes in circulating juvenile hormone (JH) influence both the
behavioral development of worker bees and the determination of caste. It is
known that worker bees perform a complex series of behaviors during their short
(20-42) days of life. Younger bees rear the next generation; middle-aged bees
maintain the hive and guard the colony; the most mature bees forage outside of
the hive for nectar and pollen. Foraging is an extremely demanding task
involving learning and memory, and advanced forms of communication. These
striking changes in behavior are mediated by changes in juvenile hormone.
Juvenile hormone also causes the permanent differentiation of females into
either queens or workers. Drs Robinson and Fahrbach are using these systems to
define the neural pathway through which hormone action on the brain causes
transient or permanent changes in behavior. They will investigate how juvenile
hormone influences neurogenesis or neural circuitry during periods in which
behaviors are changing. In the long term, the goal to use this excellent model
system to provide information on how learning and memory are affected by
hormones. In addition, the honey bee is an important insect for agriculture.
Therefore, greater understanding of the plasticity of behavior may contribute
its continual role as an important agricultural pollinator.
