Objective: The objective of the proposed research is to analyze, design, and
construct novel imaging systems that are completely constrained to planar or
linear form factors. These waveguide-based devices will be extended to passive
white-light illumination by applying computational imaging concepts, and their
performance will be assessed in real-world
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The
intellectual merit embracing this technology consists of a synergistic
combination of novel optics with sophisticated signal processing algorithms. The
proposed optical systems utilize waveguides and grating couplers in
unconventional ways, and represent a significant challenge in modeling,
fabrication, and testing. The signal processing algorithms are uniquely designed
to enable the various imaging architectures, and will push the state-of-the-art
in the areas of signal recovery, tomographic image reconstruction, and
aberration correction. Underpinning these efforts, the fundamental limits of
optical throughput, light sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, and
image space-bandwidth will be assessed, laying a foundation for future planar
camera designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader
impacts are 1) development of new imaging paradigms that enable cameras with
extreme form factors, 2) training of graduate students in the cross-disciplinary
areas of physical optics and signal processing, 3) augmentation of undergraduate
instruction to incorporate interdisciplinary themes, and 4) outreach efforts to
enhance K-12 student interest in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;
