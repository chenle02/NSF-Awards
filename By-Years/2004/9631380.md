Dr. Andrew B. Bocarsly of the Chemistry Department, Princeton University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
for research on the photochemistry and photophysics of multielectron charge
transfer reactions. A multimetal cyano-bridged Pt(IV) system has been shown to
undergo a two-electron charge transfer reaction after photoexcitation. This
system will be studied in detail in order to gain better understanding of the
primary controlling process. The electronic and molecular structure of the
primary photoproduct will be determined using high speed laser spectroscopy. The
degree of delocalization associated with the charge transfer state will be
determined, as well as the role of solvent. This information will be used to
synthesize new cyano-bridged multinuclear systems in order to provide molecular
control over the observed charge transfer chemistry. Materials in which
electrons are mobilized after being activated by light are technologically
important. In this project, the structural details of the effect of reaction
with light on a series of compounds will be determined. Attempts will be made to
extend the lifetime of the material so that further photoactivation can take
place. This fundamental research project will improve capability to utilize
solar energy for the formation of useful fuels and fine chemicals and to develop
nonlinear optical materials.
