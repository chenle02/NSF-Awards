9628850 Robinson This award provides support for Dr. Robinson's continuing
research on the low frequency variability of the extratropical atmosphere and
employs a mix of observational analyses, analyses of general circulation model
output, and simple numerical models. The principal investigator will focus on
three tasks. The first is the development and application of a generalized
barotropic model to be used for diagnostic and process studies of low frequency
variability, both observed and in general circulation models (GCMs). This is a
new undertaking by the PI and involves a new, creative approach that employs the
PI's empirically derived formulation of the relationship between potential
vorticity and the streamfunction. The other two tasks represent continuations of
previously supported work. One is a series of diagnostic studies of the dynamics
governing the zonal index in GCM output and in observations, and of the
predictability of the zonal index. The other major area involves analytical
studies of the nonlinear behavior of the barotropic instability of zonally
asymmetric basic states which is believed to contribute to the low frequency
variability in the atmosphere. All of these studies are important for advancing
understanding of atmospheric dynamic processes that are critical to improved
extended range prediction. ***
