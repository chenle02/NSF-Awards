This is a project to develop and implement a web-based "community model"
(websim3D) for the generation, storage, and dissemination of ground motion
simulation results. Websim3D will initially be based on the nine long-period
finite-difference (FD) earthquake scenario simulations carried out for the Los
Angeles basin by the P.I. The user-friendly access to the simulated ground
motion time histories will allow seismologists and engineers to analyze the
broadband synthetic ground motions for desired earthquake scenarios at sites of
interest.

The P.I. is regarded as an authority on simulation of ground-motion for southern
California earthquakes using the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC)
Community 3-D seismic-velocity model. His prior work set the standard for this
type of simulation. Getting state-of-the-art ground-motion simulations for
scenario earthquakes to the scientific and engineering community is a high
priority, especially for the Los Angeles region of southern California, which
contains 25% of the nation's seismic risk. ***
