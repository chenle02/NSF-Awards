This collaborative research (with Wright, SES92-09210) will study work, social
class, and social mobility in Russia and the United States. Exact replicate
surveys were designed and administered in European Russia and the USA in 1991.
The study will analyze these survey data to describe and compare the class
structure in the two countries. The study will examine differences between the
US and Russia in attitudes toward egalitarianism, the normative link between
education, occupation and income, and attitudes toward state versus private
control of the economy. The study will provide a much need comparative
perspective on social stratification in Russia and the United States and shed
new light on the relationship between social structure and stratification
processes. The study also will make an important contribution to the study of
the relationship between type of political economy and social mobility and
equality of opportunity.
