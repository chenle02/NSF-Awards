This CCLI Phase 2 collaborative research project, "Online Statistics Education:
An Interactive Multimedia Course of Study II," is updating, expanding, and
enhancing one of the most used free websites for teaching introductory-level
statistics. In particular, the project team is making the materials compatible
with learning management systems (such as Blackboard) and developing a large
bank of test items to assist students with mastery learning. Based on the
American Statistical Association supported Guidelines for the Assessment and
Instruction of Statistics Education (GAISE), the project team is revising and
improving selected content, developing additional case studies, improving the
usability, and increasing the production value of the multimedia components.
Furthermore, this collaborative team is also optimizing the materials to run on
mobile devices to provide students with easy and constant access to learning
materials. The effectiveness of the materials across a range of educational
institutions is being assessed by independent evaluators. The product and the
evaluation results are being disseminated to the statistics education
communities through the statistics education digital library, CAUSEweb, and
through other publication and presentation venues.
