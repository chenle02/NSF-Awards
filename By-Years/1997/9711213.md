9711213 Barro Under their previous NSF grant the investigators assembled and
placed on the internet an international data set that includes a large number of
economic, political, and social variables useful for analyzing the determination
of economic growth. This project concentrates on improving measures of the
quality and quality of school attainment for a broad cross section of countries.
This information, which includes student performance on internationally
comparable examinations, will be incorporated into an updated version of the
data on the determinants of economic growth. A long-term panel will also be
assembled that includes indicators of democracy and other aspects of political
structure. This information will be merged with measures of economic
performance, schooling, and other variables and used to assess the determinants
of political structure, including the extent of democracy.
