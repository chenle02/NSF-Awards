It is proposed to apply hydrostatic pressure to vary the built-in strain to
conduct a study of the physical processes responsible for the improvements in
the laser characteristics with strain. Calculations of the strain in the laser
structures under pressure show that an additional strain is generated in the
laser active area due to the difference in the elastic constants between the
active and cladding years. The cladding and carrier confinement layers, being
much thicker than the active layer, deform isotropically with pressure. The
additional strain created by high pressure will allow for the first time the
tuning of the initial built-in strain from compressive to tensile in a single
device. In t his way, it will be possible to evaluate solely the effect of
strain and avoid variations in the growth conditions which take place when the
effect of strain is evaluated by comparing devices from different waters with
different compositions.
