The PI is proposing to utilize a novel expression system (baculovirus vectors)
to determine the functional significance of the various isoforms of tyrosine
hydroxylase. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in
catecholamine biosynthesis and, as such, is a crucial and pivotal point in many
physiological processes. Recently, the PI's laboratory has isolated full length
cDNAs of the multiple human subtypes. To investigate whether these different
isotypes have altered functions, the PI will subclone the cDNAs into the
baculovirus expression vectors. This system will generate large quantities of
the different forms of TH to permit kinetic and structural analyses. This system
will also provide the means to use site- directed mutagenesis to assess the role
of particular amino acids in phosphorylation, catalysis, cofactor binding, etc.
Results from these studies will delineate structural requirements for TH
regulation and expression and will help understand mechanisms of activation and
possible roles in atypical catecholamine function.***//
