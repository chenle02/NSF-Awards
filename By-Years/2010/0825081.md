The purpose of this proposal is to provide financial support for selected US
participants to the trimester program ?Interacting particles, statistical
mechanics and probability theory? running from September to December 2008 in
Institut Henri PoincarÂ´e, Paris, France. This program will attract many leading
researchers working in the interdisciplinary field between probability theory
and statistical physics and host them for various durations. It will propose
three workshops, five long courses, and a dozen of mini-courses. The main
objective of this proposal is to ensure that US based junior researchers do not
miss this opportunity to interact and learn from the best experts of this
important field for lack of support. Strong preferences will be given to
beginning researchers showing great promise, i.e., advanced graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty in need of financial support. Participation by
talented junior researchers can be expected to have a major impact on their
careers, and hence on the continued leadership role of the US in this area.
Strong participation by this group will also be essential for the healthy
development of this young and active field.
