Partial support is provided with other federal agencies for a four- day
symposium on the tribology of surfaces exposed to extreme environments. The
symposium will be held in conjunction with the Fall Meeting of the Materials
Research Society during December of 1988. Many developing areas of advanced
technology are dependent on components which operate under very severe
environments of temperature, vacuum, and/or aggressive gases. In these
environments the tribological problems are especially severe and must be solved
primarily through advances in materials science and engineering. The symposium
will expose researchers in these fields to current problem areas in tribology
for advanced applications and is expected to stimulate research on
tribomaterials as well as cross-disciplinary research between materials science,
materials engineering, and more traditional tribology fields.
