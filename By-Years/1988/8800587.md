This research project will examine the role of indigenous categories of
inequality in the construction of contemporary social and economic relations
among the Luo of western Kenya. The investigator will focus on Luo concepts
which traditionally have defined differential access to resources based on
kinship status. She will test the hypothesis that these traditional cultural
cateogies are still important, even in the face of increasing social and
economic differentiation resulting from the emergence of a capitalistic economic
system. This project will explore the interaction between external forces of
capitalism and indigenous cultural categories of relationship as they relate to
the emergence of class forms. The results will increase our understanding of the
processes of change and stratification in African societies.
