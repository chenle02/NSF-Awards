This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site in Physics at Kansas State University. The REU site will focus on
interactions of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscales. Each year the
ten-week program will involve twelve undergraduate students. The participants
will engage in significant research projects and related experiences during the
summer. Participants will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in
intense and ultra-fast optical and xray pulses, how scattered laser light
reveals the structure of nanoparticle crystallization and gel formation, what
eye-tracking reveals about how students learn, or how light interacts non-
linearly in optical fibers; or they will develop computer codes for calculations
of atomic interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates, for modeling nanoparticle
self-assembly from lattices to gels, or for particle tracking for neutrino
detection. This experience will be supplemented by a small series of lectures
that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The
participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety
of audiences and will also engage in reading on and discussion of ethical
behavior in science. Social activities, both organized and spontaneous, will
enrich this undergraduate research experience.
