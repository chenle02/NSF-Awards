STEIN, Robert F. 95-21785 Dr. Stein will investigate the interaction between
solar p-modes, convection, rotation and magnetic fields. The research will be
accomplished by analyzing realistic numerical simulations of the upper solar
convection zone and photosphere and idealized simulations of the deep convection
zone and stable layers below it. It will also include comparison of the
simulations with GONG observations and development of simple conceptual models
to represent the findings. ***
