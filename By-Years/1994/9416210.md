9416210 Stuart Thompson Calcium ions hold a central position in the hierarchy of
events that regulate both the metabolism and the unique functional attributes of
neurons in the nervous system. A delicate interplay exits between the entry of
calcium into the cells through ion channels in the membrane and the removal of
calcium from the cells by ion pumps. When this balance is disturbed for longer
than a few minutes, the result is nerve cell death. Consequently, there is great
interest among researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers in
understanding the mechanisms that control calcium levels in neurons. This
conference will bring together researchers, educators, graduate students and
drug company representatives to discuss the latest findings in this research
area. The focus is on a neuly discovered pathway that directly links the
metabolic state of the neuron to the control of the calcium entry pathway. This
pathway is changing our view of metabolic regulation and neuronal function. This
meeting will bring together the key persons involved in this research around the
world.
