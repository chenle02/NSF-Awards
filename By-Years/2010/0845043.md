The principal investigator will carry out a laboratory research program aimed at
better understanding and quantifying interactions of trace gases with ice and
snow. A quantitative physical understanding of these interactions is critical
for predicting the effects of climate change on atmospheric composition, for the
interpretation of ice core chemical records, and for modeling atmospheric
chemistry. Emphasis will be on several gases key to polar photochemistry:
formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, nitrous acid, and peroxynitric acid. The
principal tools will be (1) a flow tube reactor with ice-coated walls coupled
with chemical ionization mass spectrometry for quantification of trace gases,
and (2) the surface-specific technique ellipsometry to probe quasi-liquid layers
(QLL) and quasi-brine layers (QBL) at ice surfaces of various compositions.

The broader impacts component of this project will include involvement of one
post-doc, one graduate student, and a K-12 science educator. Education/outreach
will have three major thrusts: (1) "Science of the Atmosphere", a bilingual
(English and Spanish) interactive web site designed to teach students, families
and educators about air pollution, climate change, and other atmospheric science
topics, (2) a research and curriculum development partnership with a New York
City area K-12 science educator, and (3) laboratory activities with economically
disadvantaged New York City public school students from groups that are
underrepresented in science and engineering.
