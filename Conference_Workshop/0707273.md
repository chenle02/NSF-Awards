The proposal is to provide support for the participation of US researchers in
this weeklong workshop. These conferences have been held every two years since
1995 and have been very beneficial to research activities in these fields. There
has been considerable collaboration between US and Brazilian mathematicians on
these topics and these meetings have resulted in considerable progress in these
areas. The proceedings of this conference will be published in a similar manner
to most of the previous proceedings.

The workshop will focus on recent results and open questions in the theory of
CR manifolds, analytic hypoellipticity, delta-bar cohomology and overdetermined
systems of partial differential equations and their applications in geometry and
physics.
