This proposal supports a symposium entitled Computing Science and Statistics:
Symposium on the Interface, and subtitled Statistics on Many Parameters: Curves,
Images, Spatial Models. The conference is to be held 17-19 May 1990 at the
Kellogg Center at Michigan State University. This is the 1990 version of a
continuing series of symposia sponsored by The American Statistical Association,
the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics. This series provides an opportunity for professionals in
statistics, computing science, and numerical methods to interact. This
particular conference is intended to be a showpiece for the computer-video
presentation of statistical and numerical research on problems involving curves,
images, and spatial models.
