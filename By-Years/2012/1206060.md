This project will use a combination of experiment and theory to test the
hypothesis that mechanical forces generated by the cytoskeleton are important
for efficient immune response during T cell activation. Forces generated by T
cells during signaling activation will be measured and correlated with
intracellular dynamics of cytoskeletal proteins and receptor clusters as well as
signaling. Computer simulations of the feedback between signaling and force
generation will be developed to compare with experimental results on molecular
perturbations that interrupt the mechanochemical feedback. This research will
provide fundamental insights into the role of physical forces in the biochemical
signaling function of lymphocytes. The research project will enhance the
understanding of biological systems using experimental and theoretical tools
from Physics and Cell Biology. In particular, gaining deeper insights into the
way immune cells are activated may facilitate future biomedical advances. A
course titled Dynamics of Cells will be developed in which concepts from topics,
such as statistical and continuum mechanics, will be used to explain biological
processes. A laboratory component will introduce students to basic biophysics
techniques and cell biology experiments. Students from disadvantaged socio-
economic backgrounds, as well as high school students, especially females from
the area high schools, will be encouraged to participate in research. Software
developed as part of this research to model actin dynamics and mechanical
signaling will be made publicly available.
