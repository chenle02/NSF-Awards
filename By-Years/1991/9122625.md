Education is central to a large number of issues that economists consider
important: the distribution of income, the growth rate of an economy, and the
determination of a country's comparative advantage are a few prominent examples.
Despite this, the factors that determine the nature of the educational system
have received relatively little theoretical attention. The purpose of this
project is to develop models to study the endogenous determination of
educational policy. It will do so by studying various interactions among income
distribution, the political system, and key attributes of the educational
system. Quality, accessibility and community composition are the characteristics
this project plans to concentrate on, with special attention paid to the
consequences that arise from the fact that education is provided by both the
private and the public sector.
