Numerous technical and environmental forces are increasing the importance of
data privacy for businesses and individuals alike. These forces include the
migration of data to Web services, the permanent archiving of large volumes of
data and communications by services and ISPs, and legal actions that are forcing
individuals and organizations to reveal private (and even encrypted) data.
Traditional encryption is an insufficient solution under these conditions,
thereby creating new challenges to preserving our digital privacy in an
increasingly inter-connected and digital world. This project tackles these
challenges through the creation of a principled framework for protecting the
privacy of past data -- such as copies of emails maintained by an email provider
-- against accidental, malicious, and legal disclosure, even to entities who
have access to the decryption keys. This framework consists of both underlying
technical mechanisms and prototype applications; these mechanisms and prototype
applications are developed in concert to ensure the broadest applicability of
the overall framework. These prototype applications, by themselves, also
directly address the privacy needs of broad classes of individuals, ranging from
home users wishing to enhance the privacy of their email communications to
voting machine manufacturers wishing to improve the privacy of electronic voting
audit logs.
