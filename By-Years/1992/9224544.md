Discovering functional relationships among high-dimensional data is
astonishingly hard. Overcoming the "curse of dimensionality" is a vital problem
for any complex manufacturing industry, such as VLSI production, in which
hundreds of variables must be precisely controlled in order to achieve high-
quality yield. This research addresses both theoretical and practical concerns.
On the theoretical end, statisticians have recently proposed a number of
compelling new ideas for high-dimensional, nonparametric regression (e.g., ACE,
AVAS, LOESS, PPR, MARS, RPR and several other algorithms). These ideas are
largely untested, and little is known about their comparative performance in
realistic situations. To remedy this, a large-scale simulation experiment is
performed that employs statistical design to evaluate the effects of sample
size, dimensionality, signal-to-noise ratio, and various kinds of underlying
functions on the integrated mean squared error of the fitted model. The results
of the study are examined in an analysis of variance, leading to clear
conclusions as to the circumstances under which each of the proposed methods is
most valuable. On the practical side, this research applies the methodology
studied in the simulation experiment to VLSI production data as micro-modeled by
the PREDITOR software, which is widely used in industry to calculate from
physical principles the actual result of each step in the production of a VLSI
circuit wafer. ***
