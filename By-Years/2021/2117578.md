Human communication happens both when we speak to each other and when we write
things down. Researchers studying how people communicate can easily obtain many
examples of written material. Written material is also easy to analyze because
it is easy to scan it for computer use or to download it from the Internet. It
is far more difficult to do research on spoken language because it is much
harder to record speech and convert those recordings into a format a computer
can use, especially speech that occurs in natural situations such as a family
conversation around a dinner table or an argument between children in a
classroom. This project will build a new system that will let researchers and
students examine recorded conversations and provide additional data about
details of those conversations, such as the talkers’ emotions, that cannot
otherwise be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new system to be built will be
part of the TalkBank system at Carnegie Mellon University, the largest publicly
accessible databank for the study of spoken language in the world. TalkBank
includes audio and video recordings from children, classrooms, bilinguals,
second language learners, and persons with language disorders in 34 different
languages, together with written transcripts of those recordings. The new system
will allow scientists and researchers to study human communication by looking at
patterns of speech in individual conversations, which is a level of detailed
analysis that is not currently possible. Studying communication at the
conversation level is important because fine details in speech patterns can help
answer important questions such as how people resolve confusion and
misunderstandings as a conversation unfolds. The new system will be based on a
concept called Collaborative Commentary, which allows research groups and
students to add comments about important conversation details, such as talkers’
motivations, directly into the database by adding links to the conversation
transcript. This same system will also permit users to provide comments on media
that has not yet been transcribed and create new transcripts through a web
browser interface. This project will engage the public with the data through
Citizen Science and provide a resource for teaching about language and
communication through guided commentary. Completion of this work will open up a
remarkable new window to the study of spoken language and
communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
