This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Savannah. The R/V Savannah is a 92 foot
coastal research vessel operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography as part
of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. The request includes four items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt; 1)
Fluorometers&lt;br/&gt; 2) Suite of Net Systems&lt;br/&gt; 3) Grab
Systems&lt;br/&gt; 4) Pinger/Transponders&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows
NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition of the shared use
underway sensors and sampling equipment will provide an important upgrade to the
coastal observing capabilities of the R/V Savannah.
