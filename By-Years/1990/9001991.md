Dr. Silvia Lopez has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Lopez's doctoral degree was from Cornell University under the
supervision of Professor Hector Abruna. Dr. Lopez intends to continue research
at the University of Minnesota under the sponsorship of Professor Henry S.
White. Dr. Lopez's area of postdoctoral research will be studies of the dynamics
of electrocrystallization of low dimensional solids. By carefully controlling
electrode potentials, Dr. Lopez will be able to monitor crystallization of
specific phases by scanning tunneling microscopy. The Postdoctoral Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
