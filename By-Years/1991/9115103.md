The timing of radio pulses from "pulsars" has become important to a number of
areas in physics and astronomy, including the integrity of time-keeping
standards, the detection and measurement of the effects of gravitational
radiation, the measurement of shifts of the crusts of neutron stars, and the
understanding of how pulsars are born, "reborn," and evolve with time. The
Principal Investigator (PI) is widely regarded as heading the group doing much
of the most precise work on the timing of pulsar pulses. He proposes to continue
these observations using improved equipment that he has designed at Arecibo and
Green Bank radio observatories. It is expected that this work will continue to
be among the most fundamental in linking observational astrophysics and tests of
General Relativity.
