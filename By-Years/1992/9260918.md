Post-disaster assessment of structural damage due to hurricanes is generally
conducted in not sufficient depth as to be of value to structural engineers,
architects, builders and officials responsible for developing and implementing
building codes. The present work will take the opportunity provided by Hurricane
Andrew to conduct detailed inspections of failed or damaged structures of
diverse kind and their components; to undertake distress analyses and design
investigations to confirm actual loading at failure; to develop a consistent
methodology for hurricane damage assessment; and to present recommendations for
code- writing authorities.
