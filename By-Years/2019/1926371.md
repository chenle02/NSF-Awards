Microscopic imaging of tissue samples is a fundamental tool used for the
diagnosis of various diseases and forms the workhorse of pathology and
biological sciences. The clinically-established gold standard image of a tissue
section is the result of a laborious process. This work will demonstrate the
ability to virtually stain label-free tissue sections and will revolutionize the
current paradigm for histological analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To
demonstrate deep learning-based virtual histology staining of label-free human
tissue samples this proposal will use salivary gland, thyroid, kidney, liver and
lung samples, and will use three commonly used stains: H&amp;E (salivary gland
and thyroid), Jones stain (kidney) and Masson's Trichrome (liver and lung). This
proposal will determine the staining efficacy of the proposed approach for whole
slide images and will blindly evaluate the virtually stained outputs with gold
standard stained samples. The output of this proposed system will be validated
by a group of pathologists who will compare histopathological features with the
virtual staining technique against conventional histology
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
