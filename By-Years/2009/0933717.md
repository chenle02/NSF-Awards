This workshop of about 15 experts explores future research directions in
cognitive radio networks. The team members have all been involved with early
projects aimed at demonstrating the potential of cognitive radio platforms.
Based on the results of several projects conducted over the past few years, the
PIs believe that the time is right for a large-scale testbed project aimed at
conclusively demonstrating the benefits of this technology, at scale, with
applications, and in real-world deployment scenarios.

The PIs: (a) Develop a scientific perspective that clearly articulates research
questions and challenges that need to be addressed that need to be solved to
build Cognitive Radio systems, (b) define the required infrastructure to carry
out the science, (c) develop and present a coherent road-map agenda, (d) define
educational outreach activities that will engage teachers/students in this
effort.

The availability of a general-purpose platform that can serve as a
microprocessor-like universal platform for wireless system development and
deployment is potentially transformative. Such a platform and one or more test-
bed facilities available to the broader community of computer scientists and
engineers could unleash a wave of innovation in system design to cope with the
problems of scale and performance that come with ubiquitous dense deployment.
