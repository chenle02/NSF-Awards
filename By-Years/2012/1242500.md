Transformative concepts for optical data storage (ODS) applications are needed
for future needs in multimedia, digital archiving, security, and many others.
Commercial data storage technologies are moving to three-dimensional materials,
but the known concepts suffer from limitations and high fabrication costs.
Herein, a demonstrated storage medium, based on co-extruded multilayer films,
overcomes these problems and allows for terabyte-level (TB), bit-by-bit optical
data storage. Information in the form of complex patterns and individual bits
was recorded in up to 23 superimposed layers by photobleaching a fluorescent dye
via one-photon absorption. Results indicate this fabrication process is far
simpler than current approaches and enables a read/write system that is nearly
Blu-ray compatible, producing high-density multilayer storage media capacities
orders of magnitude higher than the state of the art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
explosion of digital data of all kinds in the internet, entertainment, health
care, and a plethora of other industries will require an ever increasing
capacity of archival storage, data distribution and security. For example, the
rapid growth of ?cloud? storage and access will require secure backup. Current
manufacturers of optical data storage media have continuously reported their
efforts to increase capacity and density to meet future market needs, such as
super HD video. In analyzing the reported approaches, the proposed process for
manufacturing multilayer polymer data storage substrates has the potential to be
transformative, enabling a truly scalable, low-cost approach. In addition to
potential applications in digital data storage, such films could be applicable
in a number of other technologies requiring written multilayer data for secure
storage.
