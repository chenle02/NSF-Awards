Over the past decade, computer systems have become prone to a variety of
hardware failures. Traditionally, hardware failures were circumvented by
operating the system at less than peak computing efficiency, effectively
compromising efficiency to achieve reliability. Such a conservative approach is
no longer a viable option because it leads to significant energy inefficiency.
Since datacenters containing thousands of computers are one of the largest and
fastest growing consumers of electricity, it is important to decouple the
relationship between hardware failures and energy efficiency.

The PIs' research will lay the groundwork for an intelligent computing system
that operates at peak efficiency, but manages its fault resiliency and
reliability using machine-learning based deep learning techniques. In effect,
the system learns to steer itself clear of danger whenever its deep neural nets
anticipate a failure. The research will address several important issues
involving the scalability, flexibility and efficiency of deep learning
techniques for various types of hardware failures. If successful, the research
product will minimize, if not eliminate, penalties to the system that stem from
the various circuit and micro-architectural techniques that are commonly used to
mitigate and overcome hardware failures.
