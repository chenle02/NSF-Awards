The goal of this research is to elucidate host-symbiont relationships in a
unique model ameba-bacteria symbiotic system. The research will focus on the
symbiosome membrane, which is the intracellular membrane defining the
intracellular compartment in which the endocytic bacteria reside. Questions to
be asked include: what is unique about the biochemical makeup of the symbiosome
membrane? How is the symbiosome membrane involved in the prevention of lysosomal
digestion of the symbiotic bacteria? How is the symbiosome membrane involved in
the mutual dependency for survival of the bacteria on the host and the host on
the bacteria? These questions will be addressed using modern biochemical and
molecular biological approaches, including monoclonal antibodies for detection
of unique antigens and immunocytochemical studies. This research has relevance
to a wide range of endosymbiotic systems, including but not limited to the
nitrogen-fixing bacteria contained within root cells of leguminous plants and
intracellular parasitic bacterial diseases.
