In this project the principal investigator will apply methods from computability
theory and other branches of logic and theoretical computer science to study the
effective content and proof-theoretic strength of various areas of mathematics.
In particular, he will concentrate on effective randomness, computable model
theory, and reverse mathematics and effectiveness of combinatorial principles,
with a particular emphasis on the connections between these areas. Among other
areas in the theory of randomness, he will study properties of ``far from
random'' sets and the connections between them and notions of mutual information
for infinite strings. He will also seek further applications of randomness to
various areas of computability theory. In computable model theory, he wl
continue to address issues raised by effectivizing model theoretic notions,
including the relationships between the degree of effectivity of different
models of theories with few models and the computability theoretic and proof
theoretic aspects of special models, such as prime, homogeneous, and saturated
models. He will also further investigate computability theoretic and proof
theoretic aspects of combinatorial principles as well as principles arising from
model theory. In this work he will exploit the connections between effective
mathematics and the reverse mathematics program, which aims to calibrate the
strength of theorems of ordinary mathematics in terms of the (set existence and
induction) axioms needed to prove them.

The study of the effective content of mathematics has received increasing
attention in the last few decades. It is a natural outgrowth of the efforts to
understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and computable function
undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century. It is of both pure
mathematical and foundational interest, and has important connections with
computer science. This project aims to further our understanding of how
structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other
fundamental notions of modern mathematics and foundations of mathematics, such
as randomness and proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have
developed a highly successful theory of relative computational complexity of
sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has
been influential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this
project is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of
relative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework in
which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an infinite set is
more random than another, and what consequences does the relative randomness of
sets have for their relative computational complexity?
