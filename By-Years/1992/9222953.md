The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate alternative theories of
alliance behavior, and to apply the theory of alliances and spillovers to the
study of global collective action, including treaty formulation and adherence.
In particular, the noncooperative behavior among nations confronted with common
pollution problems is analyzed. Various strategic behavioral alternatives and
their impact on resource allocation are examined. In addition, institutional
arrangements to elicit cooperation are examined, while accounting for
transaction costs of a fixed and variable nature. Alliance models will be
applied to analyze the determinants of participation in the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on CFC emission reductions. Further, the degree to which cooperative
behavior was practiced by the signatories' actions after the agreement will also
be studied. This research on cooperative behavior for mitigating pollution is
extremely important and timely given the heightened concern about attaining
better global cooperation for reducing atmospheric pollution and the possibility
for catastrophic global warming.
