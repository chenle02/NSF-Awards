Fixed-bed operations are central to many separation and purification processes;
a critical factor limiting efficiency in many cases is the excess pressure drop
which develops as particle size decreases and bed depth increases. One way of
preventing this is to fluidize the bed; fluidization has the drawback, however,
of increasing the mixing between volume elements in the bed, which reduces
chromatographic separation of mixture components. Stabilization of the bed with
a magnetic field can improve the separation. A critical area for investigation
of the potential advantages of using a magnetically stabilized fluidized bed is
that of large-scale reverse phase chromatography. Reverse phase chromatography
is an important purification process in many schemes for producing commercial
quantities of biological molecules produced from genetically altered
microorganisms or cell-cultures. This project will examine potential
improvements to the efficiency of reverse phase chromatography for
bioseparations from its implementation in a magnetically stabilized fluidized
bed. Lower pressure drops, better ability to handle entrained particulates, and
possible improvements in packing handling ability in an MSFB configuration make
this a potentially important process for downstream processing in the
biotechnology industry.
