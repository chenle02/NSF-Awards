9412348 Thomas The Microelectronics Research Center of the Georgia Institute of
Technology proposes to upgrade an existing ATOMIKA SIMS analytical system
through new electronic and computer packages. These upgrades will provide for
the first time three dimensional mapping of elemental distributions, render the
system user-friendly for student initiated projects, and provide facilities for
remote analysis of data on standard office computers. The enhanced system will
support several projects in Electrical and Materials Engineering as well as in
the multidisciplinary Microelectronics Research Center. In particular the
equipment will used for study of materials for high efficiency solar voltaic
cells, and High Definition TV imager chips. ***
