SCALE2 explores the design of resilient, inexpensive cyber-physical systems
(CPS) technologies to create community-wide smartspaces for public/personal
safety. SCALE2 aims to demonstrate that community safety can be realized by
augmenting CPS technologies with end-to-end resilience mechanisms. Such a study
requires real-world community-scale deployments to understand citizen concerns
and can only be achieved through partnerships between various stakeholders -
researchers, government agencies, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SCALE2
multisensory platform will use inexpensive Internet of things (IoT) components,
and support dependable operation by enabling resilient information-flow through
multiple system layers. Research will explore mechanisms for (a) ingest of real-
time data through flexible rich data models, (b) Quality of Service (QoS)-aware
messaging to cloud platforms, and (c) reliable detection of higher-level
community events through semantics-driven virtual sensing. SCALE2, through its
established partnerships/testbeds, offers a unique short-term opportunity to
guide future resilience technologies, train the next generation of students and
have broader community impact. SCALE2 will be deployed at Montgomery County, MD,
and the Irvine-Sensorium working with local agencies.
