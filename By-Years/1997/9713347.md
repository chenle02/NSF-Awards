9713347 Forbes, Lewis University of Kentucky CISE Special Project: ADMI 97 This
grant provided travel assistance primarily for students along with a small
number of faculty from minority-serving institutions to participate in the 1997
ADMI Symposium, "Increasing Diversity in Research and Education". This 1997
Symposium built on the major new themes initiated in the 1996 Symposium: 1)
enabling minority-serving faculty to present papers on strategies for increasing
the number of CISE-discipline students from underrepresented populations and to
share these topics with representatives from major research universities, and 2)
providing for significant participation by students, giving them valuable
experience in presenting research papers and providing for their involvement in
graduate study workshops. Participants were chosen by a selection committee
following submission of their papers. A Conference Proceedings is being
published containing all of the papers presented at the conference.
