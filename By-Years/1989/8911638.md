This grant is for a theoretical and observational study of magnetic pulsation
in the magnetosphere. A linear eigenmode analysis of ultra-low frequency (ULC)
MHD. Waves will be performed in a realistic dipole field geometry. Special
attention will be given to the nonlinear saturation mechanism (s) of these MHD
waves and how such waves effect particle diffusion. An important part of this
study involves using observed ring current ion distributions (from the A M P T E
C C E Satellite) as input for the lower linear analysis to be able to determine
the excitation mechanism (s) of ULF waves. This information along with a
knowledge of the nonlinear saturation mechanism of ULF waves may provide
important insight into the global dynamics of ring current plasmas.***//
