Jones, Edward G.&lt;br/&gt;0135396&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Human Brain Project
will extend our previous efforts in developing an information system that can
store, manipulate and retrieve large datasets compiled by the collaborating
investigators. The project is built around and designed to manage data obtained
from high resolution human and monkey brain atlases, molecular and cellular
mapping studies, morphometry and physiology of retinal and thalamic cells, and
studies of brain connections. There is an Administrative Core responsible for
oversight, evaluation and dissemination and 4 Research Projects that will
collect data and interact in visualization and databasing. Project 1 will design
and integrate informational methods that integrate graphical and non-graphical
datasets derived from Projects 2-4 and, using the lateral geniculate nucleus as
a model, will develop software tools for building and maintaining neuroscience
specific databases, for linking the diverse information sets derived from
Projects 2--4 to one another, and for network retrieval and interchange of
information from these and other neuroscience datasets. Project 2 will use
computer assisted microscopy to build high resolution digital atlases of human
and monkey brains, extending cytoarchitecture to quantify neuronal populations
in the major nuclei of the thalamus (including in normal, schizophrenic and
manic depressive human brains), and their profile of receptors and chemically
defined cells and afferent fiber systems. This project incorporates a strong
Visualization Component made up of computer scientists who have expertise in
storage, manipulation and display of large datasets. It will populate a central
NeuroImage Repository and, working in close conjunction with the other projects,
will develop software tools for manipulating, graphically displaying and
browsing the high resolution histological and neurochemical brain atlases,
starting with the lateral geniculate database, and for distributing simplified
images using Internet methodologies. Project 3 will expand a database of retinal
cells characterized by morphology, chemistry, physiology and connectivity that
provides the model for, and input to the lateral geniculate database. Project 4
will develop a database of monkey visual thalamo- and cortico-cortical
connections for integration with the lateral geniculate database, using a newly
developed pulvinar database as a model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
