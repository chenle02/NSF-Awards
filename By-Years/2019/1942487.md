Every year, infectious viruses cause millions of deaths worldwide. Current
technologies for testing virus infections often require multiple labor-intensive
steps and need costly and bulky equipment, hence are not suitable for rapid
disease testing at point-of-care (POC) settings. The goal of this CAREER project
is to develop a sample-in-answer-out technology for rapid detection of multiple
viruses simultaneously with minimal sample preparation at POC settings. It aims
to produce a low-cost, disposable device that integrates fully automated assay
with smartphone-based readout for reporting and surveillance of current and
emerging infectious diseases. This project integrates multidisciplinary research
with educational activities to engage high school teachers and students at
different levels (K-12, undergraduate and graduate students). It helps to
prepare a skilled workforce and broaden participation in STEM
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through combined scientific research and device
engineering, the Asghar group at Florida Atlantic University aims to develop a
low-cost, functional device that can be widely deployed for POC diagnosis of
viral infections. The research team explores the use of water-oil interphase
separation in a microfluidic device integrated with magnetic actuation platform
and smartphone-based readout to allow automation and improve throughout. The
approaches to enabling analysis of complex samples (including blood, saliva and
urine) with minimal sample preparation and resources include employing reverse
transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and using
synthetic "self-avoiding" nucleotide analogs to address the current limitations
of primer dimerization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
