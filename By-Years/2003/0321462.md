Wheat is the single most important source of plant protein in the human diet and
together with other cereal grains (rice, corn, sorghum, barley, millet, and
oats) accounts for most of the food directly consumed by humans.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge for the post-sequencing era is to identify
the biological functions of sequenced genes. Reverse genetics - the discovery of
gene function by searching for lesions in specific genes - plays an essential
role in that process. The large, complex genomes of important crop species like
wheat necessitate the development of a large number of mutants, and genetic
screening methods developed to date do not support the high throughput necessary
for making this search efficient. We intend to optimize and demonstrate a model
screening system applicable to any large genome
species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research resources&lt;br/&gt;We will produce a
collection of lines carrying small deletions in the genome in the cultivated
diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum. Screening of this mutant collection for
lesions in genes of interest can be accomplished efficiently through a pooling
scheme combined with a method termed DEALING (DEtecting Adduct Lesions IN
Genomes). We will demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying
mutations that affect reproductive development in wheat. We will also develop a
database, WIRE (the Wheat Information Resource), to disseminate the information
generated by this and future DEALING experiments. &lt;br/&gt;
