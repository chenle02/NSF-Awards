The proposed research will attempt to demonstrate that information from modern
mammalian communities and those preserved in the recent fossil record is
pertinent to understanding mammalian community organization past and present. A
model of community organization in relation to one of its important causes --
climatic conditions -- based on both modern and late Quaternary communities
should be more powerful than a model based on modern communities and climates
alone. The inclusion of late Quaternary mammalian faunas and climates broadens
the information base and also adds communities and environments more similar to
those of the Tertiary than any extant ones are. Previous studies of size
distributions in mammalian communities as well as a pilot study presented here
suggest that regularities are present in community structure under similar
environmental conditions despite differences in location and taxonomic
composition, but these regularities remain to be quantified. Quantification of
the relationship between environmental parameters and the distribution of
species' sizes and feeding habits will serve to clarify and measure the strength
of this relationship. If this relationship is strong, then it can serve as the
basis for a quantitative method for estimating paleoenvironmental conditions in
older mammalian communities. In addition, this study will provide hypotheses of
the adaptive significance of size-change during the Cenozoic record of changing
mammalian faunas and environments.. These specific goal can also be generalized
to allow analyses of environmental changes through time .
