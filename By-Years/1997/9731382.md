This project investigates cycles of inter-ethnic conflict. The argument is that
anti-government protests by minorities generate a cycle of contention involving
collective action processes -- counter-mobilization, bandwagons, external
patronage, and intra-community competition -- that affect the likelihood of
inter-ethnic conflict and cooperation. The PIs apply this theory of inter-ethnic
relations to the case of Blacks and Jews in the United States. While
conventional wisdom indicates that Black-Jewish relations have deteriorated in
recent years, systematic description and explanation is virtually absent. This
work examines Black-Jewish interactions in New York City from 1900-1997. It
codes data from a variety of news sources and uses ARIMA intervention estimation
and hazard models to test the model. The research contributes to our
understanding of two established fields -- social movements and Black protest.
