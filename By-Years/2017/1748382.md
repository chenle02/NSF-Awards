The proposed project will bring together researchers in a workshop to be held in
November 13-15, 2017 at the Days Inn Penn State in State College, PA. The
Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic
layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-
chalcogenides, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides and complex oxides, as well
as their applications in various devices. The Workshop will bring the NSF EFRI
Two- Dimensional Atomic-Layer Research and Engineering (2-DARE) supported
researchers together with those supported by the Designing Materials to
Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) and Materials Innovation Platform
(MIP) programs. By bringing together researchers to discuss cutting-edge
research in the above areas the Workshop will catalyze important collaborations.
It will also impact training of a globally engaged workforce which will help
promoting science and engineering breakthroughs. Graduate students, postdoctoral
scholars and junior faculty will comprise a significant portion of the attendees
and will benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research in 2D materials and
devices and the application of theory/simulation/data analytics to materials
discovery.
