Tectonic uplift on a regional scale can occur whenever the lithosphere is
thinned through some combination of normal faulting and ductile stretching. Such
processes appear to have played a major role in the development of the
Cordilleran metamorphic core complexes of the western states. This project will
continue investigation of thermal uplift experienced by two metamorphic
terrains, the Pioneer Mountains of Central Idaho and the Albion-Raft River-
Grouse Creek region of southern Idaho and northern Utah. The approach will
involve theoretical modeling to predict pressure-temperature-time paths for
metamorphic rocks which are brought to the Earth's surface through tectonic
denudation, and field studies focused on reconstructing actual pressure-
temperature-time paths using quantitative metamorphic petrology and Ar-Ar
thermochronometry. Results are expected to considerably refine understanding of
thermally-driven tectonic uplift related to continental extension.
