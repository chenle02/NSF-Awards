This research will use the Green Bank 4.85 GHZ northern sky survey to find
radio identification candidates for extragalactic sources in the Infrared
Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) Faint Source Catalog. The candidate identifications
will be checked using VLA maps and optical positions. It is expected that this
work will yield approximately 200 confirmed radio identifications having active
galactic nuclei as their source, and another 200 sources powered by stars in
normal spirals and starburst galaxies. The Principal Investigator is a widely
recognized expert in identification of radio sources.
