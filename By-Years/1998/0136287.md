The Householder Symposium gathers the world's most active researchers in
numerical linear algebra once every three years to review advances in the field,
present recent theoretical and practical results, assess where the field is
headed in the near future, and to provide an intimate atmosphere to foster close
personal interaction and exchange of ideas.

This project supports the travel of junior U.S. researchers to the 15th
Householder Symposium on Numerical Linear Algebra to be held June 17 - 21, 2002
in Peebles, Scotland. The funds are for travel expenses for U.S. graduate
students and recent Ph.D.s who would otherwise be unable to attend. The NSF
funds will permit full participation by the most promising junior members of the
U.S. numerical linear algebra community. As the Householder Symposium is
traditionally a gateway conference into the field, participation of junior
scientists is essential. U.S. participation in the Symposium will have a
positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the U.S. in the
crucial discipline of numerical linear algebra, a field of central importance in
scientific computing.
