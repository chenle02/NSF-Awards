*** 9760459 Geng This Small Business Innovation Research (Sbir) Phase I project
will explore a new means for rapid generation of three dimensional (3D) data for
parts to be prototyped. Although many rapid prototyped (RP) parts can be
produced from CAD drawings, the capability of directly digitizing 3D physical
objects is needed in certain RP applications, in which parts must be fabricated
to fit irregular shapes of 3D objects, e.g., certain parts of human body or
teeth. Conventional methods of measuring complex 3D shapes are usually time-
consuming, complicated, highly interactive, and require expert knowledge. Thus,
the time of a RP iteration cycle is driven by the digitizing of a 3D model and
generating an adequate 3D data file. Phase 1 SBIR will study a high speed 3D
camera (that can acquire a full frame 3D image of an object at a rate of 30
frames per second) and an ultra-precision RP machine. The high-speed 3D imaging
technique will be combined with an ultra-precision droplet deposition ink jet RP
technique for realistic dental office environments. 3D dental images will be
acquired, and dental parts will be produced in real-time with sub-millimeter to
micro-sized features. Applications of this integrated RP concept include rapid
dental treatment in the digital dental office. By this technology a new
generation of RP dental instruments is expected that can rapidly fabricate
dental implants, caps, crowns,and bridges in a dentist's office. ***
