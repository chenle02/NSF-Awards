The computer acquired through this project was a Silicon Graphics 4D/25G
graphics workstation with 12 MB of memory and two 380 MB hard disk drives. The
graphics and calculational capabilities of the computer are being used to
support two biochemistry courses, a course in computational chemistry, and the
senior thesis program. The workstation filled a gap that existed between what
the chemistry undergraduates were taught and modern chemical research. The rapid
growth of information regarding molecular structure in biochemistry has given
rise to the need for a more effective method of representing large molecules in
three dimensions than was available at the institution. The graphics workstation
provided such a method. Using available software packages, students are
introduced to the intricacies of macromolecular structure throughout the one
year biochemistry course. An additional need arose from the lack of instruction
that undergraduates received in computational chemistry. The acquisition of the
workstation permitted the development of a course designed to teach the theory
and practice of molecular calculations. To teach such a course effectively, the
Chemistry Department required a more powerful computer than was available. The
Silicon Graphics workstation provided not only the necessary processing power,
but also the advantage of graphics capabilities to assist in the presentation
and interpretation of results from sample calculations. The senior thesis
program also made extensive use of the graphics workstation. Student projects
that were affected included site- directed mutagenesis studies, enzyme inhibitor
design and mathematical modelling of the relationship between structure and
mutagenicity. The institution contributed in an amount slightly in excessof the
NSF funds.
