This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
fabrication of high-power circulators. Ferrite junction circulators that operate
under high power conditions are currently narrow band devices, since they are
necessarily biased above ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). In order to increase the
frequency bandwidth and still operate at high power Massachusetts Technological
Laboratory proposes to fabricate circulators in a six-port geometry. In a six-
port design the ports are alternatively connected to open circuits which serve
as stub-tune capacitors. In preliminary calculations, it has been shown in six-
port design that it is possible to achieve a bandwidth of 15 % of the central
circulation frequency. This is compared to a conventional junction circulator
biased above FMR where the bandwidth is approximately 5% of the central
frequency. High-power wide-band circulators capable of handling a few hundred
kilowatts are currently needed in the design of R/T modules deployed in front of
power transmitters. Researchers believe that the proposed work will have
potential for both military and commercial applications.
