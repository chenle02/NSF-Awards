The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve
the information available to workforce planners in a way that reduces the time
and money they spend in assessing and anticipating regional workforce needs.
With the help of more accurate analytics, workforce planners will be able to
shift more of their resources towards designing and developing training
initiatives that fill the most likely skills-gaps for workers in the near- to
mid-term, thus keeping their regions globally competitive in rapidly-evolving
labor markets. The commercial potential of this project derives from advances in
computational techniques to identify industry-specific skills gaps empirically;
to map the related structure of regional production; and to uncover new skills-
induced career pathways in regional economies using those maps. Bringing these
technical advances to workforce analysts and policy makers will provide both
with the best available tools to respond adaptively to the innovative needs of
their economies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project uses advanced
analytics and Big Data collection methods to assess the technical and spatial
distribution of work in cities with the goal of providing insights along three
dimensions: patterns of technology diffusion and their workforce implications;
human capital-based evolutionary competitive advantages of regional economies;
and the structure of regional "economic ecosystems" as a source of
entrepreneurship and innovation. The algorithms search the parameter space of
regional economic activities, capabilities, and technologies to describe the
actual structure of work within a given region. In effect, this innovation
enables the automation of key aspects of workforce planning strategy that are
typically time-consuming and expensive because they typically rely on surveys.
The approach developed here will enhance the speed and accuracy of labor market
analysis.
