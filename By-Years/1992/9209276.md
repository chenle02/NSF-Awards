Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
investigations which involve extensive collaboration between theoretical and
experimental physicists. There will be a general analysis aimed at testing the
consistency of our theory of the strong nuclear force and at accurately
determining the structure of a nucleon in terms of quarks, and detailed analyses
of a variety of individual elementary particle physics processes. These
investigations are very important to the interpretation of present experiments
and the planning of future ones.
