Learning Mathematics with Computers The intent of this project is to find ways
of presenting mathematics to college students, both mathematics majors and non-
majors, in such a way as to enhance their motivation for studying mathematics
and to help develop their mathematical intuition. The regular use by students of
computers, both in the classroom and in homework assignments, allows wide use of
discovery learning, with its emphasis upon making conjectures and testing their
validity. Access to computers allows the courses to be taught in ways which
emphasize the graphical and numerical aspects of mathematics, as well as the
analytical. This project will impact every student who graduates from Franklin
College, since all courses which can be utilized to meet the graduation
requirement are affected. A recently awarded grant from Lilly Endowment, Inc.,
aids in this process by providing released time for the investigators for the
development of course materials. The project uses a 15 workstation
classroom/laboratory equipped with Z-486 computers, an EtherWORKS network served
by a DEC PCLAN/Server 3100, and four Cannon BJ-300 printers served by a
DECserver 90L.
