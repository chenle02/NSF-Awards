Different soil treatment methods may be used for new construction to minimize
damage due to strong earthquakes. Little formal research exists to assist in the
analysis of the proper soil improvement technique to use, though many advances
have occurred through innovative construction techniques developed by specialty
contractors. This project involves a collaboration between Professor Maher of
Rutgers University and Mr. Joseph Welsh of Hayward Baker Inc., an
internationally-recognized specialty contractor in soil improvement and
foundation remediation. The objective of this collaboration is to study the
behavior of treated soils subjected to high strain cyclic loads such as those
experienced during earthquakes. Dynamic properties, that is, shear moduli and
damping characteristics, of both admixture and grout-treated soils are being
investigated to assess: a) the potential of soil treatment as a viable option in
the mitigation of earthquake hazards, and b) the response of existing treated
soil-structure systems to earthquake loads.
