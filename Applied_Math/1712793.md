Nonlinear wave motion is manifested in many natural phenomena and technological
processes. Nonlinearity effects are most prominent for the high-power signals
and large-magnitude waves: when one wave is superimposed on the other the waves
are not just adding as would be true in the linear case but interact with each
other. Such waves form complex wave patterns and have very important
applications, including among others propagation of electromagnetic waves for
fiber optics and lasers, shock waves in aerodynamics, and rogue waves in the
ocean. Mathematical analysis of these phenomena is hampered by the nonlinearity
of the governing equations. For nonlinear equations formulating a general theory
is often unfeasible, and obtaining solutions requires a case-by-case study. This
research effort focuses on solving a number of open problems that will
substantially extend the ability of mathematicians to develop deeper
understanding and explain the behavior of large-amplitude wave phenomena which
arise widely in applications. 

The Inverse Scattering Transform (IST) method is one of the few analytical
techniques that allows one to analyze and obtain solutions to a number of
important equations in mathematical physics. IST will be used to obtain
solutions and understand properties of new classes of nonlinear wave equations
which exhibit PT (parity-time) symmetry properties.  IST can also be used to
describe certain classes of localized solutions, termed lump solutions, which
decay in all directions. The key properties of these solutions will be
understood and they will be connected to the non-stationary Schrödinger
equation. The research effort will also be directed to investigating a class of
shock wave phenomena termed dispersive shock waves (DSWs). DSWs are shock waves
which are regularized by dispersion, in contrast with standard shock waves which
are regularized by dissipation. DSWs arise in many applications including water
waves, Bose- Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, etc. The theory of DSWs
will be extended in order to obtain improved approximations to the underlying
equations in one dimension, and a detailed multidimensional analysis will be
developed.
