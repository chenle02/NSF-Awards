This project will study how tax incentives affect the structure of household
portfolios. One strand of research will explore the determinants of asset
allocation patterns in tax-deferred and taxable accounts. The recent growth of
employee participation in 401(k) plans, and the coincident expansion in the
number of households with Individual Retirement Accounts, has raised new
portfolio choices for many households. This research will investigate the extent
to which households consider tax factors in structuring their portfolios by
comparing asset allocation decisions in taxable and tax-deferred settings. It
will also develop new information on the potential distribution of balances in
tax-deferred accounts when current savers reach retirement. The research will
bear on the ongoing discussion concerning the adequacy of household retirement
saving and thus will have broader impacts on both the financial and the public
policy sectors.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A second strand of research will explore
the recent growth of variable annuity products. It will evaluate how tax
incentives affect the demand for these financial products, and test the
hypothesis that the households with the largest incentives to hold variable
annuities purchase these products. This research will also consider the
potential role of these products in helping retirees to draw down the balances
that they accumulate in 401(k) plans and other retirement saving vehicles.
