This research project involves acquiring a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
instrument to support research and education in science and engineering areas at
the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. This SEM instrument is being used
by many researchers in various departments, including bioengineering, civil
engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemistry. This instrument advances
various research projects that involve surface analyses of diverse materials,
including natural products, inorganic complexes, coordination polymers,
nanomaterials, and other materials. The instrument also greatly impacts the
education of undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds, since the
institution serves a large number of underrepresented minority students. The SEM
instrument also allows students the opportunity to use modern equipment and gain
research skills that would be valuable for future careers in STEM fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquired SEM instrument increases the research
capabilities of the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. This instrument
benefits a number of research projects that involve characterizing surface
degradation in biodegradable polymers, coated fibers, electrospun composites and
fracture surfaces of various metals, solids and molecules for carbon dioxide
capture and activation. The instrument also is being used to structurally
characterize biologically relevant materials, including bone fractures,
nanomaterials, and particles for delivery of pharmaceutical related compounds.
The acquisition of this SEM instrument contributes significantly to ongoing
research projects and enables the institution to compete for future grant
opportunities. Additionally, the instrument also provides valuable training
opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students. This award is funded
by the Office of Assistant Director of Engineering.
