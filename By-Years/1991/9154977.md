The University of Utah will initiate a five-week, commuter Young Scholars
project in Computer Science which will provide science enrichment activities for
40 precollege students entering grades 11,12. This summer program will emphasize
research participation in computer graphics and intelligent systems. Students
will learn about two- and three-dimensional representation techniques and will
design models of their choice. They will then study different ways of rendering
surfaces for their models and explore problems of current research interest. In
the artificial intelligence and expert systems component of the program,
students will study LISP and rule-based programming. They will then develop an
expert system to control an autonomous "rover" which is a part of a simulated
space probe. They will visit robotics and computer- aided-manufacturing research
laboratories.
