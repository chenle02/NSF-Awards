The goal of this project is to incorporate state-of-the-art observing into all
levels of the astronomy curriculum, from introductory courses to advanced senior
research projects. A strong foundation is already in place--an extensive
curriculum, a modern planetarium, dedicated teachers, and a relatively large
(0.5-meter), new telescope--and this project builds on it. observing
opportunities for students are being greatly expanded through the use of a CCD
camera for the 0.5m telescope. In introductory classes the project enables the
capture of student interest with images and observing projects possible only
with the sensitivity and immediate output of the CCD. The best projects and labs
are those that invite students to make their own observations, and a CCD camera
makes that possible. Basic projects are made available to all students, and a
new introductory lab section provides more extensive hands-on experience for the
best students.For more advanced students a new lab course on modern CCD
detectors and observing techniques is being created. Hands-on experience is a
necessary and vital part of this course. For the most advanced and serious
students among our physics majors and astronomy minors, independent study offers
more extended access to the telescope, and the opportunity to gain additional
observing experience and to pursue serious research.
