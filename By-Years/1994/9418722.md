Peter Tolias IBN#9418722 Single stranded (ss) DNA and RNA-binding proteins
encompass a subset of molecules that play significant roles in Drosophila
development. The developmentally regulated shuttle craft (stc) gene encodes such
a protein. The main objective of this proposal is to determine the functional
role of STC protein in egg chambers and embryos using a combination of cell
biological, molecular and genetic approaches. The PI in the course of this award
will: 1) clone and sequence the two existing EMS-induced stc alleles and the
Drosophila virilis stc gene to identify essential and conserved structural
motifs, 2) use the new FLP-FRT recombination system to generate marked mutant
clones that have lost function, and 3). determine whether stc protein is
differentially processed. The human homologue to stc has recently been reported.
It is NF-X1, a gamma interferon-inducible human transaription factor. The
identification of this homolog will help the PI to distinguish important
structural motifs in the shuttle craft protein and identify its targets. The PI
has also identified that one of his stc mutants has CNS defects in late
embryonic development that appear to be defects in axonal guidance; this
phenotype will aid his experimental design.
