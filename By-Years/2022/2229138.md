Understanding the solar wind is crucial to space weather science and forecasting
because the properties of the solar wind plasma affect the local conditions in
the space environment around Earth. These conditions are largely the result of
the speed, structure, and magnetic fields carried by the solar wind plasma. This
project addresses the Solar, Heliospheric, and Interplanetary Environment
(SHINE) goal of understanding the solar wind, through research that utilizes
modern Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and big data analysis
algorithms to analyze space-based and NSF-funded ground based coronagraph
observations. The project is led by an early career female scientist and is
cross-disciplinary, building a collaboration between solar physicists and data
scientists. Graduate and undergraduate student researchers from under-
represented groups in STEM will be supported.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is a four-year research program that applies state-of-the-art AI/ML technology
to in-situ solar wind measurements from past, current, and future missions. The
goal is to classify solar wind types and to determine their coronal source
regions, to understand the physical connection between the solar windâ€™s in-situ
properties and their coronal origins. The team will use available observations
from NASA space-based missions including the Advanced Composition Explorer,
Wind, Parker Solar Probe, Ulysses and when available, Solar Orbiter (SO) 1.
Spectroscopic data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory and SO
will provide magnetic field geometry and basic plasma diagnostics of the solar
wind source regions. Furthermore, NSF-funded ground based coronagraphs such as
CoMP (2011-2018), MK4 (1998-2013), KCor (2013-today) and, when available, UCoMP2
will be used to provide additional solar context data and plasma
diagnostics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
