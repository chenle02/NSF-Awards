This project extends upon previous work by this group on the atmospheric
chemistry or organic aerosols by examining the stability and atmospheric
lifetimes of a series of organic compounds found in aerosols and as such
commonly used as tracers. The investigators will design, construct and employ a
laboratory system for testing aqueous phase reactivity of organic tracer
compounds and test a variety of candidate compounds in terms of reaction
mechanisms and products in order to evaluate their relative utility as conserved
tracers of regional and synoptic scale atmospheric transport through a series of
laboratory experiments on natural atmospheric aerosols (such as cloud, fog, and
haze) and synthetic yet representative mixtures of ambient aerosol and reagent
organic compounds. Results will have important broader impacts for the
interpretation of ambient receptor site data, as well as understanding the
contribution of long-range transport of these compounds on radiative transfer
and climate change. The project includes elements integrating study research and
education through existing laboratory classes at the host institution,
contributing to professional training of young scientists through graduate
student support, and web-based community outreach.
