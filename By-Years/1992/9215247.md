The process of surface diffusion is the focus of this research project supported
by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. In this work Professor George,
who has pioneered the application of laser induced thermal desorption methods
for the study of surface diffusion, will extend his studies to anisotropic and
coverage dependent diffusion using a newly developed linear diffraction
technique. This laser induced transient grating method promises to provide wider
applicability, and the possibility of monitoring diffusion over a much wider
coverage range than previously possible. These methods will be applied to the
study of small molecule diffusion on bimetallic surfaces, long chain hydrocarbon
diffusion on ruthenium, and to the study of molecular diffusion on ice surfaces.
%%% An understanding of the mechanism and rates of surface diffusion of
molecules is essential to the understanding of the dynamics of reactions on
surfaces. Newly developed transient grating methods will be applied to the study
of a range of molecular adsorbates on well characterized surfaces, providing
much needed information for the understanding of catalytically relevant surface
reactions.
