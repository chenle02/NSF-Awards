The traveling salesman problem is a famous, well-studied problem within computer
science and optimization. Given n cities, and a set of distances between each
pair of cities, the goal is to find the shortest tour that visits each city once
and returns to its starting point. There is an outstanding question of whether
there is any efficient algorithm that given any set of n cities and the
distances can find the shortest tour, or whether any such algorithm will always
need time exponential in n to find the shortest tour. In the absence of the
resolution of this question, researchers in computer science have instead looked
for efficient algorithms that always find provably near-optimal solutions to the
problem. The best such algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, known for
almost 40 years now, is one that finds a tour that is always no more than 50%
longer than the shortest possible tour.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to find efficient algorithms that always find tours significantly
closer to the optimal than 50% longer. Recently some candidate algorithms have
been proposed which might be provably better than the 40-year-old algorithm;
they give provably better bounds in special cases of the traveling salesman
problem, and the PI has shown through computational experiments that in practice
they perform better. The goal of this project is to attempt to prove that these
candidate algorithms do in fact perform better (or to show that they do not).
The project will use computational experiments in significant ways to help
direct the mathematical proofs of the behavior of these algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Because the traveling salesman problem is well-known to
undergraduates and even high school students interested in computer science, the
PI hopes to involve undergraduates in parts of the research and expose high
school students to the work in order to interest them in further study in
computer science.
