Beckman 9500314 This is an equipment grant to enable the Department of Chemical
and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh to purchase a Mattson
model RS-10000 Research Series FTIR Spetrometer which will be dedicated to
support basic research and education in engineering science. The FTIR will be
used for several research projects, including: 1. "Carbon Dioxide as Both
Monomer and Solvent in Polymerizations", 2. "Enzyme Structure in Organic
Solvents Using FTIR", 3. "Readsorption and Diffusion Effects on Steady-State
Isotopic Transient Kinetics", 4. "Time-Dependent Behavior of Thermosetting
Materials: Chemical Degradation, Physical Aging, and Moisture Absorption", 5.
"Selective Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides with Methane Catalyzed by Metal-
Containing Zeolites".
