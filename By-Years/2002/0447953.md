Image segmentation, shape detection and object recognition are three tightly
coupled and intertwined visual processes. Only by integrating them together into
a coherent, unified system can there be hope for achieving the long-standing
goal of large-scale visual recognition. This proposal puts forward a learning-
based unified graph formulation providing a principled and workable framework
for attacking this extremely difficult problem.

The proposed research efforts are directed along three fronts: 1) complete
inference of object information by constructing multi-layer graph for shape
detection, object recognition and segmentation; 2) unbiased integration of
bottom-up low level cues with top-down knowledge of object shape; and 3) direct
learning of the object recognition graph with supervised spectral graph cuts
learning technique. The proposed 100- and 1000- Object Recognition Challenge
will provide a highly objective and rigorous evaluation its success.

This research draws upon ideas from a diverse set of disciplines: computer
vision, machine learning, numerical analysis, and theory of computation. PI will
continue to promote inter-disciplinary researches through graduate courses,
conference tutorials and workshops, internships and research experience for
undergraduates, as well as web page resources offering tutorial and open source
code.
