The project deals with a novel approach to conceptual design with the potential
for decreasing the design and manufacturing costs at the same time increasing
design productivity. Traditionally, products are designed for functionality
without much regard for the manufacturability. By providing manufacturability
information up front, it may be possible to develop better designs which would
result in decreasing manufacturing costs. Comparative initial designs will be
developed using functionality and functionability/manufacturability
respectively, as inputs to access the relative cost and effectiveness of these
methods to produce products. The problem under consideration will be restricted
to the design of injection molded structural parts. The approach if successful,
would provide the road to concurrent product and process design.
