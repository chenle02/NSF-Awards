This award supports the travel of US participants, in particular students and
early career researchers, to the conference "Ordered Algebraic Structures and
Related Topics" held at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques
(CIRM) in Luminy, France on October 12-16, 2015. The conference covers a broad
range of topics in ordered algebraic structures, a dynamic area of mathematics
in which there have been a number of important recent developments. The activity
will contribute to the training of graduate students and junior researchers and
promote the exchange of ideas among the world's leading experts in ordered
algebraic structures. Eight internationally recognized experts have been chosen
to give survey talks to promote interaction, facilitate participation and
introduce junior researchers to the subject. It is of substantial intellectual
advantage for US-based researchers to have the opportunity to participate in
this workshop and to bring back to their campuses and communities the benefits
of these interactions.

The conference will bring together major researchers in five general areas of
interest: Ordered Groups, Real Algebra and Valuations, Model Theory of Ordered
Structures and Algorithms in Semi-algebraic Geometry, Quadratic Forms and
Abstract Spaces of Orderings, Real Algebraic and Analytic Geometry and
O-minimality, Positive Polynomials and Optimization. In addition to the survey
talks there will be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and
discuss their work in both formal and informal settings. Additional information
