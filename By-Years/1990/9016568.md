The aim of this research is to develop the scientific basis and computational
tools for predictive simulations of machining processes. To this end, an
integrated experimental and computational program is formulated which focusses
on understanding and quantifying: (i) friction between the cutting tool and the
workpiece; (ii) accurate constitutive models for the behavior of the workpiece
under the temperature and loading conditions that occur during machining, and
(iii) material failure leading to the creation of new free surfaces, including
the role of shear band localizations in the failure process.
