This project will investigate interrelationships between feeding and swimming
behavior in the evolution of sharks. The first study tests whether ecological
habitat influences swimming behavior in sharks. High-speed video and
electromyography will be used to analyze fin, body, and tail movements during
swimming in the spiny dogfish shark, a shark that is an open ocean swimmer, and
the bamboo shark, a bottom-dwelling shark. The study addresses the question of
whether open ocean sharks swim differently than other sharks. Another question
that will be addressed is whether bottom-dwelling and open ocean sharks can
control their fin movements to change the forces generated during swimming. The
second study investigates the feeding mechanism of sharks eating hard prey.
Feeding on hard prey is rare in sharks. High-speed video and electromyography
will be used to analyzing head and jaw movements and muscle activity during
feeding. The PI will analyze bamboo sharks eating hard prey, bamboo sharks
eating soft prey, and bonnethead sharks eating hard prey. The results will be
used to test previous predictions for jaw force and lever systems in sharks.
This research will increase our understanding of feeding and swimming behavior
in sharks.
