The objective of this research is to develop a miniaturized detection system for
real-time monitoring of vehicle emissions. The approach is to develop a novel
hybrid sensor that maximizes the advantages of different sensing principles, and
to integrate multi-scale technologies into a complete system, including an
intelligent sampling scheme, hybrid sensing elements, integrated signal
processing, and wireless data transmission. Each component uses innovative
techniques to achieve its corresponding function, and all the components work
together synergistically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of the many recent
exciting enabling technologies, such as the demonstration of single molecule
detection capability, detecting and analyzing trace chemicals in a complex
environment containing thousands of interference chemicals and substances
remains a challenge. Inspired by the olfactory system found in nature , this
proposal aims to establish a new hybrid and integrative approach spanning
multiple length scales and crossing multiple disciplines in order to develop the
detection system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid and integrative approach will
enable the construction of a detection system with a broad potential impact on
maintaining a healthy population, a clean environment, a safe food industry, and
a secure society. the project will provide students with the research
opportunities in finding engineering solutions to urgent environmental problems,
and will also provide the principal investigators with a unique opportunity to
develop an interdisciplinary course on Integrated Sensors. As part of the
outreach plan, industrial partnerships will be established with local companies
to bring industrial device design and fabrication expertise to the project, and
to provide the students with summer internships.
