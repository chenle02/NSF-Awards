This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few undergraduate institutions are able
to provide their faculty and students with research grade telescopes and
instrumentation. The University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH) is, however, an
exception. They have recently acquired a new one-meter class telescope which is
located on the top of Mauna Kea, one of the world's premier sites for
observational astronomy. Dr. David James of UHH is heading up the installation
of two new instruments for the telescope: a new digital optical camera and a
spectrograph which will be used to analyze the light from stars. The new
equipment will allow faculty astronomers to conduct important scientific
research. It will also be used extensively to provide training and scientific
research experiences for UHH undergraduate students. The instrumentation is
being made possible through the NSF's Major Research Instrumentation program.
