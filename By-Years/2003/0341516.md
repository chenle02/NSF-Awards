Project Kaleidoscope enhances the capacity of science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) faculty responsible for the strength of undergraduate
learning environments and of the infrastructures supporting their work. Building
on and reaching beyond the Project Kaleidoscope informal alliance of 8000
persons, the project directly impacts faculty at 300 core institutions,
representing the diversity of higher education that they will prepare as leaders
of multi-disciplinary teams. Broad impact results from formally connecting
present and emerging generations of leaders within undergraduate STEM education
and preparing for the leadership transition that is inevitable- connections that
are essential if current initiatives for strengthening undergraduate STEM are to
be sustained. This national effort develops multi-disciplinary teams of STEM
leaders in order to increase involvement in research-based understanding and
thereby tackle interdisciplinary challenges, and those that relate to scientific
and technological advances and the increasing diversity of students. Fifteen
workshops, follow-up support, and leadership institutes followed by preparation
and dissemination of project materials comprise the heart of the project.
Evaluation consists of longitudinal studies administered to workshop teams and
senior administrators.
