Supply Chain Automation is a new and fast-growing industry in the global market.
Neither industry nor post-secondary education institutions have been primed for
addressing the needs of this emerging sector, and both have struggled to
adequately prepare existing and incoming workforce for the rapidly evolving
technologies which drive the industry. The National Center for Supply Chain
Automation is the formal medium for engaging both parties in a national dialog
to ensure educators are preparing students for the rapid growth in this high
technology job sector. The Center has the capacity to provide education and
career pathways to thousands of Americans leading to living wage jobs. Within a
six month training period, students enrolled in SCA Technician programs can earn
national industry approved certifications leading to advanced certification and
degree options for further career advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norco
College, with lead colleges and partners, will target services to the top 19
states with the greatest concentration of supply chain activity and employment.
The National Center will (1) implement model 2+2 SCA career pathways through
high school and community college partnerships to increase the number of skilled
SCA Technicians entering the workforce; (2) convene supply chain automation
stakeholders via a National Symposium to deliver professional development and
establish a community of practice by engaging ATE Centers and projects focused
on related disciplines; (3) increase the number of underrepresented participants
entering the field; (4) disseminate information and product deliverables for
secondary and post-secondary educators through conference presentations and
participation in panel discussions, producing and publishing newsletters,
videos, white papers, labor market studies and integrating social media channels
with digital content; and, (5) establish and promote a stackable national
industry certification for Supply Chain Automation Technician, validated and
recognized by industry.
