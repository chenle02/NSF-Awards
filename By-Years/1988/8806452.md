This project deals with a novel method of fabricating ceramic oxide-metal
(silver) superconducting composite using explosive shock wave propagation
technique. The advantage of this technique is that it does not involve
significant heating (<100oC). Mixtures of silver powder and yttrium-barium-
copper-oxygen powder of different fractions will be consolidated and
encapsulated in silver into bars. These will be drawn/rolled to wires and
subsequently heat treated. The processed components and precursors will be
examined for Meissner effect (diamagnetic response) and transition temperature.
Magnetization studies and superconducting current transport studies will be made
in collaboration with the Los Alamos National Laboratories.
