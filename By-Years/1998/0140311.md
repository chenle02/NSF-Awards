The scaling limit of open strings propagating in a neutral electromagnetic
background is known to&lt;br/&gt; give rise to non-commutative gauge theories
(introduced by mathematicians in the context of non-commutative geometry), but
many interesting questions remain. This research programs
investigates&lt;br/&gt; non-commutativity in more general string backgrounds. In
particular, non-commutativity in charged strings (as opposed to neutral strings)
is studied, as well as the related issues of generalization of the star product,
and of the interpretation of the corresponding scaling limit in the D-brane
language. &lt;br/&gt;Non-commutativity in solvable backgrounds of the plane wave
type (the Nappi-Witten model is one example) will be also investigated. The
latter are time dependent backgrounds, and are very interesting in their own
merits, and the center of much current research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
physics question one aims to answer is how intrinsic to string theory is non-
commutativity of space-time variables. The possibility that space-time
coordinates might not commute at the string scale &lt;br/&gt;is a very radical
departure from our current understanding of space-time, and points to a novel
type of uncertainty principle. It might induce deviation from smoothness of
space-time at small distances,&lt;br/&gt; and possible modifications to the
inflationary perturbation spectrum. &lt;br/&gt;
