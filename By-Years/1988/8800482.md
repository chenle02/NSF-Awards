This proposal is to continue the highly successful Phase I work for optimization
of the unique indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) structure for a novel, simplified
avalanche photodiodes (APD for the 1000-1700 nm spectral region). The Phase I
work showed that the structure could be used to double the breakdown voltage,
reduce edge breakdown, produce avalanche gains of 3 and leakage currents of 1 nA
at half the break down voltage. Working InGaAs APD's were actually fabricated
with vapor phase epitaxy (VPE). Computer techniques were developed to model the
electric field behavior of these devices (with Prof. S.R. Forrest of the USC).
Phase II work includes optimization of the "floating" guard-ring structure,
possibly incorporating a new "slab" structure into the original Phase I device.
VPE will be refined to yield lower background and finer control of n-doping. We
will deliver ten devices which are easy to fabricate, have gains beyond 10,
operate at 2 GHz and have sensitivities below -40 dbm.
