With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Ursinus College will acquire a Mossbauer (MB)
spectrometer. Faculty at St. Joseph's University, SUNY-Stony Brook, Texas
A&amp;M University and the University of Delaware will also carry out research
using this spectrometer. Mossbauer investigations range from studies of small
molecule iron compounds to the exploration of novel iron sites in proteins.
Projects will focus on analyzing hyperfine spectra to determine the number of
distinct iron sites in the sample, their oxidation and spin state and magnetic
behavior. These parameters will be interpreted in terms of electronic models,
allowing the investigators to make predictions of molecular structure and
function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owing to the great expansion of iron bio-
inorganic chemistry, Mossbauer spectrometers are now more frequently found in
academic Chemistry departments. The establishment of the MB spectroscopy lab at
Ursinus College will benefit the chemical research in the Philadelphia region,
involving scientists in Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry. Because of the
possible applications of MB spectroscopy in the analysis of a variety of
biological samples and chemical compounds, the presence of such instrumentation
should prove attractive for students in a variety of research programs. Thus the
training potential is significant. The highly interdisciplinary character of the
projects indicates a strong impact in fields ranging from synthetic and physical
inorganic chemistry to spectroscopy of proteins. &lt;br/&gt;
