9506771 Valavanis The central mbjective of the proposed work is: object
identification, classification and avoidance in 3-D underwater automated
surveillance. The motivation behind this objective is monitoring and
safeguarding wetlands, coastal fisheries and deep water polluted environments,
which are among the most valuable national resources. The specific application
domain, directly related to the proposed work, is surveying and monitoring
Louisiana's wetlands and shallow water fisheries in collaboration with the
Southern Science Center (SSC) - previously known as the National Wetlands
Research Center - and the recently established National Marine Fisheries
Services (NMFS), both located at the University of Southwestern Louisiana's
(USL's) research park. This proposal capitalizes on already available resources,
technology and algorithms, developed for other applications, but adapts and
further modifies and enhances them for the proposed automated surveillance
problem. The end result will be: a detailed methodology/approach for the real-
time sensor based autonomous control and navigation of an underwater vehicle,
capable of automated surveillance in sensitive environments. There will be no
field studies and/or vehicle related experiments at this stage. Three specific
objectives will be accomplished: i)Development of a detailed architecture for
underwater vehicle motion control. ii) Implementation and experimental
verification of an already derived total color difference (TCD) measure and
total color difference tolerance (TCDT) thresholds for underwater object
identification. iii) Enhancement and verification of a recently derived
potential based panel method for autonomous vehicle motion planning in a 3-D
workshop environment. ***
