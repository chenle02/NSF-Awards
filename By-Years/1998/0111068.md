To facilitate chemical transformations, enzymes must possess sufficient
flexibility to accommodate substrate and reaction intermediates while
maintaining adequate structural rigidity. How enzymes perform this delicate
balancing act is critical for a meaningful understanding of catalysis and
recognition. This attribute is brilliantly expressed in the enzymes that
catalyze protein phosphorylation in the cell, the protein kinases. These enzymes
have been crystallized in many forms that differ by movements in the amino acid
backbones comprising the essential three-dimensional structure. While it is
believed that these motions are important for function, little is known about
the nature and catalytic relevance of these conformational changes in solution.
In this project, equilibrium- and pulsed- hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled
with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry will be used to understand the solution
conformation of an essential protein kinase-cAMP-dependent protein kinase [PKA].
The goal is to determine what types of structural transitions occur when
nucleotides, substrates and inhibitors bind to the enzyme. Once identified, the
time frame for the structural transitions will be established and correlated
with the catalytic mechanism for the enzyme. The long-range goal is to determine
whether structural changes limit substrate phosphorylation and, if so, which
regions of the enzyme are involved in these events.
