9700542 Lieman This award funds programs for research and education centered
around the areas of number theory and computational mathematics. In number
theory, the investigator will address several outstanding conjectures about the
average values of various families of L-series of arithmetic interest, including
an "on average" version of the Lindelof hypothesis in n-aspect; a conjecture
concerning the Whittaker-Fourier coefficients of metaplectic forms; and a
conjecture concerning the average values of the L-series of the classical "sum
of two cubes" family of elliptic curves. The investigator expects to resolve
each conjecture by using and developing a blend of techniques from metaplectic
forms and analytic number theory. In addition, the grant includes a summer
research project in number theory for undergraduates. This summer program has
diverse goals: to increase underrepresented minority participation in
mathematics and science; to produce a self-paced mathematical investigation
series which will be available to the general on-line undergraduate community;
to involve undergraduates in active research investigations; and to produce new
courses for the mathematics department at the University of Missouri. Finally,
the investigator will undertake an experimental effort to increase graduate
student visibility, travel opportunities, and professional experience within the
mathematics community. The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the
early development of academic faculty as both educators and researchers. The
Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program
that provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their
overall career development. It combines in a single program the support of
quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation
of those traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering. This program
enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development
of full, balanced academic careers.
