Data processing facilities are highly vulnerable to earthquake damage. Effective
steps can be taken to mitigate earthquake damage, but no guidelines, standards,
or recommended procedures exist which can be used by those who operate or
procure computer services. The absence of such information limits assurance that
such facilities can and will remain functional during and after an earthquake.
This project will develop seismic design guidelines for data processing
facilities. The guidelines will be suitable for use in several circumstances: to
assist the owner and designer in selecting the level of performance that is
required; to provide criteria and specifications to govern the design and
procurement of new or strengthened facilities; to provide guidance to the
engineers or systems analysts in selecting approaches to meet performance
requirements; to provide minimum evaluation standards; and to guide computer
industry manufacturers in the design of their equipment. Other equipment and
processes of the banking and insurance industries will also be considered in
this research project.
