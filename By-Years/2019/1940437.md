Large-scale utilization of bioenergy is attractive as a potential alternative to
fossil fuels only if the production and processing of bioenergy feedstocks is
sustainable from economic, environmental, and social standpoints. Research into
bioenergy sustainability will benefit from improved understanding of goals,
progress to date, and cooperation among researchers active in multiple
disciplinary domains. The 2019 Bioenergy Sustainability Conference, to be held
October 21-22, 2019 in Nashville, TN, is designed to bring together scientists
and engineers working on the latest advances in the field. This conference will
address information gaps and solutions to bioenergy sustainability challenges
including land, water, climate, and socio-economic aspects. Presentations will
discuss fundamental and applied research underway to support more sustainable
bioenergy. Break-out sessions will encourage all attendees to share their
experiences and discuss research needs and approaches.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference aims to provide a venue for: (1)
scientific presentations from a diverse group of researchers, (2) encouraging
active participation by graduate student and post docs who represent the future
of the field, (3) bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an
atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to
motivate new research into barriers limiting the development and sustainability
of bioenergy sources, and (4) a particular focus on women, underrepresented
groups in engineering, and persons with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
