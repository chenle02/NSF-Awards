The Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES), a
unit within the College of the Environment (CoEnv) at the University of
Washington (UW), will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
for undergraduates interns. The project will bring students to the campus in
Seattle, WA for nine weeks each summer for three years. Students will be
recruited nationally from all major science and engineering disciplines mostly
during their Junior year in college. Special efforts will be made to recruit
students from under-represented groups and from community colleges. Each student
will be matched with a mentor and a research project. Professional development
activities conducted during the nine-week period will include a special lecture
series, a Responsible Conduct of Research workshop, training on how to prepare a
scientific poster, and discussions about graduate school with a postdoc/graduate
student panel. During the summer each student conducts independent research and
gives final oral and poster presentations at the end of the program. Mentors
participating in this REU program will provide foundational training in core
disciplines and promote collaboration across research fields. Students will be
encouraged to present their results at scientific conferences after the program
is over and/or co-author publications in peer-reviewed
journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a multidisciplinary, cooperative
institute, CICOES facilitates interactions between academic and National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) government scientists and among academic
units within and outside the UW CoEnv. CICOESâ€™ REU program will immerse students
in the process of how scientific research is conceived, designed, conducted,
interpreted, and communicated. Students will explore the climate and
environmental research in research projects about the earth system. Potential
research topics include oceanography, fisheries, conservation and resource
management, earth sciences, environmental engineering, and marine policy.
Students will also have access to state-of-the-art analytical instruments,
sampling devices, and modeling programs for their research projects that across
multiple disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
