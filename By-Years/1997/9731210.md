This research utilizes Rydberg atoms to investigate the non-linear dynamics of
impulsively driven systems, to study the control and manipulation of atomic
wavefunctions, to probe ultra-low energy electron-molecule scattering, and to
examine the behavior of atoms near a solid surface. Advantage will be taken of
the fact that the excited electron in the Rydberg atom is in an orbit very far
removed from the nucleus; thus its behavior is strongly affected by weak
external perturbations.
