The College of Science and Technology, the College of Education, the Savannah-
Chatham Public School System (SCCPSS) and the YMCA of Coastal Georgia are
collaborating to recruit, build and support cohort communities of STEM
undergraduate majors to become teachers using five strategies: 1) attracting and
recruiting freshmen and sophomores into teaching, 2) holding workshops for STEM
faculty to provide them with the expertise to advise students on the career of
teaching, 3) providing scholarships for junior and senior STEM majors planning
to become teachers, 4) creating future teacher professional learning communities
(FTPLCs) focused on research and best practices in STEM education, and 5)
supporting the accelerated MAT year leading to math or science certification at
the Middle or Secondary level. The students teach in a high needs school for up
to 6 years (2 years for each year of support) and serve as peer-leaders in
learning communities at Armstrong and within their school environment. This
project is producing 31 highly qualified MAT prepared science and math teachers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The shortage of math and science teachers
in Georgia is critical. The projected need over the next five years is for 88
middle and 91 high school science/math teachers. This project is impacting the
need for highly qualified science and math teachers to teach in high needs
districts in Savannah and the surrounding areas of southeast Georgia.
