It is generally accepted that bending of epithelial cell sheets during early
organ formation is caused by constriction of cell apices and/or bases. The
mechanism of constriction is thought to be interactions of myosin with actin
filaments anchored in the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is based primarily on
circumstantial evidence. Changes have been shown in the width of microfilament
bundles at cell apices in morphogenetically active regions of primordia and
shape change in many organ primordia is inhibited by drugs that interfere with
the integrity of actin filaments. However, the arrangement of filament bundles
differs in different primordia and in different regions of the same primordium.
Careful measurements of shape change have been done only for neural fold
formation and the results do not exclude other mechanisms for shape change. The
goal of this study is to provide not only careful measurements of cell size and
shape for all regions of several representative primordia, but also to
quantitate changes in cytoskeletal components during the shape changes. This
will be accomplished by computer assisted image analysis. Furthermore, the
results will be tested with a computer model of organogenesis to determine which
observed changes are sufficient and necessary to produce the organotypic shape
changes. Computer modelling will allow additional experimental testing of each
hypothesis. %%% During the development of the embryo organs are formed and
shaped from cells. Dr. Hilfer will test the hypothesis that organ formation is
controlled primarily by changes in cell shape. He will use microscopic
measurements of developing embryos as well as computer models to test this
hypothesis.
