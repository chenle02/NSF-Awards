This research examines sharp risk convergence for adaptive estimates of
nonparametric curves in the absence of prior information on nuisance
parameters.Since optimal risk convergence in this context depends crucially on
the smoothness of the estimated curve, the goal is to develop a suitable
estimator without a priori knowledge of the smoothness. Particular areas of
application are probability density estimation, nonparametric regression,
filtering and spectral density estimation. Most (optimal) estimates of curves
from data rely on assumptions about the smoothness of the curve to be estimated.
Adaptive estimation allows information about the smoothness to be built up as
observations (data) are gathered. This is done at the same time and as part of
the process of estimating the curve itself. For sequential methods of this kind,
the amount of data required (sample size) depends on the observations and the
underlying curve. Both theoretical approaches to an optimal overall strategy and
some applications will be considered.
