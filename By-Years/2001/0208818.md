Efforts are underway worldwide to create Web-accessible mathematical and
scientific digital libraries. To leverage such resources, users should be able
to search not only for text, but also for equations, formulas and other math
constructs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop the theory and
algorithms for indexing and searching of mathematical expressions, and implement
a Web-accessible math search and retrieval system. Also, the project will define
and implement a math query language that is intuitive and expressive. This will
allow users to enter full or fragmentary mathematical expressions as queries,
and retrieve all documents containing the symbolic entities that match the
query, even if those entities are represented graphically (e.g., GIF images).
The methodology is to build a math search engine on top of a text search engine,
and to translate math contents and queries into textual queries by means of
novel textualization and structure-linearization-&amp;-normalization techniques.
A more powerful but demanding alternative strategy, structural indexing, will be
developed in a follow-up project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unprecedented search
capability will provide educators and students, from junior high schools to
graduate schools, with an effective knowledge-discovery tool to enhance learning
and problem-solving skills in mathematics and mathematical sciences. It will
also be a valuable aid to researchers and practitioners in those
fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
