Orszag applied renormalization group (RNG) methods to the analysis of
hydrodynamic turbulence and deduced a closure second order scheme to calculate
the eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity produced by subgrid eddies. One of the
assumptions of the method is that turbulence is isotropic. Two major facts that
produce anisotropy in geophysical flows are rotation and stratification. Here he
proposes to study the effect of rotation and stratification on the turbulence
schemes and apply the results to specific oceanographic problems, including
models of the thermocline in the equatorial Pacific.
