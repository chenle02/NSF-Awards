The magnetic properties of thin films of magnetic metals are to be investigated
by susceptibility, photoemission, and surface scanning microscopy. The
cooperative magnetic behavior of these films depend on their thickness, a few
atomic layers, and the specific chemical compositions of the films. Of
particular interest is the magnetic anisotropy in the films. This can be tuned
by alloying the 3d ferromagnets iron, cobalt and nickel with nonmagnetic
elements. The epitaxial film compositions are not stable in bulk materials, but
can be stabilized in the thin film geometry. The magnetic properties of the thin
films change dramatically with the composition, which can be varied over wide
ranges. Thus materials that originally ferromagnetic can be tuned to spin glass
or other magnetic order by changing the composition.
