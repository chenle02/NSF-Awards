The purpose of this research is to develop a semi-analytical sensitivity
analysis procedure for predicting the effects of geometric and/or material
nonlinearities and perturbations on the nonlinear large deformation response of
composites. Of particular interest is the post-failure behavior. For the class
of problems being considered, methods such as the global finite difference
technique or the traditional incremental methods lead to erroneous results
because of the non-smoothness of the constitutive equations of the composite.
Instead, a direct differentiation approach and a variational approach that uses
the adjoint state concept will be studied in order to include the effects of
non-smoothness in the stress-strain relationships. Results obtained from the
sensitivity analysis procedure will be compared with test data as a step in the
verification of the proposed methodology.
