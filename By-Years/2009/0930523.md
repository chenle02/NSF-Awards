This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project targets the separation
of metallic and semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) at
industrial scale. The intellectual merit consists in enabling the efficient use
of the multi-functionality of SWCNT.

Successful completion will allow taking full advantage of metallic and
mechanical properties, e.g., in transparent conducting films, and of
semiconducting properties in electronic devices such as thin film transistors.
The successful separation between metallic and semiconducting SWCNT includes
enabling innovative electronic products, e.g. thin film transistors, sensors and
memory with improved characteristics such as deposition on flexible, conformable
and stretchable substrates. Solution processing of SWCNT will contribute
significantly to safe handling and address environmental and health concerns.
The project will contribute to the training of essential workforce in techniques
necessary for the fast implementation of multifunctional materials in commercial
products.
