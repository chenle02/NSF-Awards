With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Berkeley
will upgrade its computational chemistry facility. This equipment will enhance
research in a number of areas including the study of reaction mechanisms and
dynamics, structural biology, spectroscopy, enzyme catalysis, coordination
chemistry and environmental chemistry. The reconfiguration of this facility is
also tied to a curriculum development initiative, e.g., the faculty will offer
in-facility mini courses, and the equipment will be used in modern computational
and molecular modeling methods in undergraduate and graduate courses. A cluster
of fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of
active research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in
state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These studies will have a
significant impact in a wide number of areas, including biochemistry and
environmental chemistry.
