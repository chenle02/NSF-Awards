Fundamental understanding of storm systems and, hence, improved predictions
depend upon advances in knowledge of many interacting meteorological phenomena.
In this study, the Principal Investigator proposes to investigate the effects of
atmospheric thermal forcing in flow regimes that posses a "critical level". A
critical level is the height at which the velocity of the ambient wind coincides
with the propagation speed of atmospheric disturbances. Previous work has shown
that critical levels can play an important role in triggering and/or maintaining
convection. The Principal Investigator will use both theoretical investigations
and numerical modelling to study the relationship between thermal forcing and
atmospheric flows with critical levels and how these relate to the formation and
maintenance of two diverse atmospheric storm systems -- mid-latitude squall
lines and east coast wintertime cyclones. //
