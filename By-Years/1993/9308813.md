ABSTRACT --CTS 9308813 Viljoen The interdisciplinary problem of thermal stress
in a chemical reacting system is addressed. Examples of these phenomena are
found in the failure of catalyst supports in packed bed reactors operating in
the ignited state, reactions on metal gauzes, catalytic converters, and porous
radiant burners (PRB). The systematic analysis of these problems will enable us
to design more durable supports, extend the life of converters and expensive
gauze material (e.g., Pt) and expand the application of PRB's to transient and
frequent shut-down-start-up operations. Both a theoretical and experimental
study of the problem is proposed. The experimental program will be developed
around ceramic samples with piezo-electric fibers embedded inside the matrix.
These samples of various forms and dimensions, will be exposed to a combustion
environment. Direct measurements of the stress will be made and results will be
correlated with theoretical results. The development of such an in-situ stress
measurement technique for ceramic structures could also find important
applications in other ceramic structures exposed to high stress/temperature
environments.
