9405080 Geissman The mechanics of extremely extended terranes is incompletely
understood, with several models proposed. This project will utilize Cenozoic
Death Valley, California extreme extension to test the "rolling hinge" model.
The work includes structural, stratigraphic, paleomagnetic and geochronologic
tests and is intended to lead to a better understanding of the three-dimensional
aspects of extension. Results should provides a robust assessment the viability
of the extreme extensional model.
