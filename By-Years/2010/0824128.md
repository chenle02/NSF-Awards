Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop the first
single-chip radio frequency platform formed by the integration of Aluminum
Nitride contour-mode resonators and switches. The approach is based on
understanding the fundamental issues for piezoelectrics at the system
integration level by focusing on fabrication yield, reliability, and
reproducibility of the proposed microdevices. The frequency of operation of the
resonators will be increased up to 6 GHz and recently developed microswitches
will be integrated in the same process and optimized for low voltage
actuation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The large scale
integration of piezoelectric micromechanical devices will have a
transformational impact on future radio front-ends. New low power radio
architectures that take advantage of frequency hopping and channel selection
will be enabled by this integration. Fundamental challenges related to device
design, impedance characterization and Q limits will be explored at unreported
frequencies of operation. The fundamental issues of piezoelectrics concerning
material orientation, electromechanical coupling, residual stresses and
transducer modeling will be examined and their understanding permit a
significant leap forward in the use of these films.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The research activities will
promote notable advancements in the area of wireless communications and sensing
by making possible the realization of multi-standard and reconfigurable devices.
The discoveries and technology development performed under this project will be
disseminated by including the findings in a newly created course, REU programs,
and offering tours and hands-on training sessions to K-12 students and
underrepresented minority in the Philadelphia school
district.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
