0104339 Dorothy Shippen&lt;br/&gt;Telomeres are essential for genome stability
and continued proliferation in an undifferentiated and dedifferentiated state.
Arabidopsis thaliana is a useful model to elucidate the role of telomeres in
plant growth and development and to address fundamental questions of telomere
function in higher eukaryotes. The investigator recently demonstrated that
Arabidopsis can survive up to ten generations without telomerase, the enzyme
responsible for maintaining tracts of telomeric DNA on chromosome ends. In
telomerase-deficient plants, telomeres shorten progressively and late generation
mutants endure increasing levels of cytogenetic damage, correlated with
developmental anomalies in vegetative and reproductive organs. Unexpectedly, a
significant subset of telomerase-deficient plants show a different phenotype
that includes homeotic transformation in floral organs and leaves that curl up
along the longitudinal axis. The striking similarity of this phenotype to
mutants defective in aspects of chromatin structure in Arabidopsis strongly
suggests that telomere dysfunction can lead to global epigenetic repercussions
in the regulation of gene expression. This project will test whether telomere
erosion is accompanied by changes in nuclear architecture and chromatin
structure and to reveal the global transcription profile during successive
generations of a telomerase deficiency.
