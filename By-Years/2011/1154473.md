The Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering at University Park is
providing scholarship awards that target members of groups that are
underrepresented in engineering which include women, racial minorities and first
generation college students. The Engineering Pathways program is based on a
cohort model, bringing the students onto campus for a math-intensive bridge
program the summer before they enroll and providing special housing, mentoring
and internships throughout the students' undergraduate careers. The elements of
the Pathways program are based on the research findings on effective strategies
for increasing enrollment, retention and career success for these
underrepresented groups. The program awards 10 new scholarships each year to
incoming students and, based on student achievement, awards retention
scholarships for continuing students. The evaluation plan is designed to provide
timely feedback on the success of the students and the overall program, and it
will add to the knowledge base of successful retention strategies in
engineering.
