This award will support study of the Japanese language by an American scientist
or engineer by providing a stipend, tuition, or other course-related expenses.
The objectives of the program are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers
to acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to
allow them to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient expertise
in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical abstracts in their field
of interest. There is a critical need for more effective technical communication
between American and Japanese researchers. This award is intended to help remove
language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese cooperative research and to
facilitate science and technology exchange.
