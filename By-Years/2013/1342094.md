A wildfire in the wetland-mosaic landscape of Big Cypress National Preserve,
Florida, offers a sudden and time-critical opportunity to understand what
happens to forested wetlands when drought and fire occur in quick succession. In
this instance, an area that experienced wildfire during severe drought in 2009
burned again only four years later (March 2013) and also during regional drought
conditions. A series of studies after the 2009 wildfire provide considerable
pre-2013 fire data, making this opportunity highly unusual from the standpoint
of fires in wetlands. By making measurements of fire severity, tree mortality
and loss of soil, this project will provide critical information on the
resilience of wetlands to fire and drought.

Cypress domes store water long into the region's annual dry season. They thus
provide important habitat for wildlife; refugia that concentrate prey organisms;
and a distributed network of recharge basins for the shallow aquifer that
supplies southwestern Florida's growing human population. The combination of
projected climate change and human-altered hydrology is likely to result in more
frequent and severe wildfires. By understanding the combined effects of drought
and repeated wildfires on these wetland-mosaic landscapes, the project is
expected to inform fire management strategies.
