The Third International Workshop on Positron and Positronium Chemistry is to be
held at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 16-18, 1990. The
subject area of positron and positronium chemistry consists of the elucidation
of the chemistry of these two species, and their possible utilization in
materials science and engineering. This workshop will provide a proper forum for
addressing fundamental physical-chemical issues that underpin the development
and optimization of techniques for materials characterization. This workshop is
being supported jointly by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of
Materials Research at the National Science Foundation.
