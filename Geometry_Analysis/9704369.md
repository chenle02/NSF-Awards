9704369 Gordon This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry. More
specifically, the investigator is to consider the structure of isopectral sets
of metrics, the possible existence of metrics in Euclidean space with the same
scattering behavior, constructions of isopectral metrics whose geometric
properties differ in certain ways, and the extent to which the spectrum of a
Schrodinger operator determines the potential. The spectral geometry of
orbifolds, minimal hypersurfaces and their applications to the geometry of Ricci
curvature in dimension three, and the Ricci flow on manifolds with boundary are
also to be pursued. Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations
of curved surfaces. Such manifolds have well-known applications in theoretical
physics. A Riemannian manifold possesses a notion of distance, or a metric. And
by taking the derivative of the metric one can measure its curvature. The
Laplace operator and its spectrum are a fundamental object associated to any
Riemannian manifold. Much of this research project is concerned with the
question "To what extent is the geometry of a Riemannian manifold determined by
the spectrum of its Laplace operator?"
