Within the criminal justice system, there is a growing trend toward utilizing
videotape technology to record and present confession evidence. An apparent
advantage of videotaping an interrogation/confession is that such a procedure
should make it possible for fact finders to determine objectively and accurately
whether a confession was voluntary or coerced, and consequently whether it
should carry any weight in determining the guilt or innocence of a defendant.
However, despite the seeming objectivity associated with the making and
subsequent evaluation of a videotaped interrogation and confession, the
scientific literature on illusory causation suggests that certain aspects of
this process could inadvertently bias or prejudice judgments of voluntariness
and guilt. Studies to date show that, relative to other confession-presentation
formats, videotapes that are recorded with the camera focused on the confessor
tend to produce judgments of greater voluntariness and guilt. This research
builds on prior work in two primary ways. The first set of investigations will
continue examining the extent to which the previously demonstrated camera
perspective bias in videotaped confessions generalizes to real-world situations.
The second set of investigations will focus on determining the effect of the
videotape-presentation format on accuracy in the evaluation of confession
evidence. The research conducted is of considerable applied significance because
only when both the potential advantages and disadvantages of the videotape
format are clearly established can appropriate decisions be made as to how to
utilize this procedural innovation to the best benefit of the criminal justice
system.
