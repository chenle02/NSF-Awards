9450735 Lepowsky The Peralta Community College District, San Francisco City
College, California State University-Hayward, and San Francisco State University
are forming a consortium to jointly revitalize instruction in calculus by
adapting the Harvard Calculus Curriculum. Faculty from each institution are
jointly developing the curriculum which will incorporate instructional methods
and strategies that have proven to be effective in increasing the success rate
of calculus students. The results are being published in a Calculus Reform
Handbook. The respective mathematics departments are working to institutionalize
the developed reform curriculum in all calculus classes at the four
institutions. In addition, the core group are developing a preparation program
for mathematics faculty who have not participated in the curriculum development
effort.
