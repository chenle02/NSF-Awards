9508216 Wright Glacial Lake Agassiz was a huge lake fronting the retreating
Laurentide ice sheet. Its southern and eastern arms in northwestern Minnesota
were occupied from about 11,600 to 11,000 radiocarbon years ago, but following a
dry period contemporaneous with Younger Dryas interval only the southern arm was
occupied, from 10,000 to 9,500 radiocarbon B.P. This proposal aims to evaluate
the effects of the cold glacial meltwaters of light 18O on the climate,
vegetation, and small-lake limnology downwind on the adjacent moraines by
stratigraphic analysis of varved sediments of small deep lakes. analysis of
pollen, stable-isotope and trace-element composition of ostracodes, stable
isotope composition of cellulose in organic matter, and species composition of
ostracode assemblages will be used along with varve counts and AMS radiocarbon
dates to establish a dated stratigraphy to correlate with Lake Agassiz phases of
expansion and reduction. A site downwind of the eastern arm should show one
interval of lake effects, of Lake Agassiz on the climate of the adjacent
landscape.
