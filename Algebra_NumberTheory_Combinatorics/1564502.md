This project concerns the field of algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics
studying the geometric structure of solutions of polynomial equations. Many of
the questions under study in this project are motivated by string theory, a
branch of theoretical physics connected with the structure of elementary
particles. This project aims to significantly enhance the intensive and fruitful
interaction between cutting edge research in enumerative algebraic geometry and
theoretical physics. The research aims to extend mathematical developments that
verify and generalize conjectures originating from physics, and the work is
expected to significantly impact development of the physical theory as well.
Through conferences, a summer school, seminars, and research involvement, this
project provides unique opportunities for a new generation of mathematicians to
obtain the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to work in this
exciting research area.

The aim of the project is to study enumerative invariants in the broad sense and
their dependence on various stability conditions, as well as dualities relating
different enumerative invariants. The investigators plan to further develop the
theory of Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSM) and will study the epsilon-wall-
crossing conjecture and zeta-wall-crossing conjecture at all genera; Gromov-
Witten (GW) and quasimap invariants are related by a sequence of epsilon-wall-
crossing, whereas the Calabi-Yau/Landau-Ginzburg correspondence (relating GW
invariants and FJRW invariants) and Pfaffian/Grassmannian correspondence are
examples of zeta-wall-crossing. The investigators are developing the theory of
Mixed-Spin-P (MSP) fields, to interpolate GW theory of quintic threefolds and
FJRW theory of Fermat quintic polynomials, and to study algebraic structures of
higher genus GW and FJRW invariants. The new theories of GLSM and MSP fields
will provide new tools to attack the central and longstanding problem of
computing higher genus GW invariants of compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. The
investigators have been investigating K-theoretic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of
threefolds, as well as GW and quasimap invariants of Nakajima quiver varieties.
Because some of conjectures motivated by theoretical physics can only be
properly formulated in terms of K-theoretic enumerative invariants, they plan to
study dualities relating K-theoretic enumerative invariants of different
geometries, and to lift results on traditional enumerative invariants to the
K-theoretic setting.
