We propose to further our initial investigations of carrier dynamics in solid
C60 begun at Rice, using time-resolved optical methods to study both carrier
relaxation and transport mechanisms in this material. Also, we plan to
investigate semiconductor interface electronic structure and its effect on bulk
carrier dynamics near the surface.
