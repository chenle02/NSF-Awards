Professor Fitzgerald is continuing her work that seeks to locate the scientific
and technological transformations in American agriculture within the broader
framework of industrialization. Research so far indicates that agricultural
innovations were a direct response to both the severe agricultural depression
and the emergence of agricultural engi neers and economists as new professional
groups, both of whom brought to agriculture the views of urban engineers and
economists. In the 1920s one can see a series of attempts to model agricultural
practice on manufacturing practice, in both material and ideological terms.
Topics in this project include the emergence of agricultural experts in
economics and engineering; the creation of an ethos of agricultural efficiency
and abundance; the mechanization of agriculture; the trend toward large-scale,
"factory" farming; a case study of such a farm; and the role of collectivization
as a model for large-scale farms. Thi s project seeks to offer both a more
interpretive account of agricultural change in America and a new set of cultural
and intellectual benchmarks for the scientific and engineering practitioners of
the past, whose material reshaping of our culture has been so pronounced.
