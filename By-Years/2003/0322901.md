In this Starter Research Grant, the PI will develop and apply a quantitative,
semi-empirical method to predict the mechanism by which proteins interact. This
analysis will provide an insight into protein function. The emphasis of this
research is to build a combined theoretical and experimental framework that can
quantitatively determine how ligand molecules interact with biological
macromolecules of interest. The method combines a linear interaction method
recently developed with a combinatorial technique using aptamer libraries.

The PI's institution works actively to encourage students from underrepresented
groups to study science through outreach programs and this research project is
expected to play an important role in this educational process. The PI will
train graduate and undergraduate students.
