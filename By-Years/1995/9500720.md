9500720 Klein The main subject of this research proposal is the study of
phenomena that occur in disordered systems. The topics of proposed research are:
I) Random Schrodinger operators. II) Classical spin systems in a random
environment. III) Disordered quantum spin models, percolation and contact
processes. IV) Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. V) Polymers in a random
environment. Impurities can change dramatically the properties of certain
materials. The best known examples are transistors, which are made of certain
materials whose properties are modified by impurities. Such materials are
modelled by disordered systems. The proposed topics of research include systems
in Quantum Mechanics and in Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics. ***
