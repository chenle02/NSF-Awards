The main objective of his proposal is to request the sponsorship of NSF in the
organization of an International Workshop on High Performance Fiber Reinforced
Cement Composites to be held in Main, Germany, 6/91. The workshop is cosponsored
by DFG, Germany's counterpart of NSF. These Composites include materials such
SIFCON (slurry Infiltrated Fiber Concrete), fiber reinforced DSP (Densified
Small Particles), and CRC (Compact Reinforced Concrete). They have been shown to
develop very high strengths (up to 40 ksi in compression) while maintaining high
ductilities. Advanced composites and the fundamental understanding of their
behavior is a rapidly expanding branch within the field civil engineering
materials. The main object of the proposed workshop is to provide a forum for
discussion, primarily among specialists, as to the latest developments in the
field and future directions to follow.
