The team will investigate the enigmatic "dark matter" in nearby galaxies. Dark
matter does not radiate but its gravity tugs at the stars in a galaxy.
Observations of such tracer stars provide clues about the dark matter. The team
will use forefront facilities to study the starlight at optical wavelengths.
They will focus on the faint outskirts of giant galaxies and on some just-
discovered dwarf galaxies. The team will compare their observations to
simulations of the dark matter in these diverse -- thus challenging -- settings.
Senior team members will train junior members recruited from underrepresented
groups. The team will continue its successful partnership with Science Buddies,
an on-line resource for increasing K-12 science
literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the giant early-type galaxies, the team will
use chemodynamics to map out their dark matter distributions and to study their
assembly histories. For the dwarf ultra-diffuse galaxies, the team will use
spectroscopy to study their dark matter distributions and their star formation
histories.
