Information visualization is an increasingly important research and development
area, crucial for the success of the information revolution. This workshop
focuses on visualizing information and how users interact with digital
information. Co-chaired by Nahum Gershon (The MITRE Corp.) and Jacques-Emile
Dubois (CODATA International) it has an international committee of visualization
experts from nine countries. The goals of the workshop are to bring together
researchers and developers in information visualization from Europe, United
States, and Canada for intensive brain-storming to accomplish the following:
survey current activity in information visualization in Europe and the United
States; identify research and development issues in visualization; and forge
research collaborations between the United States and Europe. Although there has
been a great deal of development of methods for visualizing diverse types of
data and information, few algorithms and methods have been implemented to solve
real-world problems, especially in North America. Since more research and
development have been targeted at solving real problems effectively in Europe,
they are ahead of U. S. research and development in applying visualization to
operational environments. The focal point of this workshop is implementing
visualization methodology. Combining the North American and European expertise
is expected to result in enhanced effectiveness of visualization, enabling
better communication of information and more effective use of the information
highways, reducing the number of documents end users such as journalists must
access.
