The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to study problems arising in analysis,
convex geometry and computer science using the methods of probability. For many
problems of geometry and analysis, such as finding sections of a convex body
with certain nice properties or extracting a small sample with a certain
structure from a large set, the explicit constructions are unknown. In these
cases random constructions turn out to be very effective. It is often possible
to define a random section or sample and show that it has the desired property
with high probability. This approach combined with advanced probabilistic tools,
like measure concentration, led to major discoveries in convex geometry and
functional analysis. The PI plans to study the combinatorial dimension of a set
of functions. This is a new measure of complexity, which arises from questions
in probability and computer science. The PI will also investigate the spectral
properties of random matrices and apply the results of this research to
construction of effective error-correcting codes.

This research will provide new connections between functional analysis, convex
geometry and probability. An important part of this project is the application
of probabilistic methods to concrete problems of computer science. The study of
combinatorial dimension is likely to have practical applications in machine
learning. The geometric approach to the signal recovery and error-correcting
codes will lead to the construction of more efficient and stable algorithms.
