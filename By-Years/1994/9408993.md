A set of experiments are planned to investigate young infants' understanding of
the meaning of affective expressions. These experiments focus on a number of
related abilities: (1) the use of information for affect provided by acoustic
features of different vocal expressions, (2) the role of face and voice in the
portrayal an recognition of affect, (3) the effects of contextual information on
the understanding of expressions, and (4) preferences for positive and negative
expressions of emotion during infancy. Results of each of these experiments will
combine to provide both a broader and more detailed picture of infants'
abilities. The perception of affect plays a crucial role in early development,
particularly in the realm of communication and social interaction. As
development proceeds, gaining an understanding of the expressive behaviors of
others is a step in acquiring the more general capability of discerning other
person's thoughts, intentions, desires and beliefs. It is important to trace
this developmental progression in order to understand deviations from the norm,
such as are found for young children with autism.
