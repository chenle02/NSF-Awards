9408283 Wee Freshwater, scale-covered algae called "golden algae" are common
throughout the world, but their taxonomic classification is problematic and
their phylogenetic relationships are poorly known. Most collections are
identified as the genus Mallomonas or as Synura, but considerable variability
hides within the bounds of these convenient categories. Dr. James Wee of Loyola
University, with colleagues at Tulane University and elsewhere, is addressing
this problem by studying morphological features of the siliceous scales and
cellular ultrastructure while adding significant new data from DNA sequencing of
nuclear ribosomal genes. Mutational differences among species in these
synurophyte algae will be assessed and used to construct likely phylogenetic
trees, which in turn can be used to evaluate changes in morphological features
employed as taxonomic discriminators. Synurophyte species are key environmental
indicators in lake acidification studies, are associated with taste and odor
causing compounds in potable water supplies, and are used in basic biological
research on cell structure. Reliable taxonomic identification, stable
classification, and robust phylogenetic analysis will improve both their utility
and our understanding of their ecology and evolution.
