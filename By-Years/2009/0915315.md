The MCDB Database System for Managing and Modeling Uncertainty Analysts working
with large data sets often use statistical models to ``guess'' at unknown,
inaccurate, or missing information associated with the data stored in a
database. For example, an analyst for a manufacturer may wish to know, "What
would my profits have been if I'd increased my margins by 5% last year?" The
answer to this question depends upon the extent to which the higher prices would
have affected each customer's demand, which is undoubtedly guessed via the
application of some statistical model.

The MCDB project is concerned with the design and implementation of a prototype
database system called the "Monte Carlo Database System," or "MCDB" for short.
MCDB allows an expert-level analyst or statistician to attach arbitrary
stochastic models to the database data in order to "guess" the values for
unknown or inaccurate data, such as each customer's unseen demand function.
These stochastic models reside in the database, and are always up-to-date in the
sense that they are parameterized on the current state of the database (using
each customer's most recent purchases in the above example).

The project attacks a number of key intellectual and scientific challenges. Most
of these are related to the fact that for performance reasons, it is not
possible to materialize one thousand stochastic instances of a one terabyte data
warehouse, and query each of them in sequence. Novel methods for avoiding such
materializations are being considered, such as skipping Monte Carlo trials that
produce data which will never be used to answer a specific query. The project
also considers statistical challenges, such as generating database instances
that fall far out in the tail of the answer distribution, which is necessary for
specific applications such as risk assessment.
