Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: ECCS- 0821565&lt;br/&gt;Grantee:
Cornell University on behalf of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure
Network&lt;br/&gt;Title: Nanotechnology Research Instrumentation in Support of
NNIN (2008)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this award is to advance
nanotechnology research at the boundaries of electronics, microsystems,
materials science and life sciences. NNIN facilities will acquire and make
available instruments for open national use: (a) rapid deep glass etching
(University of Michigan), deposition of complex oxide materials by sputtering
(Penn-State University), plasmon resonance measurements (University of
Washington) and non-contact printing of biological &amp; novel materials
(Georgia Tech).&lt;br/&gt;The approach will enable reproducible inorganic and
organic/biological materials deposition and processing, including development of
new techniques, and their characterization, that will be available to national
researchers with reliable protocols and rigorous training for hands-on use. A
broad group of research projects will benefit including advances in applications
of phase transition phenomena and organic materials, understanding of life
science phenomena, and the broader uses across discipline boundaries including
organic-inorganic interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project stems
from the large research user population (&gt;4500 users including &gt;650
industrial users), geographic diversity, and the educational and broader efforts
that NNIN pursues. NNIN will develop and make available protocols and training
that will be available on the web, organize technology-focused workshops
leveraging the instruments and employ these tools in specific undergraduate
research projects. &lt;br/&gt;
