The greatest challenge facing theoretical physicists today is to construct a
consistent and useful quantum theory of gravity. Only when such a theory is
available can one begin to determine, with confidence, the nature of the cosmos
in its earliest moments, when it was less than 10_43 seconds old. The reason
these moments are important is that the violent fluctuations in the geometry of
spacetime that were then taking place must have had a strong influence on all
the other violent processes that were going on simultaneously (the Big Bang) and
hence on the subsequent evolution of the Universe. Preliminary computer
investigations have already been carried out on a simplified model (known as the
O(1,2) sigma model) that shares some of the significant features of quantum
gravity. These investigations will be completed and work will be begun on the
quantized gravitational field itself.
