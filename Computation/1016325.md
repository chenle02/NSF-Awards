Robust stability functions (RSFs) have broad importance in many fields in
science and engineering. In the case of linear dynamical systems, described by
ordinary differential or difference equations with no feedback control, RSFs are
real-valued functions of system coefficient matrices. The most important
examples are the pseudospectral abscissa and radius functions and the distance
to instability. The principal investigator is developing and analyzing new
efficient iterative methods to approximate RSFs much more quickly than is
currently possible. In many applications the coefficient matrices depend on
parameters which may be varied in order to optimize robust system stability.
Because RSFs are not convex and are typically not differentiable at optimizers,
it is essential to use nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization (NNO) methods that take
this into account. The efficiency of the new methods will open the way to
computing and optimizing RSFs for much larger systems than was previously
possible, including discretized systems of partial differential equations. In
practice most dynamical systems include feedback control. Then the RSFs of
interest become more complex and an important generalization is the H-infinity
norm. The PI is involved in the development of software that can be widely used
in the engineering community. This award was selected for partial funding by a
program which promotes the reuse of Cyberinfrastructure (CI) elements through
the Office of Cyberinfrastructure at the National Science Foundation.

The goal of the project is to bring new optimization tools to a wide community
of scientists and engineers, for use in many different kinds of applications.
The investigator's open-source software is already in use in a variety of
applications, including the design of aircraft controllers, a proton exchange
membrane fuel cell system, power systems controllers and the design of winding
systems for elastic web materials. All of these systems require controllers to
work effectively: a complex system such as an airplane or a power plant requires
automatic controllers to function safely and effectively, in addition to skilled
operators who know how to use such systems. However, these computations are
currently limited to small or moderate-sized systems, which cannot model real
physical systems very accurately. New scalable methods will allow the design of
controllers for much larger systems than was previously possible, including
control of discretized systems of partial differential equations, which have
applications throughout the natural sciences and engineering. This award was
