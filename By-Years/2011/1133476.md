The overall goal of the proposed project is to elucidate the fundamental
physical mechanisms governing the reorientation of cell migration polarity,
which affects how persistently the cells maintain their directionality of
movement and their ability to follow spatial cues during physiological processes
such as wound healing, the immune response, and embryonic development. The
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway has been implicated in the
control of cell reorientation, which is achieved by stabilizing the branching of
existing cell protrusions activity. Using an approach integrating live-cell
fluorescence microscopy, image analysis, and computational modeling, the team
will characterize and manipulate the dynamics of signal transduction pathways,
focal adhesions, and the actin cytoskeleton during protrusion branching. The
hallmarks of cell reorientation thusly identified will be re-evaluated in
PI3K-inhibited cells to evaluate if the dynamics are altered and how. These
research objectives are to be integrated with educational activities, and,
through the support and training of graduate students and the participation of
undergraduate students, the project will contribute to the training of
researchers in the cross-disciplinary areas of engineering analysis and cell
biology.
