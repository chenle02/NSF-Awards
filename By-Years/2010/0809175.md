This award provides travel support for doctoral student Ms. Josephine Rodriguez,
and an undergraduate who will be trained to assist her, working under the
guidance of Dr. James Whitfield, of the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, to conduct research on the parasitoid groups of the Microgastrinae at
the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in Costa Rica. Dr. Dan Janzen will be
her local mentor at ACG. Plans are to assess the overall diversity and richness
of the species, increase taxonomic understanding and use molecular phylogenetics
to address specific hypotheses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities of
this proposal will serve to advance understanding of issues in insect biology
and biodiversity and provide opportunities for increasing data on tropical
insect biodiversity. The project activities will involve an undergraduate and 30
Costa Rican parataxonomists, and will advance the training of a female
scientist. Materials generated from this research will be shared with other
researchers at ACG, and will contribute to further studies in the field.
