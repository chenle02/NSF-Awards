Carlton Pryor Theodore Williams Rutgers University FY97: $183,000 For 36
months. Kinematics of Stellar Systems: Mass Distributions, Stellar Populations,
and Binary Star Frequencies. Drs. Pryor and Williams, at Rutgers University,
will study the mass, structure, stellar content, and dynamical evolution of
stellar systems. The basic goals are to better define the properties of the
first generation of stars to form in our Milky Way galaxy and to search for dark
matter in star clusters and galaxies. These researchers will measure very large
samples of stellar radical velocities as the observation technique for this
study. The award includes funding for involving undergraduate students in the
research program. =================
