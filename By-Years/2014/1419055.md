This project will convene a panel of experts in government, industry and
academia to raise and discuss emerging concerns for human subjects' protections
in the digital age. Learners taking part in formal education, informal
education, and out-of-school settings are subject to a ubiquitous tracking of
their activities: locally, using the internet of things (e.g., smart phones,
smart sensors and other cyberphysical devices), and globally, via the internet.
This tracking may include data tracked passively (e.g., online purchases) or
data made available on social media websites by the learners themselves. In
addition, the use of the longitudinal data collected by local educational
agencies for research is an increasingly political concern. Decisions about the
use of these data by university researchers and scholars are typically made by
Institutional Review Board (IRB) offices. New guidelines on IRB practices are
being considered by a number of bodies, including the National Research Council,
which issued a report in early 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
support scholarly discussion on human subjects' protections in the digital age
with implications for funding agencies, schools, and those who work with human
subjects in a variety of environments. The issues discussed are of national
import, including, but not limited to FERPA privacy concerns. To the extent that
US researchers work with data from other countries (e.g., via massive open
online courses or MOOCs), the impact of the reports that will be produced as
part of this conference for education research is potentially global.
