This is a nominal continuing award of $50,000 per year for 3 years to sustain
the progress made by EPSCoR in the State of Maine over the last 6 years. While
progress was slow and less than anticipated or desired, the program office is
convinced that a nominal amount of resources, coupled with the NSF imprimatur
can, and will, catalize the State of Maine into affirmative action towards
research and research related activities. The proposal received an average of
very good plus from the four reviewers and the staff recommends the award. The
State has, since submission, provided the matching funds as called for in the
proposal via the Maine Science and Technology Board.
