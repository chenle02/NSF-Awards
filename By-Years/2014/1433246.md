This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (PRF) supports studies to investigate the
factors that influence the uptake of water by small particles in the atmosphere.
Factors that may be important include temperature, relative humidity, and
particle phase morphologies, such as whether a particle may be a mixture of
solids, semi-solids, and/or liquids, or may have various surface coatings. These
factors influence particle growth and the formation of clouds in the atmosphere.
Hence this research is important for understanding how atmospheric aerosols
influence climate.

The scientific questions that this research addresses include the following: (1)
What role does particle phase morphology play in the activation and growth of
cloud condensation nuclei; (2) Is there evidence of complex particle phase
behavior in the natural atmosphere; and (3) How well do current state-of- the-
art thermodynamic and kinetic models capture the complex relationship between
particle phase and water vapor uptake? Laboratory and field measurements will be
coupled with data from thermodynamic and kinetic models to accomplish the
objectives of the research. Most of this research will take place in the Linde
and Robinson Laboratory chamber facility at the California Institute of
Technology.
