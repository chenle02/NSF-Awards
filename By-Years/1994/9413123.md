9413123 Kaufman Various direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC)
procedures developed by the proposed investigator is especially attractive
because they do not require full state feedback or adaptive observers. Other
important properties of this class of algorithms include (1) their applicability
to non-minimum phase systems, (2) the order of the plant may be much larger than
the order of the reference model, and (3) this approach considers plants with
multiple inputs and outputs. However, it is important to note that in order to
guarantee asymptotic model following or even boundedness, it is sufficient to
demonstrate the satisfaction of a positive real type constraint. Although
various augmentation schemes have been developed to alleviate this constraint,
it is not straightforward to design the needed (usually feedforward compensation
to satisfy the positive real condition over the desired (or a maximal) range of
parameter variations. Thus, it is proposed to consider recent robust
compensation techniques that appear relevant to the design of such compensation.
These include a robust feedforward compensator developed for single input-single
output adaptive systems which will be extended to multiple input-multiple output
systems and the Kharitonvoc polynomial analysis, which will be considered for
use in single input-single output systems. The resulting augmentation procedures
from this proposed effort in conjunction with the MRAC algorithms should result
in easily implementable procedures for designing and synthesizing very robust
direct adaptive controllers that are applicable to many systems with significant
uncertainty. ***
