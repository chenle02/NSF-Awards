A complete understanding of the internal motions of the molecular and atomic
components of biologically significant sequences of DNA is the long-term
objective to which the proposed work would contribute. Such an knowledge would
bear directly on the detailed understanding of the dynamics of protein-DNA
interactions. The work proposed here would add to establishing a dynamics-
function paradigm. Specifically, it is proposed to: (a) perform far-infrared
measurements in order to determine how: sequence, length, and both physiological
and genotoxic counterions affect the long wavelength vibrations of
oligonucleotides, and (b) carry out a program to observe the effects of H-bond
melting on biologically relevant low frequency vibrations of various
oligonucleotides. Similar samples have been studied in the middle infrared and
far-infrared measurements have been made on some random polynucleotide
sequences. Resources for accomplishing these tasks are uniquely available for an
undergraduate institution. Senior thesis students will make measurements with
the on-campus research-level Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. They will
also purify large quantities of oligonucleotides produced at a neighboring
research laboratory.
