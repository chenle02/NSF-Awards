This California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) Noyce Teacher Scholars:
Building Upon a Learning Assistant Model project encourages highly qualified
mathematics and science students to pursue teaching careers through the
collaborative efforts of CSUSM School of Education and College of Science and
Mathematics. The program focuses on recruiting 38 CSUSM mathematics and science
undergraduates to the CSUSM credential program and building on efforts to
promote careers in teaching via an existing Learning Assistants Program (LAP).
The project includes three specific activities: a scholarship program, early
teaching experiences, and a STEM Summer Credential Program. There are existing
partnerships and funded activities, including efforts to expand the LAP to
nearby Palomar Community College, all of which support the recruiting efforts.
Local K-12 school districts and professional development organizations support
internships and induction for credential candidates and new teachers. The
project employs proven approaches and leverages existing activities and
partnerships, while building on model programs implemented at CSUSM by the PIs.
Understanding the ways the LAP model can serve as a fulcrum for enhanced STEM
teacher recruitment and how students come to decide whether to pursue a career
in teaching are valuable outcomes for the STEM teacher preparation knowledge
base.
