This Presidential Young Investigator award recognizes the outstanding
productivity and potential of Dr. Canny as a researcher and educator in computer
vision and robotics. While a graduate student, he published influential work in
edge detection and in collision avoidance for robot motion planning, solving
long-standing problems by new techniques. The latter work was recognized with an
ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award for 1987. Dr. Canny is continuing his excellent
work in robot motion planning and computational algebra and geometry, including
research in compliant motion planning and grasp planning. He is also supervising
four Ph.D. students and teaching graduate courses in robotics and computational
mathematics.
