This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry involves the development of a quantum dynamical theory for
describing condensed phase processes. This theory is based on integrals over
paths in classical phase space. A related aim of the project is the complete
analysis of a new model for quantum Brownian motion; this is of fundamental
importance since such motions of particles represent the simplest condensed
phase dissipative process. %%% Modern mathematical methods which unite classical
and quantum mechanical descriptions of the motions of particles are being used
in this study to develop new theories of chemical reaction rates in both liquids
and solids.
