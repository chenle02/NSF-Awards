A Beowulf cluster is a low-cost supercomputer based on inexpensive computer
nodes networked together. It provides a low-cost parallel processing environment
that can be used to enrich curricula in computer science and related fields at
the associate's and bachelor's levels. This project is developing a Beowulf-
Based Curriculum Enrichment Integrated Laboratory (B-CEIL) for enhancing
important concepts and principles in key courses of several degree programs:
B.S. in computer science, Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) in computer
information systems, and Bachelor of Applied Technology (B.A.T.).

The central component of the lab is a 24-node Beowulf cluster, built from an
existing inventory of 24 Pentium computers and three Alpha workstations, with
the addition of complementary equipment to simulate a Public Switched Network
(PSN).

Two levels of student lab projects are being developed in the B-CEIL
environment. The first level covers topics such as computer interfacing,
networking, clustering, task scheduling and optimization, and benchmarking. The
second level focuses on enhancing students' understanding of real-world PSN-
based networking and computationally intensive fields such as artificial neural
networks, image compression, image analysis, numerical analysis, and distributed
databases. The student lab projects are applicable to a number of courses in the
university's B.S., A.A.S., and B.A.T. programs, including Networking, Systems
Programming and Concurrent Processes, Computer Organization, Operating Systems,
Database Management Systems, Principles of Programming Languages, Numerical
Methods, Image Processing, and PC Hardware.
