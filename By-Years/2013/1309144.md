Investigating the influence of movement behavior on the spatial spread of
invasive species: A case study with the Burmese python in South
Florida&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Predicting the geographic spread of invasive
species is central to understanding and predicting their ecological impacts.
Numerous studies have acknowledged that an accounting of complex animal
behaviors in models of spatial spread give rise to more accurate predictions of
the dynamics of invasions. Individual-based models can incorporate behavioral
complexity in movement and provide a method for predicting the effects of
movement and dispersal strategies on spread dynamics. The Burmese python (Python
molurus bivittatus), a native of southern Asia, is established in South Florida
and is currently expanding its range northward through the Florida peninsula and
southward into the Florida Keys. The fellow will analyze empirical studies on
the movement capacity of Burmese pythons and use these data to parameterize
spatially-explicit, individual-based models to investigate the influence of
movement behavior on Burmese python spread dynamics. This study will provide
informative predictions of spread rate and invasion routes of pythons and
insight into the influence of movement and navigational capacity on species'
population dynamics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The fellow will develop expertise in
computer simulation modeling, mathematical modeling, and empirical data
analysis. This project will result in additions to a simulation model (SEARCH)
that is available for use by wildlife and natural resource managers. The
teaching plan includes training undergraduates in research, developing lectures
for entry-level undergraduate science classes, and designing and implementing an
upper-level undergraduate biology course in dynamic modeling. The fellow will
mentor underrepresented minority students through the Davidson Research
Initiative, TERRA Environmental Center, and the Ada Jenkins Center.
