Under this project, an Appletalk Local Area Network will be set up linking 16
Macintosh computers, a hard disk, and two Imagewriters. The resulting laboratory
will be used for the undergraduate teaching of programming algorithms. Besides
graphics, dynamic animation of data structures and algorithms, the timing and
measurement of algorithms, and the associated data analysis and graphing will be
used in the laboratory.
