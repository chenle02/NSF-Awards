The research to be carried out by Csaba G. Horvath, Yale University and Robert
Ohmacht, School of Medicine, Pecz, Hungary under the US-Hungary Joint Fund is
planned in the field of characterization and evaluation of liquid
chromatographic packings. Yale University has unique column packing facilities
and substantial knowledge of biotechnology, biochemical separation. The
Institute of Chemistry is well equipped for preparative chemical work but needs
urgent support in obtaining chemicals, parts and some supplements to their
equipment. This project in chromatography fulfills the program objective of
advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States
and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources
in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
