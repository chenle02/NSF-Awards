This is a continuation of a project that started while Prof. Arbib was at the
University of Massachusetts, and is being conducted in collaboration with Prof.
K. Ramamritham there. Substantial progress has been made on a distributed formal
model of robot computations, operating system and scheduling support for
realizing that model, and control-theoretic approaches to task-level robot
control. The work on the distributed model is centered at the University of
Southern California, while the other topics are pursued mainly at the University
of Massachusetts. The work centers on control of complex tasks involving
grasping and manipulation with a dexterous robot hand (the Salisbury hand).
