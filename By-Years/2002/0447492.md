Steroid hormones have dramatic and permanent effects on the developing brain.
This has been best studied in the case of testosterone and the development of
sex differences in brain function and adult behavior. However, the mammalian
brain is also exposed to progesterone, possibly from the mother, during
development and this hormone may have profound effects on brain regions linked
to cognition, such as the cortex. The goals of this project are to examine when
and where receptor proteins for progesterone are expressed in the cortex of
fetal and newborn rats, to determine when the brain might be most sensitive to
progesterone's effects. To better understand the function of progesterone on
cortical development this project will also examine what specific cell types in
the cortex are sensitive to progesterone during development and will assess how
the development of these cells is altered, in terms of their structure and
function, when the effects of progesterone are blocked during critical
developmental periods. Results from this project could dramatically change our
thinking about the role of steroid hormones on the development of cortex. This
project will facilitate the integration of research and education by allowing
undergraduates, particularly minority students, to participate in cutting edge
research to determine how steroid hormones remodel the brain.
