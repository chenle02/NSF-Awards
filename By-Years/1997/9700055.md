ABSTRACT Proposal Number CTS-9700055 Principle Investigator: Lucht This is a
grant for the purchase of an electron-bombarded charge-coupled device (EBCCD)
digital camera system. The EBCCD is a new type of array detector which uses a
back illuminated CCD (BCCD) chip as the anode of a vacuum photodiode. The gain
process is much less noisy than the gain process in multi-channel plates (MCPs),
the basis of the gain process for nearly all intensified CC cameras at present.
The EBCCD offers numerous advantages compared to MCP-intensified CCDS, including
better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), greater dynamic range, and much better image
quality. The EBCCD also has better sensitivity at low light levels. An important
feature for combustion applications is that the EBCCD can be gated by turning
the voltage between the photocathode and anode on and off with minimum gate
widths down to at least 100 nsec. Thus the EBCCD can be used for laser imaging
measurements in flames, whereas the unintensified BCCD cannot be used for such
measurements because of background flame luminosity.
