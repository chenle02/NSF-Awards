8818698 Greenspan This project is concerned with the study of the centrifugal
separation of mixtures. The effects of geometry, particle size variation,
collisional processes, flow stability and vorticity production will be examined.
Numerical simulations will also be completed, tested and employed. The
objectives of this project are (1) to achieve an understanding of fundamental
phenomena involving rotating two-phase fluids especially those amenable to
laboratory study and verification; and (2) to develop in the shortest possible
time of a solid and sound basis for technological application, exemplified by a
new separation/fractionation centrifuge.
