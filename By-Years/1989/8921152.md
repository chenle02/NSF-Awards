A comprehensive analysis will be carried out of the effects of human ecology
patterns in mitigating the casualties, injuries and economic losses caused by
tornadoes in the United States. The work will comprise: a) the description, in
time and characteristics, of several thousand events; b) the correlation of the
tornado events to population and several social characteristics of the impacted
populations; c) the assessment of the effect these social and physical
parameters have on all losses; and d) a test of the effectiveness of
preparedness through the analysis of the net effects of codes in mitigating the
impacts of tornadoes. The results of this work will be applicable to mitigation
measures in areas prone to tornado occurrences.
