0821152&lt;br/&gt;Sirbescu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant will support acquisition of a fluid
inclusion microthermometric stage and dedicated microscope and column upgrades
for an existing ion chromatograph in the Department of Geology at Central
Michigan University. The equipment will support research that relies on chemical
characterization of individual fluid and melt inclusions. Examples include
studies of: 1) paleoseawater chemistry and the search for chemical clues to
early microbial life as recorded in marine evaporites; 2) characterization of
ore deposit hosted fluid inclusions in order to elucidate the environmental
conditions leading to their origin; and 3) magmatic fluid inclusions in
pegmatite deposits to decipher their petrogenesis. The requested fluid and melt
inclusion analytical equipment will support student experiences with state-of-
the-art technologies for chemical characterization of mineral-hosted inclusions.
The PIs will continue and enhance a local underrepresented K-12 outreach program
in the Detroit metro area which focuses on forensic chemical analysis
techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
