9512186 Clark This proposal is an equipment request (Academic Research
Infrastructure ARI Submission) by Cornell representing the various universities
which comprise the NNUN (Cornell, Stanford, Penn State, UC Santa Barbara and
Howard). The NNUN is supported by three directorates (ENG, MPS, BIO) and
provides a pooling of specialized skills and instrumentation into distributed
user facilities (i.e. a network') to facilitate world-class research/education
across a wide range of user disciplines. The NNUN is a unique experiment to
provide researchers access to sophisticate equipment for the purpose of
innovative discovery in the area of nanostructure materials and devices. The
network provides leading edge research tools in the area of nanostructures to
explore the frontiers of knowledge' for an extended user community which would
here-to-fore have had little opportunity to participate in the process. The
proposal request support for the acquisition of major state-of-the-art equipment
{Electron Beam Lithography System, Support Equipment, Plasma Etch System,
Magnetron Sputtering System and Chemical Vapor Deposition CVD reactor
enhancements to improve research and eduction over the network for both
graduates and undergraduates, scientists and engineers, and promote partnerships
between academic researchers and private sector instrument developers.
