The positions for Godwana and Laurentia have been recently revised
paleomagnetically and are in broad agreement with avail- able biogeographic and
paleoclimatic constraints on Paleozoic paleogeography in the Atlantic realm.
However, a part of the land mass involved now occur as small allochthonous
terranes. The British Isles, south of the Iapetus suture, is one such terrane,
and present data is insufficient to track its movement history. This
collaborative proposal with workers at University of Florida (EAR88-16802) will
examine samples from this terrane using modern paleo-magnetic methods. Results
should help clarify how this terrane fits into the paleozoic movement picture of
the circum-Atlantic area and its original affinity.
