ABSTRACTS This grant provides equipment to enable the investigators to compare
the intonation of three tone languages: Mandarin, Yoruba, and Cantonese. In all
three languages, FO contours can be approximated with sparsely placed tonal
targets. Chinese tones typically have two targets, placed at the beginning and
the end of the rhyme. However, the first target of a rising tone is delayed to
the center of the rhyme. An innovative analysis of Yoruba tonal target placement
drastically simplifies Yoruba tonal phonology. Each tone in Yoruba has a single
target. H(igh) and L(ow) targets are aligned with the end of the rhyme, but
M(id) target is aligned with the beginning. This alignment automatically
accounts for the 'spreading' phenomenon traditionaly handled by a phonological
rule. Data on the scaling of tonal target confirms that global downtrend can be
viewed as the combination of many factors. Declination effect found in sequence
of like targets is strongest in L sequence and less in H sequence, so is final
lowering, which affects the final syllable. Catathesis (downstep) is restricted
to alternating L H sequence. The amount of lowering depends on the pitch level
of the L target. Mid tones, however, do not have strong catathesis effect.
