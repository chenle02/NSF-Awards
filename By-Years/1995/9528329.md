9528329 Mitchell MOREnet Expansion Phase 10 The University of Missouri-Columbia
requests support from NSF to connect the National College institutional network
to MOREnet. MOREnet, a midlevel network in the state of Missouri, will provide
operations management and information services and it will give the campus
access to the Internet, a collection of interoperable networks that connect most
research and education organizations in the United States. The campus needs the
Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout the
state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty, staff
students of the National College campus as well as the community in general.
