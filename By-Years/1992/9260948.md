This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop and assess a package consisting of sound and laser experiments to be
carried out by middle school students and a subsequent, more advanced
demonstration and a delivery system for sharing the materials and equipment in
the package. The materials and equipment will be developed so that not only can
illuminating scientific experiments be carried out, but that these can be done
using equipment and materials that lend themselves well to travel and sharing.
The short term rental system would enable middle schools to share these
materials and equipment at low cost, and it would be strengthened by onsite
training and support of teachers and a hotline.
