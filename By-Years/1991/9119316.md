The Sixth Biophysical Discussion: "Biophysics and Recombinant DNA" will foster
an examination of molecular genetic manipulations as they reveal physical and
structural properties of proteins. Basic difficulties will be confronted, such
as the structures of newly created species, the innovative use of mutagenesis to
test specific hypotheses, and modeling built on computation or computer graphics
as compared with the need for more accurate three-dimensional molecular
structures. Proposed topics for this Discussion include gap junctions;
acetylcholine receptors; ion-coupled transporters; bacterial chemotaxic
receptors; rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin, sodium, potassium, and calcium
channels; the bacterial flagellar "motor"; receptors and other membrane-spanning
or lipid-linked proteins; protein design and engineering; protein folding; and
protein/polypeptide insertion. The Organizers of the Discussion hope that
bringing together scientists working in these topical areas will raise important
new questions, clarify issues and problems and resolve some research
controversies.
