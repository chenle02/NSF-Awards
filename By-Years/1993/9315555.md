9315555 Novak This awards supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan Seminar on Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials, scheduled for May
15-19, 1994 in Pacific Grove, CA. The co- organizers are Professor Bruce Novak,
Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, and Professor
Hideki Sakurai, Department of Chemistry, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. The
United States and Japan are two leading countries in the field of inorganic-
organic hybrid materials. This seminar is a follow on to a 1991 U.S.-Japan
Seminar on Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers, which covered a wide range of
topics including polysilanes, polyphosphazenes, boron containing polymers,
polysilazanes, and phthalocyanine-containing polymers. The 1994 seminar will
focus on inorganic-organic hybrid materials since they are anticipated to play a
key role in advancing existing materials and in developing emerging
technologies. Potential applications for hybrid materials include optical,
ceramic and ceramic precursors, electronic materials, and biomedical polymers.
The seminar will emphasize preparation, characterization, and applications of
various polymers including inorganic-organic interpenetrating networks,
polyphosphazens, polysilozanes, polysilanes, polysilazanes, and polyborazines.
