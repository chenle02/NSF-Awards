Loyola University Chicago, in conjunction with Aspira of Illinois, offers a
bilingual (English/Spanish) six week, commuter Summer Science Camp integrating
computer science, engineering, and physics for rising seventh through ninth
grade "High ability/low opportunity" hispanic students. A subsequent academic
year follow-up program is also provided. The interdisciplinary activities begin
with students being introduced to basic computer architecture, after which they
assemble IBM-compatible microcomputers for subsequent use in the program.
Students are guided through experiments in three district labs: Digital
electronics, Engineering design and control, and computer science programming,
where computer concepts are introduced through programming in the Pascal
language. Summer sessions include career-oriented field trips to the facilities
of Argonne National Laboratories, Northwestern University, Chicago Research
&amp; Trade (a securities trading firm), and People's Gas. Students earn high
school course credit through the gifted program of the Chicago Public Schools.
