This project describes work in portable, high performance algorithm
development, with experimental system support for I/O intensive programs. For
these programs the data access time is the predominant component of the running
time. The work has three thrusts. (1) Multiprocessor Multi-disk File Systems. In
ongoing research, an experimental multiprocessor multi-disk file system has been
built, which runs on Intel Paragon. The file system was built to support a
prototype for a standard application programmer interface; the interface has
been designed to facilitate the production of portable programs. A major portion
of this project is to evaluate the efficiency of theoretically optimal data
access algorithms that have already been designed, and to validate the paradigms
used to design these algorithms for a two-level memory hierarchy. (2) Additional
Two-Level Memory Model Algorithms. LAPACK is a natural (and very appropriate)
package for upgrading to accommodate for out-of-core data sets. A portion of
these algorithms will be redesigned and implemented as prototypes for testing
and validation. Completed programs will be released for public use and
evaluation. (3) Three-level Memory Model. A significant research goal is to
develop a memory which captures critical performance and latency behavior
between main memory, disk systems, and tape systems, for many of the
contemporary computer architectures. Such a model is intended to support the
development of I/O- efficient algorithms.
