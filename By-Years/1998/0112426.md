This program produces a cadre of computer scientists with strong specializations
in information assurance and a commitment to federal service. Three cohorts of
students complete a two-year program that integrates intense information
assurance studies with research and outreach. Students also spend one summer as
interns in federal agencies. Upon completion of degrees at the end of two years
the students then enter the federal cyber service. The program features an
emphasis on collaborative research and outreach to the community. The program
components train students in information assurance theory and practice while
providing an environment that fosters teamwork, strengthens motivation, and
builds a sense of professionalism and commitment to service. &lt;br/&gt;
