In recent years, a growing dissatisfaction with biomedicine and rising rates of
mental illnesses have led patients to search for therapeutic alternatives.
Numerous news reports, best-selling books, television series, and scientific
journal articles have increasingly begun to suggest that plant-based healing
from Indigenous and folk practices offers a glimpse of hope for those whose
suffering has been unaddressed or neglected by biomedicine. Such portraits often
reinforce two conventional historical narratives: first, that these plant-based
therapies were heralded as medical miracles from the late 1950s to the late
1960s before several scientific and cultural controversies transformed them into
social pariahs, effectively ending scientific studies of psilocybin, lysergic
acid diethylamide, and ayahuasca; and second, that these Indigenous and folk
traditions are static, remaining unchanged over time and space. This doctoral
dissertation project, however, shows that these historical narratives are
incomplete. By focusing on ayahuasca, a plant-based concoction from the
northwestern Amazon, this research offers an important corrective to these
historical narratives and joins a growing body of research that emphasizes the
dynamic relationship between folk and Indigenous knowledge and
biomedicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project reconstructs the relationship
between scientists, local knowledge practitioners and healers, and ayahuasca
from the late nineteenth century to the late twentieth century. Drawing on
qualitative data gathered from archival research, oral histories and interviews,
museum collections, and published sources, this historical project responds to
two main research questions: 1) Why has ayahuasca sustained the attention of
generations of multidisciplinary and transnational scientists? Preliminary
archival research for this project suggests that scientists leveraged ayahuasca
to professionalize their disciplines and develop bioprospecting opportunities
with limited success. Folk and Indigenous perspectives are, however, often
absent from these sources leading to this projectâ€™s second major research
question: 2) What were the consequences of ayahuasca research, including humans
and non-humans? Findings from this project will contextualize the influence of
Indigenous and folk knowledge on modern science as well as the role of non-human
actors in knowledge production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
