9601734 Pan A mode-locked titanium-doped sapphire laser system will be acquired
by Fisk University. The pulsed laser system will serve as excitation source for
characterizing two basic type of laser and nonlinear optical materials: doped
glasses and II-VI compound semiconductors. Phenomena to be studied include
luminescence lifetimes of rare-earth ions in glasses, nonlinear optical indexes
of quantum-dot glasses, and the nonlinear optical response of and optical
limiting in doped glasses and II-VI semiconductors. The phenomena to be studied
are relevant to the utilization of the materials in nonlinear optical devices.
The research program involves undergraduate and masterOs degree students. %%%
The proposed laser system is a major and essential equipment for the research on
nonlinear optical materials at Fisk University. The outcome of such research has
important potential applications to all optical switching and to high data rate
communications. The instrumentation will strengthen and complement the existing
capabilities for characterization of optical and electronic materials. The
UniversityOs teaching program will be enhanced since underrepresented minority
students will gain experience in using lasers and various optical techniques.
