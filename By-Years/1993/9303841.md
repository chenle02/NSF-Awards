9303841 Han This is an examination of an alternative approach to the extraction
of precious metals from refractory ores; the approach is intended to pose a much
lesser threat to environmental quality than the presently predominant cyanide
leaching process. The dissolution mechanism of gold in ammoniacal solution at
elevated temperature and pressure is studied. Unique features of the approach
include use of relatively high temperature and pressure in an autoclave, use of
oxygen to regenerate the copper or cobalt oxidant, and measurement of
electrochemical potentials at high temperature in an autoclave modified for this
purpose. The oxidation of sulfide in ammoniacal solution is also investigated.
If fully successful, this effort should result in a process that would pose a
much lesser environmental problem than current technology, and would also permit
extraction of gold (and maybe silver) from ores presently considered refractory.
