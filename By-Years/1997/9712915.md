ABSTRACT EEC-9712915 CHAUDHURY Factors influencing polyelectrolyte are greater
and more complex than those in organic solvents. Quantitative comparison of
theory to experiment, and therefore a comprehensive understanding of these
factors, is lacking. Only a fraction studies conducted with polyelectrolytes
used samples with sufficient monodisperse molecular weight distribution to
quantitatively isolate the relevant phenomena. This collaboration (TIE) project
utilizes the expertise of two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers
to address this problem. Researchers at the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Centers for Coatings Research at Eastern Michigan University will
synthesize three classes of polymers to address the study. Researchers at the
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Polymer Interfaces at Lehigh
University will perform fundamental studies to build a ground-up understanding
of the absorption behavior of these polymers.
