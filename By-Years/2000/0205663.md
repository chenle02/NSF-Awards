EIA-0205663 University of Colorado Charbel Farhat ITR: A Data Driven Environment
for&lt;br/&gt;Multiphysics Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this project is to enable an efficient prediction capability for the response of
multiscale interdisciplinary continuous interacting systems. This will be done
by an effective union of information technologies, coupled multiphysics
sciences, and automated massive experimentation for data gathering to steer
adaptive modeling of the observed systemic behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
