Special Project: 7th Annual MU-SPIN Conference (1996) and Supplemental Support
for on-campus Regional Training Workshop This interagency transfer purpose is to
partially support a large conference and supplemental smaller workshops on high
performance computing and communications and infrastructure development for
minority institutions. NASA, through its National Space Science Data Center, has
developed a program called the Minority University Space Interdisciplinary
Network (MU-Spin). The program constitutes a major networking and education
initiative for minority institutions, and other universities with large minority
student enrollments. Connecting these institutions with the NASA Science
Network, and promoting the activities such connections provide serve as primary
goal of the program.
