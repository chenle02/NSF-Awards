ABSTRACT CTS-9634117 A chromatographic technique, which has proven to be a fast
and reliable method for determining solid solubilities in supercritical fluids
(SCFs), will be applied to pharmacological solids. This investigation intends to
first measure solid solubilities of a variety of pharmacological solids and
second to propose mathematical models describing their phase-equilibrium
behavior in a varietv of supercritical fluids. The phase-equilibrium behavior
obtained in this investigation will help design effective specialty separation
solutions for pharmaceutical applications. In addition, this investigation will
further the understanding of phase equilibria involving complex involatile
substances in supercritical fluids. This knowledge will help in the development
of more sophisticated and comprehensive models describing phase equilibria with
SCFS.
