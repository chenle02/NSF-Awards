Bastain Braams of the Courant Institute at NYU and Joel Bowman of Emory
University are supported by the Chemistry Division through the Information
Technology Research program in a collaborative effort between theoretical
chemistry and mathematics. They will develop and apply dynamic, high-dimensional
interpolation and approximation methods, combined with a sparse grid dimension
reduction approach, to first-principles molecular dynamics calculations.
Applications guiding the project come from chemical kinetics and reaction
dynamics, and especially combustion. The methods and codes under development
will have broad applicability in quantum chemistry and in high-dimensional
function fitting and optimization.

This project addresses a challenging and multi-faceted problem in scientifc
computing, and combines research and research training in numerical analysis and
computational chemistry. The computer codes developed herein will be useful to
other areas of computational science, and will be written and documented for
wide dissemination.
