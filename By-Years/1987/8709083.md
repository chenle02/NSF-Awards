Narrative: Cyclosporine is recognized as a wonder drug (an immunosuppressant)
which has been used effectively to prevent foreign tissue rejection in
conjunction with human organ transplants. In general, cyclosporine has been
viewed as an important tool in the workings of the human immune response and
possibly as a prototype of a new category of immuno pharmaceuticals. This
investigation addresses the practical need for the economic production of this
life-saving drug by increasing our understanding and control of the formation of
cyclosporine via the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum fermentation. The knowledge
generated from the proposed work will not be product-specific, but will seek to
complement currently active studies in the broad areas of the process
engineering and the physiology of secondary metabolite production, using this
model as a realistic, commercially important system.
