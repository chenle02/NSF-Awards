The grant provides partial funding for the Sixth International Conference on
Molecular Beam Epitaxy, being held on the campus of the University of
California, San Diego, August 26-31, 1990. The scope of the conference covers
the entire spectrum of molecular beam epitaxy, for example, growth of materials,
processing and characterization, growth physics, device physics, and properties
and structure of thin films. The funds will be used to provide partial support
for participation by graduate students and young scientists. The proceedings of
the conference will be published in the Journal of Crystal Growth.
