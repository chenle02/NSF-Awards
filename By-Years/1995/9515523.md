INT 9515523 Sibeck This U.S.-Czech research project between Dr. David Sibeck of
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and Dr. Jana Safrankova
of Charles University, Prague, will examine the processes by which solar wind
mass, energy, and momentum flow through the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The
researchers intend to exchange data sets and correlate studies using
simultaneous solar wind, magnetosheath, magnetospheric, and ionospheric
observations taken from the Interball satellite, other space craft, and the
ground. Overall results, which will be made available over the Internet, are
expected to contribute to our understanding of: 1) the manner by which processes
within the foreshock modify solar wind features; 2) the characteristics and
causes of magnetopause motion; and 3) the means by which variations in solar
wind parameters trigger magnetospheric substorms. This joint project in upper
atmospheric research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence. ??
