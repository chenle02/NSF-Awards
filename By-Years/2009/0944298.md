The iron-oxygen (above 100GPa) and iron-carbon binary systems will be explored
to determine phase stability and eutectic melting temperatures as a function of
pressure. Partial melting, unit cell volumes and other crystallographic
information are to be determined using synchrotron x-ray diffraction while the
samples are compressed and laser-heated in a diamond anvil cell. Crystal
structure is naturally monitored with x-ray diffraction, so subsolidus phase
transitions will also be detected and identified during the course of the
equation of state measurements. The experimental methodology for these
experiments has been proven successful at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne
National Laboratory. The data to be collected are critical not only to
understand the temperatures in the Earth's core, but also for developing models
of chemical evolution of the Earth's core. The phase relations in these systems
and temperatures within the Earth's core are critical for understanding the
generation of the magnetic field throughout the history of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Results from the proposed study will be disseminated primarily
through publication in the scientific literature, by participation at scientific
conferences, and when warranted, through wider-reaching news outlets. Additional
benefits of the proposed research include the continued development and
refinement of experimental high-pressure, high-temperature techniques; continued
exposure of university researchers, including student participants, to the
facilities and talent at government-funded multi-user sites; and the training of
students in the wide range of experimental techniques and scientific protocols
associated with performing the proposed work.
