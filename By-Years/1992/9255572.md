Microscale techniques can be applied to such important areas as organometallic
chemistry and bioinorganic synthesis. This offers many advantages to the
traditional offerings in these fields, most notably reductions in the quantities
of chemicals used, safety hazards, time required to perform an experiment, and
amount of waste produced. Air quality is sharply improved. The workshops on
microscale offer an opportunity in the ongoing effort at the revitalization of
the critical field of inorganic chemistry laboratory at the undergraduate level.
