The Partnerships in Field Research and Curriculum Enhancement project is
designed to stimulate renewed interest in and improve the teaching of science at
the precollege level by providing opportunities for K-12 teachers to join
University of California (UC) scientists on field research projects in the
natural and social sciences. Workshops conducted before the field activities
will provide an overview of each of the disciplines involved, major developments
and current directions. Teacher participants will then join U.C. field teams for
two to four week periods in the summer on research projects in the United States
and abroad. They will live with the scientific team at the field site, be
instructed in basic field methods, and take an active part in data collection
and analysis. After returning from the field, teachers will develop classroom
curriculum materials based on their field activities. A series of academic-year
workshops led by university scientists and curriculum specialists will provide
assistance in curriculum development. Curriculum units developed by the teachers
will be disseminated to interested educators through a teacher Research Resource
Library. The program is planned to operate over a 3 year period. Approximately
100 teachers will participate. The program's impact will be extended through
teacher presentations of field research experiences and dissemination of the
curriculum materials. This project allows the Teacher Enhancement Program the
opportunity of placing teachers (K-12) in research situations. Subsequently the
participants will plan teaching strategies to incorporate their research
experience into classroom activities. Since many teachers have not been involved
in research activities of any type, this type of program should result in a
substantial change in doing science in the classroom.
