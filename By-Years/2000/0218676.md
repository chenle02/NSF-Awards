EIA 0218767 Jerome Pine California Institute of Technology Title: A Neurochip
for Studying Neural Networks in Vitro&lt;br/&gt; The mammalian central nervous
system has enormous capabilities for information processing; analysis; and
generation of appropriate outputs for a huge variety of task. It far surpasses
current best efforts with man-made hardware and software. Learning in detail
about how real neural networks function holds the promise of guiding efforts to
improve man-made systems, and perhaps showing the way to revolutionary rather
than evolutionary improvements. Yet doing this is a daunting task for in vivo
systems, where huge numbers of neurons operate cooperatively, and observation of
their individual behaviors in full detail is far beyond the capabilities of
current technology. Understanding the behavior of small neural networks in vitro
is a potentially valuable start, and it is proposed here to create a silicon-
based system, called a "Neurochip", with unique capabilities for observing the
behavior of every neuron of a small network in detail. Each neuron will be in an
enclosure" which incorporates an intracellular electrode for recording and
stimulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental system is being constructed
mainly from commercial components. The neurochip itself is being fabricated
using novel methods, but ones, which can be duplicated, in any serious
fabrication laboratory. The low temperature fabrication process for the
neurochip can be done on a silicon wafer, which incorporates CMOS circuitry, so
an on-board computer could be made part of the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
