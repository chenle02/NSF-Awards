Equipment is being purchased to support a course in archaeological field
research methods. In this class, students participate in excavations to recover
information from an eroding prehistoric campsite located on Armand Bayou in
Houston TX. Student completing the course demonstrate much improved
understanding of scientific research procedures and an enhanced understanding of
prehistoric societies and ecology. The equipment greatly improves the resources
for teaching essential archaeological techniques including 1. surveying
equipment for teaching site mapping, 2. soil flotation equipment for teaching
the recovery of information about floral, faunal, and other dietary or
environmental remains, 3. a camera and accessories for teaching artifact
documentation and production of publishable records of artifacts, and 4.
computer equipment for teaching data management and quantitative analytical
techniques. The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.
