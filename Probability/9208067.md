Various problems of asymptotic approximation will be studied. A resolution of
the St. Petersburg paradox will be proposed. The resolution will be achieved
through an understanding of the nature of the distribution of the cumulative
gain in a sequence of games and their lightly trimmed variants, when a fixed
number of the largest gains are withheld from the gambler. Several associated
general problems concerning domains of partial attraction and infinitely
divisible distributions and their trimmed versions will also be studied. This
research will attempt to find a resolution to the St. Petersburg paradox, a
problem which was first studied in the early eighteenth century. The paradox
involves determining an appropriate fair price for playing a game of chance.
