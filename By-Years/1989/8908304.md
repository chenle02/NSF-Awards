Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The Department of Chemistry at
the University of Missouri, Columbia, will use this award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program to help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas
of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) New ozonide chemistry 2) Relationship between kestoses and the
biosynthesis of plant fructans 3) Nitrosamine chemistry 4) Late transition metal
mu-oxo and mu-imido complexes 5) Chemical and biosynthetic studies of Fusarium
6) NMR studies of slow molecular motions in molecular aggregates and
macromolecules.
