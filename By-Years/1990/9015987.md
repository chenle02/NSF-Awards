The proposed research makes a connection between micromechanical modeling of
particulate flow, supercomputer simulation techniques of governing equations,
and experimental verification for fluidized bed technology. The aim is to
develop a predictive tool flow patterns and concentration distributions in
fluidized beds, including for three-phase flow and circulating fluidized beds.
The kinetics theory of granular flow will be applied. Time average and transient
solids distributions will be measured and compared to the calculated patterns to
guide development of the models. The proposed numerical simulations in fluidized
beds will improve our understanding for design purposes, scale-up, control in
operation, and anticipation of possible problems such as erosion of internal
structures or inadequate gas-solid contracting.
