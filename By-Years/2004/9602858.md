Adult humans evidence a left brain hemisphere bias for processing the formal
properties of language (e.g., semantics) and a right hemisphere bias for
processing the emotional content of language (e.g., intonation, affect). There
is also evidence of hemispheric biases in processing facial expressions,
contingent upon whether the emotion is positive or negative. The evolutionary
origins of these asymmetries remain unclear. This proposal has been designed to
address this gap in our understanding, conducting research on a population of
semi-free-ranging rhesus macaques. Part one explores asymmetry in facial
expression and tests the hypothesis that negative/withdrawal emotions are
associated with a right brain hemisphere/left side of the face bias, whereas
positive/approach emotions are associated with left hemisphere/right side of the
face biases. Possible developmental changes in this pattern of expression will
be assessed by recording from infants and adults. Part two studies perception of
vocalizations, using playback experiments to assess whether rhesus monkeys
evidence a left hemisphere bias/right ear bias. Natural and manipulated calls
will be used. Part three examines whether rhesus monkeys show a left
hemisphere/right side of the face bias during vocal production, as occurs in
human adults while speaking.
