A grant has been awarded to the Research and Collections Section of the North
Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences (NCSM). Under the direction of Dr.
Stephen D. Busack, the museum will augment the computer-based catalogue for its
approximately 1.5 million fish and aquatic invertebrates. Most components of
NCSM's collections represent recent consolidation of several regional
collections from North Carolina and other states, and these components continue
to grow significantly each year. NCSM collections are, therefore, a unique
resource for documenting regional biodiversity. The completed catalogue will
enable rapid and cost-effective collection management operations, greater depth
of service to the scientific and regulatory communities, and international
sharing of the Museum's data through the worldwide web. In the rapidly
developing Southeast, documentation, timely and accurate reporting of the extent
and distribution of biodiversity is essential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Museum's
collections focus on the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States and
adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Computerized data for fishes currently represent 9415
lots (117,195 specimens). About 40,612 additional lots are only ledger cataloged
and 86,000 lots are not cataloged. While 27,000 lots of aquatic invertebrates
are computerized, approximately 8800 lots remain in backlog. NCSM Fish and
Aquatic Invertebrates collections management staff will verify and upgrade
specimen identifications and collection data , add GIS information, and provide
the data to computer entry personnel. Data will first be entered into a
temporary database and proofed by curatorial staff, and later will be
transferred to the permanent database. The NCSM's relational database will
provide these GIS-linked data to resource managers and scientists in a timely
manner, greatly enhancing the utility and frequency of use of these data for
research, environmental management, and education.&lt;br/&gt;
