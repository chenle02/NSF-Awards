9412585 Shimp Abstract The ability to rapidly shift attention is an essential
aspect of adaptive behavior. Different types of attentional shifts are well
known in humans. One type involves shifting attention between different levels
of the environment. For example, one can look at a landscape and see the forest
or see the trees. Another type involves shifting attention between novel and
familiar stimuli. Dr. Shimp is working to develop innovative new procedures for
the study of these attentional phenomena in animals. These new procedures will
lead to new information about the mechanisms underlying attentional shifts and
will allow techniques from behavioral neuroscience to be brought to bear on
their biological bases.
