This proposal continues a long term study of the structure and specificity of
antibodies to a homopolymer of glucose alpha(1-6) dextran and its
oligosaccharides, and on blood group A, B and H substances. It characterizes
their primary and higher order structures by a variety of techniques. The
cavity-and groove-type sites were defined, the former specific for terminal non-
reducing alpha(1-6) linked glucoses plus 3 or 4 additional residues, and the
latter reacting with internal chains of up to six or seven glucoses not
including the non-reducing end. Anti-idiotypic sera and monoclonal antibodies
recognizing either groove-or cavity-type sites have been obtained. Model-
building studies show that two cavity-type sites vary in size. The hybridoma
repertoire of anti-alpha(1-6) dextrans is being compared with E. coli expressed
Fab repertoire. The role of Vl-CDR3 and J(kappa) on antigen binding, idiotype
expression and combining sites structure of the groove-type anti-alpha(1-6)
dextrans with V(kappa)-Oxl light chain is being studied by the generation of
recombinant Fab and computer modelling. %%% The research will concentrate on the
following aspects of monoclonal antibodies to .(1-->6) dextrans: a) Mapping the
structures of the combining sites by immunochemical methods and studies of
anti-.(1-->6) dextrans with cavity and groove type antibody combining sites and
their idiotypic specificities; b) Providing quantities of the various
characterized anti-.(1-->6) dextrans to various crystallographic laboratories
for crystallization and high resolution x-ray diffraction studies. c)
Continuation of replacement studies of a cloned antibody (amino acid residues 31
to 35) by glycines that have shown an extraordinary effect in greatly reducing
anti .(1-->6) dextran reactivity and substantial restoration of 80% of the
original anti .(1-->6) dextran specificity by replacing glycine 32 and 33 by
tyrosine and tryptophan. d) Studying the effects of similar substitutions in
other interaction domains of the antibody.
