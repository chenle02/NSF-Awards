This project will continue work on the development of methods for the formation
of C-C bonds employing peptide-based catalysts. The focus of the proposal is on
Lewis base catalysts predicated on the incorporation of nucleophiles into low-
molecular weight peptides. The catalysts are to be tested in a range of
enantioselective and diastereoselective complexity-generating processes. Studies
to elucidate the mechanistic basis of stereochemical control are another
emphasis of the project. Combinatorial screening of peptide-based catalyst
libraries with hypothesis-driven catalyst selection techniques will also be
employed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Scott J. Miller of the
Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Professor Miller's research efforts
revolve around the development of efficient catalysts for complex bond-forming
reactions. This chemistry will contribute environmentally benign methods to the
field of chemical synthesis. Peptide-based catalysts also present analogies to
enzymes, creating an opportunity to probe fundamental aspects of biologically
relevant catalysts. Successful development of the methodology will have an
impact on the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, as well as provide
rigorous training for students in synthetic and physical organic chemistry.
