EIA-0116050&lt;br/&gt;Michael A. McRobbie&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University -
Bloomington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI: Creation of the AVIDD Data Facility: a
Distributed Facility for Managing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Instrument-Driven
Data &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for equipment acquisition under
the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student
training across a broad range of instrument-driven data-intensive science areas.
The proposed distributed facility for managing, analyzing, and visualizing
instrument-driven data would address the data life cycle consisting of data
capture and remote data reduction; high speed data transfer; real time data
analysis and processing; data storage; data retreival; data analysis and
postprocessing; data visualization; and the use of remote data stores. Among the
research projects enhanced and enabled by the proposed facility are both
computer science and applications area projects, for example work on end-to-end
real time data management for remote control and use of beam-line systems by
X-ray crystallographers&lt;br/&gt;
