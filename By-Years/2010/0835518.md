This award provides support for the second in a planned series of regional
student conferences in applied mathematics. The conference, held at the
University of Florida on 5-7 March 2009, immediately precedes the "100th
Anniversary Ulam Conference" beginning on 7 March 2009 at the same location.
This conference encourages and financially supports participation by students
and recent Ph.D. recipients. Members of groups underrepresented in mathematics
are especially encouraged to apply for support.

The meeting includes many student research talks and poster presentations, as
well as plenary lectures, on topics of current research interest, including
computational methods and optimization, modeling in biomathematics, and medical
imaging. The conference brings together workers in a variety of different
research areas, with emphasis on providing opportunities for new researchers to
present their work and to develop research contacts and collaborative networks.
