9531219 Withers This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
will develop a method for production of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) silicon
carbide (SiC) fibers tow, free of agglomeration or bridging between fibers.
Previous attempts to utilize CVD, which yields fibers with the requisite
mechanical properties, have not successfully produced SiC fiber tow on graphite
substrates without these problems. Phase I demonstrated spreading of the
graphite fiber tow substrate without agglomeration or bridging but with
retention of high-temperature strength and at a projected cost one order of
magnitude less than current cost. Phase II will focus on continuous, trouble-
free operation and a thorough understanding of processing variables. Multiple-
pound quantities of SiC fiber tow are expected and will be used in economic
evaluation of the production process. Commercial applications are expected in
composites for energy, conversion, e.g., heat exchangers, hot gas filters,
porous and tubular radiant burners, reformers waste incineration, in fusion
reactor components, in gas turbine and internal combustion engine components, in
aerospace structures, in various defense system components, and in sports
equipment.
