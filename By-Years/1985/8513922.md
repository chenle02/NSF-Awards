Research will investigate flow through the coronary blood vessels. This will be
achieved by development and application of a computer model of coronary
circulation and by experiments to be carried out in vivo or in simulation. The
researchers will also investigate the responses of cultured coronary endothelial
cells to fluid-imposed shear stress and pressure. The problem which this
research addresses, (coronary artery disease) is a major cause of death and
disability. The data which will come from this research should have significant
impact on health care delivery.
