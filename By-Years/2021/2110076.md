The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a micro-logistics solution to address multi-billion-dollar
challenges facing supply chains due to coarse item-level visibility and
tracking. The complexity of todayâ€™s supply chain makes it difficult to optimize
micro-logistics processes, such as quality control, inventory tracking, re-
stocking, traceability, deadline projections, and indoor transport. The
commercialization of a micro-logistics Internet of Things (IoT) may bridge the
physical with the digital world, providing significant visibility and enhanced
analytics, potentially saving billions of dollars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project is based on the development of technology for high-precision,
robust, and real-time positioning. The proposed technology may transform
billions of already-deployed, batteryless Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFIDs)
tags into powerful micro-location sensors. The proposed technology relies on a
wireless excitation protocol combined with innovations in signal processing,
super-resolution algorithms, and sensor network architecture. It has been tested
in practical real-world environments, demonstrating the ability to achieve
centimeter-scale positioning in challenging indoor
environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
