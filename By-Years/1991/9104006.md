The rapid progress of advancements in the discipline of heat transfer and the
importance of past accomplishments have heightened expectations from this
discipline. Yet many of the most important areas for thermal science research
still lie ahead. With expectations high and the potential for impact
significant, it is imperative that thermal science practitioners and researchers
plan the future path and needed milestones for this discipline. The impact on
future technology and understanding of important phenomena need to be critically
evaluated and the significant issues delineated. Basic understanding and
technological impact are key. This project is a combined program/workshop to
assess the role of the thermal sciences related to emerging technologies and to
identify critical phenomena which need further research. The Program is directed
at the development of a strategic plan aimed at enhancing the economic
competitiveness of the United States in the world marketplace and at ensuring
that appropriate fundamental research is carried out in the thermal sciences.
