Long Beach Unified School District seeks National Science Foundation support
for a project that will augment existing curriculum in a 4-year high school
which focuses on the study of science, mathematics, and technology. The overall
thrust of the project is providing the students with workplace experiences that
are connected to principles they learn in the classroom. Among the major
activities for which support is sought are: (1) development of a "pre-
professional" curriculum to integrate study of workplace applications into
regular 9th grade classroom instruction; (2) mentor program for 9th and 10th
grade students; and (3) internships and work experiences for 11th and 12th grade
students. The partnership will bear 79% of the anticipated project costs.
