This proposal requests funds to purchase a versatile state-of- the-art
photomicroscope unit for the communal use of twelve investigators in the
Department of Molecular Biology. The Department is new but has already obtained
international prominence in the areas of x-ray crystallography NMR spectroscopy,
computer graphics, and organic chemistry. The photomicroscope is critical for
the conduct of research on: gap junction communication, genetic analysis of
chlamydomonas motility, regulation of expression of lens fibre junctions,
genetic analysis of cell division in yeast, specific gene expression in
mammalian hippocampus, expression of hemin p. 70 in bone marrow cells and other
tissues, survival of salmonella in macrophages, developmentally regulated
expression of trypanosoma cruizi surface proteins, color variation in serratia
marescens, genetic control of morphogenesis in dictyostelium discoidium and
molecular studies of entamoeba histolytica, characterization of a cytoskeletal
protein in the m-line of muscle, and importance of fluorescence microscopy for
antineoplastic selectivity amplification. Additionally the photomicroscope will
enable the department to expand its activities into new areas such as
fluorescence signals, low-light intensification or enhancement procedures, and
time-lapse video analysis for embryonic development studies.
