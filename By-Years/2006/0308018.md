Mobile, location-aware devices raise the potential for fundamentally new
information services. However, this potential has not been realized. This is due
in part to the absence of a firm conceptual and empirical foundation. This
proposal explores one basis for constructing the requisite foundation: socially
defined places. How places (such as schools, offices, or theaters) shape
behavior has been explored in environmental psychology and architecture, but the
notion of 'place' has not been operationalized for use in interactive systems.
This project takes on that task. The key hypotheses are that (a) people's
information and communication needs are relative to place types, and (b) making
'place' a first-class computational object will increase the effectiveness and
usability of location-based systems. This project will test the hypotheses
through a combination of ethnographic studies, development of novel algorithms
and interfaces, and laboratory and field studies, leading to the following
results: 1) additional empirical knowledge about the concept of place and its
role in organizing people's activities; 2) a conceptual framework and guidelines
useful to designers of location-based systems; 3) a general infrastructure for
place-centered community information sharing systems; and 4) field studies and
laboratory evaluations that demonstrate the utility and acceptability of such
systems.
