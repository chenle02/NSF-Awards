Chief objectives of this international workshop are: sharing of latest research
results on product sound quality, noise engineering, and human factors and
psychoacoustics; understanding industry's current practices and future needs;
defining joint research projects that will improve understanding of how people
perceive and are affected by the complex sounds produced by machinery; and
exploring mechanisms by which that understanding can be put to good use by
practicing engineers. The forum will provide a unique opportunity for a closer
interaction between leading U.S. academics and industry parctitioners and
experts from Western Europe, Japan and Korea. The 3-day symposium activities
will be supplemented with a 2-day visit to several industry facilities including
two new automaotive company Noise-Vibration-Harshness (NVH) facitities which are
engage in extensive activities in sound quality. Summary reports on the PSQ '01
workshop based on both workshop proceedings and those projects sparked by the
workshop will be presented at meetings of the Acoustical Society and the
Institute of Noise Control Engineering. This symposium intends to identify
common international interests and priorities in the area of noise and product
sound quality and focus on important relevant scientific issues
