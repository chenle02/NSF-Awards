Support is provided for a planning conference on Manufacturing Research: An
International Perspective, to identify cooperative efforts in manufacturing
research to be undertaken jointly between the U.S. and Western Europe. Efforts
to be identified include cooperation in developing the research-base required
for manufacturing; in improving understanding of the economics of advanced
automation; and in education and training programs. Major reasons that support
is provided for cooperation in this area are: adoption of manufacturing
technologies by U.S. industry is a matter of current national concern;
manufacturing research is central to the goal to insure that the U.S. stays at
the leading edge of engineering research; and in many areas of manufacturing
research, Western European institutions are "ahead" and can contribute
significantly to the U.S. efforts.
