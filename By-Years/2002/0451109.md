John Ross of Stanford University is supported by an award from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry program for research involving the theoretical
determination of complex reaction mechanisms from experimental data and a number
of related topics. One of these additional topics involves developing a theory
for the transition from deterministic kinetics to stochastic kinetics, important
in a variety of settings including the molecularly crowded world of the cell.
Another involves the analysis of single molecule kinetics and the exploration of
a new "chemical indetermination principle" which Ross suggests would be similar
to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. A third project
involves the development of pulse sequences to extract mechanistic information
from complex reaction networks and is being done in collaboration with three
experimental groups, two of them at Stanford, the third at West Virginia
University. The work is expected to have a broad impact on the fields of
genomics and metabolomics through the development of new methods to extract
information from complex reaction environments such as the cell. Ross is
planning to disseminate the results of this and prior NSF-supported research
through the publication of a textbook, co-authored with two former students and
entitled "On the Determination of Reaction Mechanisms."
