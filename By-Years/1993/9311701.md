9311701 Willows The Friday Harbor (FHL) is the marine biological facility of
the University of Washington. It offers biological resources and scientific
facilities in support of the work of marine scientists from national and
international institutions. FHL is located in the San Juan Islands in the State
of Washington at the junction between Puget Sound, Juan de Fuca Strait and
Georgia Strait where an unusual diversity and richness of marine life occurs.
Topics of research range from cell biology to community ecology and engage
zoologists, fisheries biologists, Oceanographers, botanists, paleobiolgists, and
researchers from various biomedical fields. Some organisms are studied because
of their ecological importance, others because they are useful models for the
study of ecological, developmental, or physiological processes. At FHL, a high
priority is placed upon providing a suitable environment (instrumentation, field
biological resources, logistical support) for research that requires marine
organisms. Although over 90% of the FHL operating budget comes from State of
Washington, over 65% of the scientific people whose work is supported by FHL are
from institutions outside the State of Washington. The University of Washington
has recently completed an extensive review of physical facilities, and academic
programs of the FHL. Recommendations include extensive replacement and
modernization of facilities over 10 years. The University has committed
significant resources to the first component of this modernization program. This
project will provide for replacement of one microscope, as a part of that
renewal. ***
