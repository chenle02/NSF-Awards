9628606 Sideris The Department of Mathematics at the University of California,
Santa Barbara will purchase a Sun SPARC 20 workstation server, 5 Sun SPARC 5
workstations, and hardware for the creation of a fiber optic network link which
will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
computations of electron microstructures, computations of attractors of
nonlinear wave equations, electromagnetic calculation for physical design of
mixed signal modules, virtual Betti numbers and similarity interval exchange
maps, and numerical simulation of rotationally symmetric three-dimensional ideal
fluids.
