9706801 Byrne The role of normal faulting in the exhumation of high-grade
metamorphic rocks in convergent orogens is an important unsolved problem. Taiwan
provides a valuable opportunity to study the relation between contraction and
extension and the processes of tectonic exhumation because the orogenic belt is
active, and because the obliquity of the collision also results in a time-space
equivalence that permits different veins of the orogenic belt as it evolves.
This project involves documentation of the distribution of contractional and
extensional structures in southernmost Taiwan and testing of several proposed
models. Results will be applicable to regional-scale tectonics of Taiwan and to
other convergent margins.
