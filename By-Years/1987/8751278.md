This seminar series is a continuation of the National Science Foundation and
National Bureau of Standards outreach program for technology in science and
mathematics for faculty of minority institutions. Two, four-day, seminars will
be held (each seminar will consist of two days at NSF and two days at NSB). The
meetings will provide an opportunity for NSF of acquaint approximately 60
faculty members from 30-40 minority institutions with relevant NSF programs and
NSF in general. It also provides an opportunity for NSF program officers to meet
key people at minority institutions who can facilitate the identification of
potential reviewers and who can identify minority researchers and encourage
their participation in NSF programs. The strengths of the proposal are that (1)
evaluations of prior meetings have judged them useful and the evaluation of the
recent joint seminar found that the opportunity to learn about NSF programs was
judged very important to the faculty who attended, (2) joint sponsorship will
significantly reduce the costs for both sponsoring agencies, (3) this form of
activity moves beyond passive approaches of individual programs and acts as a
catalyst for personnel at both the Foundation and the participating
institutions.
