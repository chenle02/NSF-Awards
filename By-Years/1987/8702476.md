Calcium entry through voltage.dependent calcium channels into arterial smooth
muscle cells regulates contraction and, therefore, blood vessel diameter, and
blood flow. The overall goal of this research is to characterize the role that
calcium entry through calcium channels plays in the regulation of contraction of
smooth muscle cells in arteries. Calcium entry will be characterized by
examining the physiological and pharmacological regulation of single calcium
channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers and in membrane patches from
single smooth muscle cells isolated from cerebral (basilar) arteries. The
results of this research will advance our understanding of vascular smooth
muscle and calcium channel function.
