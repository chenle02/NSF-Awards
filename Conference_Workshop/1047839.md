This grant will enable young mathematicians -- graduate students, post-doctoral
candidates, and junior faculty members -- to attend and participate in satellite
conferences held in conjunction with the Mittag-Leffler Institute's 2011 program
``Algebraic geometry with a view towards applications." The satellite
conferences will take place in Oslo, Norway and Stockholm, Sweden, and the
organization and venues will permit ample time for young researchers to meet,
interact, and share mathematical ideas in an international setting. The focus of
the conferences include applications of algebraic geometry in the sciences,
solving polynomial equations, and algorithm development.

Although algebraic geometry has traditionally been considered a core area of
pure mathematics, in recent years its techniques have been utilized to advance
methods in applied mathematics. For example, algebraic geometric techniques have
been used to prove identifiability results for parameters in statistical models
which are parameterized by polynomials. In other areas also -- biology, coding
theory, cryptology, quantum computing, machine learning, and optimization for
example -- valuable contributions have been made recently by researchers
employing methods from algebraic geometry.
