This project is part of the NSF/USGS initiative within the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) to investigate the effects of the Loma Prieta
earthquake of 17 October 1989. This research program involves collaborative
funding between the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Geological Survey.
It utilizes a truck-mounted 20 ton electronic cone penetration system (for
penetration measurements in soil), as well as a unique laboratory testing system
which facilitates measurement of primary (P) and secondary (S) seismic waves in
soils. Together, they permit the accurate determination of in-situ stresses in
the soil. The soil measurements include the cone penetration test (CPT),
seismic-CPT, the Marchetti Flat Dilatometer (DMT) and the bender element
oedometer (BEO). The objectives of this research are: (1) to supplement the
existing data base of cone tip resistance, shear wave velocity, and dilatometer
indices versus liquefaction potential, (2) to investigate the effects of lateral
earth pressures on the liquefaction potential, and (3) to study the effects of
soil disturbance and time (aging) on soil stiffness and strength.
