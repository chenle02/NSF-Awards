This SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) project involves airborne
measurements of aerosol phase organic compounds during ACE-Asia (Aerosol
Characterization Experiment-Asia). In this collaboration with Dr. Barry Huebert
of the University of Hawaii, the PI is providing his aerosol sampling system for
use in the NSF C-130 aircraft. In this particular configuration, the airflow
will be passed through a particle concentrator, a diffusion denuder, and
filters. This minimizes potential artifacts associated with the collection of
semi-volatile organic compounds. Recent measurements have pointed to the
potentially large and yet insufficiently well understood role of organic
compounds in atmospheric aerosols and their climate forcing. The airborne
measurement of organic carbon is a crucial component of the ACE-experiment which
takes place in a region where the role of carbonaceous material is expected to
be very significant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
