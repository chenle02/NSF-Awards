This is a research project on advanced communications systems suitable for
implementing the next generation of large public networks. The principal
investigator has conceptualized a new technology called broadcast packet
switching that should support a wide range of applications including voice,
data, broadcast video (TV) and voice/video teleconferencing. Today, telephone
and cable networks are oriented towards a specific application and each uses a
communications technology well-matched to its principal application but poorly
suited to most others. Although telephone networks can be used for data
communications this usually requires the use of modems which provide slow, noisy
channels. Thus, with existing and presently planned technologies, three
separate, dedicated, applications networks may be required to meet the rapidly
growing communications needs of the general public. Successful results from this
investigation will satisfy long term communications needs through development of
an integrated network capable of supporting a wide variety of applications
simultaneously.
