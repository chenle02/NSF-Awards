This Presidential Young Investigator Award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
Organometallic Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic chemistry. The
major theme of the project is the activation of carbon-fluorine bonds by
compounds of transition metals, such as tungsten. The new chemistry which will
be developed may be useful in the synthesis of new carbon-fluorine compounds to
replace the chlorofluorocarbon compounds currently used in large quantities as
refrigerants, but which have been identified as major actors in the destruction
of ozone in the stratosphere. The discovery in Dr. Richmond's laboratory of
facile C-F bond activation at W(O) is the first well-defined reaction in which a
metal is inserted into a C-F bond. Tungsten(O) will be investigated as a
possible catalyst for the functionalization of polyfluorinated molecules. The
reverse of metal insertion, namely reductive elimination to form a new C-F bond
will be explored. The insertion of other metals into C-F bonds will be
investigated, as will the activation of other C-X bonds, including C-O, C-H and
C-C bonds.
