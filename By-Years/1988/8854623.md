This project is concerned with the design, development and evaluation of a new
curriculum for Engineering Design Graphics that reconciles the current
transition from the 2-D design medium (wooden or electronic drafting board) to
the new and near-future 3-D design medium (solid modeling system). The project
is founded on the premise that 3-D solid modeling systems, using new computer
graphics technologies, are becoming dominant engineering design tools for the
1990's, and that new knowledge and visualization skills will be required by
future engineers to become successful designers. The equipment and facilities
needed for this project are provided by the grantee.
