The International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation promotes the
study of general relativity and gravitation and enables the exchange information
within this field for example via organizing the triennial GR conference series.
This award supports the organization of the next GR Meeting (GR21) to be held in
New York City during the summer of 2016. The GR conference series is the
principal international meeting for scientists working in all the areas of
relativity and gravitation. Reinforcing existing connections and giving
opportunity to the exchange of new ideas and form new connections between GR
theorists, experimentalists, data analysts, mathematical and numerical
relativists and astrophysicists.

GR21 will have sessions covering topics such as Mathematical and Numerical
Relativity, Relativistic Astrophysics, Quantum Gravity and String Theory,
Gravitational Wave Science and Cosmology. The award will support the
participation of graduate students. Temporary child care costs that directly
result from travel to the conference will also be considered for support.
