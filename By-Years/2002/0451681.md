Throughout Western Europe, Muslim immigrants have encountered various forms of
discrimination leading to popular perceptions that liberal democracy and the
political interests of Muslim minorities are incompatible. This research
examines how political discourses, borders, local history, and urban segregation
are dynamically related to the concept of convivencia ("cohabitation" or "living
together") in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on the North African coast of
Morocco; where self identified musulmanes ("Muslims") and cristianos
("Christians") have lived for centuries on different sides of a series of
cultural, political, and economic rifts. Two research questions are posed:
First, how do political leaders in Ceuta differently construct discourses of
convivencia, and what is the relationship between discourses of convivencia and
legislative processes? Second, what is the nature of relationships between
musulmanes and cristianos, and what accounts for variations in these
relationships? The research methods for this project include informal and formal
interviews with ordinary citizens and political leaders, participant
observation, digital recordings of oral histories, text analysis, and archival
research. This study furthers our understandings of local politics at
international borders, and contributes to theoretical issues in anthropology and
political philosophy concerning debates over multiculturalism and liberal
democratic forms of governance. Broader impacts: Knowing how multiculturalism is
politically negotiated at the borderlands of the European Union is important for
policymakers and social scientists elsewhere trying to grasp the dynamics of
governance and multicultural politics.
