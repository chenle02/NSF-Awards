9530730 French The Joint Optoelectronic Project (JOP) is a joint program entered
into by the U.S. and Japanese Governments to provide prototyping services for
experimental optoelectronic devices and modules. The goals of the project are to
establish a joint research project in optoelectronics to improve the
availability of novel prototype optoelectronic materials, devices, circuits and
modules by providing users with access to leading edge optoelectronic
fabrication facilities, to stimulate research activities in optoelectronics for
computing in both the U.S. and Japan and to encourage effective
commercialization. The funds provided in this award will be used to help support
U.S. user participation in the JOP. It is anticipated that the novel, custom-
designed optoelectronic devices and modules obtained using the broker facility
will advance device and systems research activities within the academic
community.
