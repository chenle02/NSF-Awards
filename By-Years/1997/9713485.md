This is a proposal to develop a software package which, when interfaced to a
time evolving ionospheric representation, will yield quantitative information
about the growth and development of ionospheric irregularities at high
latitudes. The software package will interface descriptions of irregularity
growth and decay with a time dependent ionospheric model. As a proof of concept,
the investigators will develop a module that describes the growth rate of the
gradient drift instability in the high latitude ionosphere. The distribution of
irregularities and their time histories on specified magnetic flux tubes will be
computed and graphically displayed. These distributions will be compared with
those obtained for scintillations measurements. Future updates to this
instability model will be relatively straightforward because the platform will
be developed to have a modular interface to the instability model. The
overriding objective of this study is to demonstrate that adequate progress has
been made in large-scale ionospheric modeling to the point that both gradients
in plasma density and electric field structures are adequate to produce
meaningful estimates of the lower limits to the gradient drift instability
growth rate on a global scale.
