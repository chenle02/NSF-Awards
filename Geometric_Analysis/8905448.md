The two principal investigators will continue work in the area of stochastic
differential geometry. Professor Pinsky will consider three problems:
independence of exit time and exit position from small geodesic balls in
Riemannian manifolds; stochastic stability of linear stochastic differential
equations; spectral asymptotics on manifolds of negative curvature. Professor
Hsu will consider the behavior of the heat kernel for small times. The work that
these two investigators conduct is at the interface of Probability and Geometric
Analysis, where the tools from one area can be used to answer questions in the
other.
