The Sun Valley Workshops on Skeletal Biology emphasizes active participation of
junior faculty and students/fellows. The award "Support for Junior Investigators
at the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal
Biology; Sun Valley, Idaho; August 7-10, 2016" will be organized around problem
solving, rather than just presentation and extensive discussion. The meeting
will institute a new program to highlight posters presented at the workshop:
"Blue Ribbon Sun Valley Posters." Ten posters will be chosen for 3 minute
summary presentations by the authors. The intent is to highlight the most
significant posters, in many cases young investigator posters, and generate
interest in visiting the posters. Two of these sessions are
planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The musculoskeletal system (muscles, tendon, bone)
is highly sensitive to mechanical load and many younger investigators from
previous Sun Valley meetings have submitted applications to the Biomechanics and
Mechanobiology program. It continues as one of the important training venues for
future scientists in the area of mechanobiology of the musculoskeletal system.
