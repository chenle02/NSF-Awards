Prof. Falconer will study the overall reaction, surface processes, and
deactivation mechanisms of gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). The focus
will be on organic and chlorinated organic environmental contaminants over
catalysts illuminated with near-UV light, at near room temperature. Probe
reactants will be ethanol, trichloroethylene, and toluene. Photocatalysts will
be based on TiO2, Pt/TiO2, and MnO, and will be deposited as 0.5 micron layers
on the inside of a Pyrex annular reactor wall illuminated from the outside. The
concentration of adsorbed and co-adsorbed organic species at steady state, the
fraction of surface sites active for PCO, and the decay of all of the above over
time on stream, are to be determined. The influence of supported Pt on the
activity, surface chemistry, and deactivation of TiO2, will also be studied. A
major goal is to determine the selectivity of the various adsorbed species
towards partial or total oxidation, and the conditions needed to control such
selectivity. Techniques to be used include: steady state and transient
isothermal reaction, steady state and transient 13C isotope tracing,
temperature-programmed desorption, oxidation and hydrogenation, and FTIR. The
research outcome is of high significance for the elimination of VOC from waste
air streams, as well as for the photochemical synthesis of organic
intermediates.
