The focus of this research is the biosynthetic study of the cyanobacterial
toxins anatoxin a-(s)n Anabaena flos-aquae NCR 525-17, microcystin-LR in
Microcystis aeruginosa PCC-7820, the cytotoxins cryptophycin-1 in Nostoc sp. GSV
224, cylindrocyclophane D in Cylindrospermum lichenforme ATCC 29204 and fungal
alkaloids from the Stigonemataceae. One of the ultimate goals of the project
will be to study biosynthetic processes at the enzymatic level. Also several
unnatural C-substituted aspartic acids and beta-alanines will be evaluated as
substrates for the `aberrant` biosynthesis of cryptophycin analogs. With this
renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Drs.
Richard E. Moore and Thomas K. Hemscheidt of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Hawaii, Manoa. Drs. Moore and Hemscheidt will focus their work on
biosynthetic studies of cyanobacterial toxins produced by blue-green algae. It
is important to learn exactly how potent cyanobacterial toxins are produced ,
since poisonous blooms of blue-green algae in eutrophic freshwater and brackish
lakes present serious environmental and health problems , not only to domestic
animals and wildlife that live on the surrounding shores, but to human
populations that depend on the water for drinking.
