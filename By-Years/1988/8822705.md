Professor Boynton is currently carrying out a series of experiments to detect a
possible composition-dependent force of intermediate range. Such a new
fundamental interaction, would have a strength less than 0.01% of gravity for a
range of 250 m. His instrument, in addition to being sensitive is simple,
portable, and quite inexpensive. He intends to achieve from one to three orders
of magnitude reduction in both systematic and statistical uncertainty using
design and operation strategies that are straightforward extensions of his
current work. This improvement in measurement capability will allow a
significant step toward resolving ambiguities that currently shroud the
existence of a new composition-dependent interaction. The portability of his
instrument enables both laboratory and field experiments at a variety of sites.
