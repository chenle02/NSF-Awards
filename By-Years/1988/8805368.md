Every four years the World Conference on Earthquake Engineering is held to
bring together researchers and scholars who are actively involved in
investigating problems associated with earthquakes. This year the meeting will
be held in Japan and because it is the premier meeting of its type, it is
essential that U.S. participation be encouraged to further the U.S. leadership
in this field. With this award, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute
will administer travel grants for U.S. participants at the Ninth World
Conference on Earthquake Engineering. The conference will be held during the
period of August 2-9, 1988.
