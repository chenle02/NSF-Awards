9553140 O'Shea Yeast growth is sustained by the availability of nutrients.
Phosphate is a required nutrient. When phosphate is limiting transcription of an
acid phosphatase occurs. This enzyme which is secreted hydrolyzes phosphoryl
groups of organic molecules to yield phosphate ion. The PHO5 gene encodes the
phosphatase; transcription is tightly repressed when yeast are grown in medium
containing Pi. Three positive regulators and two negative regulators of the gene
have been identified. Two of the positive regulators have been shown to be
transcriptional regulators that bind to the promoter. Both of the negative
regulators are essential; deletion of either results in high levels of gene
expression. One of these, PHO80, is homologous to a yeast cyclin (which
regulates cell division). The other negative regulator, PHO85, is a CDC related
protein kinase. The complex of negative regulators phosphorylates transcription
factor PHO4 only when yeast are grown in high phosphate. This phosphorylation is
correlated with gene repression. Growth in low Pi results in one of the positive
regulators, PHO81, inhibiting the kinase complex. The reduced activity of the
kinase is correlated with derepression of the gene; this is assisted by the
action of PHO4 whose biochemical activity is not characterized. %%% Yeast
require phosphate to grow and multiply. When phosphate amounts are low the yeast
secrete a special enzyme that breaks down organic compounds that contain
phosphate to renew the supplies. The investigator has found that the same
molecules that regulate the production of the special enzyme also regulate cell
division. This is a remarkable example of adaptation to the environment. The use
of the same or similar molecules that control phosphate use which is necessary
for growth and division also direct the cell to reproduce itself. ***
