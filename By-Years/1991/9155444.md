The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology seeks support for an
expansion of the Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering (ASE) launched in
1991 by its Saturday Academy with the placement of 80 students. Among the
project's goals are increasing the opportunities for Hispanic and Native
American students and integration of applied experiences from the field into the
curriculum. Over the four-year period of the project, an additional 75 students
and 5 teacher-monitors will be involved with the program each year, for a total
of 300 additional students and 20 additional teachers. Plans for continuation
after the period of NSF funding are likely to be realized. The partnership will
bear approximately 67% of the total project costs.
