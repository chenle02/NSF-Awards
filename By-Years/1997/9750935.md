Assessing the hazards faced by workers and the local community due to various
industrial processes is an effort that requires extensive technical information.
The risk assessor must accumulate and evaluate qualitative data regarding the
nature of each industrial process being assessed. The information required to
make a reasonable assessment includes (1) a knowledge of the workers'
interactions with the process; (2) the chemicals emanating from the process; (3)
the toxicological effects, and environmental fate, of these chemicals; the
potential for, and the result of, the escape of these chemicals into the
community environment through the air, water, or waste; (5) any physical hazards
associated with the process (e.g., ionizing radiation); (6) and any effective
risk reduction measures. Significant effort and investigative abilities are
essential in obtaining this information. The process of competent environmental
risk assessment is a skill learned by students in the Environmental Science
curriculum. The database resources necessary to effectively research specific
information about industrial processes and the associated risks are essential to
the curriculum. It is essential that students are able to practice these skills
in either laboratory scenarios or real-world projects. The Environmental Safety
and Health Resource Laboratory being developed in this project consists of
computers and CD-ROM/software databases. It is providing a variety of excellent
resources from which specific environmental risk assessment searches can be
launched. The laboratory is also serving as a significant resource to the local
industrial community as students assist local environmental health and safety
professionals in obtaining this critical information about processes in their
facilities. *
