Under the direction of Dr. Thomas Hester, Mr Jeffery Huebner, a graduate
student at the University of Texas, Austin, will collect data for his doctoral
dissertation. Mr. Huebner has amassed and will submit prehistoric skeletal,
tissue, fecal, animal and plant samples to Geochron Laboratories for carbon and
nitrogen isotopic determination. The results will permit him to do two things:
1. reconstruct how prehistoric diet changed in the Chihuahuan Desert region over
a time interval when the enviroment shifted markedly. 2. allow refinement of a
set of isotopic techniques widely used by scientists to reconstruct human diet.
Past research has shown that different animal and vegetable foods vary in their
isotopic composition in both carbon and nitrogen. These "isotopic signatures"
are transmitted, with some alteration, to the tissues of animals which consume
them. Analysis of human skeletal material for example shows isotopic variation
which is related to diet over the course of an individual's life. Because of
this fact, and because human skeletal material is often preserved,
anthropologists have increasingly used this technique in an attempt to
reconstruct prehistoric diet. Because of its dry environment and the excellent
preservation of organic remains, the Chihuahuan Desert provides a unique
opportunity to help to develop this technique. Not only are well dated human
skeletal remains available, but both mummified tissues and fecal remains are
also present. Analysis of all three allow an interesting comparison since soft
tissue reacts differently than bone and reflects diet over a shorter time
interval. Because plant and animal remains are well preserved, analyses of them
provides a control against which tissue results can be calibrated. This research
is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how
humans adapt to a difficult and changing environment. It will help to develop a
technique of widespread anthropological use. It will also assist in the training
of a promising young scientist.
