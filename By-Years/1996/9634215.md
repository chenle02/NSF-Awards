Many problems in the real world involve systems that are complex, stochastic,
and partially observable -- for example, jet engines, the human body, and the
stock market. Recent developments in probabilistic representation and reasoning
technology, especially probabilistic (Bayesian) networks, have led to a rapid
growth of successful applications in engineering, finance, medicine, software
systems, etc. This project concerns the development of techniques for automated
construction of complex probabilistic networks directly from data. Previous work
by the principal investigator has shown that distributed, gradient-based methods
can be used to learn probabilistic networks with hidden variables. This work is
being extended to handle models of temporal processes, models with mixtures of
continuous and discrete variables, models with unknown structure, and models for
which various types of prior knowledge are available, thereby providing more
powerful learning methods for applications such as data mining, forecasting,
speech recognition, and computer vision. Because probabilistic networks can
provide compact and easily understandable models of very complex processes, the
project will also yield new tools for automated scientific investigation in
cases where current data analysis tools are ineffective -- for example, in
understanding the complex pathways by which DNA lesions lead to tumors.
