9320458 Bayless This SBIR Phase II proposal addresses the problem of developing
a novel, sealed, source of 14 MeV (or 2.5 MeV) neutrons which can operate at
high output flux with long life. The Intense Pulsed Discharge (IPD) neutron
source uses a simple cold-cathode ion generator and a distributed ion extraction
geometry to deliver a high fraction of atomic deuterium ions at energies of 200
keV to a tritium-loaded target. Neutrons with energies in the range of 14 MeV
are generated through D-T (T(D, n)4 He) fusion reactions; 2.5 MeV deuterium-
loaded target. The basic feasibility of the IPD neutron source concept was
demonstrated in a SBIR Phase I project that included ion beam experiments and
conceptual design development. Phase II will complete the feasibility
demonstration by constructing and operating a 200 kV laboratory prototype IPD
neutron source system. This project includes: (1) optimization of the ion
generator; (2) design and assembly of a sealed 200 kV IPD neutron source; (3)
source characterization with hydrogen; (4) operation with deuterium and
measurement of the 2.5 MeV neutron flux resulting from D-D reactions (the 14 MeV
flux can be projected from this); and (5) life testing with the goal of
operational life of 300 hours under conditions representative of a D-T neutron
flux of 5x10 12 n/sec (>50 times greater than available with commercial sealed
sources) and a flux density of 3x10 10 n/cm2-sec. ***
