The principal investigator will continue the study of measure-valued population
processes and multi-level branching diffusions. The major motivation for the
project is to create models to fit the hypothesis and then to use the acceptable
models to predict the future behavior. The classes of stochastic processes to be
studied have been shown as appropriate models for analysis of allelic frequency
data. Measure-valued branching processes trace not only the numbers of particles
but also their distributions over the time. Thus the measure-valued aspect of
the processes make them particularly attractive models in epidemiological spread
of communicable disease or economic wealth of various populations.
Mathematically, the stochastic measure diffusion process is the continuous
analogue of an infinite particle branching Markov system. The project will
address three specific aspects of these processes: properties of the topological
support of the associated random measure, including the coherence or
dispersiveness, clustered nature or scatteredness, and singularity or absolute
continuity of such random measures.
