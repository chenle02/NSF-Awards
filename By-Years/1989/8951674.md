Jackson State University will use Apple-II-GS computers and associated hardware
and software to provide data acquisition and data analysis in Basic and General
Physics laboratories. The equipment will be used in a variety of experiments
there, and also in electronics and atmospheric science courses. The equipment
will enable students to explore a wider variety of phenomena than previously,
and to collect and analyze more data more easily. A significant number of
minority students will be served. The University will match the award with an
equal amount of funds.
