This project is developing and implementing curricular strategies that can
improve the retention and graduation rate of women students. Women students
typically make up 20 percent of the lower-level classes, but only 12 percent of
the upper-level classes. A computer science laboratory that is run by and for
computer science students is being implemented. The laboratory is giving women
computer science students systematic experiences that are developing their
confidence and ability to accept positions of increasing importance and
responsibility in a computing environment. The new laboratory is the vehicle for
providing these experiences. In addition to attracting and retaining women to
the curriculum, this program is significantly benefiting all of the students in
the computer science program. *
