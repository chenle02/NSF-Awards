A Gordon Conference on the Dynamics of Simple Systems will be held in Andover,
NH, August 11-16, 1996. This conference will bring together nuclear physicists,
atomic physicists, chemists, and materials scientists to exchange ideas and
insights concerning problems in which they have a common interest. These
problems include effects of relativity in both nuclei and atoms, the physics of
both nuclear and atomic three-body systems, phenomena associated with ultracold
atoms, and the use of quanta of light to control the evolution of small
molecules. Considerable progress is currently being made in these interesting
areas, and the exchange of ideas among experts in the different subfields
involved is important if we are to take advantage of the scientific
opportunities being presented.
