0201861 Wyatt This research project is to develop and test a prototype
prosthetic device for restoring some useful vision to blind humans who have
retinal disease. The investigators will apply their microfabrication and
surgical expertise to the development of a prosthesis, which can be successfully
implanted for a period of months or years without affecting the delicate
surrounding tissue in the eye. The wireless, inflatable prosthesis is to receive
its power from outside the body by radio frequency transmission. A new form of
low-power circuitry is to be developed for the implant to reduce heating effects
in the eye. This thin silicon circuit, integral to the implant, will transmit
simple patterns to an array of stimulating electrodes located on flexible,
spider-like 'arms' which are to be folded-up for insertion through a small
incision in the eye. Once inside the eye they can then be inflated for
attachment to a larger area of retina. A parallel effort will develop
encapsulation technology to protect these implants from bodily fluids.

This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the
Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) under the terms of a Letter of Agreement of
April 19, 2002. The research will be conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and the Cornell University Nanofabrication Facility. Testing of
the various versions of the prototype implant is to be done at MIT and the DVA
Center for Innovative Visual Rehabilitation in the DVA Medical Center, Boston,
Massachusetts.
