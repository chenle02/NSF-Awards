Appoaches to acquiring problem-solving knowledge have focused on achieving
general results with simple problem domains. These domains have had small search
spaces, few subgoal interactions, and only Boolean constraints. Real-world
application domains have many subgoal interactions, large search spaces, and
real- valued performance constraints as well as Boolean constraints.
SteppingStone is a new general learning problem solver for solving difficult
real-world problems. SteppingStone solves these problems by decomposing them
into simpler subproblems, and then learning to deal with the interactions that
arise between them. An initial version of our approach demonstrates this in the
classical tile-sliding domain. This work will extend the system and demonstrate
its capability in real-world problem- solving situations such as VLSI design and
job-shop scheduling. By experimenting with both classical problem-solving
domains and real-world aplications it will demonstrate that the problem solver
is both powerful and general.
