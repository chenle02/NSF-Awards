Texas A&amp;M proposes to acquire a 5-channel nutrient autoanalyzer for use at
sea for the measurement of nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate and ammonia
during research cruises carried out by personnel from the Department of
Oceanography at Texas A&amp;M University and the Departments of Marine Biology
and Marine Science at Texas A&amp;M University, Galveston. Such measurements are
currently made using samples collected at sea and frozen, then analyzed on an
old Astoria-Pacific instrument at the laboratory at the Geochemical and
Environmental Research Group (GERG). Having an instrument that can go to sea
would mean more timely and accurate results for their programs. Texas A&amp;M
Provided technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the
following Oceanographic Instrumentation: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) SEAL AA500
autoanalyzer $100,590 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The
principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of
the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for
scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of
their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition,
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
