The Calculus & Mathematica course initiated at the University of Illinois and
further developed at Ohio State is being extended to second year calculus. The
focus is on development of materials, testing them in the class room, and
revising them in light of the experience gained. Student outcomes are being
assessed and the results will be reported to the community.
