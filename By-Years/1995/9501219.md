This award supports preliminary research on a topological invariant, -P.P,
associated to the germ of any complex normal surface singularity. The goal is to
develop techniques for both finding a volume form on the link of a surface
singularity, and for formulating closed expressions for -P.P. The principal
investigator will initially work on determining the behavior of -P.P under
splicing and finite ramified maps. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a
revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origins, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays, the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
