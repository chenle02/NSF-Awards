The central focus of this proposal is the development of efficient algorithms
for the storage and movement of data. Specifically, we are interested in
algorithms that impact the performance of large multimedia data storage systems.
In algorithmic terms, some of the principal challenges that arise in the context
of multimedia data storage are: (a) deciding how many copies of each data item
need to be stored, (b) determining the exact layout of data on a set of servers,
(c) dealing with changing workloads and dynamic data access patterns. These
related challenges require the development of efficient algorithms for
optimizing data layout to maximize client satisfaction, monitoring the
performance of data storage systems and scheduling the movement of large amounts
of data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Futhermore, what makes the issues that we consider
even more significant is the fact that data storage and movement issues also
arise within publicly share networks such as the Internet where the bandwidth
can be dynamic and highly variable, and can result in a poor choice of paths
chosen to transfer data in the network. One way to address this issue is to
route data through specific holding points. By doing this we are able to
increase throughput and decrease completion times by an order of magnitude to
transfer data from several sources to a single destination. Algorithms related
to this problem have been developed by us and are being tested with the Bistro
framework, which is a framework for providing a data upload service such as one
required by IRS for tax submission purposes. Our data movement algorithms are
being used to schedule the transfer of data from many different locations to a
final destination server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While some specific instances of
the individual problems have been considered earlier, there is no work dealing
comprehensively with the range of issues that we focus on.&lt;br/&gt;
