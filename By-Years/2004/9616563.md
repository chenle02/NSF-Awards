Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: Project Technovision
X-33, Planning Year The Los Angeles Unified School District has been awarded
funding in the amount of $50,000 for a period of 12 months for a planning grant
to study the effect of access to technology on the education of a traditionally
underrepresented, culturally and linguistically undeserved student/parent
population. The proposed research will lead to the formation of policy and
curricular changes which will significantly affect education in urban, low-
income communities into the twenty-first century. The project will involve the
collaboration of many different entities: K-12 teachers and administrators;
university researchers and professors; governmental organizations; and private
business. During this planning year, approximately 15 specific collaboratively
development projects will be tested for feasibility and eventual implementation.
Data and analyses gathered from these projects will be disseminated widely,
using the full resources of the Internet and the World Wide Web.
