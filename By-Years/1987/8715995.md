Research under this grant includes a wide variety of topics in particle and
quantum field theory. Alberto Sirlin plans calculations which will further
improve the comparison between theory and experiment in the standard model of
electroweak interactions (following improvement for beta-decay achieved
recently), and to extend it to new domains where it may reveal the signal of new
physics. Daniel Zwanziger intends to investigate non-perturbative phenomena in
continuum QCD using the formulation of stochastic quantization, to employ a
recently developed lattice fermion action in numerical simulations, and to test
the new multi-grid algorithm of Sokal and Goodman in lattice gauge theory. This
research is at the frontiers of theoretical physics in the areas of elementary
particles and field theory. It should help lead to better understanding of both
current and planned experiments as well as helping to devise deeper theories
that may in the future be susceptible to experimental tests.
