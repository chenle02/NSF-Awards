This research will develop a relative Hodge theory of families of complex
algebraic varieties. More precisely, there is associated to any variety a
category of objects called stratified variations of Hodge structure. Given an
algebraic map, the data of the cohomology along the fibers together with their
mixed Hodge structures should give rise to such an object. The principal
investigator will examine this situation, as well as consider the category of
polarizable mixed Hodge structures. This is research in the field of algebraic
geometry, which is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics. In its origin,
it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations,
namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from
algebra, but also from analysis and topology. It is finding application in those
areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
