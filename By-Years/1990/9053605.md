The proposed research will investigate students' reasoning about quantitative
variables and functions in different situations that support understanding: a
physical device in which quantitities are related by linear functions, a
computer simulation of the device that includes numerical information, and a
computer-based "functions machine" that presents only numerical information. The
research will focus on the different ways that these models and representations
present resources for reasoning and learning about functions. Students will be
interviewed in pairs, with parallel series of problems and questions for the
three systems. Students who will be interviewed will include middle-school
students who have not studied algebra and high-school students who have studied
algebra for one year. Teachers will be asked to recommend students whose
performance in mathematics is about at the average of national norms. In one
study, students will answer questions and solve problems with the systems with
whatever additional representations they choose to use. In two subsequent
studies, students will learn to construct (l) formulas and (2) graphs to
represent functional relations among quantitities in the situations. A fourth
study, to be begun in this grant period, will combine learning of formulas and
graphs as representations of the systems. Conclusions about the students'
reasoning and learning will be based on their success in solving problems and
answering questions, the explanations they give of their solutions and answers,
and the linguistic terms that they use to refer to quantitative properties and
relations. Finally, the work will focus on specific aspects of students'
reasoning and understanding that are similar and different situations, relating
differences to the different kinds of information and activity that the
situations provide.
