The goal of this Rapid Response Research is to create a human-robot system that
will assist in the ``doffing'' (i.e., removal) of Personal Protective Equipment
(PPE) worn by health-care workers treating Ebola. Because the PPE has multiple
layers of clothing and involves numerous steps, and because doffing must be
repeated often under stressful conditions, the process poses a significant risk
of infection for health-care workers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks
to use a robot to minimize the amount of contact between the worker's hands
(covered with gloves) and the PPE, as this contact may enlarge the areas of the
PPE that are contaminated and thus increase the risk of infecting the worker. To
accomplish this goal, the PI and co-PI seek to develop manipulation strategies
and primitives that will allow the robot to assist in the doffing process by
using its hands as hooks, braces, and clamps so that the health-care worker uses
their hands as little as possible during the doffing process. The work will be
performed in close consultation with medical professionals to ensure that the
developed procedures are both safe and provide an advantage over the manual
doffing process.
