The PIs will design and build a new rapid access ice drill (RAID) for use in
Antarctica. This drill will have the ability to rapidly drill through ice up to
3300 m thick and then collect samples of the ice, ice-sheet bed interface, and
bedrock substrate below. This drilling technology will provide a new way to
obtain in situ measurements and samples for interdisciplinary studies in
geology, glaciology, paleoclimatology, microbiology, and astrophysics. The RAID
drilling platform will give the scientific community access to records of
geologic and climatic change on a variety of timescales, from the billion-year
rock record to thousand-year ice and climate histories. Successful development
of the RAID system will provide a research tool that is currently unavailable.
Development of this platform will enable scientists to address critical
questions about the deep interface between the Antarctic ice sheets and the
substrate below. Development of RAID will provide a way to address many of the
unknowns associated with general stability of the Antarctic ice sheets in the
face of changing climate and sea level rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific
rationale for RAID was reviewed in a previous proposal (Goodge 1242027). The PIs
were granted ?Phase I? funding to develop a more detailed conceptual design for
the RAID drill that would provide a better understanding of construction costs
as well as operation and maintenance costs for RAID once it is constructed.
Phase I support also allowed the PIs to work with the research community to
develop more detailed science requirements for the drill. This proposal requests
continued funding (Phase II) to construct, assemble and test the RAID drilling
platform, through to staging it in Antarctic for future scientific operations.
