This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the factors
that affect citizen trust in government. The investigator attempts to build a
complete theory of trust in govermnent. This is done by assuming trust operates
as a public decision and that trust will be the result of public information and
public disposition. Citizen trust in their government will vary depending on
information about government performance and dispositions of ideology, party
identification and social capital that are used to interpret that
information.&lt;br/&gt;The theory and hypotheses are tested by using a quarterly
measure of trust in government for the period 1972 to 2000. This measure of
trust in government demonstrates that trust in governmnent varies on a regular
basis. The investigator also attempts to assess the effect of trust in
government on political participation, voter turnout and elections.
