This project concerns the symmetry groups of shift dynamical systems, smooth
manifolds, and operator algebras. Ideas from algebraic K-theory are applicable
to each area and form a common theme tying together these disparate mathematical
constructs. Wagoner will study algebraic and homological structure of symmetries
of sub-shifts of finite type (SFT), sofic, and other shift dynamical systems.
Among other problems, three central questions for SFT's he will explore are FOG,
LIFT, and SHIFT. Some of the problems concerning invariants of symmetries of
shift systems have non-commutative versions for C*-algebras. The classic
Alexander polynomial of a knot in three- dimensional space is closely linked to
the algebraic K-theory group K1. Recently, other polynomial invariants have been
found for these knots, starting with the work of V. Jones. Pseudo- isotopies and
diffeomorphisms of manifolds in a wide range of cases (including knot
complements) have invariants involving the algebraic K-theory group K2. Wagoner
will examine whether it is possible to define new invariants for diffeomorphisms
of knots in analogy with the new knot polynomials.
