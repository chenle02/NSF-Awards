TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical research and education that is built on the
synergy between statistical physics and computational complexity theory.
Students will participate in interdisciplinary research and gain skills valuable
for materials simulation, protein folding, and combinatorial optimization. The
proposed research is organized into three main parts. The first project
addresses how physical complexity can emerge spontaneously from simple rules and
randomness, the second project focuses on graphical representation for
frustrated systems, and the third involves the development of Monte Carlo
algorithms to deal with frustrated systems. Computational complexity theory
seeks to determine the computational resources required to solve problems. Phase
transitions occur in the complexity of solving computational problems and the
methods of statistical physics are well suited to understand the mechanisms
leading to such phase transitions. The approach will be applied to circuit value
problems and Darwinian evolution. Disordered spin systems with competing
interaction and frustration will be investigated using graphical representations
and associated efficient cluster algorithms to investigate what determines which
phase is selected: the initial conditions or the choices during evolution.
Computational algorithms such as replica exchange Monte Carlo and evolutionary
annealing will be optimized.

NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY

This award supports theoretical research and education at the frontier between
statistical physics and computational complexity theory. Computational
complexity theory seeks to determine the computational resources required to
solve problems such as Darwinian evolution. Dramatic changes occur in the
complexity of solving problems and the methods of statistical physics are well
suited to understand the mechanisms leading to such variations in the
complexity. Students will be engaged in interdisciplinary research and gain
skills valuable for materials simulation, protein folding, and combinatorial
optimization.
