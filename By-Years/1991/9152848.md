The Department of Geography is purchasing computer-based data- acquisition
systems including albedometers and pyrradiometers that will allow quantification
and analysis of radiation balance terms. Sensor systems are deployed by students
at various sites with differing surface characteristics (e.g., grass, concrete,
gravel) to determine shortwave and longwave energy-flux densities. The results
are compared to various theoretical models for atmospheric energy balance. These
studies are are expected to lead to a greater understanding of
