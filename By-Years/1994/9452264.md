9452264 Schreiner Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR)
spectroscopy has been established as the most important technique in the
identification and structural assignment of all organic and organometallic
compounds. It also lends itself to structure determination of biochemical
macromolecules, and can be used to study molecular dynamics. The objective of
this project is to educate chemistry and other science majors in the theory and
operation of this powerful technique by introducing them to NMR at a gradually
increasing level of sophistication throughout the entire chemistry curriculum.
Student use of the instrument occurs in course ranging from introductory
chemistry to undergraduate research projects. Starting with basic l-D 1H NMR,
students advance to multinuclear and 2-D methods. This effectively ensures
proper training in modern NMR techniques for our students who go on to
industrial positions or excellent graduate schools. In addition to the students
and faculty of Randolph-Macon College involved in this project, one nearby
Community College (J. Sargeant Reynolds) and the local Mathematics and Science
Center are using this equipment.
