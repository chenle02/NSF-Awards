This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Science Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be used to support several research projects in the Department of
Mathematics at Purdue University: Applications of a Graphics Supercomputer to
Numerical Modeling of Physical Processes - (1) Numerical Simulation of Flows in
Fractured Reservoirs, (2) Numerical Methods for Compressible Fluid Flow, and (3)
Inverse Problems and Acoustic Well-Logging, directed by Todd Arbogast, Jim
Douglas, Jr., Bradley Lucier, and Fabio Milner; and Applications of High Level
Computer Graphics to Complex Analysis, directed by Steven Bell, Richard Penney,
and Allen Weitsman.
