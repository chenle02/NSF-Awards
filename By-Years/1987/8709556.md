This grant permits Dr. Bass and his collegues to continue excavation of a
shipwreck lying at a depth of 145 to 170 feet off Ulu Burun, Turkey. The wreck,
found as the result of a systematic survey, dates to the Late Bronze Age (14th
century B.C.) and sank after being driven onto the Ulu Burun cliffs. Because it
sank upright, its rich contents remained in place and were not significantly
disturbed when the ship settled to the bottom. Preliminary excavation has
revealed copper and glass ingots, ceramic vessels and numerous personal
belongings of crew members. The teams plans to continue mapping and excavation
of the ship. All artifacts will be photographed >in situ> and after removal,
necessary conservation will be carried out. Copper and glass samples will be
analyzed to determine the sources of these materials. Neutron analysis of
ceramics will also be conducted for the same goal. With these data, it should be
possible to determine the possibly multiple points of origin of the cargo and
through this means help to reconstruct the patterns of trade in the Bronze Age
Mediterranean. Historians and anthropologists have argued about the role which
Greece played at this time and whether or not it controlled, and was the origin
for many products, such as bronze, which spread across this area. Dr. Bass has
argued that the focus was along the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean. This
research will help to answer this question. Anthropologists want to learn how
complex widespread cultural systems develop. The Bronze Age saw the emergence of
just such a network and it is important to undersstand how it functioned, and
the effect it had on the particular societies involved. It is unclear what role
such long distance trade played in the development of early states. This
research will help to resolve this question.
