The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
application of high performance catalysts for use in energy conversion/storage
devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Successful commercialization will
considerably advance nano-manufacturing in electrochemical energy
conversion/storage and have a positive impact on a number of clean energy
technologies. Typical customers for the proposed innovation include a broad
spectrum of high-tech industries which will potentially benefit from
commercialization of this technology. Some examples include fuel cell
manufacturers, automotive industry, consumer electronics and energy storage
companies. Superior performance of novel amorphous catalysts compared to state
of the art suggests that this technology might be attractive core strength for a
new company. As such, this I-Corps program will seek to understand whether a
market opportunity exists around application of this technology and any
potential spin-out company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is focused
on addressing catalyst performance bottlenecks in energy conversion/storage
technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. This will be achieved by
replacing state of the art nanoparticle catalysts with novel amorphous metallic
alloys. Metallic glasses are fully amorphous multi-component alloys with unique
combination of properties and processing ability. They can be produced in a wide
range of compositions that are not available in crystalline form and therefore
their electronic and catalytic characteristics can be engineered to achieve
superior performance. A self-supporting architecture will be used for these
novel amorphous catalysts, which prevent the dissolution of support material and
significantly improve durability. The success of this project will lead to
commercialization of highly-efficient and low-cost catalytic materials for
electrochemical energy devices. It will pave the way for new clean energy
technology ventures.
