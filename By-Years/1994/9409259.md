9409259 Pinsky It is generally accepted that all nuclear matter is composed of
quarks held together by the exchange of gluons. The theory that describes these
interactions is known as quantum chromodynamics or QCD. While the broadest
outlines of this theory are known, many important details are yet to be
understood. One of the leading approaches to a more refined understanding
employs a technique, pioneered in the 60's, known as light front field theory
(LFFT). The fifth annual workshop on LFFT applied to QCD will be held this
summer in Telluride, Colorado bringing together for two weeks from around the
world the leading workers in this area. The discussions will certainly be lively
and will, in particular, significantly affect the research focus of the many
students in attendance. The workshop is likely to lead to significant progress
in our understanding of QCD. ***
