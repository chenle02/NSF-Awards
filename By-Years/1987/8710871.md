This project is concerned with statistical signal processing and image
processing. In particular the PI is developing robust algorithms for signal
parameter estimation in correlated noise and also for the segmentation of
objects from background in noisy images. Robustness is important because
otherwise optimal schemes can perform poorly in the presence of statistical
outliers. The goal of robust signal processing is to maintain the near optimal
performance in such a case. In the parameter estimation area, it is planned to
concentrate on nonlinear estimation in nominally Gaussian noise, making use of
previously developed results in linear estimation and estimation in independent
and weakly dependent noise. In the image segmentation area, the concentration
will be on image models that result in robust maximum a posteriori (MAP)
segmentation algorithms. The three reviewers assembled in a panel rated this
proposal as Excellent. The investigators career potential is thought to be
outstanding. The area of research is quite relevant to the CSP program. A two-
year award of $57924 is highly recommended. This award should be funded at
$25088 in FY87 and $32836 in FY88.
