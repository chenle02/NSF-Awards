Understanding the reasons for the location and timing of the onset of
convective weather is a fundamental research question and important to the
forecasting of weather. Convergence along mesoscale atmospheric boundaries and
topographic effects are primary mechanisms for convective cloud initiation and
development and in determining the distribution of precipitation. The
availability of data from recent field research experiments and advances in
numerical computer model capabilities provide an opportunity to advance
knowledge of these processes. The Principal Investigator will use data collected
from recent field programs to initialize and verify an advanced atmospheric
numerical model. He will examine the contributions, interactions and
sensitivities of the physical processes leading to convective storm development
along atmospheric boundaries. He also will examine the influence of topography
on the development and organization of clouds and precipitation.
