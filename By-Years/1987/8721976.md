To search for the possible existence of the H particle, a strangeness minus 2
dibaryon, and thus test the two step reaction mechanism and a special two
compartment cryogenic target. The kaon charge exchange reaction will be used to
produced cascade minus particles in the liquid hydrogen part of the target. The
cascade minus will be slowed down and stopped in the liquid deuterium part of
the target to form a cascade minus deuterium atom which can decay to the H
particle by neutron emission. The neutron from this reaction will be
monoenergetic and its energy will be measured by time of flight techniques. The
signature for the H particle will be a peak in the neutron time of flight
spectrum. The experiment will be performed in a new high momentum beam line to
be built at the Brookhaven AGS. The project will permit the collaboration of
Professor Stearns, of Vassar College and physics majors from Vassar in these
experiments. This project should lead to the strengthening of the physics major
at Vassar particularly through the enrichment of an advanced laboratory course
and a course in Modern Physics taught by the principal investigator.
