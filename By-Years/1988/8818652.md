This project will support the Second International Conference on Mathematical
Population Dynamics that will be held May 17-20, 1989 at Rutgers University. The
meeting will be organized by Professor David Axelrod. The focus of this
conference is the mathematical modeling of heterogeneous biological populations.
An interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas between biologists and
mathematicians will be provided. Topics will include population of genes, cells,
and tumors, the natural history of cancer, and selected topics from
epidemiology. The mathematical topics relevant to these areas include branching
processes, stochastic models, random walks, spatial processes, structured
populations, semigroups of operators, and dynamical systems. Special efforts
will be made to facilitate understanding between theoreticians and
experimentalists and between established scientists and junior colleagues.
