Narrative: This project for a "Career Advancement Award" deals with
micromechanical and computational studies on certain colloidal phenomena and
fluctuation processes for the following objectives: (i) to broaden the current
research activities of the PI in studies on concentrated colloidal dispersions
that also include studies on stability and structural transitions for certain
classes of practically-important dispersions; (ii) to develop some novel
computer experiment procedures needed in the above context and to initiate the
necessary supercomputing programs; and (iii) to explore the application of these
techniques to nonaqueous and sterically-stabilized dispersions in order to
establish University/Industry collaborative links. In addition, the project
includes efforts aimed at modifying the techniques or procedures which are
developed under the above initiatives to study permeation of ionic and other
species through membranes.
