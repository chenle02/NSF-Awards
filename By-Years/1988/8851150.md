The goal of this project is to provide equipment to support the initiation of
biochemistry laboratory and senior-year research programs. The equipment is for
centrifugation, spectrophotometry, and potentiometric techniques. The Biology
Department is revising its curriculum in order to offer a greater focus on the
health sciences. The restructuring already has doubled departmental enrollments.
The new equipment is helping to produce graduates who are better prepared for
advanced study and better able to serve the community at large. The grantee
institution is matching the NSF award with a substantially greater sum obtained
from non-Federal sources.
