Geographic factors strongly influence the atmospheric processes that lead to
heavy rains. This doctoral dissertation project will provide an analysis of the
subsynoptic character of heavy rain for a broad area encompassing the flood-
prone Appalachian mountains of the United States. The horizontal movement of
masses of air that causes changes in the physical properties of air will be
calculated for a large, spatially unbiased sample of heavy rain events. A
principal components analysis will be performed to identify modes of covariance
in the advection fields associated by these air movements. This analysis will be
followed by a cluster analysis to objectively determine groups of heavy rain
events with common low-level moisture, thermal and mid- level vorticity
advection patterns. After examining geographic patterns in the occurrence of
heavy rain groups, subsynoptic scenarios of heavy rain for the Appalachian
region will be developed. This project will provide a better understanding of
the role of advection processes in heavy rain development. Patterns of
geographic variations expected in the relationship of the advection fields will
permit inferences to be made about the ways that mountain orientation and the
location of moisture sources alters the subsynoptic regimes associated with
heavy rainfall. The development of heavy rain scenarios for the flood-prone
Appalachian region will provide forecasters with much needed guidance in the
prediction of heavy rain. This project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent
research skills.
