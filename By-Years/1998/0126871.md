Biological Sciences (61) Experiments that utilize optical spectroscopic methods
adapted from the literature are being introduced in a coordinated fashion into
four teaching laboratories as a means of increasing student understanding of
interactions of light and matter. Students measure the absorbance and
fluorescence of metalloporphyrins in a freshman-level inorganic chemistry
laboratory. They characterize protein-DNA interactions, DNA-ligand
thermodynamics and kinetics, and protein unfolding equilibrium and kinetics in
upper-level biochemistry and chemistry laboratories using absorbance and
fluorescence spectroscopy. In one laboratory course, students develop and test
their own hypothesis for a well-defined biophysical problem. Web-based teaching
tools are being developed and implemented to enhance and monitor student
learning. Instrumentation to facilitate these activities include a UV-visible
spectrophotometer, two scanning fluorometers (with computers/printers), and a
rapid-mixing accessory for stopped-flow kinetics for dedicated use in the
undergraduate teaching laboratories. This project is being assessed by an
advisory board of chemistry and biology faculty and a teaching and learning
specialist.
