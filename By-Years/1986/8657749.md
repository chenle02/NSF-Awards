Narrative: The influence of surface chemistry on the growth of colloidal
particles and on the behavior of model suspensions will be investigated. Recent
advances made in the laboratory of the principal investigator in understanding
the effects of particle interaction potentials on the morphology of precipitates
will be extended to conducting polymer materials. In this work, the mechanisms
of formation of analine and pyrole polymer particles will be investigated to
establish methods of synthesizing model conducting polymer colloids. The
resulting particles will be used in fundamental studies of the electrical,
optical and suspension behavior of this unique set of materials. A second line
of approach to understanding the influence of particle surface properties on
suspension behavior will be to unravel the effects of interaction potential and
suspension structure on the rheology of flocculated materials. By working with
model electrorheological fluids which flocculate reversibly in the presence of
an electric field, reproducible suspension structures can be obtained and the
degredation of this structure by shear carefully studied.
