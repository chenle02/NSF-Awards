This project focuses on mathematical research in the regularity theory of
certain partial differential equations that arise naturally in physics and
engineering. A central topic in the research of linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations is the smoothness of solutions under various regularity
assumptions on coefficients and domains. Many equations and systems from physics
and engineering involve discontinuous coefficients or domains with sharp corners
or cusps, or even fractal structures. For instance, fiber-reinforced materials
may have fiber inclusions that are very closely spaced and may even touch. In
such cases, much of the classical theory of partial differential equations is no
longer applicable. Another research topic of major importance is hydrodynamic
turbulence in fluid and gas dynamics. The study of turbulence leads to new ideas
in scientific computing, differential equations, and statistics, and it has been
characterized as one of the most fascinating problems in fluid mechanics.

The principal investigator will carry out research closely related to the
aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in
these areas. He will focus his attention on several projects that can be
gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new
methods to study certain elliptic equations associated with composite materials
(e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The principal investigator
is particularly interested in the fine regularity of solutions to these
equations, including higher-order regularity and more quantitative derivative
estimates. Second, the project will explore nonstandard Sobolev estimates for
local (or nonlocal) nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations with irregular
coefficients or kernels, in possibly irregular domains. Finally, the project
will investigate well-posedness and regularity issues for certain deterministic
and stochastic fluid equations such as the magnetohydrodynamics equations.
