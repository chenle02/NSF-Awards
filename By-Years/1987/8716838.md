Equipment for system prototyping and verification will be provided for
researchers at Duke University for research in the Departments of Computer
Science and Engineering. The equipment is provided under the Instrumentation
Grants for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering program.
The equipment will be used for several research projects, including in
particular: 1. Parallel architectures for ray-casting and solid modeling 2.
Solid modeling 3. Architectures which include parallel instruction caches and
decoding units 4. Non-homogeneous tightly-coupled multiprocessor systems for
vision 5. Modular high-performance architectures 6. Specialized multiprocessor
architectures for specific large scientific problems such as atomic-level
molecular dynamics calculations
