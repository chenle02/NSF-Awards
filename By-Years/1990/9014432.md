This grant will support completion of the data analysis and publication of all
results from Experiment E710 at Fermilab, (pp elastic scattering and total cross
sections at energies up to s = 1.8 TeV). During the second and third years of
the grant the group will start a new experiment to improve the measurement of
the ratio of real to imaginary forward scattering amplitude at the full energy
of the Fermilab Tevatron, as well, as a much improved measurement of the total
cross section. A small group of physicists, consisting of one faculty member,
one research associate and one student, is continuing its research in elementary
particle physics.
