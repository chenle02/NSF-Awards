State University, proposes a planning visit to Inner Mongolia, China to carry
out a field reconnaissance of Cretaceous Extension Basins above the Louzidan
Detachment. The purpose of this visit is for him to develop a full research
proposal. In addition, this project will provide opportunities for two U.S.
graduate students to gain the field experience in this area. The project is
jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and the Chinese Academy of
Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
