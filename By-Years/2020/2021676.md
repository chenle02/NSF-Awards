This travel grant is used to support US based graduate students to attend IEEE
International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP), to be held in Madrid,
Spain, October 13-16, 2020. ICNP is a conference that covers all aspects of
network protocols, including design, analysis, specification, verification,
implementation, and performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel grant aims to
broaden ICNP participation by lowering the financial barrier of attendance for
graduate students, in particular female and underrepresented students, at
institutions in the Unites States. Enabling students to attend a high-quality
conference at an early stage of a researcher's academic career is a wise
investment in the future of the field. Priority will be given to the students
who will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited
travel funds, as well as junior graduate students who will attend the conference
for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
