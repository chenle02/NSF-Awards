A new era in gravitational wave detection is about to begin, with the completion
of the three interferometers of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory, or LIGO. The gravitational wave research group at Syracuse
University intends to play a key role in LIGO's improvement and observing
activities over the next three years. They will carry out detector
characterization activities to guide this work, will strive to understand the
data produced by the interferometers, and will help optimize methods for
searching for gravitational waves. In support of these activities, they will
devote their laboratory facilities at Syracuse to experiments that will
investigate any anomalies that may be discovered in the instruments at the LIGO
observatories. In addition, the group will develop a set of laboratory teaching
stations, as the nucleus of a summer school for scientists new to the field of
gravitational wave detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once LIGO is collecting the
sort of data for which it was designed, we will be in a position where dramatic
new discoveries about the universe are possible. The results of LIGO's initial
data run could shed light on black holes, gamma ray bursts, neutron stars, and
supernovae. The instruments carrying out these observations have dramatically
extended the state of the art of precision measurement technology.
