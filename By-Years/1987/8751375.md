The purpose of this research is to study the home processes related to
children's interest and proficiency in mathematics, and to assess the extent to
which these processes are changed through a program designed to help parents
become more effective partners in their children's mathematics learning. The
project will focus on families in FAMILY MATH programs across the country,
specifically: low-income, inner-city minority and majority families in the San
Francisco Bay Area; Hispanics (through Valle del Sol in Arizona); American
Indians (through the Oregon Indian Education Association); and urban blacks
(through the Urban League in Indianapolis, Indiana). Over 200 families will be
included in the study. Research questions posed for this study are: How does
FAMILY MATH influence the parents' confidence, and competence as partners in
their children's learning? How does participation in the program change the
families; math-related activities? Do parents increase their involvement in
their children's formal mathematics learning? To what degree does participation
in the program affect children's school mathematics learning? The study has
implications for future research on the factors influencing student achievement
in mathematics, as it will help us understand how families can be an important
resource in our efforts to improve student interest and competence in
mathematics. Results will help us understand how home processes are different in
special minority groups, what differences in patterns of change we might
realistically expect when working with these special groups, and how programs
might be modified to become more effective in communities where the children's
needs for a "better chance" in mathematics education are particularly great.
