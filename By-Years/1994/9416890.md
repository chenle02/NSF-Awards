The project addresses major application domains of parallel computing including
parallel data bases, and addresses the fundamental issues of the evolving
technology of parallel algorithms. Various properties of families of parallel
computer systems are studied with the intention of moving towards more
ubiquitous general purpose parallel computing. Specifically the role of
interprocessor communication as part of the theoretical foundation of parallel
computer systems is studied.
