This University of Oklahoma College of Engineering project involves three
separate but related components covering the total spectrum of development and
experience that a student needs in order to understand the value and rewards of
a career in research. The three components include a 1) Summer Academic
Enrichment Program for minority high school graduates, 2) a university based
research experience, and 3) an industrial based research experience. The Summer
Academic Enrichment Program focuses on academic development and introduction to
research careers. The overall goal for this program is to assist the students in
achieving their academic potential by having the participants enroll in six
hours of college credit including English and mathematics courses. The
participants also are involved in writing and math labs each day plus Academic
Orientation and Person Development Workshops. The second and third components of
the project include research opportunities for participants in both the
university and in industry. The project allows for flexibility. Some
participants may participate in only one or two of the components. However, the
goal is to produce students who have gone through all three components. This
project should produce a group of talented minority students trained and
motivated to continue in research and graduate school opportunities.
