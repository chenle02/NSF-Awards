Ruby Byrne is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Fellowship to carry out
a program of research and education at the California Institute of Technology.
Byrne will use emission from neutral hydrogen to study the Cosmic Dawn, the
phase in cosmological history when stars and galaxies first formed. She will
also lead a summer research program for high school students and undergraduates
that will expose students to astronomical data analysis techniques and prepare
them for careers in science.

This project employs the OVRO-LWA, a radio array in California’s Owens Valley
that operates at frequencies of 12-85 MHz. The upgraded OVRO-LWA Stage III array
is sensitive to highly redshifted signals from neutral hydrogen’s 21 cm emission
line, which trace the intergalactic medium during the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of
Reionization. Byrne will implement novel precision data analysis techniques to
produce three key science results: (1) a measurement of the sky-averaged 21 cm
spectrum, (2) the strongest constraints to date on the power spectrum of 21 cm
fluctuations during the Cosmic Dawn, and (3) high-fidelity, polarized maps of
the low-frequency radio sky. These results will illuminate the dynamics of early
galaxy formationmand test models of cosmological evolution.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
