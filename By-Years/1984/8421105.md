This action is concerned with the transfer of a project on stabilization of
large power systems from Washington University to Texas A&amp;M University. The
objective of the research is to derive on-line digital control techniques for
thestabilization of large power systems subject to severe disruptions (such as
in emergencies). A new method has been proposed for managing the active and
reactive power in such a way as to keep all voltages within normal limits and
all currents within their thermal limits thus avoiding further stabilityproblems
under severe disruption of system operation.
