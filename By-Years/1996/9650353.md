This project is intended to foster a more comprehensive knowledge of research
methods and to infuse students with an enthusiasm for doing research. The major
goal of this project is to enhance the undergraduate course in experimental
psychology by expanding the number of computer workstations and supporting
software for conducting students experiments. All laboratory workstations used
in the project are being linked to the university network, thereby providing
access to the distributed resources of the university library, most other state
university libraries, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. In addition to
enhancing the in-laboratory information retrieval capabilities, the project is
making much of the course information available to students and interested
parties through the networking of the laboratory and a class website. The
monitored laboratory is open for student use 40 hours per week. The primary
software, MacLaboratory Psychology, is a research-grade tool that consists of a
number of experimental modules that stimulate students to explore a variety of
research problems in general experimental psychology using both basic and
advanced research methods. The project also provides students with powerful
statistical software (STATVIEW and SuperNOVA) with which to analyze the results
of the experiments they conceive, execute, and report.
