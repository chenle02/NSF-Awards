This symposium will survey critical and emerging issues in biomedical
engineering. The invited papers, mini-papers, and workshops will be collected
into a special publication and distributed throughout the bioengineering field.
It is expected that the publication will delineate the areas of greatest
expectation and greatest needs for resuources and research.
