9224765 Block This award is for partial support of junior investigators in
particle physics to enable them to attend the twenty third in a series of
symposia in September at Aspen, Colorado. These symposia are typically attended
by approximately 125 physicists, and cover a wide range of topics. The last two
symposia in the series have been in Santiago di Campostela, Spain (1992) and in
Wuhan, China (1991). The topics to be covered in the symposium, planned for
September 12-17, 1993, are of current interest to all particle physicists. ***
