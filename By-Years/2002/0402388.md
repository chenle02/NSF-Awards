In this project, faculty at Erie Community College and SUNY Buffalo's Center of
Excellence in Information Systems Assurance Research and Education are
collaborating to (1) develop four new courses ("Introduction to Computer and
Information Security," "Computer and Network Security," "Operations and Database
Security," and "Legal, Ethical, and Regulatory Framework for Information Systems
Security") and an Information Systems Security (ISS) certificate program, (2)
develop a Web site to complement the ISS program, (3) conduct "train-the-
trainer" workshops for high school teachers and presentations and demonstrations
for high school students, (4) conduct workshops and short courses for industry,
and (5) develop articulation agreements to link the community college program
with related programs at four-year colleges and universities. The new courses
and certificate program, which are offered at all three campuses of Erie
Community College, leverage courses and laboratory materials developed at other
institutions, including those developed at SUNY Buffalo for a master's-level
certificate program in information assurance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new
curriculum incorporates the cybersecurity skill standards of the National
Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET), as well as aspects of the
CNSS National Training Standards and the CompTIA Security+ framework. The
curriculum targets both traditional college students who wish to take courses in
or specialize in information systems security and industry workers who wish to
upgrade or retool their skills. Two notable features of the curriculum are its
emphasis on real-world problems and issues and its use of isolated computer
network labs, which will enable students to participate in hands-on experiments
with security penetration techniques and corresponding countermeasures and
protective approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
