Anthranilate and p-aminobenzoate synthases in selected gram-negative bacteria
will be studied. These paralogous enzymes are often encoded by a four-member
gene family, two large alpha-subunit genes and two small beta-subunit genes, but
there is conclusive evidence that some non-enteric, gram-negative bacteria as
well as Bacillus subtilis use a single beta-subunit for both enzymes.
Fluorescent pseudomonads, on the other hand, are unique so far in having
duplicate anthranilate synthase genes. Both genetic and biochemical experiments
are planned to establish the physiological function and regulation of the
anthranilate gene pair that is not involved in tryptophan synthesis. We will
also examine suppressed mutants of the tryptophan-specific enzyme in which the
second anthranilate synthase gene pair may substitute for the first. The DNA
sequence of the second anthranilate synthase shows a 23 bp overlap between the
alpha- and beta-subunit genes. Preliminary experiments indicate that this
configuration allows coupled translation of the two genes. If confirmed, these
results will extend appreciably the distance over which coupling can occur,
indicating the possible regulatory significance of similar-sized overlaps in
organisms as diverse as B. subtilis and coliphage lambda. Long-range goals are
to use the anthranilate and p-aminobenzoate family to examine the control of
genes involved in secondary metabolism in the fluorescent pseudomonads, since at
least two important secondary metabolites are believed to require their
participation.
