The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is funding Prof. J.Simons at
the University of Utah. Over the next three years work in his group will focus
on the dynamics of energy transfer and chemical reactions involving anion
species. Specifically, for anions in which the extra electron is very weakly
bound, the binding energy can be similar to the rotational energy level spacings
of the underlying molecule. So, as the molecule rotates faster and faster, its
rotational period approaches the orbiting period of motion of the electron,
energy can be efficiently transferred and electron ejection can occur. Over the
past several years, excellent experimental work in other groups has examined the
rates of auto-detachment of electrons from such anions to study the coupling
between rotation and electronic motions. In the present work, the theory of
these events as well as their computational simulations will be undertaken. The
chemist's ability to create new molecules and new materials relies heavily on
understanding the electronic motions in atoms and molecules. As the science of
chemistry enters the 21st century, it is focusing much of its efforts along two
fronts: the interface between chemical science and life science- biological
chemistry, and the design and synthesis of new materials with unusual
properties. In the latter area, it is especially important for theoretical
chemists to consider and to predict the electronic and chemical (e.g., stability
and energy content) properties of molecules that have not yet been synthesized
or even observed. An integral part of the theorists' ability to contribute to
this effort lies in knowledge of how electronic energy, momentum, and angular
momentum can be converted to energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the atoms
and molecular fragments, within a molecule. The efforts being funded in this
program are directed toward providing a basic theoretical framework for
understanding and predicting such properties.
