This EAGER project supports foundational research toward the exploration of data
quality (DQ) issues in the context of sensor networks. Speci&#64257;cally, this
project will include three major research thrusts: (1) a multidimensional DQ
model for sensor feeds that can accommodate a diverse set of DQ attributes. The
project will carry out a comprehensive study into various DQ dimensions which
will include inventing metrics and mechanisms for accurately quantifying the DQ
dimensions; (2) The project will create a service oriented architectural
framework for federated sensor service clouds in which DQ awareness is pervasive
at all levels and all aspects of the architecture. Our core idea is to
virtualize all sensors and auxiliary services in a DQ-aware manner; and (3) The
project will devise DQ-aware autonomic techniques for sensor service discovery,
feed composition and adaptation towards environmental dynamics. Our techniques
will enhance scalability by detecting feed processing tasks that are shared
among multiple user requests, as well as by cloud topology-aware distribution of
feed processing tasks.
