The Einstein Toolkit is an infrastructure that enables modeling in relativistic
astrophysics, with particular emphasis in sources of gravitational radiation.
This platform is currently being used by dozens of researchers across the world.
The proposed workshop aims at training the new generation of users/developers,
most of which are currently graduate students. The workshop is an essential tool
for keeping the ET community connected and up to date, as well as a way to
identify new developmental opportunties.
