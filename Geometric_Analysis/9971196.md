Abstract

Award: DMS-9971196 Principal Investigator: Casim Abbas

Significant progress has been made in the study of the Reeb-dynamics of a three
dimensional contact manifold and its topological implications. Past research
focused on periodic orbits of the Reeb vectorfield, while this project deals
with a different class of trajectories, the so-called characteristic chords.
These are orbits of the Reeb vectorfield that hit a given Legendrian knot twice
at two different times (or more general, a given Legendrian submanifold). In the
case of periodic orbits the main tools were pseudoholomorphic curves in the
symplectisation of the contact manifold with domain being a punctured Riemann
surface without boundary, while in the case of characteristic chords the domain
will have boundary and also punctures on the boundary. A free boundary condition
will be imposed. One aim of this project is to investigate when characteristic
chords exist, a question which is related to a conjecture of V.I. Arnold in
contact geometry. The method developed by the principal investigator is a new
version of a classical result by E. Bishop about local fillings of a real
surface near an isolated elliptic complex tangency. The other aspect of the
research project is joint work with Helmut Hofer which is providing the analytic
setting for a new invariant of Legendrian knots ("Contact Homology") in a three
dimensional contact manifold, where pseudoholomorphic curves on punctured
Riemann surfaces play the key role. This would also provide a more systematic
approach to the existence question for characteristic chords, since existence
results would imply nontriviality for the invariants in certain cases.
Approaching the existence question of characterictic chords by filling methods
is only possible if the contact manifold is three dimensional while the
construction of Contact Homology should also work in higher dimensions where
very little is known about the dynamics of the Reeb vectorfield. On the other
hand, every closed three dimensional manifold admits a contact form, with
between dynamics and topology closely related.

This research project deals with the theory of Legendrian knots and dynamical
systems induced by a Reeb vectorfield. In recent years close relationships have
been found between knot theory and quantum field theory, a part of modern
theoretical physics. Dynamical systems of Reeb type describe a very diverse
spectrum of phenomena in physics, such as the motion of a satellite in the
presence of gravitational forces, or the motion of the particles of an ideal
incompressible fluid if the motion is in an equilibrium (steady) state and the
pressure is almost constant.
