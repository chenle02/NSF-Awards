Various problems of mathematical physics can be modeled by the Laplacian or more
generally Schrodinger equations. The difference between the first two
eigenvalues of the Laplacian is referred to as the fundamental gap, which
represents the energy needed to excite a particle from ground level to the next
level in quantum mechanics. In the first project, the principal investigator
will estimate the fundamental gap for various spaces. The second project relates
to volume entropy which is a fundamental geometric invariant for compact smooth
manifolds. This concept is closely related to other notions of entropy found in
dynamical systems and plays an essential role in differential geometry and
geometric group theory among others. The work on entropy rigidity is related to
optimal transport, information geometry and discrete geometry. The project will
also support educational activities and diversity through mentoring graduate
students and postdocs; recruiting women and other underrepresented groups;
organizing seminars, workshops and research programs promoting young scholars.
The material discussed in the proposal will be the subject of an advanced
graduate course at UCSB in Fall 2021.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three
parts. The first is about eigenvalue and fundamental gap estimates of the
Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions on a convex domain in locally
symmetric spaces by comparing with some suitable 1-dim model. The second
concerns volume entropy comparison and rigidity for metric measure spaces with
curvature lower bounds. The last is to study integral curvature pinching for the
critical power using Ricci flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
