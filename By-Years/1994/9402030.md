9402030 Miller This project is on research to examine the effects of low oxygen
levels and high carbon dioxide levels on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell growth
and metabolism, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) synthesis, glycosylation, and
proteolysis. This project will also attempt to characterize the mechanisms
responsible for changes in tPA quality, and address problems that are
encountered in the large scale production of therapeutic proteins by mammalian
cell culture. ***
