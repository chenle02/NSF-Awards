The decades following the US Civil War saw the most creative period of
institution building in the history of the House of Representatives. This
innovative research seeks to draw explicit links between this critical period of
congressional history and the contemporary congress. The institutional practices
that developed during this period, such as the development of the seniority
principle and the development of the differentiated committee system loom large
in the contemporary congress. Understanding the origins and early dynamics of
these institutions can provide insights into the operation of the contemporary
house. Specifically this project provides a comprehensive accounting of
organizational change in the House of Representatives from 1870 to 1946. Data
will be collected on the committee system during the period and will be
augmented with data on member characteristics and on the political system more
generally. When completed this research not only will shed light on
congressional politics during an important and formative period of American
history but also will help us evaluate contemporary political theories about
collective choice.
