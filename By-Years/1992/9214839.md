The main purpose of this study is to analyze new region segmentation techniques
based on the temporal properties of image sequences. These techniques will
enable precise definition of regions with similar or dissimilar temporal
patterns with respect to a reference pixel or reference ROI (region of
interest). Different similarity measures (correlation coefficient, covariance,
Tanimoto coefficient, etc.) will be tested on sequences of image ROI's (regions
of interest) of various sized and spacings. The computational effectiveness of
each similarity measure will also be evaluated. In addition, a method for
automatic selection of reference ROIs will be designed and tested based on a new
idea for maximum entropy histogramming. All of the ideas will be tested by (1)
mathematical modeling, (2) application to earth resources imagery, (3)
application to medical imagery. The significance of this research is that these
new methods are of great importance in dynamic image analysis due to the
enormous size of the data base to be processed. For example, a single spectral
component of Landsat imagery taken of a single region on the surface of the
earth over 10 years is composed of about three billion data points (pixels).
Clearly, extremely efficient computational techniques are necessary to analyze
dynamic temporal changes and they will have a potential use as a research tool
in quantitative imaging. Fortunately, the segmentation techniques developed for
time series analysis of one type of image data can be employed for time series
segmentation of other type of image data. For example, the techniques developed
for satellite image sequences can be used for analyzing medical data, and vice
versa. The results obtained in this study will lead into a long term goal of
establishing models and techniques for the study of temporal behavior of imaged
structures and improve our ability to extract quantitative information contained
in dynamic images.
