The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel theoretical framework to
describe both, coherent and dissipative processes in dense atomic samples, and
to apply this theory in several experimentally relevant situations. The aim is
to describe the effects involving multi-atom quantum correlations due to dipole-
dipole coupling mediated by radiation fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basis for
the proposed work is a formalism that can successfully describe atom-field
interactions in dense gases by reducing a many-body multi-mode Hamiltonian to an
effective single-atom equation. The formalism will be applied to investigate the
following problems: (i) application of this formalism to novel experimental
setups such as dense quasi-one dimensional atomic clouds on surface magnetic
traps (\atom chips"); (ii) generalization of the formalism to include dipole-
dipole quantum correlations; (iii) chirping in a superradiant system; (iv)
special investigation of super- and subradiant states and comparison with few-
atom models; (v) using the outcome of the above calculations to interpret and
predict realistic systems, in particular in a quasi-1D ultracold atom cloud on
an atom chip and an ultracold gas of Rydberg atoms. &lt;br/&gt;
