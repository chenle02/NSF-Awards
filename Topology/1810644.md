Foliation theory is a field of mathematics, which is roughly 50 years old, whose
object of study is certain decomposition of manifolds into path-connected
subsets, called leaves. A foliation looks locally like a decomposition of the
manifold as a union of parallel submanifolds of lower dimensions. Such geometric
structures naturally arise in physics and geology. And in mathematics the depth
and breadth of foliated objects made mathematicians use tools from many
different branches of mathematics including differential geometry, homotopy
theory, noncommutative geometry, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The PI
intends to use new tools from homotopy theory to investigate the relation
between foliations and diffeomorphism groups.

The existence and classification of foliations and the implication of such
structures on the global topology of manifolds have been extensively studied in
the past five decades. However, there are still many mysteries, perhaps the most
important of which in the homotopy theory of foliation is the Haefliger
conjecture. Haefliger asked whether all plane fields on a manifold whose
dimensions are roughly less than the half of the dimension of the manifold are
integrable up to homotopy. It was shown by Mather and Thurston that the homotopy
theory of foliations is naturally related to the homological invariants of the
diffeomorphism groups made discrete. But the group homologies of diffeomorphism
groups as discrete groups tend to be very large and are poorly understood. On
the other hand diffeomorphism group with the Whitney topology is better
understood, in particular, Galatius and Randal-Williams' program developed new
tools to study the classifying space of these groups with the Whitney topology.
The PI's plan is to combine the new homotopy theoretical methods that stem from
the evolving field of the moduli space of manifolds with the classical foliation
theory to study homological invariants of diffeomorphism groups made discrete.
