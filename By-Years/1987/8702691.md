Spectroscopic observations of a number of Seyfert type 1 galaxies will be
continued to determine the temporal behavior of the broad emission lines. It has
been shown that the variability of the broad-lines in the spectra reveals
important information about the line-emitting regions and the central energy
sources that cannot be obtained in any other way. The primary purpose of the
research is to determine the size and kinematics of the broad-line emitting
regions in active galactic nuclei. Observations will be made with the new Ohio
State University Change-Coupled Device (CCD) Spectrograph on the Perkins 1.8-m
telescope at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Some of these will be supplemented
with ultraviolet observations made with the International Ultraviolet Explorer
(IUE) satellite and possibly with the Space Telescope. These simultaneous
optical and ultraviolet spectra will be used in comparisons with the predictions
of current photoionization models.
