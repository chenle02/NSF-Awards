Activated carbon adsorption is one of the best available techniques for removing
organic compounds from air and water. Unfortunately, the costs associated with
this process put it out of reach for many potential users. Thermal regeneration
of the activated carbon is a major cost associated with its use. New innovative
thermal regeneration techniques are needed to help control the cost of activated
carbon adsorption and thereby foster more widespread use of this technique for
recovering organic pollutants from air and water. This research seeks to
demonstrate a new approach for thermally regenerating spent activated carbon. If
successful, the result will be a regenerating process that is far more cost-
effective than conventional regenerating techniques. This process could be
operated at remote sites and field camps in the polar regions
