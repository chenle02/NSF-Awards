The Multi-functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) I/UCRC is motivated by
three major research/industry trends: 1.) Stepping beyond the current challenge
of continued conventional scaling of integrated circuits (Moore?s Law); 2.)
Exploring new functionalities at intersections of materials, processes, devices,
and circuits for multi-functional systems; and 3.) Integrating nanoscale
materials into micro/nanosystem manufacturing. Through industry-driven
collaborative research initiatives, interdisciplinary mixing will be promoted at
the MIST Center in order to catalyze innovation opportunities such as
combinations of computing, sensing, actuation, and energy storage/generation on
the same system on a chip (SoC) or system in package (SiP). The MIST Center
intends to contribute to the definition of the roadmap to next-generation
integrated electronic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research at the MIST Center
aims to link industry and academia and connect research advances in materials
science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices,
MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies. The proposed MIST I/UCRC
plans to integrate a strong team of complementary investigators, train the next
generation of graduate students who are versed in the center?s precompetitive
research, actively recruit and mentor participants from underrepresented groups
in science and engineering drawing on programs at each center site, and team
with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations.
