Goodwin&lt;br/&gt;0332793&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
award provides funds to develop the Phase I Pilot - protocol development stage
of a program that the PI's hope will lead to the development and deployment of
an in-situ biosensor for remote quantification of aquatic organisms. The
biosensor would use electrochemical detection to measure rDNA in the environment
without target amplification by the polymerase chair reaction (PCR). Gene-based
remote sensing requires the development of easy-to-use, fast, inexpensive,
miniaturized analytical devices. Electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization
is uniquely qualified to meet size, cost, and power requirements of field
systems. This Phase I development will focus on two critical components of
biosensor technology development - remote DNA extraction and direct detection of
DNA without using PCR amplification. Meeting these two challenges are critical
first steps toward developing the next generation of remote sensing technology.
Species-specific data generation in conjunction with synoptic measurements of
relevant environmental variables could significantly contribute to the
understanding of a variety of processes related to plankton dynamics, initiation
of algal blooms, and the spread of coral disease. Biosensors to monitor toxic
organisms could provide early warnings of the need to close fisheries or
beaches.&lt;br/&gt;****&lt;br/&gt;
