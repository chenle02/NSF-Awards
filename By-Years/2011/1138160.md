The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental research
platform designed to extend our understanding of the biosphere to regional and
continental scales. Through remote sensing, in-situ observation,
experimentation, synthesis, and modeling, NEON will provide researchers with a
unique capability to quantify the strong and weak forces regulating the
biosphere and predict its response to climate and landuse change. NEON
infrastructure will include field deployed instrumented towers and sensor
arrays, remote sensing capabilities, cutting-edge laboratory instrumentation,
natural history archives, and facilities for data analysis, modeling,
visualization, and forecasting, all networked through a cyberinfrastructure
backbone. Infrastructure will be deployed across the continental US, Alaska,
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico using a statistically determined design, stratified by
climate and landuse. The knowledge base NEON will create, its real time and
continuous integrated data, simulation and observation capabilities, and its
networked communication will be an asset for formal and informal education and
training. A NEON gateway will provide resources to support informal public
education and provide opportunities for citizens to actively participate in
scientific investigations.This award is the adminstrative framework for the
construction and operations of the National Ecological Observatory Network.
