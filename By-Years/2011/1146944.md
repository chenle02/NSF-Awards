During development and regeneration of the nervous system, neurons send out
processes guided by the neuronal growth cone, a highly motile sensing structure
and an excellent model system to study the dynamic interactions between cell
surface, signaling, and cytoskeletal proteins such as actin. Although
significant progress has been made in identifying the molecules involved in
directional growth cone migration, the underlying mechanisms are not well
understood. Particularly, the relationship between mechanical and biochemical
signaling in neuronal growth and guidance remains a mystery. To fill this
knowledge gap, this project will investigate how Src tyrosine kinase, a key
signaling enzyme, regulates actin organization and dynamics as well as adhesion-
mediated growth and force production of live neurons. Specifically, this project
will determine which aspects of actin dynamics are regulated by Src as well as
the relationship between force production and Src signaling in adhesion-mediated
growth. To reach this goal, quantitative fluorescent imaging of cytoskeletal
dynamics and Src activation will be combined with biophysical approaches
involving micropipettes and the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).

This research will significantly improve the understanding of how cells
integrate sensing, signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics during directional
migration. The project involves training of High School, undergraduate, and
graduate students in cutting-edge live cell imaging and biophysical techniques.
The results will not only be disseminated to the scientific community, but also
to the broad public through a web site called "CELLebration" displaying movies,
images, and educational material about cell motility, through presentations at
local schools, and public outreach events at Purdue University (Spring Fest and
NanoDays). In summary, through high-quality digital imaging presentations, this
work will increase the public awareness for the need for quantitative microscopy
and biophysical approaches to solve key cell biological problems.
