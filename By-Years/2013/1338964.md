Researchers propose a self-calibrating integrated approach that operates at the
hardware, signal processing and user interface levels to adapt to the new
recording session with the least burden on the user as outlined here: 1) The
hardware and circuit level approach, where the aim is to find input contact
mismatch by injecting a reference signal of known amplitude and observe the
common-mode rejection ration (CMMR) of the circuits and electrodes. Artifacts of
this reference signal manifest themselves when the electrode coupling is
worsening. 2) Employing the signal processing calibration techniques to resolve
the strong variation in electroencephalography (EEG) signals from one session to
another. Specifically, the research team proposes adaptive training algorithms
to utilize relevant information from prior recording sessions to shorten or even
omit the calibration time for the next session. 3) Creating customizable user
interface in order to produce a more user friendly interface that create less
burden on the user. More adaptive user interfaces will lead to more comfortable
use, higher transfer rate and better accuracy in realization of the user
intents. Researchers plan to develop an inexpensive, easy-to-wear, and low power
brain computer interface (BCI) system that uses dry-contact EEG electrodes and
can be connected to the computer via Bluetooth and is suitable for real-time
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EEG systems have been around for a
relatively long time and their applications have been mostly inside the
laboratories. However, BCI applications can potentially include any real-world
interaction in our daily life. The introduction of low profile, and inexpensive
BCI devices with the size of a cellphone and comparable prices create
opportunities for new applications controlled with our thoughts, expressions and
emotions. For instance, with the rising incidence of chronic diseases, a major
health care application for BCI self-calibrating devices is wearable in-home
assessment systems to quantify the existence of symptoms or effectiveness of
treatments for brain deficiencies through long term EEG recording and analysis.
BCI technology has great potentials to become the most common communication
alternative for users interacting with computers. For instance, BCI devices are
capable of emerging in the gaming industry. It enables the consumers to
experience an entirely new form of human-machine interaction by eliminating the
conventional joysticks for gaming, entertainment, navigation and rehabilitation.
