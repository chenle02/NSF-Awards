The Chemical Catalysis Program supports the research of Professor Dean M.
Roddick of the University of Wyoming on the development of perfluoroalkylated
phosphine (PFAP) metal complex catalysts for the efficient conversion of simple
hydrocarbon feedstocks to useful products. Specific challenges for investigation
are the selective dehydrogenation of alkanes and tandem oxidation of alkanes to
alcohols and ketones, as well as the controlled oligomerization of
fluoroolefins. A key feature of PFAP systems is their unique air- and moisture-
stability, which allows metal reaction centers to carry out fundamental C-H and
C-C bond forming steps under stringent oxidative and hydrolytic conditions.
Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies further suggest that group 10 metal PFAP
systems are particularly well-suited to novel fluoroolefin oligomerization and
polymerization chemistry.

This award will provide a twofold impact on the larger community. First, this
research project addresses several critically important and unrealized research
challenges in catalysis. Discovery of practical and efficient conversion
methodologies from abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks to useful chemical precursors
and feedstocks would transform chemical industry, improve atom economy and
increase synthetic efficiencies. Second, Professor Roddick's research group
trains not only graduate and undergraduate students as future professionals in
catalysis research, but also spearheads outreach to community colleges
throughout Wyoming through visits and workshops, and also collaborates and
contributes to the newly-formed School of Energy Resources at the University of
Wyoming.
