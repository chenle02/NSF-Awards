Abstract Narrative Professor Scott and doctoral student Angel will gather
detailed data on production and employment from individual firms and workers in
the U.S. semiconductor industry, by means of questionnaires and personal
interviews. Particular attention will be devoted to questions of job matching,
job turnover, and the inter-firm mobility of skilled and unskilled segments of
the semiconductor labor force. The purpose of this research is to determine how
local labor markets are organized in the U.S. semiconductor industry, and in
particular, the ways in which the organization and operations of local labor
markets produce external economies of scale that cause and sustain the
agglomeration of the industry in regions of concentration, especially in Santa
Clara County, California. The project will also produce insights into the ways
firms select dispersed locations in small, often non-metropolitan labor markets
for some of their production. Understanding the locational dynamics of high-tech
industries such as semiconductors is important from the standpoint of industrial
location theory as well as from the perspective of national and international
economic and industrial policy. Professor Scott's previous research has made
major contributions to location theory, and this research promises to yield
additional insights along similar lines.
