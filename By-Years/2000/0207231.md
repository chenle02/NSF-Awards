&lt;br/&gt;The investigator attempts to classify square-integrable tamely
ramified &lt;br/&gt;representations of split reductive p-adic groups G and their
inner &lt;br/&gt;forms, by means of homomorphisms from the tame Weil-Deligne
group into &lt;br/&gt;the dual group of G. This project is part of the local
Langlands &lt;br/&gt;conjecture for such groups. The representations are
partitioned into &lt;br/&gt;finite sets, called ``L-packets". The method is a
p-adic analogue &lt;br/&gt;of Lusztig's Jordan decomposition for finite
reductive groups. &lt;br/&gt;From a functorial point of view, the tame L-packets
are bijective &lt;br/&gt;lifts of unipotent L-packets for quasi-split groups and
their inner &lt;br/&gt;forms. Properties of the L-packets, such as formal
degrees &lt;br/&gt;and Whittaker models, will also be
investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symmetry is an effective way to
study mathematical and &lt;br/&gt;physical objects. A Group is a collection of
symmetries, and &lt;br/&gt;Representation Theory is the study of how these
symmetries manifest in &lt;br/&gt;different ways. As a simple example, there is
a group of sixty &lt;br/&gt;symmetries consisting of permutations of five
objects, and this group &lt;br/&gt;also manifests as the sixty symmetries of an
icosohedron, and of the &lt;br/&gt;fullerene molecule. The investigator studies
certain infinite groups of &lt;br/&gt;infinite dimensional symmetries. In the
past forty years, &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and physicists have guessed that
there may be deep &lt;br/&gt;relations between such symmetries and fundamental,
as yet undiscovered, &lt;br/&gt;properties of numbers. The investigator attempts
to confirm part of &lt;br/&gt;these conjectures, and make them more explicit.
