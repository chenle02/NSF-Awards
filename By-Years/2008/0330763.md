0330763&lt;br/&gt;Paulino&lt;br/&gt;Travel support is provided for about ten
U.S. researchers in mechanics of&lt;br/&gt;advanced materials to participate in
a joint workshop with researchers from&lt;br/&gt;a number of Brazilian
universities. The workshop will be held in Rio de&lt;br/&gt;Janeiro, June 9-13,
2003 and will include a short course for advanced&lt;br/&gt;graduate students.
The purpose of the workshop is to explore areas of&lt;br/&gt;collaborative
research in micro-, nano- and bio-mechanics of materials,&lt;br/&gt;including
smart (active), composites, and functionally graded materials.
