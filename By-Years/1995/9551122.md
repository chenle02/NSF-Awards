Students need experiences that extend the classroom into the environment so that
they can see how their scientific training can benefit their community. Further,
schools need to enhance programs that attract women and minorities to science
majors. Finally, coastal communities need the information that marine science
programs can provide about important environmental issues. With this equipment,
the academy is establishing "A Center for Marine and Freshwater Analysis" to
provide a necessary educational component to a new major entitled Marine Safety
and Environmental Protection. The center consists of a portable laboratory
containing analytical instrumentation. Faculty and students manage the center
and use equipment both in the laboratory and at sea to test marine and fresh
waters for substances of environmental concern. The Center (1) provides students
with hands-on experience in testing waters; (2) enhances the academy's newest
and most successful major in attracting underrepresented students toward careers
in science; (3) forms important linkages between the academy and local
environmental agencies such as The Coalition for Buzzards Bay.
