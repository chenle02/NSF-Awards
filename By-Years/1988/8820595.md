This project provides partial support for planning a national conference and
clearinghouse on computer ethics. The planning advisory group includes
philosophers, computer professionals, and social scientists. Among them are key
people in the Association for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electronic and
Electrical Engineers, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, and the
American Philosophical Association. There are specialists in computing education
and accreditation and five journal editors. The principal investigator will
circulate a proposal for the conference and clearinghouse to this group, who
will critique and expand it. The next version will be circulated to group
members, who will meet to discuss and refine the plans further. A new proposal
will be submitted to NSF. It will include details about the conference program,
who will participate, how prospective attendees will be informed and selected,
how the journals which planning group members (and others) edit will be used to
further the project, and follow.up and follow.on activities. Computing is
changing social interactions and raising new ethical concerns. This project
provides a basis for developing an ongoing network that can help us to respond
to these new developments with adequate research and educational programs. The
investigator and his advisors are exceptionally well qualified to undertake this
planning activity; institutional support is very good; the award request is very
modest. Support in the amount of $13,755 is recommended.
