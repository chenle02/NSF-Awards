With this award the PI will sample living corals in the Galapagos islands that
face a threat of serious damage in the next several months, a period during
which a moderate to strong El Nino episode is predicted by most dynamical model
forecasts of ENSO. Previous El Nino episodes have caused upwards of 95% coral
mortality in the region, and the reef identified for sampling in this project
may be the only living Porites (massive coral) of century-plus age remaining in
the Galapagos archipelago. Based on the measured sizes and growth rates, the PIs
predict that these corals preserve an annually-resolved record of sea surface
temperature over the past one to three centuries, which represents a substantial
extension of existing coral record length in the region. Records from the new
cores will provide a critical piece of the puzzle in determining how the
equatorial gradient of SST has evolved over the past century and will shed light
on the mechanisms by which ENSO responds to anthropogenic climate forcing. The
field program will involve a PhD student from the University of Arizona and a
graduate student from Ecuador.
