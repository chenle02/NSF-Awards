During evolution of terrestrial plants, the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide
(CO2) declined, resulting in a limitation on the capacity for photosynthesis,
especially under higher temperatures, drought and/or saline conditions.
Consequently, some plants evolved a biochemical inorganic carbon pump through a
C4 cycle, so they are called C4 plants. While C4 plants account for less than
10% of terrestrial species, they are estimated to account for about 30% of
global terrestrial productivity because of their success under extreme climatic
conditions. This is due to their effectiveness in carbon assimilation and
efficiency of water use. Unfortunately, most crops lack this carbon pump, which
limits their productivity and our ability to extend production into less
favorable habitats. Plants not possessing C4 photosynthesis have one
photosynthetic cell type in their leaves. The dogma for about 35 years has been
that photosynthesis occurs in all terrestrial C4 plants by the cooperative
function of two photosynthetic cell types: an outer layer of palisade cells,
where atmospheric CO2 is captured by the C4 cycle, and an inner layer of bundle
sheath cells, where the CO2 is concentrated through the C4 cycle and used in
carbon assimilation (called "Kranz anatomy"). However, we have shown recently
that C4 photosynthesis can function in a single photosynthetic cell based on
studies on a member of the family Chenopodiaceae. The results suggest that Kranz
anatomy is not required for function of the CO2 concentrating mechanism, and
that two types of chloroplasts, each with specialized functions, can occur
within a single photosynthetic cell. In this project we will determine the
mechanism and efficiency of single cell C4 photosynthesis considering
biochemistry, compartmentation of required enzymes within the photosynthetic
cell, characteristics of oxygen production and CO2 exchange. Information on
biochemistry and spatial compartmentation will be used to develop a mechanistic
model to test how C4 photosynthesis can function in a single photosynthetic
cell. Since little is known about genetic control of development of Kranz type
C4 plants, we will also study, by mutational analysis, whether single genes
control development of their specialized anatomy and biochemical
compartmentation. There is great interest in the potential for genetic
engineering of crops, such as rice, to perform C4 photosynthesis. Our project
will suggest rational strategies for genetic modifications to increase
productivity via increased capacity for photosynthesis.
