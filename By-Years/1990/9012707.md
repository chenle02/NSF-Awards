This is a two-ship multichannel seismic field program that will provide the
first detailed geophysical constraints on the crustal structure along the East
Pacific Rise south of the Garrett fracture zone. Three types of data will be
collected: (1) twenty closely-space, single-ship multichannel seismic reflection
profiles along the East Pacific Rise; (2) twenty- five two-ship expanding spread
profiles along and parallel to the rise axis in this same area; and (3) a
700-km-long multichanel seismic reflection profile along the East Pacific Rise
from the Garrett fracture zone to the large overlapping spreading center at
20.5S. These data will be used to test the spreading rate dependence of magma
chamber size predicted by many ridge crest thermal models, examine the
relationship between crustal magma chambers andalong-axis changes in morphology,
segmentation and basalt geochemistry, and to resolve better how the first-order
seismic structure of oceanic crust, including Moho and seismic layer 3,
developed during the first few hundred thousand years after crustal formation.
The section of the East Pacific Rise south of the Garrett fracture zone is to be
a major focus of the RIDGE initiative.
