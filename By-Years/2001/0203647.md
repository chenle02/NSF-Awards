Proposal title: Complex differential geometry and rigidity Proposal number: DMS

Abstract

The proposer plans to do research in the following three topics in differential
geometry: 1) the geometry of nonpositively curved Riemannian manifolds with
degenerate Ricci tensor; 2) the structure of compact Kaehler manifold with
nonpositive bisectional curvature; 3) metric rigidity/non-rigidity for complex
hyperbolic spaces. For topic 1), the proposer has obtained some results in the
real analytic cases, and he proposes to investigate the smooth cases in this
context. For 2), he has studied the class of compact Kaehler manifolds with
nonpositive bisectional curvature. Under some additional non-degenerateness
assumption, he was able to obtain a structural result for such manifolds, which
can be viewed as the dual version of classical Howard-Smyth-Wu splitting
theorem. He would like to study the general case, as well as some other related
questions regarding this type of manifolds. For topic 3), he proposes to study
two metric rigidity questions about the complex hyper! bolic space, in dimension
two or higher. One is a non-equivariant metric rigidity question for quarter-
pinched metrics, the other is for some special type of CAT(0) singular metrics.

The proposed research lies in the field of differential geometry, which is a
branch of mathematics aimed at understanding the interplay between the global
structure and the curvature (which measures the bending) of a given space. The
major models of spaces in this study are Riemannian manifolds and Kaehler
manifolds. This field is of importance not only to many branches of mathematics,
but also to other sciences and engineering such as physics. A well known example
is the use of Riemannian geometry in Einstein's theory of the general
relativity. Another example is that the modern control theory uses almost
exclusively tools developed in differential geometry. Within the field of
differential geometry, the study of nonpositively curved spaces and the rigidity
phenomenon often associated with such spaces has been on the center stage since
early 70's, after the discovery of Mostow and Margulis. It has drawn much
attention in 80's and 90's from the mathematical world. The proposer and others
are trying to investigate these topics for Kaehler manifolds, which are
Riemannian manifolds with a special type of structure. The recent development in
string theory suggests that the universe is the ten dimensional product space of
the usual (four dimensional) space time and a compact six dimensional cross
section which should be a special kind of Kaehler manifold (the so-called
Calabi-Yau spaces). Besides reasons and existing/potential application outside
mathematics, Kaehler geometry has become more of more important within many
fields of pure and applied mathematics.
