This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
Program. The study will link theories of employment discrimination based on
economic outcomes with those based on institutional processes to present a more
comprehensive picture of the direct and indirect effects of laws on changing
patterns of employment discrimination. Analysis is based on civil cases of
employment discrimination by states using existing and recoded data, newly
assembled data from histories of state employment discrimination policies, and
measures of employment inequality using census data. The time covered is from
1960 to 1990. %%% This study will contribute to sociological understanding of
the variable affects of anti-discrimination laws on the work experiences of
women and blacks and add to theory and research in the sociology of law, social
movements, and social stratification. The findings will be of use to policy-
makers concerned with the use of legal means to remedy discriminatory practices.
In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award
will materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to the future scientific manpower of the
nation and the thorough training of the next generation of social scientists.
