The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), on
behalf of its 360 member institutions, will conduct a set of activities intended
to make readily available the computer-readable data resources from the 1990
U.S. Census of Population and Housing. These activities include: (1) acquisition
of substantially all data produced by the 1990 Census; (2) provision of multiple
modes of access to the data without charge to scholars at ICPSR member
institutions and at a nominal charge to individuals at nonmember academic
institutions; (3) provision of custom subsetting capabilities to allow
researchers to acquire the data needed for specific research applications; and
(4) provision of training in the use of 1990 Census data. The project will
receive additional financial support from ICPSR membership dues, a Joint
Statistical Agreement with the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and a grant from the
National Institute on Aging. The project will be conducted over a three-year
period (1992-1995)
