Professor McDuff has recently concentrated her attention on 4-dimensional
manifolds, using and developing techniques first introduced by Gromov. She has
shown that a large class of minimal symplectic 4-manifolds (those containing
"nice" symplectically embedded 2-spheres) carry a unique symplectic structure in
each cohomology class. She intends to continue this work: for example, to see if
she can extend the above result to manifolds which contain a symplectically
embedded surface of higher genus, or to see if she can find a 4-manifold which
supports different symplectic and Kahler structures in the same cohomology
class. The class of symplectic 4-manifolds lies between the class of Kahler
surfaces and the class of smooth 4- manifolds, and, if it turns out that
symplectic 4-manifolds behave nicely enough, one might be able to use
information on their structure to obtain information on the class of 4-manifolds
itself. Professor Jones will continue his joint research with F. T. Farrell. One
of their most recent results states that the surgery L-groups and the rational
algebraic K-groups for the group ring ZG can be computed in a simple way from
the L-groups and rational K-groups of group rings ZG', where G' is any virtually
cyclic subgroup G' in G provided G is a co-compact discrete subgroup of a
virtually connected Lie group. In the next three years they hope to prove this
same result for more general groups G. Symplectic manifolds arise in the study
of mechanics, both classical and quantum. Lie groups are also ubiquitous in
mechanics. It would seem that mathematics and theoretical physics are not
entirely distinct subjects at this level.
