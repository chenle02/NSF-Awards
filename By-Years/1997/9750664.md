The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
(GC/MS) to improve the undergraduate chemistry laboratory program by
incorporating mass spectrometry laboratory experiences within the existing
framework of the laboratory courses. The project operation requires the purchase
of a benchtop GC/MS suitable for teaching, routine analysis, and senior research
applications. Increasingly complex laboratory utilization of the instrument is
possible as the students progress from introductory organic chemistry to
instrumental analysis and physical chemistry and finally to senior research
applications. These laboratory experiences complement and supplement the
students past laboratory experiences which have been centered around an array of
basic instrumentation and a few more sophisticated items. These additional
laboratory experiences better equip graduates to meet the challenges of industry
and graduate programs. *
