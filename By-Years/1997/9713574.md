This project will combine data from the DMSP and NOAA polar orbiting spacecraft
from 1984 - 1997 to develop and compute indices representing magnetotail
stretching, the open/closed boundary location and shape, and the enclosed open
magnetic flux. Automated techniques based on neural nets will be used to process
the vast amounts of data to develop a database containing information on the
magnetospheric state. This will enable statistical and prediciton filter studies
as well as provide general availability of the indices for community use. The
investigators will utilize the database for correlation and prediction filter
studies.
