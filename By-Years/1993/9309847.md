9309847 Luu With this Research Planning Grant, Dr. Luu will explore the
feasibility of using new infrared array spectrographs to determine the
compositions of comet nuclei and Trojan asteroids. The infrared technique should
serve as a powerful probe of the composition of primitive objects in the outer
Solar System, and provide a unique means to study the conditions and processes
of the early Solar System.
