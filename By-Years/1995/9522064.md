Non-technical Summary, Grubb T. IBN-9522064 Patterns and Processes in a Non-
ecotone Hybrid Zone. Recent advances in molecular genetics have spurred interest
in hybrid zones. Work has focused on specifying the width of hybrid zones,
searching for correlations between the locations of such zones and environmental
clines, and examining hybrid-zone dynamics through time. Progress has been
slower in describing behavioral and genetic processes responsible for the
observed patterns. This proposal focuses on behavioral and genetic factors
maintaining the hybrid zone between two small passerine birds, the Carolina
chickadee (Parus carolinensis) and the black-capped chickadee (Parus
atricapillus). The project will assess experimentally whether a hybrid zone is
maintained by differential reproductive success of hybrids to environmental
factors or by genetic incompatibility of hybrids. The findings of this study
should elucidate fundamental evolutionary processes involved in speciation.
