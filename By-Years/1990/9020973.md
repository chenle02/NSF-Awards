Under the guidance of Dr. Elizabeth Wing, Ms. Susan DeFrance (a graduate
student at the University of Florida), will collect archaeological data for her
doctoral dissertation. Focussing on a series of sites excavated in the Moquegua
river valley in southern Peru, she will analyze faunal remains to determine the
effect that the introduction of Old World domestic animals had on the indigenous
pastoral system, as well as the reciprocal transformation which occurred in
Spanish colonial culture. The sites selected span the Spanish colonial period as
well as the altitudinal gradient from coastal plains to Andean highlands. The
faunal materials are housed at the University of Florida as well as in Peru. Ms.
DeFrance will now focus on the latter. Prior to the Spanish conquest of Peru,
native Americans domesticated a number of animals including the llama, alpaca
and guinea pig, all indigenous to the region. Because each species has specific
environmental requirements, the distribution of each was limited. The
introduction by the Spanish of Old World domesticates such as cows and donkeys
created a competitive situation where one set of species appeared to succeed in
one environment and the second set in another. The details of this process,
however, are not well understood. Through examination of relevant archaeological
materials Ms. DeFrance hopes to gain additional insight. The research will also
help to elucidate the process of culture contact and increase understanding of
how different ways of life affect and in turn are affected by others. This
research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the early
history of Peru as well as processes of biological and cultural interaction. The
social fabric which was established during Spanish colonial times persists into
the present day and much of the political unrest which characterizes Peru today
can best be explained in this context. Finally this project will assist in the
training of an extremely promising student.
