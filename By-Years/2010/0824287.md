Introduction: The PI proposes to spend a year of full-time research examining
methodological and philosophical questions having to do with a particular type
of climate modeling, one that is at the forefront of prediction efforts. She
will investigate the issue of model inclusion in ensembles, which ties in with
general issues of model evaluation. The PI already has a manuscript on this
topic, and wants to develop a more detailed analysis. At issue are general
questions of how to interpret computational models in science, their use in
predictions, and their evaluation. She will investigate the presentation of
ensemble predictions as probability distributions, and in doing so will address
the following questions. How do you judge model quality (meaning which models
should be included in the ensemble)? How should the results of ensemble modeling
be used? How should the models and the inferred probabilities be interpreted?
What alternatives are there? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
disagreement among climate scientists about the practices of ensemble prediction
provides a prime opportunity for philosophical work. The proposed work will
strengthen philosophy of science by bringing climate science into the realm of
sciences attended to by the field, complementing work on biology, physics, and
psychology. The idea behind this project is outstanding noting that the
methodological challenges in the interpretation of the results of predictive
modeling of this sort could not be more stark, nor the philosophical dimension
of the issues more compelling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The
philosophical issues raised in the proposal are of wide interest, spanning all
of the modeling sciences, including cognitive science, neuroscience, geography,
etc. The researcher should be able to maximize this potential impact by
examining the similarities and dissimilarities with ensemble modeling in biology
and/or physics and to describe the results in a way that is accessible to a
broad audience.&lt;br/&gt;
