ABSTRACT A conference on Asia-Mainland/Austronesian Connections is planned to
capitalize on the aggregation of historical/comparative linguists,
archaeologists, and physical anthropologists who will be in residence at the
University of Hawaii during 1992-93, and the increasing attention of recent
years to the question of the origins of the ancestors of the Austronesian
speaking people. The conference will augment the group already in Hawaii with
others whose work relates to the possibility of an Asia-Mainland origin and who
have established themselves as among the chief proponents, or the chief critics,
of one or another of the major extant hypotheses as to those origins. Evidence
for the various hypotheses will be presented and debated during the four-day
conference. The proceedings will be published in a single issue of Oceanic
Linguistics: Special Publications.
