Abstract Savin

This award supports research in several areas of representation theory and
modular forms with applications to number theory. In particular, we propose to
determine the Howe correspondence for generic square-integrable representations
of classical p-adic groups. This work is based on the recent classification of
generic square-integrable representations of classical p-adic groups due to
Goran Muic.

The theory of modular forms was born more then a century ago, as powerful
techniques of complex analysis were introduced to attack classical problems in
number theory. It has remained a vibrant mathematical subject throughout the
20th century with applications in physics, and more recently in computer
science, coding theory in particular.
