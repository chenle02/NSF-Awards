As a design progresses, the design space becomes more constrained due to the
decisions that have been made. For example, once a construction material has
been chosen, all the properties of that material become constraints that limit
and shape future decisions in the design. A constraint model of design will be
created that will keep a system of accounts for the designer as a design
evolves. The constraint model also includes the idea of appropriate level of
detail--that is, the required level of knowledge of properties of a material are
different at different points in the design process. A computer model that
presents too much information too soon is not useful to the designer. To develop
this model, the researchers will study how designers frame the design tasks in
different computational environments and how designers work in the different
environments of architecture and engineering. As part of the research, a survey
and critique of current models and methods for design will be undertaken. One
area of emphasis will be the differences and similarities in architectural and
engineering design.
