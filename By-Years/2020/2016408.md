The instrumentation request in this proposal is to replace the seismic source
controller system and associated equipment on Langseth. The equipment is beyond
end of life and no longer supported by the vendor. This system is critical to
marine seismic acquisition on the vessel. The new system is a commonly used
industry source controller that is manufacturer supported. All instrumentation
is for shared use among all National Science Foundation funded
researchers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GunLink 2K Source Controller $988,264
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact
of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal
Guidelines (NSF 19-602). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to
use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded
oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by
the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and
operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any
US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their
research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of
potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
