0241007 Reid&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the circulation of the
various layers lying beneath the Intermediate water. This will follow from the
results of the separate studies of the top-to-bottom circulation of the
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans (Reid, 1994, 1997, and in press). Some
preliminary work has been done on the overturning streamlines in the three
oceans . These deeper layers include the warm, saline, oxygen-rich and nutrient-
poor waters formed in the northern North Atlantic and the less-saline and colder
waters formed around Antarctica and in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. The
shallowest of these layers is the North Atlantic Deep Water. This very saline
layer can be recognized throughout the Atlantic Ocean, along the Antarctic
circumpolar current, and extending northward into the Indian and Pacific oceans.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be done by examining the patterns of
salinity, oxygen, and silica along isopycnal surfaces and on vertical sections.
The work should have a broad impact on studies of exchanges of water, heat,
salt, and nutrients both vertically and among the three oceans. It may provide a
background against which the various climate studies can be examined. One of the
problems in studying ocean circulation is that it is possible to achieve models
that balance heat transport and mass but do not have realistic flow patterns,
and that results based upon geostrophic shear and tracers (Reid's work in the
three oceans) may have balanced total transport and realistic flow patterns but
do not balance heat transport or circulation within layers.
