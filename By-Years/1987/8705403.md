An outstanding problem in numerical modeling of atmospheric circulation is
representation of cloudiness associated with vigorous convection. An associated
problem is the interaction between cloud and radiation processes which often
dictate the ambient environment at a place. The PI, Dr. Betts, has developed a
novel formalism called the saturation point method which allows accurate
representation of vigorous convection in numerical models. Dr. Betts now
proposes to apply this method in observational and theoretical studies of
atmospheric convection. He plans to actively participate in application of the
method to data collected during the 1987 field phase of the "FIRE Project" (a
U.S. regional experiment to study cloud.radiation interaction). His work could
potentially lead to accurate development of numerical schemes to represent
vigorous convection in global forecast models.
