This Special Minority Award provides a second year of support for Pablo Saez, a
graduate student at Stanford University. The award will allow Mr. Saez to finish
his course work expeditiously and reach the research participation phase sooner.
This award is an integral part of the strategy of the National Science
Foundation to strengthen and increase minority participation in the field of
physics.
