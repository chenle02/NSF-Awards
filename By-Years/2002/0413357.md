In collaboration with PSERC, the Power Systems Engineering Research Center, the
Principal Investigator proposes to investigate the use of alternative control
signals for FACTS devices, with the objective of improving the use of
transmission facilities and optimizing the transfer capability of the high
voltage grid. The project will focus on developing closed-loop dynamic system
models for integrating FACTS devices into a control structure that will
incorporate new control signals based on transmission congestion, transmission
losses, and transmission and energy prices. This project will also create new
opportunities for students to learn about one of the largest industries in the
economy - an industry of significant national interest at the core of our
infrastructure, which has been suffering from a steady decline in student
interest and therefore course enrollment.
