9520743 VIRGINIA Aridland productivity is closely linked to the organic carbon
cycle. Few studies address changes in soil carbon resulting from
desertification. Previous studies suggest that desertification results primarily
from modifications in soil carbon source / sink relationships and long-term
ecosystem stability. These impacts may reduce the economic potential of aridland
regions. The proposed study tests these hypotheses using organic carbon
abundance techniques and radiocarbon dating to quantify changes in modern carbon
cycles. The study will provide initial quantification of long-term accumulation
/ decomposition process in a changing aridland environment, characterize changes
in total soil carbon due to desertification, and compare modern desertification
rates with past community changes and climatic history.
