The goal of this project, Tiospaye in Engineering II, is to increase the number
of Native American students graduating from the South Dakota School of Mines and
Technology with bachelor's degrees in engineering. "Tiospaye" is a Lakota word
meaning extended family; this extended family supports the Native American
students in their academic, professional, cultural, and social activities. This
engineering extended family includes the scholarship recipients as well as other
students, staff, faculty, administrators, alumni, employers, the community,
student family members, tribal members, and the tribal college partners, most
notably Oglala Lakota College. The financial support of the scholarships
combined with one-on-one and one-on-small group contact with the engineering
extended family significantly increases the pathways to success for American
Indian students in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eleven or more
scholarships will be awarded to academically talented and financially needy
Native American engineering students. In partnership with the ongoing Tiospaye
in Science project, this program is: 1) Recruiting academically talented
students, who are members of federally recognized tribes, graduates of tribal
high schools, or transfers from tribal colleges or universities. These students
must demonstrate academic excellence, financial need, and a commitment to an
engineering career; 2) Retaining these students in an environment that promotes
academic and professional success, while supporting the students socially and in
their cultural traditions; and 3) Placing these students in appropriate
employment or further education through programs emphasizing career planning and
professional options.
