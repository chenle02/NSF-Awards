9708561 Mish The goal of this workshop is to develop a format for an Internet-
based environment to foster productive collaborations among geographically-
distributed teams of researchers, especially among researchers in earthquake
engineering applications, focusing on applications in siting and geotechnical
systems. It will be held during the summer of 1997 on the campus of the
California State University at Chico. The workshop consists of three components:
Phase 1 consists of the preparation for the actual workshop, utilizing the
capabilities of the Internet for communications. As such, it is a "virtual
workshop" intended to demonstrate the key characteristics of the desired
electronic collaborative framework. Key technologies will be made available in a
simplified form appropriate for demonstration purposes. Each demonstration will
be accompanied by collaborative correspondence among members of the target
audience, so that the full impact of the technology can be detailed and
clarified. In phase 2, the "physical workshop", the results from Phase 1 will be
discussed to provide a more detailed assessment of the requisite computer
technology needed. The workshop will summarize and extend an understanding of
the technologies demonstrated in Phase 1, in order to provide necessary detail
for the needs of the earthquake engineering community. Phase 3, the
documentation phase, will prepare and publish the proceedings of the workshop.
The proceedings will include a formal specification for the implementation of
the Internet collaborative framework. The lessons learned from the workshop will
be encapsulated in a functional needs document. This functional assessment will
be circulated for approval by the earthquake engineering community, following
which it will be translated into a technical specification to serve as a
blueprint for future implementation of the virtual collaborative environment.
The dissemination and implementation of the workshop proceedings will yield an
important demonstration of new technologies for fostering productive
collaborations among geographically distributed teams of researchers. In
addition to providing obvious standards of practice for engineers in the
earthquake engineering community (for such basic topics as report preparation
and dissemination via electronic means), it will deliver concrete demonstrations
of modern Internet technologies, along with the type of "hands-on" documentation
that will be required to permit others to implement the results developed via
the "virtual workshop" and the actual workshop.
