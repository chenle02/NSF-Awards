The broader impact/commerical potential of this I-Corps project involves the use
of brochosome-inspired coatings for optical, energy, and sustainability
applications. Brochosomes are intricately structured microscopic granules
secreted by insects and typically found on their body surface. The proposed
brochosome-inspired coating technology could be integrated into camera or
sensing devices to suppress stray reflections and to further enhance the sensor
sensitivity. In addition, the brochosome-inspired coating could be engineered
and incorporated onto solar panels to enhance optical transmission to improve
solar energy harvesting. The antireflective coating could also be applied onto
glass and window surfaces to improve energy efficiency of buildings, in addition
to serving as a bird-friendly coating to reduce bird collisions for
environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is
based on a brochosome-inspired optical coating characterized by three-
dimensional, hierarchical micro- and nanostructures to suppress reflection from
ultraviolet to near-infrared light at different incident angles. The proposed
technology has demonstrated that brochosome-inspired coatings can be applied
onto various surfaces and can prevent reflection of ultraviolet to near infrared
light by as much as ~99%. The antireflective performances of the brochosomes-
inspired coating can be tailored by engineering the geometries of the micro- and
nanostructures suitable for various optical
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
