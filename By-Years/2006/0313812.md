ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0313812&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Fuhrmann&lt;br/&gt;Insitute of
Electrical and Electronic Engineers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2003 IEEE Workshop
on Statistical Signal Processing is planned for September 28, October 1, 2003,
at the Chase Park Plaza Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. The purpose of the
workshop is bring together researchers and scientists with common interests in
statistics and signal processing and their application in a wide variety of
areas including radar and sonar signal processing, telecommunications,
biomedical signal processing, image analysis, array signal processing, system
identification, and many more. The two-and-a-half day workshop will feature 5
plenary speakers and approximately 150 contributed presentations. The workshop
and its organization is being sponsored by the IEEE Signal Processing Society,
and will be the 12th biannual meeting in this area.
