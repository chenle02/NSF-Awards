MIT's Haystack Observatory will host a combined summer REU (Research Experiences
for Undergraduates) and RET (Research Experiences for Teachers) site in
astronomy, space sciences, geodesy, and informatics. The program will strive to
recruit diverse student cohorts including students from underrepresented groups,
as well as students from colleges and universities with limited local research
infrastructure. The research and professional development programs will help
students to understand the nature and ethics of scientific research and the
skills and process necessary to become a professional scientist. Instructional
Units developed by RET participants will be used in classrooms worldwide.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities are linked through an overarching radio
science theme. Each summer, seven undergraduate students and two K-12 teachers
will spend ten weeks at Haystack engaged in research. Most of these will utilize
major on-site facilities and instrumentation. Opportunities also exist for
students to get involved with the Event Horizon Telescope, very long baseline
interferometry, the Murchison Widefield Array, and in designing instrumentation
for these and future facilities. The program is also a gateway to opportunities
in various geospace and magnetospheric physics projects.
