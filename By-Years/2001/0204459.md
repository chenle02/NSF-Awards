This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY2002. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "High-Resolution
Imagery and New Visualization Tools for Reconstructing a Horned Lizard
Ancestor." Complex images generated by high-resolution x-ray computed tomography
are being combined with phylogenetic hypotheses and algorithms to estimate and
visualize ancestral traits in a genus of lizards, Phrynosoma. The primary
hypothesis, that horn complexity increases along phylogenetic branches, is being
tested by reconstructing ancestral morphology and visualizing changes from
ancestor to extant species using comparative methods.
