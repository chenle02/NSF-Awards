The primary research objective of this project is to produce a data set which
describes the contemporary situation of party activism and organization in the
eleven southern states. Though this has not been undertaken previously for any
region of the United States, the objective is particulary important in a region
undergoing significant political transition, a region in which grassroots party
organizational changes are likely to impact national party politics. More
importantly, the project offers the possibility for analysis of the role of
political parties as one of the political organizations in linkage politics. In
assessing the role of parties in linkage at the grassroots, and in party systems
on a statewide basis, the project's findings will give insight into the role of
parties in linkage and their relationships to other linkage institutions such as
campaign organizations, interest groups, and the like. Research analysts from
each of the eleven states will undertake comparable research activities.
Utilizing common instruments, the researchers will collect several types of data
for each state, including: (1) individual data from mail surveys of samples of
Democratic and Republican party precinct committee members; (2) individual data
from the entire universe of Democratic and Republican party county chairs; (3)
aggregate data for the counties and states; and, (4) historical data about
Democratic and Republican party organization and party activists at other party
levels. The investigation should encourage replication because of its
sufficiently broad data baseline and should have a catalytic effect on
systematic field research about political parties. The data base created will be
made available to other scholars interested in the area through the Inter-
University Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of
Michigan.
