Throughout the biological sciences there is an increase in the need to access
all of the current data available on a given subject. The complexity and breadth
of the biological sciences makes it impossible to have ready access to the full
data resources on even one subject, leave alone the myriad topics under intense
investigation. Mega projects like the Human Genome Initiative have made this
shortage of data sharing more obvious to the whole scientific community. Yet,
despite the need for rapid action there is a shortage of trained investigators
and the need for new theory and systems. An experimental database representing
the detailed information about a very heavily studied region of mouse chromosome
17, the H-2 gene complex, will serve as the model data system for broad
theoretical and practical development of database tools. The experimental model
system offers all of the molecular genetic and cellular biology problems found
in larger projects but only focuses on approximately 3 megabase pairs of mouse
DNA, part of which has been fully sequenced. This model system will serve not
only for theory development and testing but as a training tool for new
investigators, commercial software vendors and computer scientists wishing to
explore applied database problems. This research platform will be an effective
core for outreach workshop and symposia as well as specialized training
sessions. This format should speed database development, which otherwise could
extend over decades as other new database programs have in other fields.
