The main objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of improving
the high temperature characteristics of low cost Fe-Co-Nd-B magnets so that they
might replace expensive SmCo5 magnets in numerous applications. They propose to
magnetically anneal amorphous melt-spun Fe-Co-Nd-B at temperatures near the
crystallization in order to increase their coercivity. Curie temperature, energy
project and coercivity will be determined in order to find the composition with
the best combination of magnetic parameters.
