This award, made under th Small Grants for Exploratory Research program, will
fund observations and data analysis to test the possibility of obtaining
reliable redshifts by photometric methods. This technique, largely developed by
Dr. Loh, remains controversial, and this research should clearly demonstrate its
reliability, or lack thereof.
