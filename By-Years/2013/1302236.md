Citation is an essential part of scientific publishing and, more generally, of
scholarship. It is used to gauge the trust placed in published information and,
for better or for worse, is an important factor in judging academic reputation.
Now that so much scientific publishing involves data and takes place through a
database rather than conventional journals, how is some part of a database to be
cited? More generally, how should data stored in a repository that has complex
internal structure and that is subject to change be
cited?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop a framework
for data citation which takes into account the increasingly large number of
possible citations; the need for citations to be both human and machine
readable; and the need for citations to conform to various specifications and
standards. A basic assumption is that citations must be generated, on the fly,
from the database. The framework is validated by a prototype system in which
citations conforming to pre-specified standards are automatically generated from
the data, and tested on operational databases of pharmacological and Earth
science data. The broader impact of this research is on scientists who publish
their findings in organized data collections or databases; data centers that
publish and preserve data; businesses and government agencies that provide on-
line reference works; and on various organizations who formulate data citation
principles. The research also tackles the issue of how to enrich linked data so
that it can be properly cited.&lt;br/&gt;
