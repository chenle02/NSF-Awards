This project focuses on investigations and education in molecular biology.
Freshmen general biology laboratories are being redesigned with more emphasis on
molecular biology and biotechnology. The revised curriculum also benefits upper
division courses such as cell biology and genetics. More opportunities are also
available for individual molecular biology student research projects. More
complex techniques and experiments now include cell culturing, protein and
nucleic acid analysis, Southern hybridization, preparation of gene libraries,
use of polymerase chain reaction, statistical analysis of generated data using
personal computers, and DNA sequencing. Overall, the project enables students
who complete the general biology, cell Biology, and molecular genetics courses
to gain experience in virtually all of the major molecular biology techniques in
a cumulative, educational manner. It is also expected that students will be well
prepared for individual undergraduate research projects and use techniques in
molecular biology.
