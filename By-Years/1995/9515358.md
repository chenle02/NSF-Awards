This is a project to understand how atoms at ultracold temperatures interact
with each other through both collisions and radiation. It will experimentally
study several different aspects of the interaction: the release of violet
radiation in collisions that include two-photon processes; the change in spin
polarization of the particles as they transfer momentum in the collision; and
the change in motion induced by the collision of an atom with an evanescent
field. Results of the work impact other areas in AMO such as time standards and
precision measurements.
