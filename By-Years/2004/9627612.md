9627612 Carlos Ordonez This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for
the development of the first analytical and computational description of a
nested well Penning-Malmberg plasma processing reactor. The new nested well
configuration may allow confinement of overlapping ion and electron plasmas
within inner and outer electric potential wells, which provides a means for the
confined ion density to exceed the severe ion density limit which occurs within
the traditional single well Penning-Malmberg trap. When arranged in this novel
nested well configuration therefore, Penning-Malmberg traps become potentially
suitable for use as materials processing plasma reactors in microelectronics and
other areas. The potential advantages of this type of reactor over existing
reactors are significant: improved control of the physical to chemical etching
rates with near perfect control of the plasma ion flux to processed surface,
cleaner plasmas, equilibrium flat plasma density profiles for near uniformity in
processing and low power requirements even with improved plasma confinement
control. The design of a proposed follow-on experiment for verifying the
operation description is included, in addition to the detailed theoretical
analysis which forms the main body of the work. ***
