9461060 Schecht Nonlinear optical materials are being used for an ever widening
array of applications. As optical elements for optical communications, optical
information processing and integrated optics decrease in size, ways must be
found to develop nonlinear elements of miniature size as well. This program
investigates the growth of BetaBaB204 in fiber form. Lasergenics Corporation has
license to the patents held by Stanford University to the laser-heated pedestal-
growth technique that is used in the growth of single crystal fibers of this new
and interesting nonlinear material. This material is particularly interesting
for frequency doubling the output of semiconductor diode lasers and the Nd:YAG
laser. The research will investigate the effects of composition, temperature,
pressure, atmosphere and pull-rate on fiber growth. Resulting fibers will be
tested for composition, optical quality, and uniformity. Initial tests for
second harmonic generation will be done. Phase II is expected to optimize the
growth of this material and to build second harmonic devices and frequency-
double laser diode arrays. A tunable fiber laser system based on fibers of
titanium doped sapphire will also be explored.
