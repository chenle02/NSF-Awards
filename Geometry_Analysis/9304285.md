The investigator proposes research in submanifold geometry. Particular
questions are those concerning isoparametric submanifolds in space forms and
generalizations to symmetric spaces or a Hilbert space. Also intended is a study
of symplectic torus actions on infinite dimensional symplectic manifolds.
