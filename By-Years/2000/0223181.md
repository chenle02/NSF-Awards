This is a proposal from the National Academy of Sciences to assess the
scientific opportunities proposed be the new underground neutrino detectors
within the context of current and planned neutrino research capabilities
throughout the world. This proposal results from a request from OSTP. The
request for OSTP to take this immediate action can be found in the President's
FY03 Budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding of this proposal will be carried out
from OMA and from the Office of Polar Programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
