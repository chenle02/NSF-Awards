This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop low
cost / high volume manufacturing methods for plastic organic solar cells. Ink
jet printing will be utilized because it is an additive technology with low
pollution, that is non-contact and digitally controlled (flexible). Recent
promising developments in the field of organic photovoltaic cells cannot be
taken directly to production because there is no manufacturing technology
suitable for making them in volume at lowest cost. This project will use the
unique microscale printing ability of ink jet technology to precisely deposit
the active materials by printing on plastic substrates to form photovoltaic
solar cells arrays. The current organic bulk heterojunction material systems are
most suited to ink jet printing and show improved performance over their
predecessors. This project will use single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT), and
poly (3-octylthiophene) (P3OT). These materials represent some of the newest
work in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this
technology will be low cost, plastic film-based solar cells. &lt;br/&gt;
