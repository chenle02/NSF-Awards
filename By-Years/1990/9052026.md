A prototype "ANEX" facility is now available which permits students to compare
Analytical and Experimental results of small- scale structural model tests in a
personal computer-controlled environment. Also, a computerized "RED" facility is
being developed to improve student skills related to the Reading and
Interpretation of Engineering Drawings. Resources are provided to acquire the
necessary equipment to produce four replicates of the ANEX/RED facility so that
they can be deployed successfully for undergraduate laboratory instruction in
structural engineering.
