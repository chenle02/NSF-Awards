This 3-year award to University of Delaware provides support for technical
services during NSF-funded programs on R/V Hugh R. Sharp, a 146' general purpose
research vessel as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System research fleet. University of Delaware will provide one or two shipboard
technicians on each cruise of R/V Sharp to support seagoing research projects
and to maintain, calibrate and provide for qualified users items from their pool
of shared-use research instrumentation. In addition to these basic support
functions, the technical support group will maintain and provide portable
multibeam sonar and undulating vehicle systems to qualified users requiring
those services in support of their funded research programs on R/V Sharp or
other UNOLS vessels, as schedules allow. &lt;br/&gt;
