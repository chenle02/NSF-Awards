9723815 Abut This is a 24-month award proposed by Dr. Huseyin Abut, San Diego
State University, collaborating with Dr. Abdul Rahim Layman, the Nanyang
Technological University in Singapore. Dr. Abut request funds for travel,
supplies and student support to carry out a cooperative project with his
counterpart at the Singapore Nanyang Technological University to study the use
of higher-order statistics to find an optimal way to prescribe radiation dosage
for tumor regions without exceeding the radiation tolerance of surrounding
normal tissues and radiation sensitive organs. Dr. Abut and his Singapore
counterpart are competent, experienced and respected in this field. This study
addresses a practical question of using a statistical method for optimal signal
and image processing analysis. The result of this analysis could have great
potential for contributing to the development of an improved application of
radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The proposed project combines theory,
algorithm development and testing, and application to real data and provides an
excellent opportunity for a graduate student to learn image processing and
medical imaging.
