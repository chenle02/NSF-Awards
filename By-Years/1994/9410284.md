IBN-9410284 James Rose In some amphibian species male courtship of females is
rapidly suppressed by secretion of the steroid corticosterone in response to
stressful environmental stimuli. This project will investigate the actions of
stress-related steroid hormones on brain function and behavior. This species is
uniquely valuable for study because its stress-sensitive reproductive behavior
allows one to investigate two different actions of stress steroids on brain
function: a rapid action that appears in a matter of minutes and a slowly-
developing action that occurs across a period of hours. Studies of the behavior
of the animal and of the electrical signals of the brain cells will help to
identify the rapid and slow effects of several types of stress steroid hormones
on the brain cells that control courtship behavior. The results of these studies
have general significance because both rapid and slow brain effects of stress
steroids are likely to be present in diverse species of animals. The findings
should help to explain how environmental stressors act on the nervous system to
impair reproduction in natural populations of animals and will provide a
framework for understanding possible modes of stress steroid action on brain
function in humans.
