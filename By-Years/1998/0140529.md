&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particulate contamination of silicon
wafers after chemical mechanical polishing processes is a major problem that
affects yield in semiconductor manufacturing. The removal and adhesion forces of
slurry particles are greatly affected by the polishing, cleaning, rinsing and
drying processes that follow the particle initial contact with the surface. In
this proposed international collaboration between Hanyang University and
Northeastern University, the interaction between slurry particles and wafer
surfaces will be investigated by electrical characterization of the particles
and wafer substrates and by measuring the removal and the adhesion forces of
these particles. The goal of the project is to understand particle adhesion and
removal mechanisms for submicron particles. Hydrodynamic removal forces and the
effect of the zeta potential on slurry particle adhesion and removal will be
investigated. The study will also determine the effectiveness of the cleaning
techniques for each particle/film systems.&lt;br/&gt;
