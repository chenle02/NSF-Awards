9528535 Scalettar This grant contains a two pronged (analytical and numerical)
study of interplay between disorder and strong correlations in quantum and
classical phase transitions. The research covers a broad range of topics,
including boson and fermion Hubbard models, the dynamics of vortices in high
temperature superconductors, quantum spin glasses, possible "supersolid" phases
in Fermi and Bose systems and whether a Bose system can remain normal at zero
temperature due to quantum fluctuations.. In the course of this work, there is
also a plan to develop new computational tools, e.g. . applications of the
maximum entropy method to the dynamical response of random systems. %%% The
project is a combined effort by two researchers with complementary talents, one
has a strong background in the mathematical analysis and the other is well known
for his work using high performance computers. They have chosen to apply their
combined talents to a wide range of problems in Materials Theory: phase
transition between a superconductor and an insulator, Current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors and properties of Bose condensation as
influenced by a variety of perturbations. Our understanding of superfluids and
superconductivity in copper oxides will be main beneficiaries of this research.
