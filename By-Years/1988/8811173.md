This proposal requests funds to equip an ultracentrifuge facility. Five
investigators have proposed projects that require extensive use of
ultracentrifugation. These include mapping ofportions of the human genome using
very high molecular weight DNA, genetic control of Drosophila development, a
study of how cell interactions regulate development and motility in Myxococcus,
molecular mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication, and the biochemistry of
intracellular transport.
