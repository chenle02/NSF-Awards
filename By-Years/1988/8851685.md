Sophisticated scientific workstations running powerful software are essential
tools for practicing scientists and engineers, but undergraduate curricula
nationwide are not responding vigorously to the challenge and opportunity
provided by these devices. In response, the Lawrence Department of Physics will
construct a computation laboratory to support a major restructuring of its
undergraduate physics curriculum. The first phase of this project will build
familiarity with computer-based tools by introducing suitable examples and
exercises into the intermediate-level core of courses. As the students advance,
more sophisticated exercises will be incorporated into advanced offerings.
Through curricular revision, a departmental environment will be created within
which Lawrence undergraduates will become expert at using state-of-the-art
computing tools intelligently, effectively, extensively, and independently. At
the same time, the Department will be conducting a pilot project whose results
will influence the course of physics instruction at other schools during the
coming decades. The grantee institution is matching the NSF award with an equal
sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
