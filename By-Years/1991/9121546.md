Much of modern biology is becoming dependent on complex models, analyses and
theoretical tests that depend directly on the applications of modern mathematics
and computer science. For example, the construction of very large DNA sequences
and genetic marker maps require considerable computer analysis as well as
efforts of organizing and maintaining such information in timely accessible
databases. In addition, the identification of functions encoded within the
genetic sequences have also been obtained using computer-aided comparative
sequence and complex pattern search methods. The work conducted under this award
will provide support for research into the development of these technologies and
validation of their application to fundamental questions in the biology with
several major goals: 1) The further automation of the ARIEL pattern induction
and domain expert assistant system. The use of "massively parallel" computer
hardware will be continued. 2) The extension of the pattern system to utilize
more global structural and functional information, e.g. the overall protein
structural domain classification or the cellular organelle localization. 3)
Development of proper statistical methods for evaluating the likelihood of an
induced pattern being obtained by chance. This will involve the study of a
number of pattern representation "languages" and the selection of proper
negative control sets.
