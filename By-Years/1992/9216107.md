This project is to determine the timing, genesis, and evolution of the Karoo
continental flood basalt province in Southern Africa. Particular emphasis will
be placed on the flow-by-flow stratigraphy of the basalt flows using field
mapping and chemical techniques, and their relative and absolute ages. These
data will be used to constrain both the physical nature and the duration of this
exceptionally large volcanic event, to correlate the numerous eroded remnants of
Karoo basalt now scattered over large areas of southern Namibia, Botswana,
Lesotho, and South Africa, and to correlate the flows with the numerous Karoo
dikes found across southern Africa. The increased knowledge of the physical
evolution of the province will then be used in conjunction with the
compositional data to model mantle melting, fractionation and crustal
assimilation in the production of the basaltic magmas and to constrain the
composition of their source.
