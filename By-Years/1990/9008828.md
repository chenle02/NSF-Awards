The purpose of this collaborative research is to analyze, from a theoretical
perspective, a number of aspects of recent regulatory reform in the U.S. The
project will focus on three broad areas: (1) The management of competition in
regulated industries; (2) The optimal design of regulatory policy; and (3) The
implementation of price-cap regulation. In the first part, the investigators
will explore, from a theoretical perspective, how to combine in an optimum way
competition and regulation in regulated industries such a electric power,
telecommunications, and transportation. In the second part, research will be
directed at analyzing the implications of regulatory commissions holding
regulated industries, such as public utilities, fully responsible for decisions
having unfavorable outcomes, while at the same time allowing only meager rewards
for favorable outcomes. The third part of the project will analyze the
implications of price-cap regulation which many state regulatory commissions
have adopted to control intrastate phone rates. This project is important
because it will provide a more fundamental understanding of the impact of
alternative regulation regimes on the performance of regulated industries.
