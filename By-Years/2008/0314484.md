This five-year project builds a national network with the supporting tools and
mechanisms needed to share knowledge, resources and to disseminate findings and
expertise to the STEM teacher education community at large. The network provides
information on the training, professional development and job opportunities for
teacher education researchers and practitioners. This project establishes the
protocols for disseminating current research that informs both teaching practice
and the ongoing preparation of teachers. It links the CLT projects as well as
provides a public presence for the program and a gateway to current research.

This project will add a layer of communication and public access to the CLT
program. In addition, it solves some logistics and communications problems for
the Centers themselves. It is designed in direct response to the needs survey of
the CLT PI's; consequently, it provides them with an internal collaboration tool
as well as an outreach vehicle for their work. At a programmatic level, CLT-Net
provides a public window into the research that is underway and a tool for
monitoring the investment in the program. The project will significantly improve
the visibility and accessibility of the CLTs to those who use the research and
employ the researchers they produce.
