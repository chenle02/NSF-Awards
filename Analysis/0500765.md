D'Angelo's proposal concerns research in three related parts of complex
analysis: positivity conditions in complex geometry, CR mappings, and algebraic
aspects of subelliptic multiplier theory. One of D'Angelo's primary
contributions to complex analysis in recent years has been a systematic study of
positivity conditions for Hermitian symmetric functions on complex manifolds.
This work has merged diverse issues such as a complex variables analogue of
Hilbert's 17th problem, proper holomorphic mappings between balls, isometric
imbedding for holomorphic bundles, and globalizable metrics into a coherent
subject. The work on proper mappings led to a surprising result about primality;
invariant CR mappings provide large classes of polynomials with integer
coefficients exhibiting the same remarkable congruence properties satisfied by
the p-th power of x plus y. Proper mappings also led to results in the
complexity theory of mappings between balls. The work on subelliptic multiplier
theory is related to the complexity and effectiveness of Kohn's algorithm, and
thus fits into the same general area.

Complex variable theory in one and several variables is a striking part of
mathematics; it provides a beautiful example of pure mathematics, which has
provided applications throughout engineering and the physical sciences.
D'Angelo's work in CR geometry (a geometric part of complex analysis) has
clarified one of the most basic issues, the roles of Hermitian symmetry and
positivity conditions. His work on proper mappings between balls has led to new
sorts of complexity questions, and even to a new primality test. D'Angelo has
published two research level books in several complex variables, one
undergraduate textbook (with D. West) with exciting problem sets, and has played
an active role in mathematics education. He will be guiding a research
experience for graduate students at MSRI in summer 2005 that will initiate
students from many departments into CR geometry and the workdescribed in this
proposal. Progress on these problems should impact complex variable theory, CR
geometry, and possibly number theory.
