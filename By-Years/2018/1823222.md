Computer Architecture research has been traditionally hampered by poor
experimental &lt;br/&gt;infrastructure. In particular, infrastructure has been
lacking in terms of supporting &lt;br/&gt;research that straddles multiple
layers of the computing stack such as hardware, Basic Input-Output System
(BIOS), hypervisor, operating system, drivers, applications, full system
research that necessitates complex software stacks running at speed on novel
hardware, research that depends on real hardware implementation, and research at
scale. OpenPiton 2 is an open source processor infrastructure specifically
targeted at the academic community that enables researchers to complete research
at scale using real hardware designs and not simply simulators.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OpenPiton 2 project creates an academic infrastructure
that allows researchers to design and build many-core processors of large scale.
In particular, this research investigates different Input/Output types, enables
researchers to use the OpenPiton infrastructure on different FPGA manufacture's
FPGAs and provides a hosted FPGA platform to run high core-count OpenPiton 2
designs for academic researchers that are otherwise not possible with typical
individual university resources. This research focuses on supporting the
academic community and hence features a large academic outreach component. This
work can have large impacts on the scientific community and broader world by
enabling more efficient microprocessors to be designed thereby saving energy and
enabling more scientific research to be accomplished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
