This award is for support for a research program of in-situ synchrotron x-ray
topographic studies of both undeformed single crystal and polycrystalline ice
and dislocation structures in mechanically-tested bulk specimens. The goal is to
provide fundamental information on dislocation behavior that will enable
modeling of the deformation of ice to move from the phenomenological to the
micromechanism based. In-situ x-ray topography will also be used to examine the
effects of UV radiation on dislocations in both pure and doped single crystal
ice. This work will also contribute to further understanding of the effect of UV
radiation on the mechanical properties of ice, i.e. the photoplastic effect.
