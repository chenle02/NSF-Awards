0958928&lt;br/&gt;Pollock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation Recovery and
Reinvestment (MRI-R2) Program grant supports acquisition of an x-ray
diffractometer (XRD) and an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) to enhance
faculty and undergraduate research at the College of Wooster, an independent
liberal arts college in northeast Ohio. Two of the PIs (Pollock and Judge) are
new NSF PIs, a goal of the NSF for the expenditure of ARRA funds. The XRD and
XRF will support mineral phase identification, crystallographic structure
refinements and elemental analysis of natural materials, respectively. PI and
student research in igneous petrology, environmental chemistry, materials
science, paleoclimate and archaeology will take advantage of the requested
instrumental capabilities. The College of Wooster maintains an independent study
requirement for all students and the XRD and XRF will support student research
training. The PIs will integrate instrumental experience into existing outreach
programs that target middle school girls, high school students, and local
teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
