The Isthmus of Panama was uplifted several million years ago, leading to
isolation of the eastern Pacific and western Caribbean marine realms, and
interchange between the terrestrial biotas of North and South America. Dr. Alan
Graham has been actively sampling and interpreting deposits of fossil pollen
from Central America, with the goal of interpreting the climatic and
vegetational history of the region before and during the uplift of the Ishthmus.
He now proposes to extend his earlier sampling of Miocene strata in Panama to
both older and younger formations in Jamaica, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. The
proposed research will expand greatly our understanding of this critical episode
in earth history. These pollen records will lead to better reconstructions of
the climatic and ecological history of the region, and will shed new light on
how and why certain plant and animal groups migrated across the Ishthmus while
others did not. Dr. Graham will continue toward his eventual goal of
understanding the evolutionary history of the biotic communities we now see in
the tropics of the New World.
