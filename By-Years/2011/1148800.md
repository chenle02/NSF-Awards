Funds are provided to observe, document and analyze the current surge of Bering
Glacier and derive parameters that capture deformation characteristics during
surge stages and provide information that may facilitate mechanical modeling of
fast glacier movement. Observations will include aerial GPS, video and
photographic data, fixed laser profilometry and time-sequenced satellite
imagery. Analysis of the surge propagation will employ an automated spatial-
statistical/connectionist approach developed by the PI, this allows derivation
of deformation characteristics, as evident in surge crevasse structures from
imagery, and linkage of them to ice dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Glacier
surges can have an immediate and detrimental impact on ecosystems situated in
their path. Few such surges have been carefully observed and described making it
difficult to understand what characteristics of surging glaciers can be expected
as typical and what range of variability is realistic to anticipate. This makes
long-range management planning and risk assessment for such systems difficult.
The proposed research will contribute to the resolution of this issue.
