A course and text are being developed for upper level undergraduates who are
interested in the use of sophisticated mathematics to solve problems arising in
industry. The goal of the course is to demonstrate the usefulness of mathematics
in contemporary industrial problems, with students modeling and solving real-
life problems. The mathematics foundation will be the theory of ordinary and
partial differential equations. Particular attention will be given to the
formulation of open ended questions arising in the industrial problems.
Computational and analytical approaches will both be important in the
mathematical analysis necessary to address physically motivated issues.
