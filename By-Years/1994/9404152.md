9404152 Hunter The goal of the proposed work is to understand the behavior of
nonlinear hyperbolic waves in continuum mechanics and classical field theory.
The main approach is to use singular perturbation methods to derive reduced
equations which capture essential nonlinear phenomena in their simplest form.
These reduced equations are then studied using modern analytical and numerical
methods. Specific problems include the transition from regular to irregular
reflection in weak shock reflection, nonlinear waves in random media, and
nonlinear waves in classical field theories. Many kinds of waves --- such as
sound waves, elastic waves, and magnetohydrodynamic waves --- are described by
hyperbolic partial differential equations. At large enough amplitudes, these
waves are nonlinear. The effects of nonlinearity are often dramatic and are
qualitatively different from the predictions of a linear theory. For example,
nonlinearity leads to the formation of shocks, or sometimes to other kinds of
singularities, and to various kinds of nonlinear instabilities. This proposal
concerns a wide variety of physical problems involving nonlinear hyperbolic
waves. The problems include the reflection of shock waves, the propagation of
large amplitude sound waves through turbulent fluids, and the analysis of
orientation waves in a massive liquid crystal director field.
