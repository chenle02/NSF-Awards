9354776 Fisher This proposal articulates the development of a new undergraduate
mathematics education program consisting of three new courses for undergraduate
preservice secondary mathematics teachers and two new courses in developmental
entry level mathematics based on proven secondary reform curriculum. The
developmental courses are adaptations of the highly acclaimed reform secondary
mathematics curriculum, the Interactive Mathematics Project (IMP). The
preservice courses provide training in the philosophies, attitudes, objectives,
and methods underlying the new reform curriculum and include specific training
in the delivery of the adapted IMP materials. The preservice teachers
participate in a highly structured field experience based on reform ideas as
they actually teach (under the supervision of mathematics education faculty),
the two new developmental courses to college students with entry level
mathematics deficiencies. The project is conducted in two distinct settings:
CSU, Chico (a typical four year institution that has remedial students and a
teacher preparation program) and in a collaborative setting between the
University of California, Irvine (a research institution with preservice
teachers) and Irvine Valley College (a community college that has a large
population of remedial students). Development of the curriculum, materials, and
implementation design allows easy export to either higher educational setting
throughout the nation. This innovative preservice-developmental proposal
provides both an important advancement in aligning secondary mathematics teacher
preparation programs with reform ideas and an economical solution to the growing
bottleneck of students with entry level mathematics problems. ***y
