Power engineering students in the Electrical Engineering Department at the
University of Wyoming are using a graphics- oriented software tool for
education, research, and training in a new 486-based personal computer
laboratory. The tool called COPERITE has all user interfaces, menus and windows,
resident on the computers in the laboratory. The application programs are
executed on a faster DEC 3100 workstation networked with the PCs through an
ethernet transparent to the users of the graphical front-end. Students using
this laboratory learn about power flow, power flow control, contingency
analysis, economic dispatch, security-constrained dispatch, stability analysis,
fault analysis, and electromagnetic transients analysis. The new facility: 1)
allows learning network modeling through per unit representation on one-line
diagrams; (2) provides a framework for studying the behavior of sample networks
under steady state and transient conditions; (3) allows for control of a power
system network for economy/security conditions; and (4) provides a means for
applications of artificial intelligence to improve power system operations.
