This award to the Florida Institute of Technology's Department of Oceanography
and Ocean Engineering is made in response to a proposal submitted to the
National Science Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement
Program. The award will provide one-half of the funds needed to acquire a
shipboard system for measuring ocean temperature, electrical conductance-
salinity, and depth profiles for use in the Department's undergraduate training
program. The University is committed to providing the other half required. The
equipment will be used in the department's Marine Field Project in which
undergraduate students participate in biological, chemical, physical and
geological exercises while crossing the Gulf Stream during a week-long cruise on
an oceanographic research vessel.
