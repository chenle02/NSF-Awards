9319102 Dornfeld This is a small grant for exploratory research in support of
the intelligent manufacturing systems (IMS) initiative. In an unprecedented
world wide effort, numerous commercial organizations and universities have
joined together under the aegis of the IMS test case (this particular one for
holonic control systems) to conduct a one year feasibility study. This grant
provides partial support for a student to work in this effort. This support is
important in that the project may be the forerunner of a new paradigm for the
way research is to be performed.
