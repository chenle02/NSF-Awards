TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will take place at the
2009 Spring National ACS Meeting and will involve presentations by undergraduate
researchers in polymer science and engineering. It will cover all forefront
areas in the field and provide an opportunity for exchange of latest results.
The theme of the ACS Meeting is ?Nanoscience: challenges for the future.? The
talks will highlight all areas in this important and very broad field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
opportunity for undergraduate students to present their research results at a
major scientific conference can be of great value to them in both gaining
recognition and expertise, but especially in possibly stimulating them toward
careers in science and technology. This symposium, focused entirely on
undergraduate research in polymer science, will provide such an opportunity.
These talks will also be an inspiration to other undergraduate students and help
them develop their laboratory and research interests. Participation from
primarily undergraduate institutions and underserved populations will be
encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;
