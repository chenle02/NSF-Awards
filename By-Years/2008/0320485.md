This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposes to
develop new pharmaceutical agents to selectively enhance tumor imaging using
gallium (Ga-67). Ga-67 has been widely used in tumor imaging and clinical
medicine due to significant advantages in terms of low cost, ease of use and
long life. However, the use of Ga -67 is currently limited, mainly due to
varying tumor avidity and high dose requirements needed to achieve high signal-
to-background ratios in non-gallium avid tumors. Increasing the selective uptake
of gallium by tumor cells will dramatically improve gallium imaging, resulting
in the development of an innovative, sensitive, and low-cost tumor detection
tool. This Phase I program will focus on designing, preparing and evaluating
novel nitrosipine derivatives with the potential to drastically increase the
uptake of Ga-67 by tumor cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application
of this project is in the area of tumor imaging and oncology.&lt;br/&gt;
