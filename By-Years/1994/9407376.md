9407376 Skafar The proposed research will investigate the mechanism of action of
the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. The research will use
quantitative studies of the equilibria and kinetics of ligand-binding,
dimerization, and the DNA- binding properties of the estrogen and progesterone
receptors. Molecular biological techniques will be used to construct receptors
containing only the hormone-binding regions, or the DNA+hormone-binding regions.
The ligand- binding, dimerization and DNA-binding properties of these constructs
will be compared with those of the full-length proteins. In this way, the
interactions between the different domains of the receptors during the
conformational changes induced by ligand-binding can be dissected. ***
