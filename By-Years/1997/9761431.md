*** 9761431 LeGore Sensor R&D Inc. will study the feasibility of a novel class
of highly sensitive and selective in-situ sensors which can be applied to detect
toxic gases. These sensors will combine the portability and low cost of the
chemiresistive Taguchi sensor, with the sensitivity and selectivity of
laboratory techniques such as gas chromotography and chemiluminescence, to
produce a product with significant market potential in applications such as
emission monitors, process control sensors and environmental sensors. ***
