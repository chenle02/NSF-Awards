This is an award to provide support for the investigator's participation in an
international conference on intelligent robots and systems. He is scheduled to
present a paper on "A Goal Seeking and Obstacle Avoiding Algorithm for
Autonomous Mobile Robots." This topic relates to his research interests in
sensor based navigation, map building and control systems for these devices. The
investigator plans to meet with professors at Osaka University and research
institutions in Japan that have work underway on mobile robots. These contacts
are expected to assist him in developing his own research program. His
participation in the workshop and other contacts in Japan are also expected to
assist the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in developing a robotics
component to its initiative on research relating to productive and
environmentally acceptable ways of utilizing coastlines of the United States for
waste management.
