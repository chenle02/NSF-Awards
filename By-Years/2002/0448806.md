This career-development project will investigate the first generalized scheme
for solving topological design problems. This approach combines aspects of
optimization, graph theory, mathematical programming, artificial intelligence,
and shape and graph grammars. While traditional optimization is typically used
to find the best values for dimensions and parameters within an already detailed
design, topology optimization can be used earlier in the design process to
determine a configuration of constitutive elements. Configuring components can
be tedious given the abundance and variety of component types and the pressures
imposed by shorter design cycles. Such topological problems are prevalent in
engineering design. Examples include the design of sheet metal components, the
location and connection of roadways, and the choice and connection of processors
in a chemical plant. Thus, a design synthesis method is proposed to
automatically choose and configure elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
activities will be integrated with an educational plan that includes a project-
intensive approach to teaching machine elements, a web-based portfolio tool
geared towards high-school students interested in engineering and undergraduate
students, and the development of two interdisciplinary graduate courses in
design. &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the broader impacts of the research will
become significant when the new method is used to solve real engineering design
problems. Since the method proposes to increase the representation abilities and
improve the efficiency of the search process, more ambitious design problems can
be addressed computationally. By developing and implementing generalized modules
for solving search problems such as these, researchers will be able to implement
their specific representation and evaluation code to work within the proposed
framework. &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
