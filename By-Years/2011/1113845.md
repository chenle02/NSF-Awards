The Dynamic Spectrum Markets Workshop will be held on June 2-3, 2011, at
Northwestern University. This workshop will bring together experts in wireless
networking, wireless communications, economics and public policy to address the
design and deployment of dynamic markets for improving the utilization of
wireless spectrum. Topics to be covered in the workshop include the technical
advances that could better facilitate spectrum markets, the technical
restrictions that should be placed on spectrum users, and the type of market
mechanisms that are appropriate for running such a market. The expected outcome
of the workshop would be to establish a multidisciplinary research agenda for
designing future dynamic spectrum markets, and contribute to the development of
techniques for enhancing the access to radio spectrum and better supporting
current and new applications. Participants will be selected based on an open
call for white papers as well as there being invited participants.
