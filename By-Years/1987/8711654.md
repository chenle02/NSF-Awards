The research revolves around two approaches to understanding the physical
determinants of motility. One approach examines the physics of propulsion from
an engineering standpoint. Forces generated by appendage movements are used to
estimate thrust and body trajectories for a variety of situations, including
aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial locomotion. A goal is to determine what motions
and body morphologies are feasible for accomplishing certain movements such as
flight, swimming, or running and the limitations to movements in terms of design
and energetics. A second approach centers upon the physiology of the muscles
that generate locomotor movements. A number of important limitations to muscle
contractility have been shown with the maxima for force and the inverse
relationship between the force and velocity of contraction both etermining
overall muscle and appendage motions. While both above approaches have yielded
fruitful insight into the limitations to animal motility, no previous study has
explicitly linked these two components. Daniel proposes to combine these two
areas to determine both physical and physiological limitations to one extreme
mode of locomotion: escape from predation. We use a local species of shrimp,
Pandalus danae, that exhibits an escape motion involving a rapid flexion of the
abdomen that lasts approximately 30 ms. The hydrodynamics of this mode of
locomotion has already been worked out. He has shown that both the size and
shape of these animals are constrained by the dynamics of accelerational
locomotion. He proposes to address basic questions regarding these and related
contractile systems: (1) What are the forces generated by such rapidly
contracting muscles (2) How do active and inactive antagonistic muscle groups
respond to such rapid extensions? and (3) How is this activity regulated and
transferred into productive motility.
