This award to the University of Michigan supports the research in Bali,
Indonesia, of a cultural anthropologist studying the formal properties of wet-
rice agricultural irrigation systems. The main focus is to understand how stable
patterns of cooperation persist in the management of irrigation systems, given
inescapable asymmetries in access to resources and incentives for cooperation.
The research will develop and test a model that differs from previous models by
incorporating a more realistic information about the regional ecosystem, and by
expanding the social universe to include N players in an iterated game. The
resulting model should predict changes in ecological processes (irrigation
flows, pest diffusion, etc. ) and the payoffs for various strategies of
cooperation or `defection`. These factors in combination can predict the
patterns of cooperation in response to changes in the environment, such as
increases in pests due to adoption of `Green revolution` agriculture (the
causality to be modeled is thus complex with human decisions changing
environmental variables which then impact on later decisions). The PI and his
students will develop and test the model with measures of agricultural and
ecological variables recorded through fieldwork over three summers. The project
combines research and teaching in an innovative way since the students will be
actively involved in field work and model specification. This research is
important because this form of agriculture produces a significant amount of food
in similar ecosystems in the world at large. Increases in our understanding of
the sources of productivity, such as optimal water management and the management
of pests to produce larger harvests is of obvious importance. In addition the
advances in specification of formal models of such systems, that are more
tightly tied to local and regional specifics while retaining their generalizing
formal nature, will expand our general capacity to understand human behavior in
this realm.
