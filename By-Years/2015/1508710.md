With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of
the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Jianjun Cheng of the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to investigate the reversible bond-
forming and bond-breaking processes of a novel type of polymers. Polymers
containing reversible dynamic bonds may possess very useful properties such as
self-healing, shape memory and environmental adaptation. For example, when there
is a crack in the polymeric materials, polymers bearing dynamic bonds may allow
self-repairing of the crack and restoration of material?s original mechanical
strength. The knowledge gained from this research is disseminated through
various endeavors including publications in scientific journals and
presentations in summer camp programs and Engineering Open-House at the
University of Illinois. This project provides research training opportunity to
graduate and undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented
groups, in the areas of organic synthesis and polymer chemistry.

The reaction of an isocyanate and an amine is one of the most classical
reactions in polymer chemistry that allows the preparation of polyurea, an
inexpensive, widely used engineering polymer with very stable bulk property.
While urea bond is a very robust covalent bond, it can be weakened by the
presence of bulky substituent on one of the nitrogen atoms of the urea group
because of bond distortion. Hindered urea bonds (HUBs) may undergo both fast
association and dissociation reactions. Professor Cheng's group systematically
studies the bond association and dissociation properties of various hindered
urea structures, optimizes the dynamicity, and explores the properties and
applications of HUB-bearing polymers. This work aims to yield polyureas and
poly(urethane-urea)s capable of dynamic property change and autonomous repairing
at low temperature without catalysts.
