Project Learning with Automated, Networked Supports (PLANS) will contribute to
science and engineering education in middle schools. This software technology
will support deep learning as students carry out project-based work.
Specifically, PLANS will connect tools for brainstorming, planning, modeling,
sketching, data gathering, graphing, designing, and testing, with technology
that automatically assesses use of the tools and generates guidance that
supports learning. This project is funded by the Cyberlearning and Future
Learning Technologies program, which integrates opportunities offered by
emerging technologies with advances in what is known about how people
learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLANS will define a genre of technology-enabled
learning resources that combine investigation tools within a sequence of
student-led projects, and analytics technologies that guide students toward
deeper understanding. The researchers will explore an instance of this genre
applied to middle school physical science with a focus on energy content,
science and engineering practices, and cross cutting themes. By implementing and
researching a half-semester sequence of projects, the researchers will examine
synergies between investigation and analytic technologies that result in
substantial learning gains. The researchers will collaborate with five middle
schools serving diverse student populations. Through three iterations of
improvements in the technologies and project materials, the project will
optimize and document the educational value of this approach.
