The goals of this project are to improve student access to computer-based
techniques for data collection, analysis, and modeling for majors and non-majors
in biology, chemistry, and physics laboratories. The computer facilities are
also used by upper-level students conducting laboratory research, and in the
development of new computer-based curriculum materials for classes in
physiology, ecology, and marine biology.
