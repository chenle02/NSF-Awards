This SBIR Phase I Award emphasizes research on practical stable contacts to
high transition temperature ceramic superconductors. the research could lead to
the development of multilayer structures of (metal-conductor/transition-
layer/superconductor) which are stable during sintering to temperatures near
9000C and which maintain low contact resistance to the superconductor. These
multilayer contacts will be stable to thermal cycling above and below the
superconducting critical temperature. Conducting oxide films will be deposited
on appropriate substrates, and then superconducting oxides will be deposited on
these by screen printing. The specimens will then be sintered at the appropriate
high temperature. Chemical analysis of the films will be made using scanning
auger microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy on a scanning electron
microscope. This material structure would be suitable for fabrication of
superconducting wire and cable with superconducting critical temperature over
770K. This wire would be used for superconducting magnets, power transmission,
etc.
