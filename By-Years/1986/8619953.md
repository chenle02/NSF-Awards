A planning activity will be initiated to determine the feasibility of
establishing a Process Modeling Center at MIT. Its principal mission will be to
develop mathematical models describing materials processing operations involving
materials in the gaseous and molten state and including phase transitions such
as solidification and vapor deposition. This work would have a close interface
with solid state (i.e., deformation processing) efforts but would not emphasize
these aspects of the materials processing field. The principal industrial
customers for this work would include both the traditional commodity-type
producers, such as steel, aluminum, and copper; and new technologies, such as
ceramics composites and electronic materials. As part of this planning, co-
ordination with Lehigh University (covering the areas of mathematical modeling
of shaping and deforming of solid materials) will be explored to determine the
possibility of establishing a joint center researching mathematical modeling of
materials during gaseous, liquid, and solid phases.
