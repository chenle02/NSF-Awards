9509991 Spector This proposal for an RUI award is to study particle physics by
investigating supersymmetric gauge theories with soliton, monopole and instanton
solutions. Supersymmetry is an invariance which transforms bosons into fermions.
Non- dissipative soliton-like solutions of the non-linear equations of motion
provide different choices of vacuua of the theory. Their role in strong and weak
coupling approximations to the theory will be computed. ***
