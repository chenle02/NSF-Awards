As computing technology becomes ever more powerful, memory is larger but more
complex, with different materials, configurations, and interconnects having
different trade-offs among capacity, speed, and cost. Because of this
complexity, fully automatic solutions are increasingly sub-optimal and brittle.
This project develops new designs of the memory hierarchy that are programmable
and therefore can achieve better performance and provide stronger guarantees
than conventional solutions used on current computer systems ranging from
smartphones to supercomputers. The new programmability enables optimization in
software and hardware in concert. Since computer cost and speed depend on memory
hierarchy, programmable designs can overcome the current limit in scalability
and power efficiency. Beyond its technical content, the project advances
teaching in the science of computer memory and strives to increase the diversity
among participants in this area of research and
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project develops a two-level
programmable cache system called the lease cache and designs its programming
techniques. It has three parts: automatic programming and optimization of the
lease cache; hardware design and prototyping of a RISC-V processor with the two-
level lease cache on an FPGA board; and lease-cache theory especially
statistical properties and guarantees of the cache performance. Through theories
and prototyping, the new designs can retain software portability, ensure
matching performance to current automatic solutions by default, and provide
precisely defined cache performance properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
