The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies ultimately in saving lives. This project
proposes a Machine Learning-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) firearms detection
system for law enforcement. Implementation of this technology would
significantly reduce the cognitive burden of police officers in dangerous
situations, allowing for more informed decisions. Additionally, there are
benefits to the warfighter and security professionals to improve their
capabilities in keeping the nation and public safe. Successful implementation
and commercialization of a firearms detection system will grant capabilities to
objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data to find insights previously
unknown, and to provide a data-driven approach towards real-time reactions
around firearms and firearm usage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project
aims to research and develop a Machine Learning-enabled, integrated IoT system
dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm activity, such as
discharges and unholsters. The challenges are two-fold: 1) to develop and
iterate based on pilot user feedback regarding the hardware and software
portions of the system; and 2) to employ machine learning on a unique dataset
for insights on firearms knowledge and handling. The proposed research and
development plan calls for pilots with several law enforcement agencies,
hardware and software iterations based on user feedback, and research into a
real-life dataset collected by police officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
