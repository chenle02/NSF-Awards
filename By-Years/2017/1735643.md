Mathematics learning by inquiry (MLI) employs active learning techniques,
incorporation of meaningful applications of mathematics, and attention to
broader academic skills. A growing evidence base indicates that MLI can have a
positive impact on student learning and success in undergraduate mathematics.
The goal of this project is to build a larger national community of instructors
who employ MLI and education researchers who study MLI. To this end, this
workshop project will bring leaders and representatives from among the MLI
instructor community together with leaders and representatives from the research
in undergraduate mathematics education community (RUME). By bringing together
leaders and representatives from both the MLI and RUME communities, this project
will form an initial step to forge a more formal and symbiotic collaboration
between these two communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the workshops
will produce a strategic plan for the Initiative for Mathematics Learning by
Inquiry. This plan will focus on building a collaborative cycle through which
the MLI initiative inspires education research projects, which in turn are used
to inform the MLI initiative. The workshops themselves will be structured to
employ active engagement and inquiry oriented problem solving. Each of an
expected thirty participants will be actively engaged in the process with each
having an opportunity to make a substantial contribution. Participants will
develop national goals for a MLI initiative, identify strategies to reach these
goals, and establish a strong collaboration between these communities to improve
undergraduate mathematics education. This collaborative effort will strengthen
the ability of the MLI initiative to support effective, sustainable, and
scalable reforms in undergraduate mathematics education.
