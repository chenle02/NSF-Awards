#: 308157&lt;br/&gt;Title: Interactive Multisensory Modeling of Physical
Objects&lt;br/&gt;PI: Pai, Dinesh&lt;br/&gt;Rutgers Univ New
Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate techniques for
easy and interactive construction of high quality multisensory computer models
of real, physical objects. By multisensory models we mean models that are
capable of supporting multisensory interaction, supporting not only simulation
of the appearance of an object but also its physical response, including
associated forces and sounds. Because human interaction with the physical world
is inherently multisensory, people will be able to effortlessly combine
information from vision, hearing, and touch to manipulate such computer
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, we propose to develop an integrated
environment with excellent conditions for interactive modeling by humans. We
will explore new techniques to make the modeling task extremely easy, by
providing rapid feedback about the state of the model, developing novel sensing
and display systems, and developing software tools to plan and generalize
measurements. We will use these techniques to interactively create multisensory
models of contact.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
