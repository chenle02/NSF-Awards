PI proposes to increase understanding of diamagnetism in non- uniform
interacting electronic systems. The following problems will be addressed: 1)
ground state properties of electrons in an external magnetic field; 2)
possibility of instabilities leading, in the absence of a magnetic field, to a
ground state with spontaneous orbital currents and broken time-reversal
symmetry; 3) energetics of magnetic field-induced non-uniform collective states
in three dimensional electron and electron-hole liquids. Method to be employed
is current-density functional theory of inhomogeneous electronic systems in
magnetic fields.
