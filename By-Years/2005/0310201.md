This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan is entitled "Chronic stress and amygdala
function." A handful of studies suggest that chronic stress may enhance cellular
function in the amygdala, a brain structure that plays a critical role in
emotional learning and memory. This project will characterize the effects of
chronic stress on the amygdala using behavioral, electrophysiological, and
cellular measures in rats.
