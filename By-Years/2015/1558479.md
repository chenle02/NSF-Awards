River floods and debris flows can transport car- and even house-sized boulders
at high velocity, making them some of the most deadly and costly natural
hazards. Despite this hazard, there exist few methods for continuous monitoring
or early warning of these destructive processes. One of the main issues in
developing monitoring techniques is that floods and debris flows easily destroy
any instruments placed in their path. This project aims to overcome this
challenge by developing a methodology to measure and quantify the ground
vibrations produced by water and debris flows, and thus be able to continuously
monitor these hazards from a safe distance. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To achieve
the broader goal of developing a ground motion-based flood and debris flow
monitoring framework, it is necessary to understand the mechanics through which
these motions cause ground vibrations, and one specific goal of this project is
to develop such a mechanistic understanding. In parallel with this model
development, laboratory and field experiments are planned to test the
assumptions of the theories and verify the accompanying hypotheses. This work is
anticipated to result in new notions for how flows interact with their channels
and allow quantitative remote monitoring to be possible.
