Sahi will construct explicit models for small representations of reductive Lie
groups, and use these models to study the decomposition of tensor products of
such representations. These models are closely related to the local theta--
correspondence for classical groups, and may be regarded as a natural
generalization of this correspondence. The results are expected to have natural
global analogues, with applications to the theory of automorphic forms. The
theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie,
has been one of the major themes in twentieth century mathematics. As the
mathematical vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the
representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact upon mathematics
itself, particularly in analysis and number theory, and upon theoretical
physics, especially quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.
