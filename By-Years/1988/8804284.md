Professor Kosaraju will examine algorithm design issues in the areas of parallel
computation and computational geometry. Specific problems include: (1) the
parallelization of tree-structured computations and dynamic programming
constructs, (2) the parallel implementation of data structure constructs, (3) an
investigation of mesh architecture with a primary focus on developing methods
for translating PRAM algorithms to meshes, (4) a study of information flow in
trees of processors to explore their pipelining capabilities, (5) an
investigation of a systematic formulation for handling finite precision
computational geometry, and (6) the development of algorithms for coordinated
motion of robot arms.
