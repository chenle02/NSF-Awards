Zhiyong Gao has been doing some of the very best recent work on demonstrating
the existence of metrics with various curvature properties. His results on the
existence of negatively Ricci curved metrics and on stability of negative Ricci
curvature under connected sums are first rate. In the current research the
emphasis is placed on the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics, the
existence of negatively Ricci curved metrics and the existence of Einstein
metrics, realizing the positive Ricci tensor on 3-manifolds.
