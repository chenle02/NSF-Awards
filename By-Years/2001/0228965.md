Kinship systems which define sets of allies and potential enemies play a central
role in the life of anthropological populations, from foragers to nomads to
peasants. The number and kinds of kin in a society are produced by the
demographic rates of its population. Such populations are usually small, poorly
buffered from environmental fluctuations, and subject to random variation in
rates. This pilot research tests through simulation the effects of unstable
booms and busts in demographic rates on the number of siblings, cousins, and
other relatives in small populations. The model will distinguish cohort effects
from period effects and will control the effects of randomness due to small
sample sizes. Using the simulation program SOCSIM, the researcher will vary
fertility, incest prohibitions, patterns of exogamy and random demographic
shocks. The fundamental question to be examined is whether the simple picture of
sharp kinship responses to demographic change, and thus the plausible political
outcomes of such changes, would remain detectable under realistic conditions of
randomness and small population change. This exploratory research has
implications for our understanding of native models of kinship which group
different genealogical types into the same named social role categories, thus
overriding demographic inequalities by linguistic classification.
