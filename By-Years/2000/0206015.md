Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying factors that could
stabilize or destabilize particular systems reflects the need to understand
ecological processes because of concerns regarding how increased instability
could yield loss of species and/or ecosystem functioning. Evidence that spatial
subsidies might be more common than previously thought led prior research to
assess the generality of such inputs. Although theoretical models suggest that
subsidies could stabilize food webs, no experimental evidence supports such
claim. The proposed research goes beyond recognizing that subsidies are
ubiquitous by addressing their role on the dynamic behavior and functioning of
planktonic pond food webs. Specifically, it addresses how food webs with
configurations that differ in species richness and identity respond to
subsidies, and how multiple subsidies interact with predation to mediate
stability and ecosystem functioning. Ideally, results from this research will
determine the effects of subsidies on food webs and ecosystems by bridging
current gaps among theoretical, empirical, and correlational studies.
