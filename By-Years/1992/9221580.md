Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of transport, adsorption, and
chemical reactions which occur at liquid-vapor interfaces. He is using molecular
dynamics simulations to gain insight into the solvation free energy and
adsorption which takes place at the water liquid-vapor interface, and the effect
which this interface has on the equilibrium constant and free energy of
activation for various chemical processes such as isomerization equilibrium,
unimolecular decomposition and electron transfer. He is developing new
methodologies for performing such simulations which include treating the long
range coulombic forces by a combination of Ewald summation and reaction field
techniques. %%% One of the most challenging and important problems in chemistry
is to understand at the molecular level the effect of the medium on chemical
reactions which occur at the interfacial region bewtween different phases.
Recent advances in very fast time-resolved spectroscopic techniques are yielding
new data on solvent effects on dynamical processes in bulk solution and at
interfaces. The theoretical research being performed by Dr. Benjamin employs
computer simulations based on molecular models to gain a deeper molecular level
understanding of the physical and chemical processes which take place at the
liquid-vapor interface.
