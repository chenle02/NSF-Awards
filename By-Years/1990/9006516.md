Parallel algorithms will be developed, on a Intel iPPSC-D5 Hypercube, for the
finite element numerical solution of free-boundary seepage problems using
unstructured meshes and for the determination of the load balance and
communication structure among the processors. The goal will be to develop load
balancing strategies which will assign tasks among the processors to optimize
the overall computational efficiency. Several domain splitting techniques will
be used and evaluated including a relatively recent one developed by Italian
researchers at the University of Pavia. Furthermore, scale up performance
experiments will be performed on various systems both at University California
Santa Barbara as well as at the University of Pavia. The knowledge and tools
developed will provide techniques for the efficient solution of both free-
boundary problems as well as the use of finite- element schemes.
