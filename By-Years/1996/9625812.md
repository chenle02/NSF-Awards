ABSTRACT Majumdar 9625812 Fundamental development of scanning thermal microscopy
and application of the technique to microscale heat transport in a variety of
electronic devices and interfaces is proposed. The goal is to obtain a spatial
resolution of 1-10 nm and a temporal resolution of 10 ns in temperature
measurement. Thermal probing of self-assembled conducting polymers and polymeric
light-emitting devices will be attemped. In addition, temperature measurements
of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers and interfaces of related quantum
structures are planned. The scanning thermal microscope will also be applied to
reliability studies of solid-solid interfaces, such as diamond on silicon.
