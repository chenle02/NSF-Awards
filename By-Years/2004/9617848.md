OCE 96-17848 Flierl The project will apply analytical and numerical models to
investigate the development of disturbances in oceanic "jets" associated with
western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream. Several dynamically important
extensions to existing work in the field will be investigated: Baroclinic
effects on jet stability will be addressed by including realistic horizontal and
vertical structures in the models. The nonlinear evolution of the jet and of jet
instabilities will be considered in the presence of the mean flow recirculation
which surrounds the jet. Variations in the jet and changes in the development of
instabilities caused by the proximity of a coastal boundary will be examined.
