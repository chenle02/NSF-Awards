Preliminary studies will be performed to investigate the solution-state active-
site structure of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) and its complexes with
substrates, substrate analogs, and inhibitors. The validity of the cadmium-
substituted enzyme as a model for native zinc-containing LADH will be assessed
113Cd, 15N and 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The
feasibility of 17O and 67Zn NMR as methods to determine the nature of binding of
substrate and water molecules to the active-site metal of native LADH will be
assessed.
