High-latitude environments impose constraints on breeding activities of
migratory birds which necessitate adjustments to a much shorter season.
Environmental constraints may have been met by adaptations of the endocrine
system which serve to fine-tune breeding activities to suit arctic conditions.
It is proposed that the endocrine systems of polar nesting birds display
decreased sensitivity to stimuli that would result in rapid and disruptive
elevations of hormones which could affect breeding or nesting activities at
inappropriate times. The roles of two potentially antagonistic hormones will be
examined: testosterone, which elicits territorial aggression; and
corticosterone, which can act to inhibit reproductive activities including
territorial aggression. The endocrine adaptations to be investigated in this
research program may elucidate physiological mechanisms by which polar animals
avoid delays and/or conflicting behaviors which might reduce chances for
successful reproduction.
