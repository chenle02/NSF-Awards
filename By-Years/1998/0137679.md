The PI will conduct a geochemical study of existing samples from the Galapagos
Islands and dredged samples for the Galapagos archipelago in order to sort out
the various mantle components that apparently contribute to mantle melts there.
He will primarily analyze olivine and spinel-hosted melt inclusions, based on
evidence that such inclusions generally contain more diverse melts and are less
affected by mixing than bulk lavas. He will analyze major elements, trace
elements, volatile abundances, Pb isotopes and Oxygen isotopes in order to
determine the nature of various mantle endmembers, and to provide constraints on
what these endmembers actually are (subducted sediment? recycled oceanic gabbro?
Recycled altered basalt, etc..). The study will mostly be conducted using
instruments at WHOI, DTM, and Caltech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
