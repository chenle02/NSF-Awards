High performance computing (HPC) is a major initiative at Louisiana State
University (LSU). Its multidisciplinary research programs focus on grand
challenges in materials science, astronomy, microsystems design, and
environmental studies. To advance this effort, we request five NSF Traineeships.
Consortial arrangements have been made to recruit in-state and out-of-state
students, especially minorities from Historically Black Institutions. Innovative
training structures have been introduced to integrate HPC into graduate
education and research. These include new cross-disciplinary curricula and a
dual-degree program to allow Ph.D. students in the physical sciences to get a
M.S. from Computer Science and vice versa. Unique opportunities are available
for graduate trainees to interact with scientists at Oak Ridge and Argonne
National Laboratories, Mobil and Ethyl Corporations, and in Europe and Japan. To
establish the HPC effort a LSU, two excellent parallel computing laboratories
have been set up with $2. million in infrastructure grants from the State of
Louisiana. These laboratories feature an 8,192-node MasPar, a 64-cell iWarp, and
8-node iPSC/860, and an 8-processor Silicon Graphics. With the latest grant of
$850,000, we plan to acquire a 56-node Intel Paragon.
