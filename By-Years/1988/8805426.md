The Pi's propose to continue investigations of the Salton Sea Geothermal system
and particularly the interaction between deep hypersaline brines and Shallower,
more dilute brines. These two reservoirs seem to be stratified within the
sediment reservoir with a sharp density controlled interface paralleling the
250C isotherm. Isotopic data reveal that the two fluids may have different
sources, and their distinctive chemical compositions imply different water-rock
interaction histories along their respective flow paths. Both hydrothermal
circulation and ore deposition are controlled by the salinity stratified nature
of these fluids. Further work is intended to add to the existing data base using
samples from commercial production wells. The ultimate goal is to understand the
evolution of the two fluid reservoirs and their role in controlling
metallogenesis.
