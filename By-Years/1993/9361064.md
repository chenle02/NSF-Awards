9361064 Flannery We propose to develop a high performance computing environment
for large-scale engineering problems, making accessible the most recent advances
of parallel computing as a critical component in everyday engineering design.
The success of this work, both commercially and technically, will be based on
three elements. Upon successful completion of this work a powerful tool for
simulation of fluid flow will make accessible the most recent advances in
parallel computers to large-scale engineering problems in a user-friendly high
performance computing environment.
