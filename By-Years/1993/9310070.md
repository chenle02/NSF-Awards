9310070 Alexander This grant will fund research to develop composites for
biomedical applications. The materials will consist of an absorbable polymer
reinforced with calcium phosphate based fibers. One of the goals of this
research is to have the composite degrade over a period of two years into near
neutral degradation products. The investigators intend to test the mechanical
and chemical characteristics of the fibers, produce the composites, and perform
in vivo testing. This research is important since it could lead to the
development of absorbable fracture fixation devices that will eliminate the need
for second surgeries to remove hardware. Since the materials should allow the
gradual transfer of the load to the healing bone, the need for stress shielding
should be eliminated. These materials should also be able to be used for the
controlled release of growth and differentiation factors to bone healing sites.
