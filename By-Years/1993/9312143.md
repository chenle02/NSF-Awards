9312143 Duncan This proposal is to develop and evaluate methods to measure and
limit disclosure risk in statistical and multilevel relational databases. It
addresses the ability of database users to infer sensitive information to which
lack authorized access, based on responses to authorized queries. A decision-
theoretic approach is proposed to allow analysis as an optimization problem of
maximizing access to information subject to constraints on disclosure risk.
Building on previous work (e.g., Adam and Wortmann (1989), Denning (1982),
Duncan and Mukherjee (1991, 1992), Garvey, Lunt, and Stickel (1991) and
Mukherjee, Krishnan, and Duncan (1992), the proposal is to accomplish the
following tasks: 1. develop hybrid methods which combine existing disclosure
limitation methods for statistical databases, and specify appropriate measures
to evaluate their performance; 2. provide a probabilistic framework to evaluate
disclosure limitation methods for statistical databases; 3. introduce a
methodology that could be used at the time of schema design to detect and
eliminate possible inference channels in multilevel relational databases,
particularly in the presence of uncertainty about the external information used
in the inference process.
