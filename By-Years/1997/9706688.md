9706688 Bergman The PI proposes a three year laboratory study of the acoustics
of directionally solidified metallic alloys. The effort will involve examining
in detail solidification texturing as a possible mechanism for understanding the
inferred seismic anisotropy of the Earth's inner core. Preliminary ultrasonic
measurements by the PI have demonstrated that rectionally solidified metallic
alloys can exhibit a significant acoustic anisotropy due to solidification
texturing. ***
