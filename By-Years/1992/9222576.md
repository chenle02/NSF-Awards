Convective storms are of fundamental interest to scientists as well as
important to the general public. Such storms produce severe weather that is
economically disruptive and life-threatening as well as producing beneficial
rainfall. Accurate short term predictions (up to 24 hours) of the location,
timing, intensity and type of convective storm would be of substantial benefit
to society. Using the Advanced Regional Prediction System numerical model
developed at a NSF Science and Technology Center, Center for Analysis and
Prediction of Storms, the Principal Investigator will attack various aspects of
prediction of convective activity. By using broader parameter spaces as well as
higher spatial resolution, more realistic methods for inserting pseudo-
observational errors into the simulations during storm evolution, and a more
accurate method for treating subgrid-scale motions, the Principal Investigator
will evaluate the utility of various dynamical parameters in predicting storm
behavior within a variety of environmental settings; examine linkages between
helicity and energy dissipation; and attempt to understand how errors grow and
propagate in convective storms so as to establish predictability limits as a
function of storm type, environment and other parameters.
