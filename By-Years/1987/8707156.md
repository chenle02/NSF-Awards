This work consists of a program of experimental phase equilibrium studies of
important rock-forming silicate and oxide minerals with associated
thermochemical studies. The program is designed to yield key thermodynamic
parameters of end-member minerals and solid solutions, as well as pressure and
temperature stability diagrams of simple systems modelling the deep crust and
upper mantle. Melting studies of biotite and quartz with and without associated
feldspars is proposed, continuing on preliminary work, to erect an experimental
framework for analysis of deep-crustal melting. A principal concentration will
be the melting and subsolidus behavior of simple systems with biotite under
mixed CO2-H2O vapors, in order to provide quantitative data for the study of
fluid processes in the earth.
