9319577 WOLFRAM ABSTRACT This project examines the sociolinguistic significance
of a set of Southeastern seaboard island communities located on the Outer Banks
of North Carolina. Four primary research sites and several different secondary
sites are being studied. Ocracoke, an Outer Banks island community settled in
the early 1700s and still inaccessible by automobile, was selected for detailed
sociolinguistic and ethnographic study. This variety is compared with the speech
of two other Outer Banks communities which are now accessible by automobile,
Harkers Island and Hatteras, as well as a contiguous mainland costal community,
Beaufort, North Carolina. Data from these sites are, in turn, compared with
previously collected data from other types of historically- isolated areas,
including the Appalachian and Ozark mountains, and the Eastern Shore dialect
area of Smith Island off the coast of Maryland. Data sources consist of a set of
cross-generational sociolinguistic interviews being conducted in the four
primary dialect areas, a set of previously collected oral history interviews
providing for time-depth studies, a set of interviews conducted in connection
with sociolinguistic studies in other historically-isolated situations, and a
limited set of earlier written historical records reflecting Outer Banks
varieties of the 1700 and 1800s. The particular set of socio-historical
circumstances that combined to create the prototypical quasi-isolated island
community makes it ideal for the empirically-based examination of general
sociolinguistic principles relating to dialect contact, assimilation, and
change. This study also provides an important basis for examining assumptions
related to the apparent time construct and the critical intersection of social
and linguistic structures in the description and explanation of language
variation and change. ***
