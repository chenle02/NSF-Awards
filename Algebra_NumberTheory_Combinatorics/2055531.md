Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects ? called algebraic
varieties ? defined by systems of polynomial equations. A fundamental problem is
to find and classify algebraic varieties with nice geometric structures. When
the varieties are positively curved, it is natural to search for metrics that
satisfy Einstein's equation from general relativity. The main theme of this
project is to study such Einstein metrics using an algebro-geometric stability
theory called K-stability, and to investigate their interaction with other
structures that lie at the crossroads of algebraic geometry, differential
geometry, commutative algebra and mathematical physics. The Principal
Investigator plans to organize activities to enhance communication between
different groups of researchers (including under-represented groups).

The project has three closely related parts. The first is to prove K-stability
of explicit Fano varieties, such as complete intersections and their mildly
singular degenerations. With the help of birational geometry, the PI aims to
show that most of these Fano varieties are K-stable and explicitly describe some
of their corresponding compact K-moduli. The second part is to study the moduli
theory of Fano varieties and singularities using K-stability. The goal is to
construct compact moduli spaces that parametrize certain optimal degenerations
of the varieties or singularities. The last part is to explore the connection of
K-stability with other geometric properties of Fano varieties, especially their
birational rigidity and rationality.
