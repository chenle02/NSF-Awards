This research concerns three broad projects, each with several subproblems of
varying difficulty. The first project aims to prove the equivalence of three
regularity properties for separable simple nuclear C*-algebras: one topological,
one homological, and one algebraic. The proof of this fact, which has recently
seen rapid progress toward a solution under some restrictions on traces, would
represent a deep generalization of Kirchberg's characterization of purely
infinite simple nuclear C*-algebras. The second project concerns the interplay
between descriptive set theory and C*-algebras, and specifically the use of the
notion of Borel reducibility to answer, for various classes of functional
analytic objects, the question: How complicated is isomorphism? The objects that
the principal investigator will consider include nuclear, exact, and locally
reflexive C*-algebras, and operator spaces and systems. The third project
examines uniform perturbations of C*-algebras and the degree to which they
preserve structure and invariants. Important questions here include whether or
not Z-stability and stability are preserved by such perturbations.

Many fields of scientific inquiry require analyzing infinite-dimensional systems
and the ways in which they can be transformed. Examples include models for
quantum physics, signal analysis, and weather patterns. Infinite-dimensional
systems are, of course, complicated. Understanding them often proceeds by
approximating them with simpler finite-dimensional systems. This project uses
this approach in an effort to understand infinite-dimensional systems called
C*-algebras. The finite-dimensional approximating objects are square arrays with
complex number entries. Our aim is to identify conditions under which one can
approximate the infinite-dimensional system arbitrarily closely using only a
fixed finite number of overlapping arrays. This last property is known to have
powerful consequences for the original system, consequences that reveal a great
deal of detail about its structure.
