Abstract for DMS - 0104196

The three principle investigators on this proposal will be involved in research
in the following areas: Barry Mazur will be involved in at least four major
projects. The first concerns Euler systems and their applications in algebraic
geometry, arithmetic and analytic number theory. The second project will study
interpolations of modular eigenforms via special curves. The third concerns the
ABC conjecture in number theory and the fourth concerns rational points on
rationally connected varieties. Raoul Bott will conduct research at the
interface between mathematics and physics including research topics that relate
to computational complexity, equivariant cohomology, diffeomorphism groups and
toric varieties. The major project of Clifford Taubes concerns the coding of
smooth 4-manifold structures by the pseudo-holomorphic curves defined by their
self-dual 2-forms. The first long range goal is to read off invariants of smooth
4-manifolds from these curves. The second goal is to use them to simplify a
presentation of the manifold.

Here are some comments of a less technical nature about this research: Barry
Mazurs work concerns properties of the integers and relations between them. A
typical question asks for integers, say a, b and c, that satisfy some given
equation. An example is the equation of Pythagoreas, which asks that the sum of
the squares of a and b equal that of c. There are very general and natural
classes of such relations (such as those involved in the now proved Fermat
conjecture) that probe to the heart of the theory of numbers; and the study of
such equations forms the core of Mazurs research. Raoul Botts work probes the
manner in which families of symmetries can be used to simplify computations in
mathematics and theoretical physics. These symmetries relate different
structures and often this relation equates a simple to understand property of
one system to a mysterious and not understood property of another. Clifford
Taubes major project probes the possibilities for the large scale structure of
four dimensional universes. Our universe has four dimensions, these the usual
three dimensions of space plus time as the fourth. This said, the research seeks
to provide a complete list of the possible large scale structures for a universe
such as ours. To put this in perspective, there is a conjectured list for all
possible three dimensional spaces, but there is as yet no credible conjecture
for a similar list for four dimensions.
