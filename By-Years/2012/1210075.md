This action funds Maija Eliina Sipola of The University of Iowa to conduct a
research project, entitled "Dating the deposition of Homo erectus-bearing
sediments from Java, Indonesia," during the summer of 2012 at Macquarie
University in Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia. The host scientist is Dr. Kira
Westaway.

The Ngandong paleoanthropological site in Central Java, Indonesia has
significant impact on the models for human migration and evolution out of the
African continent. Located on a Late Pleistocene fluvial terrace level along the
Solo River, paleoanthropological excavations at Ngandong have uncovered fourteen
Homo erectus fossils that are believed to possibly be the most recent known
occurrences of H. erectus in the world. However, this hypothesis cannot be
confirmed by the results of previous studies at Ngandong due to a general lack
of understanding of how the site formed. This study seeks to overcome the limits
of these previous studies by taking a comprehensive geoarchaeological approach
to this site, including specialized methods for luminescence dating. Results of
this work are important to geochronologists, geoarchaeologists and
paleoanthropologists alike, as well as anyone interested in early human
migration and evolution in Southeast Asia.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
