ABSTRACT EEC-9527120 Niesz This award is to establish a collaborative research
effort between the University of Connecticut Center for Grinding Research and
Development and Rutgers University Center for Ceramic Research. The research has
the goal to generate fundamental scientific and engineering understanding of low
cost, low damage abrasive micro-machining for ceramics. The aim is to conduct
studies to improve the speed and efficiency of the abrasive micro-machining
process and to increase the quality of the surface. Well characterized high-tech
ceramic materials are being subjected to grinding using several techniques. The
effects of machining characteristics, such as energy input and grinding rate are
being determined. The effects of grinding on the mechanical properties of the
ceramics are being determined. The effects of the grinding on the surface of the
ceramic are being measured using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, laser
Raman, fractography, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Additional
funding is provided in this award to support a woman minority undergraduate
student to study the preparation of PZN-Pt/BT thin films by the sol-gel method
for microactuator and capacitor applications.
