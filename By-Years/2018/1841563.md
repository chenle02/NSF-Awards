With computing impacting every field, and becoming a fundamental mode of inquiry
in most disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;there is great demand for university coursework
in computer science (CS). This has been reflected in a growth&lt;br/&gt;in CS
majors. According to the numbers compiled by the Computer Research Association,
in the decade since 2006, the number of computer science majors had tripled
since 2006 and doubled since 2011. The trend has continued in the two years
since, and University of Maryland - Baltimore County has not been an exception.
According to several National Science Foundation public presentations that as
the growth in computer science majors crests, there is a building wave of what
is being viewed as "CS+X" students -- students studying in a discipline other
than computer science, but needing a significant body of coursework. Our
experience shows that by exposing such students to computing, we will diversify
and broaden the participation in CS classes. We propose to create pathways into
computing for such non computer science majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will involve designing a sequence of new classes including, but also
beyond, the&lt;br/&gt;introductory programming sequence. These classes will
introduce key concepts to students who do not intend to major in CS. Preliminary
work has shown that this pool of students is much more diverse than that
typically take CS courses. This project will focus on creating a sequence of
courses that focus more on concepts important for various domains, as well as
concepts related to scaling up (e.g., scalable data structures). It will also
experiment with customized "X+CS" majors through the Individualized Study
program. The researchers will consult colleagues from industry as they develop
the course sequence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
