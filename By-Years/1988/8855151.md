Beginning in the summers of l989 and l990, Boston University will sponsor an
intensive six week program in mathematics for ambitious high school students.
The students will be advised by l2 mathematically experienced counselors and l0
faculty. The heart of the program is the experience gained by students through
their efforts to solve problems in Number Theory and Algebra. To assist them in
these efforts, the program provides several sources of aid (beyond the daily
lecture). Five problem sessions, directed by senior mathematicians, will meet
three times per week in groups of about l0 students. Each student will be
supervised by a counselor in residence who is always available to answer
questions. The coursework will be supplemented by diverse weekly lectures by
faculty preceptors. Students will be assigned a faculty preceptor who will be on
hand to offer career guidance and mathematical stimulation throughout the
summer.
