This geoinformatics award will support the continued development of the
alphaMELTS software package to provide a flexible, powerful, easy-to-use
interface and related tools. The three-year project will employ an early-career,
female scientist to create the next software generation, to interact with users
to implement requested features and support their modeling efforts, to test and
demonstrate the new features, to optimize the package for use in teaching, and
to publicize its educational features to encourage wide adoption. All software
developed by this project will be released free of charge for use by the
scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects supported by this new
software package include models and algorithms for computational thermodynamics
in petrology, geochemistry, and geodynamics. It enables earth scientists to
execute forward models of complex petrogenetic scenarios with internal
thermodynamic consistency and integrated volatile and trace element
calculations. The project will explore the opening of an alphaMELTS XSEDE
gateway to enable access to national high-performance computing resources and
integration of computational thermodynamics into geodynamic codes on an
unprecedented scale.
