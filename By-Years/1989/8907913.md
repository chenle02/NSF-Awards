Instrumentation support is requested to provide semi-automated nucleic acid
extraction for the shared Core DNA laboratory of the Immunology Program at
Virginia Mason Research Center. This Core facility is designed to coordinate and
facilitate the needs of Center investigators for efficient access to materials,
particularly cell lines and genomic DNA. This facility employs 1.5 FTE
technicians and provides DNA prep, storage and distribution services to
participating investigators. The major users of this instrument are Center
investigators with shared interests in human immunogenetics. Each related
projects for which this instrumentation support is requested. Projects in basic
immunogenetics emphasize questions of gene organization and polymorphism among
three potentially interrelated sets of multi- gene families: Immunoglobulin VH
genes, T cell receptor alpha and bata genes, and class II genes which, in each
case, confers essential elements of functional specificity for the immune
system. Use of a semi-automated nucleic acid extractor will improve access to
materials for all investigators, particularly for DNA from multiple individuals
needed for studies of genomic polymorphisms.
