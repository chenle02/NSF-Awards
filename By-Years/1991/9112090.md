A gamma counter is to be acquired for radio isotope assays and radioimmuno
assays. Specific research areas in which this instrument will be used are: i)
Development of low-cost polymeric surfaces for culturing anchorage-dependent
mammalian cells; ii) Role of plasma membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal
architecture on cell fragility; and iii) Influence of nutrition and cell
longevity on monoclonal antibody synthesis.
