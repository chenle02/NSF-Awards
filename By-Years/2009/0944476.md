This SBIR Phase I project will develop a solution to real-time monitoring of
contaminants at specific nodes in the water use cycle. The company will employ a
proven sensor technology, the quartz crystal microbalance, to detect chemical
and biological contaminants. The quartz crystal microbalance uses chemical
receptors to bind target contaminants, either individual species or in groups.
Quansor has developed chemical receptors for a wide range of inorganic
(especially mercury and arsenic) pesticides and nerve agents and biologicals.
The system to be developed will use 2 quartz balances operating in a parallel
fashion. It will address potential problems of fouling and other interferences.
The project will develop the means to overcome that problem and enable monitors
to operate in surface and ground waters.

The broader/commercial impact of the project will be the removal of contaminants
from the water supply. Ninety million Americans are exposed to some level of
arsenic and mercury in their tap water from public supplies. The project will
optimize the cost efficiency and other environmental impacts on the
effectiveness of treatment options to ensure a high level of arsenic removal.
