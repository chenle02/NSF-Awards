In this project in the Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Harriman will study new methodologies in the field of
quantum chemistry. His contributions to density matrix theory have the potential
for allowing chemists to improve their understanding of laser and nuclear
magnetic resonance phenomena, as well as to perform accurate calculations on
larger molecules than is possible at present. This project deals with reduced
density matrices, which provide one of the best ways of summarizing the
essential information about a many-electron system in compact and useful form,
and density functional theory, which is an effective method for dealing with
large systems.
