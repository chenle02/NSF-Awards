This research will analyze the pollen from selected peat cores from the tundra
of Beringia, the ancient subcontinent which now includes Alaska and Northeastern
Siberia. The arctic tundra is a major ecosystem which plays a significant role
as a major repository of the world's carbon. Whether northern peat is still
accumulating soil carbon or may actually be losing carbon is a question with
important consequences for global change scenarios. This work will use plant
eaology and soil studies to interpret pollen records. Pollen analysis offers
ecologists a long-term perspective on vegetation change in this complex
environment. Interactive activities include: teaching a course directly related
to this research and introducing students to the tools and methods used to
understand past environmental change. In addition, a seminar will be offered
entitled Women in Prehistoric Society. This course is an exploration of the
traditional biases toward gender roles in prehistory, which will enable Dr.
Eisner to extend her visibility and contribution to other departments at the
University of Alaska Anchorage.
