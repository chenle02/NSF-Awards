The P.I.'s will raise sediment cores from lakes in the Brazilian Amazon. All
lakes have been chosen by ground reconnaissance by Brazilian personnel in
association with the project, or from shuttle imagery, the prime requirement
being that the lakes be divorced from the river system, preferably occupying
closed basins. The target is continuous sedimentary sequences spanning the time
of the last glaciation in the north. The investigator will reconstruct histories
of forest plant populations by pollen and phyolith analysis. The results will be
used to test hypotheses relating to: the existence of rain forest refugia during
northern glacial maxima, the permanence of rain forest communities, glacial
temperature depression in the lowland tropics, rain forest perturbance time-
scales and the causes of diversity, the environmental impact of long term
(.&gt;6000 yr) human disturbance on the rain forests, and to suggest strategies
of wise use or conservation for Amazonia.
