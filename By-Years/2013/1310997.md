This action funds Luke J. Linhoff of Florida International University to conduct
a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National University
of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Testing Applied Amphibian
Conservation Methodologies." The host scientist is Dr. David Bickford.

The term "translocation" is used to describe any anthropogenically caused
movement of living organisms from one area to another. Amphibian conservation
programs utilize translocations for endangered species reintroductions, habitat
mitigations, species restoration, and rehabilitations. However, little research
has studied the subsequent behavioral and physiological effects on amphibians
following translocation. This project focuses on 3 goals: 1) developing a long
term research plan to develop tropical amphibian translocation experiments that
can be replicated on temperate amphibians; 2) performing short translocation
trails comparing methodologies on a common leaf litter frog; 3) initiating
testing to assess a non-invasive attachment technique for radio transmitters
that will eventually be used to track amphibians.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will have direct and immediate
application to a growing movement to save endangered amphibians. If conservation
programs have more scientifically sound recommendations, it may be possible to
save a larger number of species.
