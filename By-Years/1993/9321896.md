9321896 Covert The fungus Cronartium quercuum fusiforme causes fusiform rust in
Southern pines. The fungus must grow in association with two different host
trees, pine and oak, in order to complete its life cycle. This starter grant,
based on Dr. Covert's NSF Plant Postdoctoral Fellowship, is funding research
aimed at the identification of genes involved with the cause of galls on pines
and the specificity of different spore forms for different hosts. A collection
of genes from the fungus is being made, and techniques are being developed to
genetically transform the fungus. %%% Fusiform rust is the most economically
significant tree disease in the Southern United States. These experiments will
allow the techniques of molecular biology to be applied to studies of how this
fungus causes disease and how it propagates itself. ***
