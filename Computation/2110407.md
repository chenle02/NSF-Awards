Many types of waves propagate through inhomogeneous media, such as light waves
propagating in the air, where the particle density depends on the height of the
atmospheric layers, acoustic waves propagating in the water, where the salinity
depends on the ocean depth, or seismic waves propagating in the earth, where the
density of geological layers varies depending on their sedimentation history.
The scientific thrust of this project is devoted to the development of numerical
simulation tools for wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media.
The principal application targeted is wave propagation in aeroacoustics to study
the noise generated by a turbo-reactor in a flow, where the source of
inhomogeneity and anisotropy is the non-uniform air flow around the engine. Yet
the methods considered will also apply to other variable material properties
such as permittivity or sound speed.

This project is concerned with the further development of a class of Trefftz-
like methods. Trefftz methods rely, in broad terms, on the idea of approximating
solutions to partial differential equations using local basis functions, which
are exact solutions of the governing equation, making explicit use of
information about the ambient medium. Instead, the new methods rely on basis
functions that are approximate solutions of the governing equation rather than
exact solutions. The PI therefore refers to such methods as quasi-Trefftz
methods. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) investigate the properties of
the quasi-Trefftz methods when using a high-order local basis; (2) investigate
numerical integration techniques for the corresponding basis functions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
