A Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometer, with associated sampling
accessories and a spectal library will be used by students in organic,
instrumental analysis, physical, inorganic, and polymer coatings courses, as
well as in undergraduate research projects. Theoretical aspects of Fourier
Transformation and computer-controlled data acquisition and manipulation, now
mainly lecture topics, will be experimentally studied and utilized by these
chemistry students. The instrument will also be introduced in lower level
chemistry courses, including a nonmajors course, where it will show the power of
modern, computer-based instrumentation in studies of samples obtained from the
everyday world. The grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
