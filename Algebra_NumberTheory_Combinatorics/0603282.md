The research contemplated in this proposal is directed at two related
Diophantine problems about polynomials. The first problem is to better
understand the distribution of values of the local and global Mahler measure of
polynomials with coefficients restricted to either algebraic number fields or
their completions. The main technical tool used to accomplish this is to study
the Mellin transform of the distribution function associated to Mahler's
measure. Then Mellin inversion techniques from analysis are used to obtain
estimates or explicit formulas for the distribution functions. A further aspect
of the research is to interpret the results in terms of the heights of algebraic
numbers. The second problem is to consider the Wronskian of a collection of
linearly independent polynomials with coefficients in an algebraic number field
or the completion of such a field. We seek an inequality which relates the local
and global Mahler measures of the Wronskian with the local and global Mahler
measures of the original set of linearly independent polynomials. This is well
understood for two polynomials, but only approximate results are known for a
collection of three or more polynomials. Again there is an interpretation in
terms of the heights of the roots of the polynomials, and this turns out to be
related to the ABC-inequality of Stothers and Mason. A further aspect of this
research is to work out applications to certain Diophantine problems.

A Diophantine equation is an equation to be solved in integers. The study of
such equations is one of the oldest parts of number theory and continues to
attract some of the best mathematical researchers. The tools developed in modern
mathematics to study Diophantine equations can be extremely technical, and often
involve related issues that can be described under the general title of
"Diophantine problems". For example, one might study inequalities to be solved
in integers, or to be solved in polynomials with integer coefficients. The
research considered in this proposal is directed at exactly such Diophantine
inequalities for polynomials. In all fields of science there is generally a
great intellectual distance between the highly technical efforts of pure
researchers and the eventual applications to business, technology or
engineering. We do know that the area of Diophantine problems has important
applications to computer problems, to the construction of encryption systems,
and to other technological questions. A solution to the problems contemplated in
this proposal would further our understanding of pure mathematical questions
which belong to this important field. Also, this proposal will fund the research
of several graduate students at the University of Texas. These students will
benefit from the opportunity to concentrate on the research efforts, to travel
and talk about their work at scientific meetings, and to consult with other
researchers working on related problems. A further important goal of this work
is the completion of a monograph written by the PI with the title ``Heights,
Mahler measure and Diophantine inequalities". Over a period of many years the PI
has written notes for graduate students in classes on this topic that the PI has
taught at the University of Texas. These notes will be collected, edited and
somewhat expanded into a monograph.
