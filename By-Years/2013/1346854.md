Objective: The objective of this project is to address the feasibility of a
novel paradigm for the Internet of Things based on radio-less backscattering
devices that can communicate with each other independently. The novel device is
referred to as sense-a-tag, and it will allow for point-to-point and multihop
communication. The work also involves development of protocols for the sense-a-
tag. The research is exploratory and of transformative nature. If the
feasibility of the envisioned sense-a-tag is demonstrated, one will have the
long-sought device that can enable a vast range of applications within the
framework of the Internet of Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:
The intellectual merit is in the design of a novel device and its protocol. The
protocol will make seamless the device?s operation with commercial Radio
Frequency Identification tags and readers. The device will play a central role
in the Internet of Things where proximity-based sensing and tag-to-tag to
communication are critical. The new sense-a-tag will also permit novel solutions
for localization, tracking and monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
The broader impacts are in advancing the research and technological growth of
Radio Frequency Identification as a key pillar to the Internet of Things. The
device will facilitate low cost and high scalability deployments, a sine qua non
for the growth of the Internet of Things, thus bringing it to reality much
sooner. The latter will benefit society in innumerable ways. Furthermore, with
the proposed device, better Radio Frequency Identification systems will be
designed and consequently, more technical and societal benefits will be reaped.
