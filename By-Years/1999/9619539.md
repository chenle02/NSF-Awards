AST-9619539 Further development and Experimental Verification of Electromagnetic
Multisphere-Scattering Theory. Interplanetary and interstellar dust particles
are often believed to have a fluffy aggregate structure. Accurate information on
the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with these complex particles is of
great importance to many areas of astrophysics, particularly planetary,
interstellar, and galactic astronomy. The aim of Dr. Xu's work is to produce a
complete rigorous solution to multiparticle scattering problems and to make
available a practical version of the theory to the community. Dr. Xu plans to
test the theory in the laboratory using microwave scattering measurements.
