This dissertation research will examine and juxtapose environmental debates
characteristic of two cities, Houston, Texas and Shenzhen, People's Republic of
China (PRC). The research will address the ethical concerns inherent in
ecological effects of global economic systems predicated on the aggressive
development of science and technology. Having completed fieldwork in Houston,
the dissertation student will spend a year in the PRC, developing an
ethnographic geography of the cultural forms of everyday life within the context
of preexisting social and spatial structures. The fieldwork will involve
networking, a survey of Shenzhen intellectuals, in-depth interviews, archival
research, and mapping exercises. Expected results will include an outline of the
general domains and terms of the environmental ethics debates there and an
analysis of how the attitudes of the Shenzhen intelligensia toward the social
use of science and technology inform their ethical positions. The information
from the studies in Houston and Shenzhen will also provide a basis for analyses
of how social relationships and status, as well as status within the world
economic system, influence the ability of individuals, groups, regions, and
nations to participate in debates about environmental ethics.
