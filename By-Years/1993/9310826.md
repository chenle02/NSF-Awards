9310826, PI-Sherbrooke: The Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) of the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH), located in southeastern Arizona, offers field
biologists from numerous U. S. and international institutions a field research
facility with access to a wide range of biological communities and a great
diversity of species. The primary objective of the Station research. Support
facilities for field research projects are extremely important. This project
addresses three areas of acute facilities' needs at SWRS in an integrated plan.
The first goal is to provide a climate controlled building for temporarily
housing experimental animals in isolated units, for different experimental/care
needs. This facility would meet room wing onto the laboratories to provide a
winterized space for housing scientific collections and the research library. In
addition, the roofing of the entire laboratory would be insulated and
refurbished. The third goal is to renovate the outdated animal room into a
computer room and an office. Achieving these goals would, in addition,
significantly increase space for researchers and improve conditions in the main
laboratory facility.
