The PI plans research aimed at clarifying the chemical steps in the
Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxial (OMVPE) growth of compounds such as GaAs
and AlGaAs used in electronic and optoelectronic devices. This project should
result in guidelines for more detailed studies of the chemical kinetics and the
reaction mechanisms operative in OMVPE crystal growth. The specific work will
involve studies of the effect of methyl radicals on well characterized GaAs and
AlGaAs surfaces. The work will be primarily experimental, for example, post-
reaction surfaces will be examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy
Dispersive X-ray Analysis (SEM/EDX), etc.
