This project examines how second generation youth (born here or immigrated at
least five years ago) adapt to U.S. society. Two surveys, three years apart,
will be conducted of students in grades 8 and 9 in South Florida. Those students
include repre- sentatives of Cuban, Haitian, West Indian, and Central and South
American immigrant groups. Differences in success of adaptation, and in the
processes through which it occurs, are expected, and will be linked to aspects
of the social context encountered by children in each group. The study focuses
upon family history, socio-economic background, employment status, language
skills and usage, acculturation, self identity, career aspirations, school
adjustment, and educational attainment. Results have implica- tions for theories
of socialization, language acquisition, mobility, and cultural change.
