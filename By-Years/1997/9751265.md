Field experiences in hydrogeology and environmental science can be substantially
strengthened with expansion of the university's capabilities to study surface
and subsurface water. This project provides a groundwater well, nested
piezometers, an automatic sampler, and associated peripherals (pumps, data
logger, etc.). The field site where these are installed is used by
undergraduates in geology and environmental science courses, by visiting
secondary school students, and by undergraduates from other institutions. Class
exercises and student research projects include the delineation of three-
dimensional flow patterns for local groundwater, development of groundwater and
surface water hydrographs, study of the chemical evolution of subsurface water,
and quantification of quickflow and baseflow contributions to a local stream.
Use of this field site ensures that students have a solid understanding of the
physical and chemical behavior of subsurface water in the saturated and
unsaturated zones and of the interaction between subsurface flow and surface
water bodies. *
