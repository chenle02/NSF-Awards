One of the central problems of low-dimensional topology is the classification of
smooth simply connected 4-manifolds. In this direction, a basic question is
whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth
structure in fact admits infinitely many. The PI's previous work with R. Stern
developed a technique called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack
this problem. This technique depends on the existence of 'model manifolds' or
equivalently the discovery of embedded nullhomologous tori on which surgery can
be performed. Until recently, there have been no explicit techniques for finding
such tori. However, in the past year, R. Stern and the P.I. have discovered
techniques for finding these tori in standard 4-manifolds. This proposal
explains how this is done in (2 or more) blowups of CP^2. The embedded
nullhomologous tori which are produced can be surgered to create infinite
families of homeomorphic but mutually nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds. The next
task is to carry out Floer homology and relative Seiberg-Witten calculations so
that our technique can become useful in its most general form.

The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship between
mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students in topology, and career development of postdoctoral
fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and topology has very close ties to physics.
For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds
which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple
type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of
engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic
concern. The search for exotic 4-manifolds has been embraced by the theoretical
physics community, and new results on this front will also serve to enhance this
relationship. Another basic goal of this proposal is to address 'pipeline
issues' in mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young
mathematicians working on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is
the development of problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced
undergraduate students. It presents problems which will be suitable thesis
problems for students and research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan
State. It also discusses computational problems which are suitable for advanced
undergraduate students.
