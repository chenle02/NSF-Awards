This project will support travel by approximately 11-12 students at U.S.
institutions to attend the 11th Annual International Conference on Mobile
Systems, Applications, and Services (MobiSys 2013). MobiSys, sponsored by ACM
SIGMOBILE, will be held June 25th-28th, 2013 in Taipei, Taiwan. Priority will be
given to students who will benefit from attending this conference, but are
unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. MobiSys is the
premier conference in the field of mobile computing and system integration. It
offers a variety of technical activities including keynote and contributed
presentations, a poster session, demonstrations, three workshops, and a PhD
Forum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project furthers both research and education,
by enabling graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-
caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and
interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students from around the
world. The impact to the students' careers from attending MobiSys 2013 is
expected to be substantial.
