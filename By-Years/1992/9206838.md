Program Summary: This is a joint proposal from PI's at SIO and at Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) to develop improved seawater profiling and
sampling systems. Each of the three proposals in the joint package addresses a
particular problem with current water sampling devices. In this proposal, the PI
proposes a one-year development program to design, construct and test an
improved water sampling bottle and an improved CTD controller. The proposed
design changes for the water sampling bottles are necessary to reduce
contamination of water samples and to permit more efficient water sampling and
use of shiptime. Such improvements would benefit sampling programs to be
conducted during the WOCE hydrographic cruises. //
