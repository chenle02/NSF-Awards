&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop an innovative new ultraviolet (UV) curable pre-ceramic polymer chemistry
for the fabrication of high yield and low cost silicon oxycarbide (SOC) fibers
for diesel particulate filters and other applications. Silicon carbide (SiC),
silicon nitride (Si3N4), and silicon nitride/silicon carbide (Si3N4/SiC)
ceramics have been fabricated from UV photocurable pre-ceramic polymers to SiC
and Si3N4/SiC with higher than 85 percent ceramic yield. Preliminary experiments
have demonstrated that SOC fibers can also be fabricated from high-viscosity,
photocurable thermoplastic pre-ceramic polymers. The poly(ethynyl)siloxane pre-
ceramic polymers also have potential as a binder or matrix phase in SOC/SOC
composites. Phase I will optimize fiber production
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential commercial applications are expected
in particulate diesel filters for manufacturers in the automotive and truck
markets. &lt;br/&gt;
