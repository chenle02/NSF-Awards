Through this grant, the Chemistry Department is upgrading the data system (high-
speed interface, pulse programmer, software, workstation) on its Chemagnetics
A-200 Fourier Transform NMR (FT- NMR) spectrometer. The upgrade includes an
accessible Windows environment, making routine use by students possible. The
system significantly shortens signal optimization and data acquisition times and
permits true multitasking (independent data acquisition and data processing),
thus permitting the use of the instrument in larger introductory-level courses.
The upgraded instrument is used by chemistry majors and minors in several
courses (Organic Chemistry II, Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry and Analytical
Biochemistry), as well as by student research interns. Approximately 75 students
per year will use the upgraded instrument. The goal of the project is to provide
chemistry majors and minors with significant experiences in the theory and
practice of the important technique of FT-NMR spectroscopy by integrating the
use of the instrument throughout the curriculum.
