A fundamental problem in the study of behavior is the emergence of complexity
of social behavior from the behavior of individuals within the social unit. If
the characteristics of a social group can be accounted for by the summed actions
of individuals, then social behavior is a resultant of individual behavior. If
the characteristics of a group are not simply due to the summed actions of
individuals, then social behavior has an emergent property. Social insects are
well known to have attributes of the colony that are not present among the
individuals comprising the colony. The activity of a colony is basic to all its
other behavior. Dr. Cole has discovered that activity within nests of a species
of ant, Leptothorax allardycei, has short-term cycles, with pulses of activity
occurring at intervals of approximately 20 minutes. Individual, isolated ants do
not show this regularity of activity, but the periodicity emerges as more and
more ants are added to the aggregate. The purpose of this research project is to
analyze the production of periodicity in colonies from the behavior and movement
patterns of individual ants. Dr. Cole will develop a computer model of the
movement patterns of individual ants, including their velocity of movement,
turning angles, and position within the nest that they occupy. This information
will be combined with information on their response to encounters with other
ants, the effect of an encounter on the probability of subsequent activity by an
individual ant, and mutual synchronization of activity to produce a computer
model of the activity of a colony. This model will be tested by direct
manipulation of the activity of colonies through the use of alarm pheromones.
Dr. Cole's research is an important step toward gaining an understanding of the
mechanisms by which the individuals within a social unit produce social
phenomena. Until we understand the mechanisms of social interaction, it will
remain impossible to predict the consequences of group living and the effects of
natural selection on social behavior.
