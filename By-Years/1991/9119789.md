Structural studies will be carried out on the quinoprotein-electron transfer
system methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) from Paracoccus denitrificans by the
methods of x-ray diffraction. Three proteins are involved in this system, MADH,
amicyanin and cytochrome c551i. MADH is a dimer of 124 kDa and contains the
unusual cofactor tryptophan tryptophylquinone. Amicyanin is a blue copper
protein of 12.5 kDa which interacts specifically with MADH. Cytochrome c551i is
a 22 kDa protein which accepts electrons from amicyanin and transfers them via
another cytochrome to a terminal oxidase. Crystals have been prepared of MADH,
amicyanin, the binary complex of MADH with amicyanin and of the ternary complex
of MADH, amicyanin and cytochrome c551i. The structures of MADH and the binary
complex have been solved by molecular replacement to 2.8 A and 2.5 A resolution,
respectively. The structures of the remaining crystal types and of the
cytochrome by itself will be determined. The structures of all crystal types
will be refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization. These structures
will be carefully analyzed using molecular graphics to determine the catalytic
mechanisms and details of the electron transfer processes.
