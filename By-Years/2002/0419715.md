This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the
development of high-performance hydrocarbon reforming catalysts for fuel
processors of fuel cell systems. The objective of this research project is to
determine feasibility of novel composite materials approach for development of
reforming catalysts with high activity for hydrocarbon reforming reactions,
resistance to degradation via carbon deposition, and tolerance to sulfur
impurities in the hydrocarbon fuels. The approach is based on the identification
of formulations and use of synthesis methods to provide ultimate dispersion of
catalytic metals within a stable support material that contributes to the
reforming reactions. The Phase I research results will establish an approach for
designing highly active and durable catalysts for use in fuel cell systems
operating on existing fuels such as natural gas, propane, diesel, gasoline, and
aviation fuels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New energy systems are required that can
operate on fossil fuels and generate less greenhouse gases and polluting
emissions. The proposed program supports the nation's goals of increasing energy
efficiency, reducing polluting emissions, and reducing the use of imported
energy resources to meet U.S. needs. The proposed catalyst technology is
applicable to a number of power generation applications in residential,
industrial, automotive, and military markets. &lt;br/&gt;
