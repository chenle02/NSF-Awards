This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of bioelectrochemistry. This award will provide funds for the
purchase of a video enhanced microscope with which Professor Ewing can perform
some truly innovative experiments in bioelectrochemistry. Specifically, this
young investigator will employ the video enhanced microscope to optically
visualize synaptic junctions between cultured neurons to perform the first in
vivo measurement of neurotransmitter release from a single synaptic bouton.
Success in these experiments would demonstrate the electrochemist's ability to
make measurements at the same cellular level that the bioscientist thinks in
terms of. This achievement would represent an important milestone in
bioelectrochemistry and its possibility has been facilitated by this
investigator's advances in microelectrode fabrication and neuronal cell culture
experiments. The ability to perform analytical voltammetry wholly within
synaptic gaps will enable the identification of catecholaminergic
neurotransmitters by voltammetry and, therefore, by cell type. Additionally,
this new experimental capability will permit correlation of neuronal stimulation
type and strength with neurotransmitter release from a single neuron. This
research could lead to procedures for identifying and characterizing cultured
neurons as well as new fundamental insights into neuronal communication.
