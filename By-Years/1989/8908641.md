This proposed research will continue a line of work long supported by this
division that has over the years produced probably the most innovative
development of statistical methods for making sense of social science data in
the last forty years. Several different projects will be undertaken or
completed, including one blending classical methods used in analyzing variance
in data typically collected by experimentally oriented behavioral and social
science research with graphic and other exploratory methods. Another, new
project will develop systematic treatment for the design and analysis of data
simulations, long a method used by statisticians for developing statistical
tools. A third will develop new techniques of exploratory and robustness
analysis (or extend techniques previously developed by the authors) to survey
research data. The PI has a most distinguished reputation among both social
scientists and statisticians because of remarkable production of both technical
and more accessible textbook materials describing and illustrating the methods
that continue to be developed.
