This is an award for Phase II of the development of an American Sign Language
(ASL) acquisition, recognition and translation system. Such a system could
eventually allow deaf signers and English speaking individuals to communicate
without the aid of a human interpreter. The Phase II research focuses on several
critical capabilities: (1) the quantification of ASL as a spatial/visual
language; (2) the acquisition of ASL for internal use by a computer; (3) the
recognition of dynamic ASL gestures; and (4) the context-sensitive translation
between ASL and English. A proof-of-concept prototype will be built. Machine
translation algorithms for ASL-to-English will be developed. Potential
intermediate products include: gestural interfaces for computers and home
appliances, telerobotic controllers, virtual reality and simulations tools, and
ASL research tools.
