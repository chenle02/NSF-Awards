Numerous samples have been colected from the axial valley of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge and Kane Fracture Zone intersection (the MARK area) during previous
dredging campaigns and Alvin dives. Drs. Thompson and Gillis plan to conduct
laboratory analyses on these and corresponding rocks from Site 504B (East
Pscific Rise) and the Troodos ophiolite in and investigate therole of
metamorphic asemblages in the foramtion of ore-forming hydrothermal fluids
within oceanic crust. Throughout the range of environments represented by this
collection of samples, the PIs hope to encounter a wide variety of temperatures,
water/rock conditions, textures and rock types. Analytical techniques will
include petrographic analysis and major, trace, and isotopic measurement of
minerals, bulk models, calculate buldk rock exchanges, and calculate fluid
compositions from vein precipitates and fluid inclusions.
