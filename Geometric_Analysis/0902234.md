Understanding the relationship between the geometry of a space and the spectra
of natural geometric differential operators on the space is a problem which
arises in a number of branches of science. Individual eigenvalues are hard to
analyze and often the geometry of a space is more clearly reflected by certain
weighted averages of the eigenvalues such as zeta invariants. Okikiolu is
proposing to study both the general theory of zeta invariants and special cases
which are of particular physical and geometrical relevance.

The purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of the geometric
significance of zeta invariants for future physical and geometrical
applications. Okikiolu proposes to continue to make her research accessible to
undergraduates through student seminars and colloquia, and to further integrate
research into the undergraduate experience. She seeks to: a) motivate course
material with accessible examples and calculations taken from her own research,
b) create opportunity for students to collaborate on building proofs in the
classroom, c) foster collaborative intellectual curiosity. This will hopefully
produce students who have a deeper understanding and appreciation for the
subject.
