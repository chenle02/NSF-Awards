NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The goal of this project is to synthesize materials
of the type Eu(S,Se) and (Eu, Sm)Se. The host material, EuSe is a special
semiconductor that can exhibit one type of magnetism (ferromagnetism) under high
magnetic fields and a second type (antiferromagnetism) at low fields. In the
first system, incorporation of sulfur, should shift the magnetic ordering from
antiferro- to ferromagnetic, which will allow a study of the relationship
between the electronic structure and magnetic ordering in order to understand
the mechanism behind magnetic refrigeration (magnetocaloric effect). In the
second system, substitution of samarium for europium will enable the
understanding of the relationship between the electronic structure and the
charge on the rare earth element. The research will target these materials in
both the bulk and as nanoparticles, providing a synergistic understanding of the
role of morphology and size on the magnetic and electronic properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The project involves the synthesis
of both bulk and nanoparticles of lanthanide monochalcogenides, which are
intrinsically semiconducting and magnetic. The role of anion solid solutions of
Eu(S,Se) will be investigated to determine the consequences of the anion changes
to the electronic structure and how this changes the magneto-caloric effect. In
addition, magnetic circular dichroism will be used to probe the excited states
of these alloys. The second project involves probing the role of the lanthanide
in solid solutions of (Eu,Sm)Se, to understand the lanthanide oxidation state as
a function of the electronic structure. Although EuSe has been found to contain
divalent europium and SmSe has divalent samarium, low doping levels of samarium
inject samarium in the trivalent state. These variations will be investigated
through use of L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
