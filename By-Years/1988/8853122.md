This project enhances this institution's offerings in the areas of
manufacturing, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and
robotics. The equipment funded by this award supports undergraduate mechanical
engineering courses at the sophmore/junior level as well as advanced courses at
the senior level. In particular, students learn both theoretical and practical
aspects of: teach pendant control, computer interfacing, mechanical
manipulation, off-line programming and simulation, and application of computer
vision. The laboratory equipment includes: Rhino robots with tilt rotary
carousel, belt conveyor, x-y table, software and other accessories, and, a
computer vision system. Student interface is via IBM PC's. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
