This research will be on the nutational and deformational responses of the
Earth to lunisolar perturbations, and on geophysical phenomena which affect
these reposes; it will consist of theoretical investigations, as well as
analyses related to space-geodetic data. The primary goals are, firstly, to
obtain more accurate knowledge of the Earth's structure and properties,
especially those relating to the fluid outer and solid inner cores, and
secondly, to apply this knowledge to derive accurate formulae, including the
effects of mantle anelasticity, ocean tides, etc., for nutation amplitudes and
tidal parameters. The theoretical studies will take advantage of the
developments in the theory of nutations including the influence of inner core
dynamics, and in the formulation of the tidal deformation problem in
computationally efficient form.
