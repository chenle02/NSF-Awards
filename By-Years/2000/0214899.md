This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
temperature-sensitive nanoparticles to protect drugs from degradation in a
targeted drug delivery system. Several important pharmaceutical compounds have
low solubility and short half-life in the aqueous phase. As a result,
significant portions of the therapeutic agents hydrolyze during formulation or
in the blood before reaching the required site. Nanotechnology and microemulsion
technology provide a novel approach to overcome these limitations. In this
project, a model therapeutic agent, an anticancer drug, has been chosen for the
development of an effective formulation. Microemulsion will eliminate hydrolysis
of the therapeutic agent and also provide thermodynamically stable nano-size
encapsulates for further development of the temperature-sensitive release
characteristics of the end product. These nanoencapsulates will circulate in the
blood for the long time and therapeutic agent can be delivered at the site of
interest (tumor cells) by increasing temperature of that site with the help of a
laser.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of pharmaceutical
drug delivery.
