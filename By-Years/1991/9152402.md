Funds are requested to replace an outdated psychology laboratory with a local
area network of computers for psychological research. Funds are also requested
for software that will significantly increase the ability of undergraduates to
program their own experiments, facilitate the ability of faculty advisors to
monitor and assist students with the implementation of experiments on computers,
and allow the department to develop a repository of psychological experiments
that are easy to modify for use by students for independent research and for
laboratory exercises in a number of courses. The project is designed to increase
the availability of sophisticated computer-controlled experiments to
undergraduates who are typically not prepared to program or execute such
experiments.
