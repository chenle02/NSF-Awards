This five-year award will support Spring Joint Student-Professional, and Fall
Regional Conferences of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP). The
Spring meeting is known as the Annual Conference of the National Society of
Black Physicists and Black Physics Students (ACBPS). The ACBPS is the largest
gathering of African American physicists anywhere in the world. Roughly half of
the undergraduate and graduate African-American students from US institutions
attend these meetings. The objective is the development of effective mentor-
protege relationships between professional physicists and students. The emphasis
of the Fall meetings is on academic achievement, leadership skills, and NSBP
chapter development. The collection of activities is intended to assist the
transition of students from secondary school, through undergraduate work,
graduate work, and ultimately to successful integration into the global physics
enterprise. The project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research, the
Physics Division, the Division of Astronomy, the Division of Human Resource
Development, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Geosciences
Directorate.
