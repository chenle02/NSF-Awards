This project establishes the Seattle Hub for Industry-driven Nanotechnology
Education (SHINE) to promote nanotechnology education in the Pacific Northwest.
The two main thrusts of the project are educational program improvement and
faculty development. The program improvement activities are designed to create a
sustainable outreach network that engages K-12 classrooms, after-school programs
and informal learning events throughout the Seattle area. The program
improvement activities are also intended to diversify the student population
that is enrolled in the nanotechnology programs at North Seattle Community
College. The faculty development activities are designed to educate high school
and community college STEM instructors in nanotechnology and advanced
pedagogical techniques. The project includes both formative and summative
assessment plans that measure the progress of the project and its impact on
students, instructors and the community. All of the materials developed during
the course of the project are going to be freely disseminated via a website
hosted by NACK, the NSF funded ATE national center located at Penn State
University.
