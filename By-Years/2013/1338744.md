A topical meeting devoted to adaptive optics across a broad range of
applications is being held by the Optical Society of America in Arlington, VA,
23-27 June 2013. Dr. Julian Christou (Large Binocular Telescope Observatory) and
Dr. Donald Miller (Indiana University) are cochairs. The emphasis will be on
synergies between methods developed and used by various communities pursuing
different applications, and a special interest will be exploring ways to address
current limitations in adaptive optics systems and novel applications. A number
of internationally-known invited speakers will be participating. Partial funding
for this activity is being provided by NSF?s Division of Astronomical Sciences
through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.
