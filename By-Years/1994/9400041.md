9400041 Wysk This project provides a technical pilot phase for testing the
utility of one physical manufacturing laboratory called MODELWORLD, for use by
many remote researchers. The information infrastructure will be supported to
allow testing of the concept in the research community. This open manufacturing
facility has potential use for research and education in operations research,
information technologies, and flexible/agile manufacturing. This project offers
the potential of linking researchers from different regions around common
research interests.
