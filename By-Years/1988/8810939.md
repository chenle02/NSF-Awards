The research envolves a study of cell culture growth and somatic embryogenesis
using alfalfa (Medicagosativa). Embryogenesis requires the temporal separation
of the induction and differentiation processes; hence, a multiple-stage
continuous or semicontinuous bioreactor system may be well suited for moderate
or large scale operation. A three stage continuous process for production of
somatic embryos is investigated. This is a research planning grant under the
Research Opportunities for Women program.
