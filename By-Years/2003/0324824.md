PI: Pearson Institution: Georgia Institute of
Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Special Projects Office of
the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Affairs of the
Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate is supporting Dr. Willie Pearson
of the Department of History, Technology and Society, Georgia Institute of
Technology to organize and conduct a workshop entitled "Postdoctoral
Appointments: Roles and Opportunities". Dr. Robert Lichter of Merrimack
Consultants, LLC and Dr. Geraldine L. Richmond of the University of Oregon are
co-PI of the project. The goal of the workshop is to explore the nature and
merit of initiating a postdoctoral program in chemistry that may serve as a
model throughout NSF. Elements that will be considered include: 1) A better
understanding of the processes, characteristics and outcomes of the postdoctoral
appointment. 2) A statement of concepts, opportunities and priorities for
activities at the postdoctoral level by the chemistry division, and the NSF more
generally, that will strengthen the human resource base necessary to maintain
leadership in science, mathematics and engineering. The workshop will be
developed by a ten-person steering committee that will oversee all phases of
planning, development and implementation of the workshop, and drafting a final
report. The workshop will be attended by a demographically diverse group of
approximately 60-70 participants. Attendees will include academic and industrial
administrators, representatives from national labs, industrial labs, funding
agencies and from undergraduate and graduate institutions. The workshop report
will inform the planning process for NSF supported activities at the
postdoctoral level in the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Directorate.
