This experimental research program is aimed at a series of experiments with
interacting cold atoms in far-off-resonant optical lattices. The group will
create and study one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems of bosons with
widely varying coupling strengths and an unprecedented level of control. The
first system to be studied is one-dimensional Bose gases, particularly in the
strong coupling limit. The strongly interacting bosons "fermionize", i.e., their
probability distribution is identical to that of non-interacting fermions in one
dimension. The next proposed measurement is of g(2), the second order
correlation function of the one-dimensional Bose gas, using a photoassociation
technique. In the strong coupling limit, g(2) is expected to approach zero
because of fermion-like repulsion. The group will also measure one-dimensional
boson momentum distributions. These are sensitive to wavefunction amplitudes,
not probabilities, so the momentum distributions differ in a characteristic way
for fermionized one-dimensional bosons and real fermions. The broader impact of
the program involves student education as well as applications to quantum
mechanical devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
