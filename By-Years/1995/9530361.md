This Research Planning Grant (RPG) addresses the development of a model,
captured and automated with expert system technology, to aid managers to
successfully plan, manage, and evaluate the diffusion of information technology.
A premise is that successful information technology diffusion will be critical
for organizations to participate in the emerging technologically-driven global
marketplace. The project emphasizes the diffusion process for information
technology and the role of use by US managers, especially those in small
business organizations, and also by managers in developing countries. This RPG
will provide the preliminary framework for developing a research program by the
investigator in this important and emerging area. + _ Ûª▓ ÑOh ª' +'ª▒0 Ý + ] $ H
