Research and advances in Big Data is a high priority for the society. A week-
long workshop on the applications of succinct data representations to Big Data
analysis will bring together about forty mathematicians and computer scientists
to exchange ideas about, and share current work on, succinct representations of
data enabling sophisticated analysis, as in compressed sensing and streaming,
sparsification, distributed sensing and data fusion, machine learning,
optimization and complex query processing.Â  The workshop will be in cooperation
with the Simons Institute on the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley, and will
take place on September 16-20 2013, during the Institute's semester-long program
on algorithmic foundations of big data analysis, thus also engaging in its work
the (more than thirty) participants of that program. The workshop will be open
to all potential participants and the findings and video tapes of presentations
will be distributed to the public for comments and engagements.
