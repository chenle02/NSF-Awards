This study pilots a new theory and a culturally responsive intervention designed
to address social identity threat among students of color. The proposed
intervention employs a single approach to a complex problem, as social identity
threat effects exert differential effects based on several factors.
Investigators will use a mixed methods approach involving the use of latent
profile analysis to stratify students into different stereotype threat risk
profiles, delivery of tailored supports to students in these profiles, and
assessment of intervention efficacy. The study is expected to produce evidence
to improve retention, interest, engagement, and performance among HBCU
engineering and computer science freshmen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using critical
race theory as a theoretical and analysis framework, the study will use
methodologies such as experimental research, experiential sampling, and content
analysis to implement a two-phase longitudinal investigation. The goal of the
first phase is to deliver the intervention and test the efficacy among first
year engineering and computer science students. In phase two, investigators will
examine the magnitude and effect of the intervention over time. Mixed model
ANOVA will be conducted to examine within and between group differences in math
performance. Longitudinal multi-level model analyses will be used to assess
outcomes over time in phase two. The project could potentially improve retention
and academic outcomes of underrepresented students in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
