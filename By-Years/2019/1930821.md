This grant provides support for 20 U.S.-based graduate students to participate
in the 25th Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Knowledge
Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2019), to be held in Anchorage, Alaska, August 4
- 8, 2019. KDD is the world's premier conference in data science. It is a
prestigious interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers and
practitioners every year, around 3,000 in the year, from all aspects of data
science, data mining, and knowledge discovery. A strong representation of U.S.
students and researchers is essential in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in
this important area today and into the future. Since 2013, the KDD conference
includes a Broadening Participation in Data Mining workshop. As in various STEM
fields, increasing the diversity of participants in KDD research areas is a
primary goal. The selection committee will select recipients of the support
based on merit and need and place emphasis on diversity in the selection
process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The KDD technical program includes oral and
poster presentations of refereed papers, panel discussions, and invited talks by
the world's leading experts. It provides an international forum for presentation
of original research results as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative
and practical development experiences, which are particularly valuable for
student participants. Besides the technical program, the conference features
workshops, tutorials, panels, posters, project showcases, a data mining contest
(KDD Cup), social networks and job matching sessions, and a PhD forum. These
events provide a comprehensive multi-faceted learning experience to students at
all levels. Proceedings will be made available through the ACM Digital
Library.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
