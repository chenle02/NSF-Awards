9408943 Griswold Funds are transferred to NOAA to support two NOAA Sea Grant
Fellows within the NSF Ocean Sciences Division. Two highly qualified students
will work with OCE program staff for one year. Valuable experience will be
gained by working on ocean science research policy and administration. One
student will work with the Oceanographic Technology & Interdisciplinary
Coordination Program and the other with the Biological Oceanography Program. The
Fellowship Program is administrated through NOAA's Office of Oceanic Research
Programs.
