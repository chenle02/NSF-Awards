9423786 Powell This Doctoral Dissertation Research Award supports a project that
uses both game-theoretic modeling and empirical analysis to investigate how
various aspects of electoral systems shape the way in which individuals choose
to organize themselves into political parties with particular organizational
structures. The theoretical model relates specific electoral rules (e.g.
plurality - "winner take all" rules), threshold requirements, and district
magnitudes (e.g. multi-member) to the organizational structures rational self-
interested individuals choose to adopt. By varying these components of the
electoral system, it is possible, within the theoretical model, to generate
hypotheses about how intra-party organization will differ under different
electoral systems. The empirical analysis seeks to test the hypotheses generated
from the theoretical model using three different data sources and methodologies.
These include a statistical analysis of a large data set on electoral systems
and party organizations for the post war democracies; the analysis of
approximately 30 "quasi- experiments" drawn from actual instances of electoral
system change; and an in-depth case study exploring the responses of the Italian
parties to the recent transformation of their electoral system. ***
