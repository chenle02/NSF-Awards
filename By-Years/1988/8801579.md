The research on this project will be carried out by two investigators, the
principal investigator Herve Jacquet and his postdoctoral associate Michael
Heumos. Jacquet will continue his efforts at generalizing his new trace formula.
Results on special values of L-functions, the determination of the residual
spectrum of the general linear group and a better understanding of the Weil
representation are among the long range goals of the project. Heumos will study
models for unitary representations of GLn over a p-adic field. These models
generalize the standard Whittaker model and are subgroups of GLn. Examples
suggest that perhaps all unitary representations embed uniquely in a unique
model. This would provide a new perspective to the study of unitary
representations of the p-adic GLn and would have widespread applications. This
research is in the area of number theory commonly known as the "Langland's
program". It applies advanced notions from many areas, most especially modern
analysis, to answer fundamental questions in arithmetic.
