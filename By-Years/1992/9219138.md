PI will study the timing, magnitude and selectivity of extinction and
origination events associated with a major turnover episode in Caribbean reef
coral fauna. Project will entail: 1) making extensive collections in late
Miocene to Pleistocene sections, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Curacao; 2) dating the
sections using microfossils, paleomagnetics and Sr isotopes; 3) identifying
specimens by morphometrics. Differential taxonomic and ecologic components will
be compared to evaulate differential susceptibility to extinction and identify
possible causes. Results will have important implications for extinction studies
and for conservation strategies for modern tropical reef biotas.
