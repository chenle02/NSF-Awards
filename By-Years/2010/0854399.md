This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-

br/&gt;This research will leverage mobile technologies and sensors to empower
individuals with personal feedback about their carbon emissions and suggestions
on how to improve. The project will be on transportation activities, with three
foci: (1) sensing individual carbon footprints using commodity mobile phones,
(2) developing feedback visualizations on the web and on phones that support in-
the-place awareness about carbon footprints that explicitly handle issues of
uncertainty at the user interface level, and (3) validating and testing
techniques in the domain of transportation. Field deployments will explore the
relative accuracy of the sensors employed and the impact of visualizations on
users' ability to identify which areas represent opportunities for reduction.
High school outreach will be included through CMU's Green Design Apprenticeship
program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
