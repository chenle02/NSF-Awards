9452731 Ripley The Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology (MONTANA
TECH) will initiate a 4-week, summer residential, Young Scholars Project in
earth science for 24 students entering grades 9, 10, and 11. The Mineral
Education Program for Young Scholars (MEPYS) immerses rural students from
Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, Utah and Washington in the field and
laboratory activities of hydro-geology and the associated areas of geological,
mining, metallurgical, mineral processing, petroleum, and environmental
engineering. The program provides students with first-hand research experience
in mineral education under the direction of practicing scientists and engineers
who have chosen these career areas.
