It is the goal of the overall research program to determine in detail laser
induced transient dynamics of phonon and of electronic carrier after optical
excitation. Prior activity in insulators and semiconductors is to be expanded to
include normal and superconducting metallic films. The proposed research
represents an effort to expand the existing program on laser induced excitations
of solids and their subsequent decay into secondary excitations and their
eventual return to thermal equilibrium. The results obtained so far offer an
excellent opportunity for the utilization of existing methods and facilities.
Experimentation is to be carried out at the author`s picosecond and femtosecond
laser facility which includes dual synchronously pumped and synchronously
amplified dye laser systems.
