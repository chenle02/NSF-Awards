9317605 Stinebring RUI: Pulsar Studies of Refraction in the Interstellar Medium.
Dr. Stinebring's research consists of new and continuing studies of
inhomogeneities in the instellar medium. In particular, he will study the
clumpiness which gives rise to refractive effects such as long term fluctuations
in pulsar intensities, organized patterns in dynamic spectra of pulsars, and
long term variations in integrated electron content along the line of sight.
This award is made under the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate
Institutions program at the NSF. As such it will provide excellent research
opportunities for undergraduates at Oberlin college.
