This award is made in the Office of Special Projects in support of the research
of Professor John Brennan at Rutgers University. The research deals with the
synthesis and characterization of molecules, clusters and solids containing
lanthanide-chalcogen bonds. A variety of new lanthanide chalcogenolate compounds
will be studied in order to determine the nature of bonding between the hard,
ionic lanthanide metal ions and the soft covalent aryl and pyridyl-
chalcogenolate ligands. Lanthanide chalcogenide clusters will be prepared to
address how bonding and physical properties of lanthanide materials depend on
dimensionality. The research will ultimately relate the structural, magnetic and
electronic properties of molecular lanthanide chalcogenolate complexes and
clusters to the properties of the corresponding solids formed by chemical vapor
deposition. Lanthanide-doped materials are becoming increasingly important in
fiber optic and semiconductor applications. They also may find applications in
magnetic materials. This research will develop new synthetic methodology and
help fill the need for new lanthanide containing complexes and cluster dopants
and precursors.
