Garfunkel 9354099 Gateways II is a conference to be held in Boston, MA on
October 1-3, 1993 to bring together the curriculum developers from all of the
NSF-funded elementary, middle, and secondary school comprehensive mathematics
curriculum projects. They share information, experiences and address common
questions which have arisen as materials and curricula have been produced. In
addition, questions of evaluation, teacher enhancement and implementation are
addressed. The interaction of the developers of these projects is to provide
better materials more expeditiously which can be implemented is schools. ***
