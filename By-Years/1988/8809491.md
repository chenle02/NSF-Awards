This proposal addresses the problems of providing a common system facility to
support concurrence and reliable accesses to shared, distributed data. This
common system facility essentially offers the service of distributed transaction
management. The research will explore the feasibility of providing such a common
facility at a fairly low layer of the system, namely, at the virtual memory
level, by designing and implementing a prototype common system facility at that
level.
