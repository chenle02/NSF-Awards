9310625 QUINN This project has two purposes. The first is to develop a
systematic comparative measure of international financial regulation among
developed nations. The second is to understand why nations change laws to
liberalize or restrict their international current accounts. The project is
important because no comparative measure of financial openness is available. The
development of the global financial market is one of the most significant events
of the postwar world economy, and its domestic and international sources are
poorly understood. The project will begin with the coding of the International
Monetary Fund's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange
Restrictions. Each country's laws regarding financial movements will be
evaluated and scored. The resulting measure of financial openness will be
reported descriptively, and then examined in explanatory pooled, cross-section,
times series models. ***
