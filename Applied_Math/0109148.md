Webb 0190148 The investigator studies differential equation models of structured
populations. The structured models arise in considering four applications: (1)
models of tumor cords structured by the cell cycle, (2) models of blood cell
production systems with proliferating and quiescent compartments structured by
cell maturity, (3) models of replicating prion populations structured by polymer
length, and (4) models of vancomycin-resistant enterococci epidemics in dialysis
clinics structured by the time since patient admission. This project applies
theoretical mathematics to biological and medical research involving population
interactions. The specific goals are to identify the behavior of proliferating
and quiescent cell populations in the micro-architecture of vascularized tumors,
to differentiate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the development of normal
and abnormal blood cell population lines, to evaluate hypothetical mechanisms
involved in the polymerization processes of prion population growth in
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow disease), and to predict the
epidemiological effects in dialysis clinics of health care worker hygiene,
patient-health care worker ratios, and screening of temporarily absent patients.
Benefits to society are the project's contributions to the fundamental knowledge
of biological and health sciences.
