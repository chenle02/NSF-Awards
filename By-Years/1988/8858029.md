This investigator's primary research interest is developing tools for building
large scale distributed systems. This leads to work on distributed algorithms
and concurrent programming languages as well as on programming environments.
Currently four research projects are underway. MERCURY is a multiple-user
language.based editor, where users may simultaneously edit the same program,
using the same machine or distributed across a network; current research focuses
on developing algorithms to support version and configuration control. MELD, a
concurrent programming language, combines object-oriented and data flow
programming; current research involves adding transaction processing facilities.
MARVEL is an architecture for knowledged-based engineering environments that
support controlled automation of computerized tools; current work considers
database support for long-lived transactions. INFUSE is a 'city model' software
development environment that enforces cooperation of programmers via
hierarchical integration of changes; current research focuses on support for
integration testing.
