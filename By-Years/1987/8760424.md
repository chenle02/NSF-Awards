The objective of this project is to investigate the technical feasibility of
applying an electrochemical process to the in situ dehalogenation of hazardous
substances in soils contaminated by halogenated organic substances that leak
from hazardous waste containment sites or enter groundwater as a consequence of
accidental spills while substances are in transit. In this project, halogenated
organic substances will be subjected to an electrochemical process that will
cause their dehalogenation. This will be done in the presence solvents which, if
effective, would make it technically possible to remove the dehalogenated
substances from soil contaminated by them. A process to destroy halogenated
hazardous wastes in soils which is reliable, does not permit release of possibly
hazardous wastes, does not use reactive chemicals, and its low cost will have
immediate application by both government and industry to clean-up landfills and
soils contaminated by leaks or spills. The proposal leading to this Phase I
award was submitted and evaluated in accord with NSF 87-8, NSF Program
Solicitation, Small Business Innovation Research.
