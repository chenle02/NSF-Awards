The pioneering works of Bennequin and Eliashberg from the 1980s and the 1990s
have shown that, among all contact structures, the tight ones best reflect the
topology of the ambient space. Only in the past decade have sufficient tools
been developed to allow many of the basic classification questions in the
subject to be attacked. The PI proposes joint work with Honda and Mati\'c to
analyze the contact topology of Haken manifolds using cut-and-paste techniques.
Important outgrowths of this investigation include constructions of tight
contact structures in Haken homology spheres, extensions of the relationship
with foliation theory to laminations and hyperbolic manifolds, and an
understanding of the interplay between the subsurface complex and contact
structures on a product.

Three-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the three-dimensional space we live
in. Contact and symplectic topology were originally motivated by questions of
physicists working in classical mechanics and thermodynamics. They arise in a
surprisingly broad array of applied situations ranging from fluid flows to the
manufacture of projection screen televisions. The proposed research has the
potential to produce new results applicable to these fields.
