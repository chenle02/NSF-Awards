High-density coverage of peridotite samples collected by the PI during U.S. and
Russian cruises between 0 and 15 deg N on the Mid Atlantic Ridge will be
analyzed. This will allow the study of small scale heterogeneities in major
elemental chemistry on olivine, amphibole and plagioclase. The data will provide
information about variations in initial composition, degree of partial melting
and thermal structure of the upper mantle.
