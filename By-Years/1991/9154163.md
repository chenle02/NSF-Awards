The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center (M2C) is conducting a two week (ten
day) project-oriented workshop on the fundamentals of VLSI design and CAD tool
usage. This workshop is directed towards Electrical Engineering faculty with
little experience in VLSI design, Electrical Engineering faculty with expertise
in VLSI but little familiarity with the design tools available in an academic
environment, and Computer Science faculty with minimal acquaintance with
electronic engineering. The goal of the Workshop is to equip the faculty with
the resources necessary to conduct an undergraduate course in VLSI design that
would culminate in the fabrication and subsequent test of student-designed
chips. Topics include an introduction to UNIX, device behavior, design
methodology including design reviews, design styles, and process fundamentals.
Lectures on design methodology and process technology are supplemented by design
and simulation laboratory exercises on CAD workstations. Emphasis is on public-
domain CAD tools in a UNIX environment. The course culminates in the fabrication
of student projects at M2C's integrated circuit fabrication facility. Fabricated
chips will be mailed to participants shortly after the end of the Workshop. In
addition, previously fabricated chips designed to the same project
specifications, some working and some with planned design flaws, are to be
tested during the workshop.
