This project will study job scheduling techniques for distributed memory
parallel processors. More specifically, the project will evaluate the
performance of several strategies for sharing the processors and other resources
of a multicomputer system among multiple, independent applications. The
evaluation will highlight the tradeoffs among the approaches and identify the
conditions under which a strategy outperforms the others. The evaluation will
focus on both analytical methods and experimental evaluation using simulations.
Various applications that are typically executed on multicomputers will be used
as system workload during the evaluation. The results of the project will be
valuable to OS level scheduling on future message passing MIMD systems. ***
