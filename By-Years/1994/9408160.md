9408160 Nyerges This award will provide partial support to a NATO Advanced
Research Workshop to permit the participation of seven U.S. scientists and two
graduate students. The workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Human-Computer
Interaction for Geographic Information Systems is organized by Timothy Nyerges,
University of Washington; Robert Laurini, Universite Claude Bernard in Lyon,
France; and Sr. Maurici Ruiz, Universitat de les Illes in Balears, Spain.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is an enabling information technology that
has been developed for use within research and applied settings. Its
effectiveness depends upon the user interface. Research perspectives from
cognitive science, computer science, informatics, and geography are needed to
investigate cognitive aspects of the human-computer interaction (HCI). This
workshop focuses on HCI research issues, includes experts from the computer
science community, and takes advantage of an international interest in the
topic, all lacking from earlier, related meetings. The workshop is designed to
identify research issues as well as intellectual linkages that will result in
research collaborations. ***
