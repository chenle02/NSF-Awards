ABSTRACT Paul Labinis MIT CTS-9500149 The Chemical Engineering Department at MIT
request support to purchase a scanning probe microscope (SPM) with the
capabilities to perform high resolution imaging of organic materials and
surfaces. The SPM will provide the needed means to interrogate chemical and
biochemical interactions at surfaces and to determine relationships between
chemical processing, surface structure (composition, roughness, etc.), and
surface properties. Its primary application will be to problems involving
various organic surfaces, including molecular and multilayer films and
fluorinated, polyionic and biocampatible polymers.
