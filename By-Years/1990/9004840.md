In may 1989, during NSF-sponsored investigations of the xenolith- bearing
basanites of central Mexico, Luhr, graduate student Greg Pool, and our Mexican
colleague Jorge Aranda-Gomez visited two of the principal localities of lower-
crustal xenoliths in central Mexico. Each vent was investigated in detail with
regard to the spatial abundance of crustal and mantle xenoliths, and attempts
were made to quantify the relative abundances of xenolith types in outcrop based
on hand-sample observations. Aranda-Gomez will continue with this statistical
work in a petrographic study at the Mexican National University using thin
sections from small fragments of 50-60 representative crustal xenoliths. This
project constitutes the A.M. thesis topic of Greg Pool. Funds from this grant
will support him for the fall semester as he completes his thesis. Funds
provided by this grant will provide additional trace element analyses by
instrumental neutron activation. U-Pb geochronological investigations will
concentrate on zircons in several orthogneiss xenoliths from each vent.
