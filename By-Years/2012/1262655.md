The Engineering Research Center for Re-Inventing the Nation's Urban Water
Infrastructure (ReNUWIt) was funded in 2011 to facilitate the transition of
water systems to a new state in which they consume less energy and resources
while continuing to meet the needs of urban users and aquatic ecosystems. This
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will provide an enhanced,
cohesive program to a cohort of undergraduates each summer and will target
highly qualified science and engineering students from diverse backgrounds with
an emphasis on women and minorities. The student-learning outcomes of the
project focus on engaging and creating enthusiasm for science and engineering.
The test-bed facilities provide ample opportunities for hands-on experience in
multidisciplinary research activities at the four geographically and ethnically
diverse institutions. ReNUWIt post-docs and graduate students will gain
mentoring experiences in working closely with REU participants. Research
communication skills of REU participants will improve through report writing,
poster preparation, roundtables, and seminar presentations. This REU Site is
supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.
