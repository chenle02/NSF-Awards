The Tufts University Noyce capacity building project aims to bolster Tufts'
newly instituted Master of Arts in Teaching Engineering program that prepares
engineers as grades 5-12 engineering teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
team composed of faculty from Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, and
Education recognizes the need for a multi-faceted approach:&lt;br/&gt;1. Attract
and recruit engineering undergraduates and practicing professionals to become
engineering teachers, &lt;br/&gt;2. Build partnerships with local schools and
engineering teachers to serve as M.A.T. in Engineering candidates cooperating
teachers, and &lt;br/&gt;3. Effectively prepare M.A.T. in Engineering candidates
through innovative coursework, engineering faculty advisors, and other
programmatic supports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach includes new course
development where engineering faculty work with education faculty to incorporate
education themes and ideas in graduate level engineering content courses and
year-round programming with all stakeholders (undergraduate engineering
students, M.A.T. candidates and graduates, cooperating in-service teachers, and
engineering and education faculty). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit
of the project rests upon the pioneering endeavor of preparing engineers and
K-12 engineering teachers. Integrating engineering into the K-12 classroom has
become a popular notion and the Prepare Engineers to Educate Now project looks
to address one of the major hurdles in making this happen more broadly creating
highly qualified engineering teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts
rest on the communities served by Tufts and its graduates, but the goal is to
inform other institutions through the evaluation of the project includes
measuring the effectiveness of recruiting strategies, partnership strategies,
and courses in developing teachers' knowledge and practices.
