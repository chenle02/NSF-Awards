This research program will study the behavior of slow viscows flows through
hollow boundaries and stenobic pipes. Although the equations in these problems
are linear, significant difficulties occur due to edge singularities and mixed
boundary conditions. In addition to analytical work, the research will also
consider the numerical solution of these flow problems in infinite domains.
Finite difference schemes have proved impractical for infinite domains because
of the slow algebraic decay of the force singularity. This work should lead to a
unified approach to a class of problems involving incomplete boundaries. The
results will have practical implications in situations, such as polymer
extrusion processes, which involve low Reynolds number flows past dicontinuous
boundaries.
