This project's main objective is to make accurate photoabsorption cross sections
of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the wavelength region 80-105 nm. This region
absorbs solar radiation between 100 and 240 km, and is the primary source of
physical processes such as excitation, dissociation, and ionization. To
completely understand basic principles of atmospheric processes, the PI will
study how the solar flux is absorbed by thermospheric molecules. He will
accurately determine photoabsorption cross sections in the laboratory under
conditions representative of the atmospheric region where the absorption occurs.
