The principal investigator is working on problems in probability theory
concerning the law of the iterated logarithms (LIL) and strong approximations.
In particular, the investigator will work on convergence rates in the LIL in
Hilbert spaces, infinite dimensional versions of the Darling-Erdos theorem and
Chung type LIL's, and strong approximations for sums of independent Banach space
value random variables. Properties of sums of independent random variables have
been of interest to probabilists and statisticians for a long time. The law of
the iterated logarithm gives a very precise bound on how fast a sum of random
variables grows.
