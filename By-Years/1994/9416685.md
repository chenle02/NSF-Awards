9416685 Lyle The PI will compile ODP/DSDP data into a more detailed and reliable
estimate of pelagic carbonate burial through the Neogene than is now available.
So far the estimates are only approximations and severely limit our ability to
understand the processes that initiated the late Cenozoic glaciations and to
estimate atmospheric CO2 variations. The work will lead to better estimates of
global pelagic carbonate mass accumulation rates and changes in global
weathering cycles and their impact on atmospheric CO2 composition. The carbonate
sedimentary pattern maps will also help paleoceanographic interpretations. ***
