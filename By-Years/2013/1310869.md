This action funds Michael Schulz of the University of Florida to conduct a
research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of
2013 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The project title is "Understanding
the Connection between Binding and Molecular Architecture in Polymer-Metal
Mixtures." The host scientist is Yoshiki Chujo.

Polyethyleneimine-methylphosphonate (PEI-MP) is an anionic polymer--a negatively
charged large molecule--that has been studied as a polymeric ligand to bind to
certain metals, specifically radioactivce atoms, or radionuclides. However, the
binding of PEI-MP to radionuclides is not understood at a fundamental level.
This project is studying various potential binding configurations of the polymer
system with a simplified, small molecule system. Isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) is being used to measure the thermodynamic parameters of each
binding mode. This information provides insight into which molecular
configurations form the most stable coordinate complexes, i.e., which are the
most effective at binding to different metals. Understanding the binding of PEI-
MP at a fundamental level will allow the rational design and improvement of
future polymeric radionuclide carriers.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow has demonstrated a commitment to
undergraduate education, involving undergraduate students in the scientific
preparation required prior to the start of the EAPSI fellowship. He will include
undergraduates in new research and collaborations that result from interactions
with the host scientist as well.
