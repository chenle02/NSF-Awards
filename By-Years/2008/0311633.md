The goal of this ongoing research is to find the structure of the theory of
information flow in&lt;br/&gt;networks. While several single-user channels, and
a few multi-user channels, are completely&lt;br/&gt;understood, the rate region
of the general multi-user memoryless network p(y1 ym x1 xm )&lt;br/&gt;remains
unknown. Certain key channels and new formulations are serving to advance
the&lt;br/&gt;theory. This work focuses on relay networks (where passive nodes
are recruited as relays),&lt;br/&gt;ad hoc networks (with interference and
Gaussian noise), erasure networks (in which the&lt;br/&gt;nodes and symbols are
erased at random), and amplification networks (in which the state&lt;br/&gt;of
the channel becomes the intended information). Quantum communication networks
allow&lt;br/&gt;physical processing not conceived by classical probability
theory. In particular, this work is&lt;br/&gt;investigating how quantum
entanglement may be used to facilitate cooperative
communica-&lt;br/&gt;tion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general attack on classical
networks is based on developing ideas for inducing cooperation&lt;br/&gt;in an
attempt to provide principles for practical low complexity
implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
