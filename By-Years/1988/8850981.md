The project; University/Industry Program for Teachers of Physics, is designed
to modernize and deepen the science background of 30 high school physics
teachers while providing them with teaching materials representative of topics
of current scientific and technical interest. The physics teaching modules which
form the basis of the project were developed by teams of physics teachers
working with Rutgers University faculty and industrial scientists from AT&amp;T
Bell Laboratories and Bell Communications Research. The Leadership Institute for
Teachers of Physics is the central activity of the project. The thirty physics
teachers, selected nationwide, will attend a four-week residential program
during July 1989. The summer program includes laboratory work on the modules
with the assistance of Lead Teachers and university faculty, a seminar series
developed by university and industrial scientists, discussion of effective
teaching strategies, and tours of leading research facilities. In addition,
selected Lead Teachers will continue to work with scientists on module
development throughout the year. This will involve the revision and testing of
previously developed modules and the creation of new ones. To facilitate the use
of the modules both in the classroom and at professional science education
workshops, follow-up meetings will be held during the school year for regional
teachers. All 1989 Institute participants will be invited back for a one-week
follow-up program in the summer of 1990. Participants will also be encouraged to
communicate using PIMAIL, an interactive computer network sponsored by the
American Institute of Physics.
