1143619/Severinghaus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a project to
extend the study of gases in ice cores to those gases whose small molecular
diameters cause them to escape rapidly from ice samples (the so-called "fugitive
gases"). The work will employ helium, neon, argon, and oxygen measurements in
the WAIS Divide ice core to better understand the mechanism of the gas close-off
fractionation that occurs while air bubbles are incorporated into ice. The
intellectual merit of the proposed work is that corrections for this
fractionation using neon (which is constant in the atmosphere) may ultimately
enable the first ice core-based atmospheric oxygen and helium records. Neon may
also illuminate the mechanistic link between local insolation and oxygen used
for astronomical dating of ice cores. Helium measure-ments in the deepest ~100 m
of the core will also shed light on the stratigraphic integrity of the basal
ice, and serve as a probe of solid earth-ice interaction at the base of the West
Antarctic ice sheet. Past atmospheric oxygen records, currently unavailable
prior to 1989 CE, would reveal changes in the size of the terrestrial biosphere
carbon pool that accompany climate variations and place constraints on the
biogeochemical feedback response to future warming. An atmospheric
helium-3/helium-4 record would test the hypothesis that the solar wind (which is
highly enriched in helium-3) condensed directly into Earth?s atmosphere during
the collapse of the geomagnetic field that occurred 41,000 years ago, known as
the Laschamp Event. Fugitive-gas samples will be taken on-site immediately after
recovery of the ice core by the PI and one postdoctoral scholar, under the
umbrella of an existing project to support replicate coring and borehole
deepening. This work will add value to the scientific return from field work
activity with little additional cost to logistical resources. The broader
impacts of the work on atmospheric oxygen are that it may increase understanding
of how terrestrial carbon pools and atmospheric greenhouse gas sources will
respond in a feedback sense to the coming warming. Long-term atmospheric oxygen
trends are also of interest for understanding biogeochemical regulatory
mechanisms and the impact of atmospheric evolution on life. Helium records have
value in understanding the budget of this non-renewable gas and its implications
for space weather and solar activity. The project will train one graduate
student and one postdoctoral scholar. The fascination of linking solid earth,
cryosphere, atmosphere, and space weather will help to entrain and excite young
scientists and efforts to understand the Earth as a whole interlinked system
will provide fuel to outreach efforts at all ages.
