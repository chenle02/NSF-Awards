The Loyola University of Chicago will initiate a six-week, commuter,
multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will offer science enrichment
activities for 18 precollege students entering grades 11 and 12. This program
will emphasize research participation in computer science, mathematics and
physics. The interdisciplinary activities begin with participant introduction to
basic computer architecture, after which they assemble IBM-compatible
microcomputers. Each week the students engage in labs in digital electronics,
engineering and computer architecture under the direction of a research
physicist. Career-oriented field trips to A.T.&amp; T. Laboratories, Motorola,
Rockwell International and General Motors are included. Participants retain the
computers for use during the eight-month follow-up which consists of three
Saturday morning classes each month.
