0922784&lt;br/&gt;Loeb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed MRI instrument will
provide a highly flexible testbed for diverse research activities in the general
field of robotic and prosthetic haptic. Robots have had a huge economic impact
on certain types of industrial productivity in repetitive and/or hazardous
environments but they are currently unable to handle common objects or tools.
Providing robotic manipulation with haptic capabilities similar to humans would
greatly extend the range of applications and environments in which they could be
used. &lt;br/&gt;There are three major aspects of the development project: i)
Design and production of TAC modules; ii) Procurement of and interface with
commercial mechatronic hand plus arm; iii) Development of software modules for
compliant exploratory behaviors, processing of sensory data and extraction of
information about external objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
instrument represents a fusion of recent advances in biomimetic principles of
sensory transduction, haptic exploration and compliant control.&lt;br/&gt;
