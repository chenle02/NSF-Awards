This award continues support for a cooperative program of round- the-clock
joint observations of solar magnetic fields by the Big Bear Solar Observatory
and the Huairou Solar Observing Station of Beijing Observatory. The observations
will target the long-term evolution of solar magnetic fields. Particular
problems to be addressed will be the polar rotation rate, the evolution of polar
field elements, the evolution of active regions, the field changes associated
with solar flares, and the flow of magnetic field elements across filament
boundaries. This work must be done with China because Huairou has the only other
videomagnetograph that operates regularly. The joint observing capability of the
two observatories provides a powerful resource. No other solar observatories
maintain regular or semi- continuous observations of magnetic fields. Magnetic
fields are important to understanding the functioning of the sun and its effect
on Earth.
