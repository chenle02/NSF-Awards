This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Howard University
provides six undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate
in research on topics in various fields of physics and materials research. In
addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU
students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research
stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly
experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a
poster, made an oral presentation of the research, and written a final report.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the nation's first Historically Black University,
Howard University is known for offering opportunities for women and under-
represented minorities to excel in research careers. Ten faculty mentors will
mentor students in projects related to computational and experimental
nanophysics, condensed matter physics, materials physics, optics, and laser
spectroscopy. Through mentoring and exposure to exciting research tools and
methods, students will acquire skills in specific methodology while developing a
keen awareness of the applications of physics to a broad range of science
careers. This award is funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of
Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and
the HBCU-UP program in the Education and Human Resources
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
