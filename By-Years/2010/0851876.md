This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds research in the
economic theory of auctions for divisible goods. There are many examples of
divisible goods; for example, economists classify oil as a 'divisible' good
because it can be sold in different quantities. Oil is sold by the quart, by the
gallon, by the liter, by the barrel, and by the tankerload. Contrast this to
'indivisible' goods such as automobiles. No one will buy half of an automobile,
so autos are sold one at a time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many divisible goods are
sold through auctions; a leading example is U.S. Treasury Bills. Recent research
has led to many new results about the likely properties of different kinds of
auctions of indivisible goods. However, we know much less about how to auction
divisible goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs build and analyze a new model that
allws them to compare three different kinds of auction procedures that are
widely used in practice. They determine how these auctions work for both
divisible and indivisible goods. They consider which kind of auction is superior
in terms of total auction revenue and in terms of the efficiency of the final
outcome. Finally, they determine conditions under which multiple related goods
should be auctioned jointly rather than conducting separate individual
auctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research could have substantial broader
impact; the societal benefit to better auction mechanisms is large.
