ABSTRACT

The main goal of the proposal is to develop new analytic methods to deal with
the fundamental issue of global regularity for Nonlinear Wave Equations such as
Wave Maps, Yang-Mills and the Einstein Vacuum Equations. We propose two specific
problems to investigate. The first concerns the critical global well-posedness
for Wave Maps and the second is to establish local well posedness in $H^2$ for
the Einstein Vacuum equations.

Nonlinear Wave equations are at the heart of some of our basic physical theory
such as General Relativity, Electrodynamics, Elasticity etc. Despite a lot of
progress made throughout last century our knowledge of nonlinear waves remains
rudimentary. The proposal outlines some directions in which we expect to make
considerable progress. The main one concerns the Einstein field equations. It is
well known that these equations can develop black holes and singularities. This
fact makes it imperative to develop a theory for rough solutions for these
equations. The Wave Maps equations can be viewed as a simplified model problem
for the Einstein equations. We hope that a better understanding of rough
solutions of these equations will help us make progress in connection to the
former equations also.
