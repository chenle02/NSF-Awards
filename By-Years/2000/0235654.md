RNA interference (RNAi) is the recently-discovered process by which double-
stranded RNA silences gene activity. The mechanism by which this occurs is only
partially understood, and is of great interest, since RNAi-related phenomena are
essential for normal development, because RNAi is now an invaluable tool to
biologists studying gene function in diverse organisms, and because of the long-
term potential for using RNAi as a therapeutic agent in humans. This project
focuses on a new gene required for RNA interference. The sequence of this gene
suggests specific, testable hypotheses for how this gene might function in RNAi.
The primary goal of this project is to determine how this gene functions. It is
expected that this work will make essential contributions to understanding this
important pathway. This research project will include training undergraduate
students in scientific research, and each undergraduate student will attend an
annual conference to present their findings. The principal investigator is a
faculty mentor in UNC Chapel Hill's Research Education Support Program, which
supports students from under-represented minority groups to gain research
experiences and to enroll in Ph.D. programs.
