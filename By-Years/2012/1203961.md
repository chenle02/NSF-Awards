This project will continue earlier studies by the principal investigator on the
existence and compactness of solutions to a fully nonlinear version of the
Yamabe problem. Such equations have been studied extensively. The project will
have a special focus on compactness issues related to the aforementioned
problem. The clarification of these issues is needed for further progress to be
made on it. The research should lead to a better understanding of nonlinear
elliptic, but not necessarily uniformly elliptic, partial differential
equations, as well as of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations. The principal
investigator will also study elliptic systems that arise in the modeling of
composite materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial differential equations arise
naturally in physics, engineering, geometry, and many other fields, and they
form the basis for modeling many phenomena in the physical world. The particular
class of "fully nonlinear elliptic" equations is especially important from this
perspective. For instance, such equations turn up in the study of composite
materials. This project will contribute to a basic understanding of fully
nonlinear elliptic equations, thereby providing scientists and engineers with
sharpened insight into various physical processes and ultimately enhancing the
quality of, say, consumer products manufactured from composites. As part of the
project, the principal investigator will train Ph.D. students, many of whom are
expected to continue their careers as educators. They, in turn, will convey to
even younger generations both their mathematical knowledge and the long-term
value of mathematical research not only to science and engineering but also, in
the end, to society.
