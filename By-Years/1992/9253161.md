The goal of this research is to develop the methodology for using model-tracing
tutors to deliver useable classroom instruction. The context of this effort will
be to develop an Algebra I tutor that will be used in the Pittsburgh Public
Schools. As the consequence of past NSF support we have developed a software
system for building such tutors, had extensive experience with building tutors
for algebra, and have an established research laboratory in the schools. This
grant will explore how this can be used to deliver a Algebra I tutor that will
be used in the schools. We will try to adapt the expert system development
methodology for tutor development. Our experts will be a master teacher in the
school system and the mathematics faculty in a local high school. We will work
with them on codifying the curriculum (consistent with the standards of the
NCTM) that they want to to teach and on making the classroom adjustments to
profitably employ the tutor. This project will serve as a general test of our
tutoring methodology and serve as a model for adapting it for other school
systems and for other topics.
