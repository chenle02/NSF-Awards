9218951 Leventer This award supports a study of the relationship between diatom
assemblages in surface sediments (from existing samples) along a latitudinal
transect and current oceanographic and environmental conditions along the
transect. This work will determine the viability of using diatom assemblages as
proxy records of climate since the last glacial maximum. The work will use
quantitative methods to describe diatom assemblages and will include a test of
the model developed by studying diatoms in two sediment cores, one from
Bransfield Strait (open water) and the other from a fjord in Gerlache Strait, in
which there are already some paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental indicators to
use as a baseline. This study is essential to the development of viable models
relating records of biological activity, and in particular diatom producing
algae, to climatic and environmental conditions. ***
