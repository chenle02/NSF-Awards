This renewal award by the Chemistry Division supports the Research Experiences
for Undergraduates (REU) site at Georgetown University for the summers of
2009-2011. The program co-directors are Sarah Stoll and Jennifer Swift. Each
year eight students recruited from across the country, but with a focus on the
Mid-Atlantic region, will have an opportunity to work on well-defined research
projects in all the major areas of chemistry. The program will target first
generation college students, with special consideration for those who may not
already have participated in research. The interests and experience of the
student participants will be matched with the individual research groups in the
department. Participants will have access to all of the modern equipment
available and will acquire skills in designing and conducting experimental work
and analyzing scientific data. They will also participate in a series of weekly
career development workshops covering oral and written communication skills,
ethics, resume writing and science careers, and the graduate school selection
and application processes. Social events afford the opportunity for enhanced
student-student and student-faculty exchange while local field trips will
provide exposure to scientists at non-academic settings. The program concludes
with a poster session in which the REU participants and all other summer
undergraduate researchers in the department present their results.
