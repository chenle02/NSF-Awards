This planning proposal requests funds for the planning phase of the Pan-American
Institute of Science and Technology (PAIST). The PAIST seeks to create effective
pathways to graduate studies for young Latinos in the U.S. through the
participation of Latin-American scientists in research collaborations and
outreach activities. The Pan-American Institute of Science and Technology
(PAIST) will set up and coordinate research in science and technology between
faculty members, young scientists and students at the University of Houston, the
University of Houston-Downtown and other participating institutions and their
counterparts in Latin America. The PAIST will create a unique continuum of
opportunities ? pathways ? for young Latinos to be successful through their
Ph.D. studies.&lt;br/&gt;This grant will be used for travel, mini-workshops and
related expenses. The NSF seed money contribution will have an important
leveraging effect at the University of Houston and in the local
community.&lt;br/&gt;
