9411812 Srienc This equipment is to be used for several research projects,
including: (1) quantitation of protein secretion in single Saccharomyces
cerevisiae cells; and (2) quantitation of protein in single mammalian cells such
as hybridomas. This equipment will provide a unique way for experimental
verification of data suggested from population models. It will also provide a
means of isolating cells with increased ability to secrete different
metabolites. ***
