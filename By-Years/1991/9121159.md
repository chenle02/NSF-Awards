This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Joris Gieskes,
the University of California at San Diego and Professor Typhoon Lee, Academia
Sinica, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program. This project plans to study the geochemistry of fluids and solids of
mud volcanos. Mud volcanos are thought to originate deep inside tectonic plate
wedges and can provide important indication to the formation of accretionary
prisms. Dr. Gieskes is a leading scientist in geochemical research. Taiwan is an
ideal place for this study since it is situated at the area where the
Philippines Plate collides with the Asian Continent. The mud volcanos are
uniquely suited for this study. This project can provide important information
to the U.S. researchers for understanding a geochemical cycle in active
hydrothermal areas currently characterized by limited existing data.
