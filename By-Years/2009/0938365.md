This project is a conference on the "Foundations and Frontiers of Physics
Education Research," in which established and up-and-coming researchers attend a
residential conference to further the work of the field. There are 60
participants, including senior graduate students, research scientists, junior,
and tenured faculty. The conference consists of a series of plenary talks by
leaders in the community; working groups of participants to address common
problems in the field and present recommendations for future work; and targeted
sessions in which research topics are explored in detail by participants. Ample
free time is also included, allowing for informal discussions and interactions
that can lead to future collaborations.

Intellectual Merit: By bringing together the leaders of the physics education
research community in an intimate setting, the conference promotes more intense
discussions and more focused interactions than are possible at other meetings
common to the community.

Broader Impact: Establishing a more cohesive research community furthers the
field of physics education research. Promoting the highest quality postdoctoral
researchers and junior faculty strengthens their reputation in the community,
supporting the growth of new leaders. Sharing results through plenary and
targeted sessions spreads knowledge that advances the field. Finally, working
groups answer questions of structural concern to the physics education research
community. The results of the working groups are to be published in an American
Physical Society Forum on Education newsletter, allowing them to be shared with
a much larger audience than attends the meeting.
