The Gender and Diversities Institute at Education Development Center, Inc. is
developing and maintaining a science, technology, engineering and mathematics
(STEM) career development digital library - CaREN, l. or the Career Resources
Education Network for STEM- targeted toward engaging middle and early high
school students. The resources and, the user services and interface place
particular emphasis on the needs and interests of currently underrepresented
populations in STEM education and careers, including females, students of color,
and youth with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is achieving its
goals to: create and sustain an easily accessible, comprehensive career
development resource that is inviting and engaging of diverse populations of
middle and early high school students, and that builds on
their&lt;br/&gt;diverse points of entry and interest, and draws them into an
easily navigable range of career exploration options and resources in the STEM
field. &lt;br/&gt;Among the project's activities are: 1) the design and
development of the CaREN digital library based on development of the Gender and
Science Digital Library; 2) the use of current research on effectively accessing
and using digital resources; and, 3) utilization of national surveys and focus
groups in determining how different populations of middle school students
perceive their career development needs, ways that a digital library could help
them, and the key components of an engaging design. &lt;br/&gt;CaREN's focus on
underrepresented populations is serving to expose more students to STEM career
options, thereby increasing their flow into the study of STEM subjects at the
high school and college levels.
