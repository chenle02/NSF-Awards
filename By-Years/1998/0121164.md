AST 0121164&lt;br/&gt;Lonsdale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this
project are to produce a computer-model which will serve as a data simulator for
a new type of radio telescope (a 400-km, low frequency, radio telescope that
will work in the 10-240 MHz wavelength range). The output of this computer model
will be used to study a variety of different instrument designs as well as
develop techniques for the post-processing data analysis. The latter will
include the development of a network architecture and protocol to support the
data rates, support for dynamic range and fidelity levels that are beyond the
present state-of-the-art, and the calibration of the ionospheric propagation
delays and instrumental characteristics that require new techniques and
algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is part of the US participation in
an international collaboration (designated LOFAR for Low Frequency Array) which
is projected for operation in 2006. An additional $9-10 million is being
invested in the design by Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy
(NFRA, [ASTRON in Dutch]) and the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The
National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey of Astronomy (2001) recommended the
project for NSF support. This effort is a major new astronomy initiative. NSF
participation will guarantee wide access to the instrument by the US
astronomical community, although the primary funding will come from NRL and
ASTRON.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
