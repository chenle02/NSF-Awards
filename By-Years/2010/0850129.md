This S-STEM scholars program awards scholarships to students seeking associates
degrees in areas related to information technology, nanoscience technology and
civil engineering technology. The project establishes the Advancing Student
Success in Engineering, Technology and Science (ASSETS) program at Dakota County
Technical College and builds on the success of prior NSF funded projects. The
program targets academically talented, first generation students from
underrepresented groups with a special emphasis on the increasing African and
Latin American immigrant population in the local community. Students selected to
be ASSETS Scholars are eligible for comprehensive support services including
faculty mentoring, tutoring and financial and career planning. Upon completion
of their associates degrees, students receive extensive job placement assistance
or may continue their education at a four-year institution through several
articulation agreements. Approximately 60 scholarships will be provided during
the life of this project.
