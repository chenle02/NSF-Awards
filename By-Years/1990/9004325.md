A series of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) experiments is proposed, to
measure the local structure about substituted atoms in high-Tc superconductors.
Such experiments should furnish significant help in understanding the unique
role that copper plays in these materials. In addition, they propose preliminary
experiments on single crystal or oriented films and substituted- materials using
the high polarization of synchrotron radiation to enhance the amplitude of the
XAFS signal for particular bond directions.
