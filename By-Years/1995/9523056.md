This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
continued support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of the Chemistry
Department, University of Michigan, on the reactivity of model complexes for
dehydrosulfurization (HDS) catalysts. The specific objectives of the project are
to determine (1) how the composition, physical and electronic structure, and
redox properties of molybdenum or tungsten sulfide clusters correlate with their
reactivity toward organic sulfur compounds; (2) the mechanisms of the
desulfurization reactions mediated by the metal cluster complexes; and (3) how
the mechanisms of desulfurizations on discrete clusters are related to the
mechanisms of desulfurization over the heterogeneous HDS catalysts used in the
petroleum industry for fuel upgrading. The experimental approaches to these
objectives include the synthesis of new sulfide bimetallic clusters, kinetic and
structural studies of their reactions with organic sulfur compounds,
electrochemical studies, and comparative studies with actual heterogeneous
catalysts. Of particular interest are those HDS reactions catalyzed by
molybdenum sulfide catalysts `promoted` with iron, cobalt, or nickel and the
role played by the promoter metal in increasing the activity of the catalyst.
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is a commercial process used to remove sulfur from
organic materials and is therefore important in manufacturing and to enhancing
air quality in industrial areas. In this project, compounds which are models of
the industrial catalyst will be prepared and their reactivity investigated.
Knowledge of the mechanistic role of the promoter in desulfurization catalysts
can be applied to the design of `second generation` hydrotreating catalysts that
possess higher activities and selectivities than those currently in use.
