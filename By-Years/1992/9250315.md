Technology that can be used for wireless information networks is currently
undergoing rapid development. Among the many applications include indoor
wireless local area networks (LAN) to provide for the portability and mobility
of computer terminals and workstations, digital cellular mobile radio telephone
networks to increase channel capacity over current narrowband analog FM cellular
systems, and personal communication networks (PCN) where individual users
operate pocket sized transceivers capable of making telephone calls using a
fully mobile service whether they are at home, in the office, or on the
street.This award will assist in funding a new senior level electrical
engineering laboratory supporting studies of wireless information systems.
Topics to be addressed include pseudo-noise codes, direct sequence spread
spectrum, frequency hopped signals, acquisition and tracking, CDMA wireless
computer communications, UHF channel propagation characteristics including
multipath time delay profiles and attenuation measurements, bit error rate
measurements, and phase-locked loops. In addition to formal weekly lab
experiments, all students will be required to do a design project relating to
wireless information networks, make oral presentations, and submit written
reports.
