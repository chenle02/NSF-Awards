This project focuses on high quality teaching of foundational skills in the
areas of reading and mathematics in grades 4 and 5. This is an observational
study and through a longitudinal study will develop and test multilevel models
of how schools and teachers affect student achievement in reading and
mathematics. A primary goal of the study is to understand how schools and
teachers scale up and sustain effective pedagogy over time for multiple student
populations. 20 schools in Montgomery County, Maryland will be studied - 10 from
high poverty areas and 10 from moderate poverty areas. Data will be collected
using standardized data collection instruments through 8 classroom
observations/year over a period of three years in a total of 120 classrooms. The
data will track changes in school policy/practices, teacher pedagogy, and
student learning. The final year of the project will be devoted to data analysis
and dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
