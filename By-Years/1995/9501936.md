9501936 Zhang This award supports cooperative research between researchers at
the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, New York, and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics on laser- semiconductor interaction.
Both institutes have fully equipped and operational laboratories specializing in
ultrafast optoelectronics. Experiments will be performed to contribute to
applications associated with the generation and detection of ultrahigh power
electromagnetic radiation. Up to four students from RPI will join the principal
investigator in China to conduct the experiments. This research effort augments
research funded under NSF award ECS 9211566.
