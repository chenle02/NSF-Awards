The goal of this project is to develop and experimentally verify a skill-based
approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic systems. The work focuses
particularly on control of robot manipulators using weakly calibrated or
uncalibrated stereo vision. The major innovations are: 1) the use of
reconfigurable, feature-based tracking mechanisms that simplify image
processing; 2) the use of projective invariant-based feedback controllers that
perform correctly despite calibration error; and 3) the development of a
taxonomy of geometric ``translation rules'' for converting the geometric
specification of a task into a visual specification of a task. The research is
driven by a series of benchmark problems chosen from the manipulation domain. In
addition to software development and experimentation, theoretical methods for
analyzing the stability of visual tracking and of hand-eye servoing systems will
be developed. Methods for detecting and responding to execution errors will be
investigated. The long-term goal of this work is to construct a system that can
automatically synthesize and execute a vision-based task specification from a
geometric task specification.
