Work will focus on recent developments in the theory of quasiconformal groups,
the universal Teichmuller space and domains arising in approximation theory
termed John domains. Some classical questions regarding quasiconformal mappings
will also be reexamined in light of new results obtained by several researchers.
Among these are questions about the approximation of quasiconformal maps in
higher dimensions by differentiable maps of the same dilatation. Efforts to
characterize the quasiconformal groups (discrete ones, first) have energized
several top investigators including the principal investigator. The fundamental
question is to determine when a group is effectively a Mobius group. Since this
is not always the case, the problem of filling in the middle should generate
some exciting research. Other work oriented more toward functional-analytical
structures in complex analysis will focus on the study of cyclic vectors in
spaces of analytic functions. These are elements of the spaces whose powers span
the space. General conditions for cyclicity are only known for special spaces.
However, for Bloch spaces only partial results are available and work will
continue to complete the picture here. In addition, investigations will be
carried out on injectivity criteria for local homeomorphisms, quasisymmetric
groups and Markov processes. Analysis in the field of several complex variables
will focus on outer functions in the polydisk and ball in two complex variables,
especially when the zero set is small. An old problem of B. Levin on integrable
functions on the quarter plane will be pursued. This work relates to a number of
important areas of mathematics including three-manifold theory, partial
differential operators and Toeplitz transformation spaces of analytic functions.
It is also used in engineering applications involving systems theory.
