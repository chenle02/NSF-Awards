One of the major as yet unanswered questions with respect to synthesis and
function of protein complexes in biological membranes is how these complexes
assemble into functionally active entities. To address this question with
respect to photosystem II (PS II), the convenient transformation system of the
cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is being utilized to create a number
of PS II mutants containing site-directed mutations. Such mutants offer an
excellent experimental system to determine the role cofactors (particularly
quinones and chlorophylls) play in PS II assembly and stability. It is known
from other systems that the presence of chlorophyll is a requirement for
stability of chlorophyll-binding proteins, whereas in higher plants synthesis of
one of the chlorophyll- binding in PS II appears to depend on the availability
of chlorophyll. For this reason, mutations in presumed chlorophyll- binding
residues are now introduced to investigate the effects on the synthesis and
stability of the chlorophyll-binding proteins as well as of the entire PS II
complex. With the Presidential Young Investigator Award, the study of the
synthesis and function of photosystem II (PS II) of the photosynthetic apparatus
is being significantly enhanced, thus contributing to a comprehensive insight
into its involvement in photosynthesis.
