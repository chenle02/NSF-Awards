MONCZKA The objectives of the research are to develop an explanatory model of
the successful integration of suppliers into the new product development process
through identification of both successful and unsuccessful strategies and
practices, and factors that explain them. The results of the research will
include implementation guidelines for other firms to follow, and case studies
and models of supplier integration into new product development for use by
industry and academia. The research will be based on a literature, review, field
research, and surveys. Field research will be conducted in ten or more firms
(Allied Signal, AT&amp;T global procurement, Black &amp; Decker, Chrysler Corp.,
Deere &amp; Co., Hewlett-Packard, Kodak, Unisys, Whirlpool, and participants in
the Arizona State University Center for Advanced Purchasing) currently
integrating suppliers into the new product development process. The survey
research will collect data from (2000 plus) members of the Global Procurement
&amp; Supply Chain Electronic Benchmarking Network. The plan also includes
periodic meetings of interdisciplinary industry and academic review teams to
advise on research design, interpretation and dissemination of results.
