Educating the next generation of engineers and technicians specialized in
renewable energy is of critical importance to our nation's energy security. This
project aims to enhance student education in renewable energy and power
engineering by: 1) developing and using sun tracking solar power systems as an
enabling tool to create innovative teaching materials including demonstrations,
hands-on experiments, and course modules; 2) integrating state-of-the-art
applications of sustainable energy such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and
smart grid into the engineering technology program; and 3) engaging college
students in the mentoring of middle and high school students on renewable energy
technologies. Curricular enhancements focus on authentic problem solving to
engage students in problem-based learning. The progressive approach used in
building content knowledge throughout the curriculum prepares graduates with
strong backgrounds and the research skills needed to advance the field of
renewable energy. The project will reach to community colleges and secondary
schools to build a renewable energy education pipeline. The project will provide
a model for student recruitment and retention in renewable energy technology.
The results of the project will be disseminated in refereed journal publications
and conference presentations. The project will contribute to the development of
a highly-skilled renewable energy workforce for this nation.
