This award provides funding to support student and postdoc travel to participate
in the 2008 Multiphoton Processes Gordon Conference. The conference is being
held during the week of June 8-14, 2008, and will involve a broad program that
touches upon a number of research activities of interest to investigators and
students supported through NSF?s AMO program. Some of these include advances in
ultrafast laser spectroscopy, attosecond physics and attosecond pulse
generation, coherent control of molecular dynamics, and electron dynamics in
atoms and molecules exposed to intense laser fields. Students will participate
through presentation of posters and through formal and informal interactions
with leading scientists in the various fields. Support is provided by both the
theoretical and experimental AMO programs&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
