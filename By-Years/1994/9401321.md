9401321 Kolyvagin This award funds the research of Prof. Victor Kolyvagin. Prof.
Kolyvagin works on the theory of Euler systems and their application to number
theory. For a given Euler system, he plans to extend the set of cohomology
classes explicitly controlled locally, and connect them to the arithmetic of
number fields and elliptic curves. This research falls under the general heading
of number theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole
numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in
number theory have furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in
almost all parts of the discipline. Prof. Kolyvagin is a leader in the use of
geometric ideas to study whole numbers. This kind of number theory is very
technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like
theoretical computer science and coding theory.
