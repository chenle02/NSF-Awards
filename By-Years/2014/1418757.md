The proposal is to enable students from educational institutions in the United
States to attend the CPSWeek 2014 collection of conferences, which are to be
held April 14-17, 2014, in Berlin, Germany. CPSWeek is an annual international
multi-conference for Cyber-Physical Systems, comprising five major multi-day
conferences, five one-day workshops, and four one-day tutorials. It moves from
country to country each year. Attending the conference will provide students
with a unique opportunity to listen and learn from the keynote speeches,
presentations, posters and demos on cutting edge topics on cyber-physical
systems, and to network with both leaders and other young researchers in this
area.

CPS research is expected to have positive societal impacts in many areas,
including transportation, energy, agriculture, water/sewage treatment,
environmental management and manufacturing systems. These systems must operate
safely, dependably, securely, efficiently and respond to events in real time. A
key feature of CPS research is the requirement to cooperate across disciplines
such as computer science, computer architecture and hardware, material science
and sensor design, software engineering, networking, and control engineering. In
this inherently interdisciplinary field, where collaborations are essential,
meeting other researchers is especially important. This event is especially
valuable in this regard, because of the international exposure. There is a very
high level of activity and investment in CPS research outside the US including
Europe and Asia. For these reasons, strong participation in this event,
especially among students (our next generation of researchers) is important to
maintaining and advancing CPS research in the US.
