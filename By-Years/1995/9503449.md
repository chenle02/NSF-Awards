9503449 Masur This proposal concerns the geometry of Teichmuller space and the
mapping class group. The proposer will use methods from complex geometry,
probability, and dynamical systems to study Teichmuller metrics. In particular,
the proposer wishes to consider random walks on Teichmuller space to study
rigidity problems about the mapping class group. Teichmuller space represents
the totality of pretzel-like surfaces with a fixed topological type; these
surfaces, so called Riemann surfaces of a fixed genus, are crucial in the study
of complex-valued functions as they generalize the complex number field. And the
proposed research seeks to understand Teichmuller space from a geometric and
metric point of view.
