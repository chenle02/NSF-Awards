Fundamental geometric problems in computational geometry and those that arise in
VLSI computer-aided design will be investigated in this project. A new model of
Voronoi diagram based on distance measures that are not symmetric is proposed
and its characteristics and efficient algorithms for its computation will be
thoroughly studied. Bi-criteria optimization problems in the plane, such as
shortest path tree or minimum spanning tree routing with constraints on maximum
delay, Steiner minimum tree routing with fixed orientations, and other
optimization problems such as topological via minimization will be investigated.
Not only the computational complexity of these optimization problems will be
studied, but also efficient heuristics and implementations will be developed.
Web-based visualization software tools that help design and dissemination of
usable geometric codes will be implemented. All software will be implemented in
C++ and Java programming languages with the use of visualization package
developed at Northwestern University. The goals of this research are to apply
geometric techniques to tackle problems that arise in computational geometry as
well as other engineering fields in general and VLSI CAD in particular, in order
to increase the real impact of computational geometry on applied areas.
