This award will support research in emergent structures in a variety of many-
body systems, including complex networks and soft matter. Response to shear
deformation will be used to prove the existence and nature of such emergent
structures, within simplified models. The main technique used will be variants
of equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Crystalline solids and other emergent structures are composed of components but
exhibit their useful features, such as mechanical strength, only when the number
of components is very large. For this reason, although such structures are
widely modelled in the sciences there is as yet insufficient understanding of
the complicated role played by the vast number of components. This award will
support a new approach to obtain effective mathematical control of the
components in modelling these technologically important structures.
