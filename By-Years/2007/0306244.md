In this research, we propose computer-aided design (CAD) techniques that
consider manufacturability and reliability of very large scaled integrated
circuits (VLSI),&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, we consider optical lithography
which is the enabling technology for the fabrication of today's VLSI. Since
feature sizes have become much smaller than the wave length of the light sources
used to print them, post-design resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) such as
optical proximity correction (OPC) and phase shifting mask (PSM) are used to
improve their printability. Ideally, these RETs should be considered during the
design steps (e.g., physical design). We propose to develop OPC/PSM-aware CAD
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, we consider next generation lithography
(NGL) techniques which will potentially replace optical lithography in the
future. The two leading NGL candidates are electron projection lithography (EPL)
and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) lithography. Due to the structure of the membrane
mask for EPL, a design needs to be partitioned and later needs to be "stitched"
together. We propose to study this mask layout partitioning problem. As for EUV
lithography, a major problem is caused by the absorption and scattering of EUV
lights by the mask (i.e., the "flare" problem). We propose CAD techniques for
solving the "flare" problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we consider the
antenna problem which is a phenomenon of plasma induced gate oxide degradation.
We plan to continue our ongoing research on diode insertion/routing for fixing
antenna problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
