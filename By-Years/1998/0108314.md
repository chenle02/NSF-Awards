J. T. Hynes of the University of Colorado is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to calculate reaction mechanisms and rates of
proton transfer reactions in solution. In addition, he will investigate the
microscopic structure of surfaces and the dynamics of reactions upon them
relevant to atmospheric ozone depletion. All resulting theoretical predictions
will be compared to corresponding experimental
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research builds upon past efforts to use
highly accurate theoretical calculations to investigate chemical reactions in
condensed phase environments. The results of this research will provide
understanding of reaction classes central to chemistry, biochemistry, and
atmospheric chemistry.
