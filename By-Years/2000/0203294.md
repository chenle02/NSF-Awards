This proposal supports meetings and other activities of the National Academy of
Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA). The role of the Board is to
identify important new developments at the scientific forefronts, foster
interactions with other fields, strengthen connections to technology and
facilitate effective service to the nation by the scientific community. Members
of the BPA are drawn from universities, industry and federal laboratories.
Meetings are devoted to evaluating activities being carried out under its
auspices, discussing critical issues and developing new initiatives. In general,
studies initiated by the BPA focusing on particular areas of physics and
astronomy are carried out by ad hoc groups of experts in those areas. Reports
produced by these groups will have considerale impact in shaping the future
directions of the field.
