This project aims to produce a narrative history of research on synaptic
transmission from the early 1890s through the present, the period which saw
research from a wide spectrum of life sciences coalesce into the amalgam that is
contemporary neuroscience. The main purpose of the study is to describe who did
what, when and how, while a secondary purpose is to consider the nature of
scientific knowledge and how it is formed from the diverse, conflicting and
fallible reports that appear in print. The study will rely mainly on close
examination of published material, augmented by formal, taped interviews with
scientists and some examination of other documents.
