Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty in the sciences continue to
seek out courses that will help capture the interest and imagination of students
in introductory general education science courses. The course in astrobiology at
the PIs institution is doing just this. The course material covers important
societal questions like global warming and nuclear weapons proliferation and it
poses interesting questions like "Should the federal government invest funds in
SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligences?" and "If an alien has
infrared vision, what can you say about the alien's home planet?" Its "case
study" approach is novel in the fields of astronomy and physics. This
interdisciplinary course, using materials from astronomy, physics, biology,
chemistry, planetary science and geology, helps students see the unity and
integration in science. Instructional materials from the project are available
to the academic community through The National Center for Case Study Teaching in
Science.
