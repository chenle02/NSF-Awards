This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project proposes to develop an
optical tomography imaging system for in vivo small animal imaging. This system
will support both active exogenous imaging of oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin using near-
infrared laser sources and endogenous light sources from bio-luminescent or
fluorescent probes .With the goal of developing a state-of-the-art small animal
scanner, this Phase I project will investigate source/detector configurations to
determine the optimum geometry to maximize image resolution and to minimize
cost. This will be followed by the development of novel image reconstruction
algorithms and of innovative methods to achieve quantitative imaging for
bioluminescent and fluorescent optical probes.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of animal imaging.
Animal imaging methods are important in the evaluation of new drugs and in basic
biomedical research.
