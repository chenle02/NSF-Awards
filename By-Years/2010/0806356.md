This project focuses on the synthesis of three biologically active and
challenging natural products. The purpose of these studies is to test and expand
methods previously developed by the PI and to investigate the biosynthesis of
these unusual families of natural products. The first aim involves the
development of new methods and strategies in order to construct several members
of the heliananes family and to investigate the biosynthesis of these
terrestrial and marine compounds. Several mechanistic studies will accompany
this study with regards to key reactions. The second and third aims entail the
synthetic exploration of a new non-racemic benzopyrilium equivalent that has
been developed, a new chiral chromene acetal. The application of this new
chromene acetal building block for the synthesis of kushecarpin, medicarpin, and
sophoracarpan as well for members of the frondosin family will be investigated.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Professor Thomas R. Pettus of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of California at Santa Barbara. Professor research efforts revolve
around the development of new aromatic chemistry. Successful development of the
proposed methodology and syntheses will undoubtedly have an impact on synthesis
in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
