This comparative study of labor dynamics in the sugar industry in the French
colony of Guadeloupe and in the wine industry of southern France (Languedoc)
examines the ways that the legalization of work unions by the French state
during the Third Republic offered individuals in rural France and in the French
colonies a way to combat economic pressures engendered by the globalization of
the world economy at the end of the 19th century. Through a careful analysis of
primary documents, including union petitions, the investigators will investigate
the extent to which unionization and the negotiation between unionized workers
and the state played a key role in the development of a French national identity
among rural workers. Ultimately, the investigators will question whether
unionization served analogous roles in the French metropole and in the French
colonies. The investigation ultimately will challenge the widely accepted belief
in the social sciences that labor and labor unions were antithetical to the
formation of national identity and nationalism in the 19th century.
