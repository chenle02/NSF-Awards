There are two primary objectives of this research: to study experimentally the
effects of plasmids on growth, protein, and DNA synthesis in ;itEscherichia
coli;ro and in ;itSaccharomyces cerevisiae;ro and to develop systematic
mathematical frameworks for analyzing and utilizing the experimental results.
This research will illuminate several key aspects of host cell-plasmid
interactions and will contribute directly toward improved methods for process
and organism design and optimization.
