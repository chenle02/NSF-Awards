This research will model records of seismic activity incorporating both
physical processes, the basis for deterministic models and stochastic elements.
Then the links between relevant geophysical variables and appropriate
statistical quantities will be examined. The objective is to develop
probabilistic models with geophysical interpretations that can be used to
distinguish different kinds of events such as natural earthquakes and nuclear
explosions. Broader goals are to develop and apply the statistics of zero-
crossings and higher order crossings in seismology research.
