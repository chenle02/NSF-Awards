The project takes as its theme the fact that U.S. students are less likely than
their international peers to learn complex and conceptually difficult
mathematics and thus lag in measures of achievement. This IERI project focuses
on scaling an important innovation made possible by the increasing availability
of technology in schools--the use of manipulable, graphical representations and
simulations to democratize access to advanced mathematics. The project builds on
a former Phase I IERI award where the project team developed the methodological
approaches and an evidentiary base for scaling up this innovation, and created
the partnerships needed to conduct a randomized experiment in schools. The team
will now investigate the following questions relating to scale:&lt;br/&gt;1. Can
a wide variety of teachers use innovative technology (SimCalc) to create new
opportunities for students to learn complex and conceptually difficult
mathematics (ratio and proportion are the topics proposed)?&lt;br/&gt;2. Which
teaching practices positively affect students' learning with these innovative
materials, and can teachers improve student learning by implementing a focused
subset of these best practices?&lt;br/&gt;3. Do student gains persist as we
reduce the presence of the research team?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
