9625725 Lee This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
develop a prototype confidence-estimator module that can be integrated with
real-world neural-network applications. Reliability of neural nets is affected
by (1) input novelty, (2) data consistency, and (3) time-varying system
dynamics. Confidence measures can gauge network reliability by indicating when a
neural network's output should be trusted and when periodic retraining should
occur in slow time-varying dynamic systems. Confidence-generation algorithms
complement virtually all neural nets and can help their integration into
production environments. Phase II will address confidence algorithms for all
reliability factors and a method for scaling and combining confidence measures
to generate a single probabilistic value. Algorithms will be tested on data from
an electrolytic chemical process, metal smelting process, a polymer formulation
process control, and an artificial control optimization problem for supply-chain
inventory management. A confidence-estimator module potentially can be used in
virtually every real-world neural-network solution to improve both the
acceptance and performance accuracy. Commercial applications are expected in
process control, finance, retail, insurance, and imaging. The confidence-
estimator module will be useful to 200-300 rapidly expanding companies currently
selling neural-network-based products. ***
