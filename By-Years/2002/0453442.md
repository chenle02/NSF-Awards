The PI and collaborators will continue the Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) program in Astronomy and Astrophysics, at the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, during the summers of 2005-2009. No fewer than eight
students each year will work in Madison, Wisconsin during the ten-week program.
Student projects will be selected from topics that include astrophysical
detectors and data analysis in cosmology, X-ray and neutrino astrophysics,
observational stellar, interstellar and extragalactic astronomy, and theoretical
work in galactic dynamics, neutrino astrophysics, and the chemistry and dynamics
of interstellar matter.

The REU program will have sessions intended to help students prepare graduate
school applications, and practice for the Physics Graduate Record Examination
(GRE). The REU students will also be encouraged to participate in the NSF-funded
"Universe in the Park" public outreach program.

The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
REU program.
