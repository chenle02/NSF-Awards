9413169 Key This project is a contribution to the US World Ocean Circulation
Experiment (WOCE) Indian Ocean Hydrographic Program (IO WHP). The PI will
collect water samples to be analyzed for Carbon-14 (radiocarbon) concentration
on the first two legs of the expedition, denoted as WOCE lines I8S and I9S,
respectively, as well as on most of the other lines over the 1995 period. Lines
I8S and I9S are essentially meridional lines along 115 degrees east, and 85 to
95 degrees east between about 30 degrees South and the Antarctic continent.
Specific objectives include a comparison of these measurements of bomb-injected
C-14 with similar measurements made in 1978 in order to quantify mixing rates
into the thermocline over a 17-year time scale. Measurements will also
contribute to a study of the deep water circulation in the western South
Australia Basin, and the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water Antarctic
Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. ***
