This research is concerned with inference in curved-ray tomography as applied
to solid earth structure. An objective is to analyze at a fundamental level the
many steps of "data processing" involved in the current approaches to
tomographic modeling; to estimate by simulation and otherwise what biases and
errors they may contain; and to remedy the error by using modern techniques of
estimation. Another objective is to apply existing rigorous methods of extremal
inversion to tomographic reconstruction. These techniques will be applied to
develop mathematical and software tools to determine precisely the extent to
which it is possible to resolve features of the 3- D structure given the
quantity and quality of the data available, accounting for nonlinearity of the
problem using newly-developed methods of bounding the uncertainty in estimation
of nonlinear funtionals.
