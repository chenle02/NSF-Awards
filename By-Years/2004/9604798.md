Abstract This proposal has been developed to replace and expand growth
facilities that were purchased more than 20 years ago. These present facilities
have waiting lists for use. The existing chambers are seriously rusting and the
lighting and control systems have constant problems and even occasional short
circuits that have started fires. Futhermore, they have inefficient control
systems and utilize city water for cooling. Modern proportional control systems
operated with central chilled water cooling will provide significant energy
conservation. Thus, these old units can meet only a portion of the needs of the
research of this decade and succeeding decades as detailed in this project.
