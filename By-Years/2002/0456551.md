A four day conference entitled "Geometry and Arithmetic" will be held during the
period of October 17, 18, 19 and 20, 2005, at the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton, New Jersey. The conference will be wide ranging in subject matter,
including talks in algebraic geometry, number theory, automorphic forms, and
representation theory. All of these fields were influenced by the new techniques
introduced by Deligne and Grothendieck (such as etale cohomology, motives, sheaf
theoretic methods for both coherent sheaves and constructible sheaves, the
derived category, mixed Hodge theory). The aim of the conference is to allow
mathematicians from these fields to interact with each other in a constructive
manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning in the 1960's, a powerful collection of
new ideas emerged in &lt;br/&gt;Paris, developed by the mathematicians Pierre
Deligne and Alexander &lt;br/&gt;Grothendieck. These ideas grew from algebraic
geometry, a field that was then somewhat arcane and isolated from the rest of
mathematics. The &lt;br/&gt;Deligne-Grothendieck ideas were so powerful and wide
reaching that, in the years since their inception, they have found essential
applications in very different areas, such as number theory (the study of
equations involving whole numbers) and group theory (the study of symmetries).
They have played a major unifying role in mathematics. Now, Deligne has moved to
the United States and we hope that this conference, celebrating his
achievements, will contribute in its own small way to unifying
mathematics&lt;br/&gt;
