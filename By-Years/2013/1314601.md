This is an award for support to replace and upgrade critical components of the
R/V Neeskay navigational instrumentation. Specifically the Automatic ship
Identification System, radar antenna, satellite compass and VHF
radio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts of the award arise from the fact
that the equipment would increase the vessels capability to support science and
educational programs, historically funded by NOAA, Wisconsin Sea Grant Program,
NSF, EPA, and private sector users (e.g. local utilities). Additionally, the
safety of operations will be improved. The newer generation radar equipment
offers significant improvements in safety through incorporation of computer
calculated collision avoidance information via Automated Radar Plotting Aid
(ARPA).
