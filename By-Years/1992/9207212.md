This is an 18 month cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Der-Tsai Lee,
Northwestern University and Professor R.C.T. Lee, Taiwan Tsing Hua University,
supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program. This
project plans to study ways to minimize the paths between the points in one
segment of a computer disk and those in another segment. This is an important
problem in geometric optimization and computer computation. Professor Lee of
Tsing Hua University is an expert in this area with the additional human and
funding resources needed to carry out computer simulations. This is a mutually
beneficial study of a set of problems for which there are currently no
solutions. Advances in this area can benefit computing and automation
industries.
