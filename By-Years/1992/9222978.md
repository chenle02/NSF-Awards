A High performance workstation for image processing, 3D computer graphics,
volume visualization, and computationally intensive signal processing will be
procured and dedicated to research in imaging science. Specific research
projects utilizing this equipment include: Image Noise Reduction in Pattern
Space A Prototype Active Vision System Automatic Tissue Characterization in MR
Imaging MR/PET Image Registration Two-Dimensional ARMA Model Order Determination
These projects are intended to have both practical and theoretical impact upon a
number of current problems in imaging science.
