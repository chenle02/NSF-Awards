This project will introduce a new technique for low-frequency NMR and NQR
measurements in which a SQUID detector functions as a high- sensitivity
broadband detection system for stochastic NMR measurements. The inherent
sensitivity of a SQUID sensor, and its wide bandwidth make it the ideal
detection device for low- frequency, broadband resonance experiments. The
bandwidth of the SQUID system also offers a unique match to the broadband nature
of the rf excitation used in stochastic NMR. The combination of both wideband
and pulsed measurement capabilities in a single instrument offers the promise of
a unique and powerful new tool in NMR and NQR studies of modern materials.
