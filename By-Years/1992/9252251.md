Contemporary techniques in cell and molecular biology are tools used to solve
problems in all biological sub-disciplines and are an integral component of
laboratory classes in Cell Biology, Molecular Biology, and Genetics. With the
new equipment these classes will utilize Southern, Northern, and Western
analysis, genetic mosaic analysis, DNA transformation, polymerase chain reaction
and immunofluorescence microscopy in their studies. All Colorado College biology
majors take at least two of these courses. The equipment is also available to
independent undergraduate research courses and senior thesis projects. Students
participating in independent or collaborative research projects are encouaged to
present and publish their findings. The requested equipment will allow the
Department to fulfill its plan to expand its offerings and provide students with
hands-on experience in the growing field of biotechnology.
