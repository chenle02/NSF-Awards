The funding from NSF will provide partial participants support at the 2015 Cyber
Security Education Workshop organized by Georgia Tech and supported by Intel
Corporation and NSF. The total attendance is expected to exceed 150 participants
from organizations across the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. At
the workshop, members of academia, industry, and government will collaborate to
build upon ongoing security education programs and encourage the adoption,
incorporation, and dissemination of security content into college curricula. The
event will also explore broader dissemination of novel ideas and experiences.

By fostering dialogue among academia, the private sector, government and
international communities the workshop will significantly improve the
collaboration among the sectors that will operate, sustain, and employ the
persons and technology that underpin the essential core of the Nation?s critical
infrastructure; the stronger partnerships between employers and academic
institutions; and increased research activities to continue forward progress on
relevant hard problems. Expected outcomes of the workshop include the generation
of new ideas for security content adoption and collaborative initiatives among
various faculty. If successful, the event will also enable the creation of
additional security content integration examples that facilitate learning at
both two- and four-year colleges.
