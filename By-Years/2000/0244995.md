This research project focuses on the study of the nonlinear propagation of high-
power femtosecond laser pulses in optically transparent media under conditions
in which the pulse undergoes wave collapse such that strong coupling of the
temporal and spatial degrees of freedom occurs. The phenomena that will be
explored include self-focusing of sub-10 femtosecond pulses and propagation in
the anomalous dispersion regime where generation of three-dimensional optical
solitons may be possible. The proposed research will have an impact on the field
of nonlinear dynamics and will have implications for various areas of ultrafast
science, including femtosecond laser damage, pulse propagation in air, and
parametric and harmonic generation in gases with ultrashort pulses. In addition
to the education of graduate and undergraduate students, the broader impact of
the program will involve outreach activities via the NSF-funded Center for
Nanoscale Systems' Institute for Physics Teachers (CIPT) as well as the delivery
of optics related seminars to high-school teachers and students.
