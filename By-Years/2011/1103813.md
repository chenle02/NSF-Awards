The proposed research focuses on cluster algebras, a class of commutative rings
discovered by the PI in collaboration with S. Fomin. This theory arose as an
attempt to create an algebraic framework for the study of two classical fields:
theory of total positivity, and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups.
Since its inception, the theory of cluster algebras found a number of exciting
connections and applications: quiver representations, non-commutative geometry,
Seiberg dualities, discrete integrable systems, Teichmuller theory, etc. The PI
explores the structural properties of cluster algebras, and their connections
and applications. He also develops the theory of quivers with potentials and
their representations, motivated among other things, by the theory of
superpotentials in theoretical physics.

This project has roots in two classical areas of mathematics: representation
theory and the theory of total positivity. Representation theory provides
mathematical tools for studying symmetry, while total positivity is a remarkable
property of matrices (square arrays of numbers) that generalizes the familiar
notion of positive numbers. Both theories find numerous applications in physics,
chemistry and other sciences, as well as numerous connections with other
mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation theory serves as the
mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major
tool for explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. The cluster algebras
lying in the heart of this project provide a new algebraic framework for the
study of these disciplines, making their formalism more explicit and
understandable.
