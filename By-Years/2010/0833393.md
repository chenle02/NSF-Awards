This Strategies project seeks to provide year round programming following an
intensive summer camp for teachers and students from middle schools in a rural
area. It proposes to build on the Games that Teach research at MIT, and the
games research of the Digital Collaboratory at UT-Austin, to give teachers the
skills they need to design educational game components in team situations with
students. The approach is to use 3-D visualizations, physics engines and other
gaming strategies to relate abstract math and science concepts to real world
phenomenon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
