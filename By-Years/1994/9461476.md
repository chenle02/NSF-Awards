The SBIR Phase I project will develop a technology for producing focused cold
neutron beams from radioisotopic sources which can be used for neutron
absorption analysis. Analytical uses of neutron absorption techniques such as
prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and neutron depth profiling (NDP) have
increased greatly on account of their ability to detect nondestructively many
light elements that are virtually impossible to detect by other techniques.
However, most potential users cannot take advantage of these methods because of
the techniques traditionally require a reactor as a source of neutrons. In this
project new developed capillary optics technology will be used in conjunction
with a californium-252 source to deliver a focused cold neutron beam which is
essentially free of gamma rays and higher energy neutrons. The use of cold
neutrons to obtain increased reaction cross section and the reduction in
background will improve sensitivity so neutron absorption techniques can be
widely used with non-reactor-based neutron sources.
