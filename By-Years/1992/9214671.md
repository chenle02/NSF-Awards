The primary focus of the research is the number theoretic aspects of
computational problems. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest
in this area. Ancient problems have been solved(e.g. primality testing), new
subdisciplines have been spawned (e.g. public-key cryptography) and deep
mathematical tools have emerged (e.g. Abelian varieties, class field theory).
One area of particular interest is the new 'number field sieve'. This collection
of algorithms, developed by many researchers, is the most significant advance in
integer factoring in the last quarter century. The PI will continue to
investigate improvements and generalizations of this method. The application of
the number field sieve to the discrete logarithm problem is of particular
interest. A second area of interest is the application of recent results to
public-key cryptography. The United States Government has recently proposed a
national 'Digital Signature Standard' (DSS). The proposed signature scheme is
controversial and the potential of several methods will be investigated,
including the number field sieve, for breaking the proposed system or for
introducing 'trapdoors'. Another area of investigation involves the development
of new mathematical tools.
