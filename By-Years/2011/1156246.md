In this project, the Principal Investigator will analyze the relationship
between entrepreneurship and market access, seeking to shed light on the effects
of economic context on entrepreneurship and, in turn, entrepreneurship on local
economic growth. The study takes advantage of the variation in market access
brought about by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA): border regions
should experience an increase in their local market size after the FTA, compared
to other interior regions farther from the border. The methods include a
difference-in-differences analysis, testing whether entrepreneurial activity
grew more in border regions than in areas farther from the border from before to
after the FTA. They also involve a spatial econometric analysis methodology,
which is new to the entrepreneurship literature, developed specifically for this
context that will allow researchers to integrate detailed spatial micro-data in
the U.S. with coarser aggregated data from Canada. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
terms of broader impacts, this research should shed light on which factors of
local economic activity (such as the availability of local financing, skilled
workforce, potential customers, and suppliers) have the most important effects
on economic growth and development. Thus, the findings should be valuable to
policy makers with responsibility for economic conditions. In addition, the
project will develop, document, and disseminate the tools needed for similar
future spatial econometric research, including a new dataset linking individual-
level, entrepreneur specific information with the Census establishment-level
universe files. While this study focuses on economic data, the research
methodology and tools developed should be useful to other scholars show are
engaged with related management and economics topics.
