The object of this research is the acquisition of a radar (50 MHz) and a
Raman/Rayleigh lidar which, together with an existing radar (1290 MHz), will
comprise a new facility for atmospheric research and teaching using remote
sensing. Some of the research topics will include temperature of the upper
atmosphere (lidar), and cognate heat fluxes, clear air turbulence, and radar
observations of both precipitation and lightning.
