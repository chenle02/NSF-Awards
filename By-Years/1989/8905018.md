The growing evidence of hydrothermal processes in layered mafic intrusives
(LMI) has brought to the forefront the question of aqueous transport of
platinum-group elements (PGE). We propose to pursue an integrated theoretical
and petrologic study of PGE mobility in hydrothermal solutions. An internally
consistent set of thermodynamic data for aqueous PGE ions and complexes will be
developed using recent advances in theoretical geochemistry. These data will be
employed in calculations to establish the speciation of PGE in solution, and
solubility of platinum-group minerals (PGM) over a large range of geologic
conditions. Mass transfer calculations will allow incorporation of petrologic
constraints, together with thermodynamic data, in order to identify which
factors control PGM dissolution and reprecipitation during hydrothermal events
associated with LMI. Petrologic constraints will be drawn from concurrent
research on the Duluth Complex in Dr. Pasteris' lab, ongoing research by Dennis
Bird on the Skaergaard Intrusive, and literature reports on the Bushveld and
Stillwater Complexes. Expected results include: predicted dissociation constants
for PGE-complexes of chloride, hydroxide, and other major ligands; predicted
solubilities of PGM as functions of temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity,
total chloride, and pH; and increased understanding of the possible role of
supercritical aqueous solutions in the redistribution of PGE in LMI and other
hydrothermal environments.
