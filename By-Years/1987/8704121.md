The Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) program was established
to provide support to strengthen the research environments and capabilities of
predominantly minority institutions or institutions that have substantial
minority student enrollments. Eligible institutions must also have graduate
programs in science or programs in engineering. Funding is provided for faculty
research in fields of science and engineering supported by the Foundation and
for the acquisition of research instrumentation. Meharry Medical College will
use RIMI support to establish core neurohistological and radioimmunoassay
laboratories. These facilities will primarily enhance the development of
research in neuroscience and physiology at Meharry. This project will promote
the strengthening of a research environment that encourages effective
collaborations between investigators. The principal investigator has published
widely in refereed journals and has commendable experience as a university
administrator. The Foundation has supported this project because opportunities
for more minorities to participate in meritorious research in neuroscience and
related areas will be possible.
