This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Operator Theory Operator Algebras: GPOTS 2013" that will be held
from May 21-25, 2013, on the campus of the University of California-Berkeley.

This event is the thirty-third installment of the Great Plains Operator Theory
Symposium (GPOTS), a conference series that annually brings together a diverse
group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory
or operator algebras. The theme of the 2013 event is the mathematical legacy of
William B. Arveson (1934-2011), who was a pioneer in the operator
theory/operator algebra field. Among the main topics to be discussed by speakers
at the meeting are the following: non-self-adjoint operator algebras; complete
positivity, complete boundedness, and quantum information; actions by groups of
automorphisms of operator algebras. The conference program provides ample
opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to
present their work.
