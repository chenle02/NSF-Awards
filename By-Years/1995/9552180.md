The university is vitalizing its chemistry program with the incorporation of
modern instrumentation at all levels of instruction. It has recently added an
FT-IR to existing holdings that include a GC-MS, UV-visible spectrometer,
spectrofluorometer, and high-performance liquid chromatograph. This project
specifically addresses the need for a Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Spectrometer and explains its integration into the curriculum, which
is designed to prepare undergraduate students for graduate school and chemical
industry positions.
