This is a grant to support partially an interdisciplinary workshop on the
climate variability of the eastern North Pacific Ocean-Western North America
region. Called the "Pacific Climate Workshops" (PACLIM), these workshop have
been held each Spring over the past four years. The goals of PACLIM include
promotion of: (1) multidisciplinary studies of climate variability, especially
short-term variability on interannual and decadal time-scales; (2) the
definition, development, analysis, and interpretation of available data bases;
and (3) the determination of useful climate monitoring strategies, including the
use of satellite remote sensing. This workshop will result in an AGU monograph
titled, "Climate Variability in the eastern Pacific and western Americas." This
project is important because it treats with a broad, multidisciplinary
perspective, a climate problem of practical importance to a large region of the
US.
