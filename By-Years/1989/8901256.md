This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of Dr. Herbert Clemens
of the University of Utah. Professor Clemens will work on the geometry of the
generic quintic threefold and on general questions arising from the conjecture
that this threefold can carry only finitely many rational curves. Techniques
that he will use are the pushforward construction from the theory of D- modules
and the infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map, among others. This is research in the
field of Algebraic Geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but
one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its
origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only
from Algebra, but from Analysis and Topology, and conversely is finding
application in those fields as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in
Robotics.
