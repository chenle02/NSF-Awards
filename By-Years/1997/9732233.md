9732233 Birkland This research seeks to understand through empirical study the
factors that contribute to variation in state roles in mitigating losses from
and preparing for disasters. Particular attention will be paid to the diffusion
of lessons among states that have been learned about the effective action in the
aftermath of recent major disasters. These concern the adoption of land-use
planning, building practices, and preparedness legislation that stem from major
disasters. The research is both quantitative and qualitative, with a 50-state
data set to be constructed to isolate determinants of improved policy, followed
by a more detailed qualitative study of disaster policy making in a sample of
states. ***
