This research on problems in complexity theory, has several particular goals:
(1) improved (non-)hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time complexity classes
and related models of computation, (2) improved characterizations of arithmetic
circuits in terms of Boolean circuits and related classes, (3) increased
understanding of the relation between the complexity of the determinant and
other complexity classes, and (4) increased understanding of small-depth circuit
complexity classes, such as ACC and AC.
