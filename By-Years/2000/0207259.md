This project would study the issues and complexities involved in the
implementation of six lesson study programs in diverse settings including one
that is for pre-service teachers. The goals of the project are 1) to understand
the implementation progress and challenges at each site; 2) to share information
about lesson study models, progress and problems; 3) to investigate lesson
study's impact on teachers and students; 4) to contribute to the basic research
knowledge on instructional imporvement, professional development and systemic
change; 5) to contribute to the methods for studying emerging reforms and 6) to
develop video and print materials for practitioners and policmakers. The primary
hypothesis is that lesson study will be adapted by US practitioners operatin gin
unique local contexts, that the nature of these adaptations will influence the
development of lesson study.
