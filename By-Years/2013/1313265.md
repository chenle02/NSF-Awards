Reliable quantitative modeling of opacities and spectra of neutral and singly
ionized Fe-like species (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) is of paramount
importance for 21st century astrophysics owing to various fundamental research
areas that depend on these models. The PI will extend his recent work on
metastable levels to treat photoexcitation and photoabsorption processes that
occur in a variety of astronomical sources. He will concentrate on two related
problems: (1) photoexcitation of Fe II and other singly ionized species in
emission spectra of AGN, and (2) photoabsorption and non-LTE opacities of
neutral and singly ionized species in atmospheres of late-type
stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborators will make all atomic
data and models widely available through numerous databases and codes, and
through a new data server and spectral analysis tool. They will also create a
hybrid course on Atomic Physics for Astrophysics to offer to graduate students
across the US and abroad. The course will be made freely available online in the
form of videos of lectures, simulations, and written materials.
