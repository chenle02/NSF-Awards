9407061 Whitfield This is a Research Planning Grant (RPG) to enable the PI to
develop a Research at an Undergraduate Institution (RUI) proposal. The scope of
the RUI proposal would include the development of a methodology and tools for
combining various compiler optimizations into a single environment. Such an
environment would permit the evaluation of the cost and benefits of
optimizations. It would also facilitate the investigation of the interactions
among optimizations and if certain combinations of optimizations produce better
results than the individual optimizations or not. Preliminary investigations
will be performed during the planning grant. ***
