95-61754 Rose This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
evaluate a multicompartment electrodialysis cell using a new anion-exchange
membrane for the separation and recovery of metals in contaminated wastewater.
The initial application will be for chromium recovery from plating and metal
finishing baths which is of both environmental and economic concern. Regulatory
standards are increasingly stringent and significant savings would result from
recovery and recycling of the metal. Use of membranes for filtration and
concentration is a promising method to address the problem because they operate
at low temperatures, do not generate new waste, and are able to handle large
volumes. The proposed cell will permit simultaneous removal of both hexavalent
and trivalent chromium from the waste stream. In the Phase I program a new
membrane with high chemical resistance will be synthesized that is less
expensive than perfluorinated membranes. Its chemical stability and electrical
properties will be measured and compared to currently available membranes. The
membrane will be incorporated into a three-compartment, laboratory-scale
electrodialysis cell to demonstrate effective removal of toxic metal cations and
hexavalent chromium. The Phase II program will incorporate the membrane into a
multicell electrodialysis system to test with industrial effluents. The
electrodialysis cell with the new membrane will permit efficient and complete
removal of toxic metals from industrial wastewater and concentrate them for
reuse or disposal. Commercial applications include treatment of wastewater
rinses from electroplating baths, tanning effluents, and metal finishing
processes and recovery of strategic metals.
