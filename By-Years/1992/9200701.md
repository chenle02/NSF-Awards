The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the field
of chemistry. For three summers beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate students
will spend ten weeks engaged in basic research under the direction of the
faculty members in the Chemistry Department. A major goal of this proposal is to
provide hands-on experience in ongoing scientific research and to encourage
students to continue their chemical education in graduate school.
