One of the primary challenges facing philosophy of science today is to explain,
if not to justify, scientific methodologies for learning about the world. Dr.
Mayo is developing a model of experimental testing that resolves key questions
in philosophy of statistics and answers the current challenge facing
philosophers of science to demonstrate the rationality of science. Dr. Mayo's
testing model is based on standard Neyman-Pearson (NP) statistics. Despite its
widespread use in science, NP theory has been the center of disputes raised by
nearly all philosophers of statistics and confirmation, and many scientists as
well. Dr. Mayo aims to resolve these criticisms. She is setting out a framework
in which statistical tests link data to hypotheses via a series of models. She
shows how piecing together local statistical tests permits errors to be detected
and corrected, and argues that, suitably reinterpreted, NP methods provide an
adequate account of what permits us to learn from experiments. Dr. Mayo uses the
resulting account of experimental inquiry to grapple with key obstacles to
theory testing: theory ladeness of data, relativity to background assumptions,
and underdetermination of theory by data. The challenge to overcome such
obstacles, raised by Thomas Kuhn and many others, has influenced the thinking in
many fields. The audience for this project includes philosophers, statisticians,
scientists, historians, sociologists, and students of interdisciplinary studies
in science and society.
