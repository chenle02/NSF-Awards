Abstract

Award: DMS-0441170 Principal Investigator: David Eisenbud

The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) is a national research
institute that seeks to further mathematical research through broadly based
programs in the mathematical sciences and closely related activities on widely
ranging topics. The Institute operates without permanent faculty and conducts
long programs (half- or full-year), conferences, and introductory workshops
aimed at students and postdoctoral researchers. MSRI contributes to the
development of the mathematical sciences workforce through postdoctoral
appointments to the long programs, summer graduate programs, and administration
of the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad and Berkeley Math Circles. Outreach and
communication efforts include public lectures in the San Francisco Bay area,
sponsorship of films on mathematics, and systematic Web video delivery of
recorded MSRI lectures.

The MSRI Web site at http://www.msri.org/ describes upcoming and past programs,
solicits ideas for future programs, and offers application forms for Institute
activities.
