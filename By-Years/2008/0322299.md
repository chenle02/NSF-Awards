Much progress has been made in the synthesis and characterization of a variety
of nanoscale materials with varying size, shape and composition. However, a
significant bottleneck exists in applications due to the lack of reliable and
cost-effective means of patterning or assembling nanoscale materials into
structures suitable for devices and functional systems. The program proposed
here aims to develop hybrid materials that can facilitate processing of
nanocrystals especially to make them compatible with readily available
microfabrication techniques. The hybrid materials considered here will consist
of inorganic nanocrystals encapsulated in monodisperse polymer colloids. This
combination provides an attractive opportunity to merge unique properties of
nanoscale materials with the processibility of polymers opening up numerous
possibilities in fabrication and manufacturing of devices and systems containing
tunable nanostructures. Compatibility with readily available microfabrication
processes to build organized nanocrystal arrays will be examined.

Hybrid building blocks considered here can integrate nanoscale materials into
currently employed top-down approaches to fabrication and processing,
potentially expediting the realization of numerous applications in areas such as
electronics and photonics. The multidisciplinary approach including chemical
synthesis, microfabrication, microscopy and optical and electrical
characterization is central to this research and provides an important
educational component. Multifaceted challenges to be tackled here will provide
ample educational opportunities needed for researchers in emerging cross-
disciplinary fields. Diverse topics on nanoscale materials to be explored in
this research program will also serve as a basis for several topics for
undergraduate and graduate courses.
