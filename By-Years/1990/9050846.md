Support is requested for improvements to the Environmental simulation
Laboratory. Established with a major NSF grant in 1972, the laboratory setting.
Students can simulate the visual quality of full scale real world physical
environments using small scale three dimensional models. A computer-aided
periscope lens and video camera records at eye level in motion what a person
would see walking or driving in proximity to a proposed design. Recent advances
in computer simulation techniques make it possible to update and improve the
laboratory equipment. These advances, including new color display technology,
digital memory and microprocessor quality images a reality even on desktop
computers. Three of our personal computer workstations are equipped with raster
graphics adapter cards capable of converting images to digital format. Using
application software, these images are then manipulated and combined with other
images. For example, a view of the real side can be combined with a view of a
scale model to explain the visual effects of a proposed design on the
environment. For the simulation of movement, one of the three workstations is
equipped with an animation module and application software to render sequential
views of a computer generated model.
