The national park model of wildlife conservation has been widely used in many
countries. With population growth and the ensuing increase in pressure on land
and resource use, however, conflicts have escalated among local farmers and
pastoralists trying to sustain themselves and park officials trying to protect
the wildlife as a valuable national and global resource. This doctoral
dissertation project will study two national parks in Kenya in order to
illuminate the complex socioeconomic and ecological problems involved in
national park wildlife conservation efforts. Interviews at the levels of family,
village, and local conservation officials will be used to identify the social
factors that shape the success or failure of conservation. This project will
provide valuable information about the perceptions and attitudes of local people
toward wildlife and how these in turn relate to the role that local people might
play in the conservation of wildlife. This project also will provide an
excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop
independent research skills.
