The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
award is to develop data-driven tractable and robust approach for large-scale
dynamic optimization under uncertainty. This is a fundamental problem especially
in today's world of BigData where we want to efficiently use vast amount of
available data for decision-making. Due to its wide applicability, any progress
in this field will have significant impact in practice. This project will
address two fundamental problems in dynamic optimization. The first is related
to modeling the underlying uncertainties in the optimization problem from data.
Traditionally, probability theory has been used to model these uncertainties but
it is often computationally intractable especially in high dimensions suffering
from the curse of dimensionality. This research will develop new data-driven
paradigms to model uncertainty that simultaneously ensure tractability and good
performance. The second problem concerns developing efficient and robust
algorithms for resulting multi-period optimization problems. The goal is to
pursue the development and analysis of robust, practical and easy to implement
algorithms through simple functional policy approximations with potentially
strong theoretical performance guarantees.

If successful, the results of this research will develop foundational theory for
tractable dynamic optimization and provide fundamental and practical new tools
for a broad spectrum of real world problems. These results will be used to
develop practical solutions for optimization problems arising in electricity
markets and smart grid applications, which is an important area where dynamic
optimization is very applicable. The graduate and undergraduate students will
benefit from involvement in research and integration of the results into
classroom instruction. The research will be broadly disseminated through
outreach programs to local high schools with a goal of increasing the
participation of students especially from underrepresented minorities in STEM
education and research.
