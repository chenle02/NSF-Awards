The objective of this project is to determine the survivability characteristics
of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in wastewater collection and treatment
systems. Research being conducted includes development of reliable methods to
concentrate and assay the virus in wastewater during and after stages in its
collection, transport and treatment. Preliminary work has indicated that the HIV
is stable in the liquid fraction of non-chlorinated, secondary effluent from a
conventional wastewater treatment plant for at least 24 hours with no reduction
in infectivity. In this project, viral concentration will be performed using the
bentonite adsorption-elution process with determination of the virus to be
conducted by direct assay using the antigen capture test, and by measurement of
infectivity. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been found in body
excretions from infected individuals. Wastes from infected individuals are
typically discharged into wastewater collection and treatment systems where the
survivability characteristics of the virus are presently not well established.
Results of this research are expected to provide the basis for determination of
any changes in the engineering design of collection and treatment systems that
may be necessary for response to this potential threat to public health.
