Mountain Empire Community College will initiate a four-week, multidisciplinary,
commuter Young Scholars project in Science and Mathematics for 60 students
entering grades 10-12. This project features hands-on scientific and
mathematical research, including overnight field trips to science-related
facilities and locations. Real-world environmental and ecological problems are
studied and innovative teaching methods are used. Participants are provided a
choice of study in the fields of microbiology and environmental science;
chemistry, geology and physical science; or mathematics and computer science.
Students receive college credit for their research activities. Area high school
mathematics and science teachers assist college faculty during the summer and
serve as contacts to insure the continuation of activities and instructional
methodologies in the high schools.
