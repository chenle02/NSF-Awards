This is the initial funding of a 36-month cooperative agreement to fund the
Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Under this funding, the LDC will create new
databases and improve infrastructure to continue and improve its work of
creating, publishing and distributing data for research on human language
technology. Improved speech and text data resources will be created in three
areas: multilingual speech, multilingual and parallel text, and human-computer
interaction. The LDC will publish and distribute these resources using the same
approach of the many databases already in its catalogue. In addition, the LDC
proposes to provide improved Internet-based access for its members to
essentially its entire archive of data, except where license agreements stand in
the way. This access would encompass both WWW-based search and retrieval of
modestly sized pieces of the data, and also (on an experimental basis) wide-area
remote file mounting for access to entire databases. Significant LDC cost-
sharing is proposed for all of these activities, including the donation of time
and facilities as well as the expenditure of case for equipment, license fees
and additional needed labor.
