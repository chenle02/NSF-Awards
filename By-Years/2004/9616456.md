DMI-9616456 Lee This research project is to improve a newly developed vacuum
infusion resin transfer molding process through a fundamental study of resin
flow, fiber wetting, and resin cure/shrinkage. The research activities include
analysis of micro-flow behavior in the vacuum bag infusion process, analysis of
cure, shrinkage and chemorheology of styrene containing resins, process and
material innovation, and comparison of quality of composites made by open mold
and vacuum bag infusion molding processes. This collaborative research project
addresses fundamental issues on the vacuum infusion resin transfer molding
process. The research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and
will provide valuable findings for the reinforced composite industry.
