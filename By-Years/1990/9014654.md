The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system separates mixtures
of volatile compounds and identifies the masses of each separated component. The
GC/MS is essential when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in
dilute solutions. The GC/MS is useful in areas such as chemical synthesis,
kinetics and structural analysis. This award from the Chemistry Instrumentation
Program to the Department of Chemistry at SUNY-Cortland, an undergraduate
institution, will help acquire a GC/MS system. The acquisition will enhance the
ability of the department to educate undergraduate students and will enhance
chemical research in the following areas: 1. Hydrolysis of Halogenated
Hydrocarbons 2. Analysis of Trace Pesticide Residues 3. Photophysical and
Photochemical Behavior of Rhenium Diimine Complexes
