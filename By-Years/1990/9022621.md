This project will research bifurcation of multiparameter families of nonlinear
differential equations. The primary focus is the analysis of bifurcations to
periodic solutions. In the autonomous case the bifurcation of limit cycles from
centers and from one parameter families of periodic solutions is considered
while in the autonomous case bifurcation of subharmonic solutions is studied. A
major goal is to develop an analysis that goes beyond the usual first order
methods by being able to treat the response to a nonlinear perturbation to all
orders. This will allow for a complete understanding of the bifurcation diagram
of the multiparameter system by detecting periodic solutions which are invisible
to first order methods and by mixing a priori information on the minimum order
to which the perturbation analysis must be carried so as to exhaust the
possibility of finding additional perturbed periodic solutions. The methods
employed include geometric analysis of nonlinear dynamics, perturbation theory,
"Andronov-Melnikov" theory, and algebraic geometric ideal theory. There is also
an important computational component especially integration of differential
equations, computer graphics and computer algebra. Applications of the theory
are found wherever physical systems are modeled by nonlinear ordinary
differential equations depending on parameters and, in particular, when
determining the possible response of a nonlinear system to external stimuli. A
typical application is illustrated in the project by the analysis of a wind
oscillation problem.
