This study considers the impact of beaver on the behavior of the element
phosphorus in streams. Historical records indicate that beaver probably
inhabited most of the small streams in North America prior to settlement by
Europeans. The river flow on these streams was likely impeded by a series of
beaver dams, resulting in ponds separated by the stream channels. Harvesting of
beaver led to their near extinction around 1900, but laws protecting them have
led to their rapid recovery. It is therefore important to understand the
influence of beaver on streams because their presence characterizes the past and
perhaps future status of streams. The influence of beaver activity on phosphorus
dynamics in streams has not been fully studied. It is important that these
studies be done because phosphorus is an element which often limits the growth
and metabolism of aquatic organisms. If the concentration of this element in
water is changed by the presence of beaver dams, then downstream reaches will be
altered. This study will determine if beaver dams change the phosphorus
concentration in downstream water and what factors (particularly those
associated with sediments) influence the behavior of phosphorus and its relation
to decomposition processes.
