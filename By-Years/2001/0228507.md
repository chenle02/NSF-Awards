Abstract

Measuring Velocity-Microstructure from Odyssey III AUV

H. Wijesekera T. Boyd

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have recently become available and popular
as stable and reliable platforms for oceanographic instrumentation and for
conducting surveys of the water column over a small region. We are in the
process of acquiring an Odyssey III class AUV from Bluefin Robotics (expected
delivery is summer 2002). One of our long-term goals is to develop this AUV as a
platform to study fine-scale to small-scale processes in the ocean. Our main
objective in this proposal is to measure velocity-microstructure from Odyssey
III AUV, and we are the first user group attempting to make such measurements
from this class of Bluefin vehicles. In order to obtain the turbulent kinetic
energy (TKE) dissipation rate we must meet two distinct goals: (1) determine
that this AUV is an appropriate platform from which to make microstructure
measurements, and (2) adapt an existing conductivity and temperature
microstructure package to measure TKE dissipation rate by adding shear probes.
To meet goal (1), we must: (a) verify that the platform is either noise-free in
the frequency band of interest, or that the noise is narrow-band and can be
removed from the signal, and (b) determine the flow distortion of the vehicle in
order to know how far forward of the AUV nose the microstructure sensors must be
placed in order to sample the free stream. At present, neither we nor the AUV
manufacturer (Bluefin Robotics) have a quantitative measure of vehicle noise and
of flow distortion around the vehicle. The vehicle noise will be evaluated by
measuring acceleration of AUV, and flow around the AUV will be examined from
numerical techniques. The existing microstructure package, "MicroSoar" will be
upgraded with shear probes along with appropriate hardware modifications to
obtain microscale velocity fluctuations.
