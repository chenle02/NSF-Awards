Shapiro plans to investigate questions in geometric group theory arising from
the study of negatively curved, automatic, semi-hyperbolic and combable groups.
He plans to use concepts developed recently by him and others to examine
3-manifold groups and an assortment of other groups which are geometric in
character. He would like to see if certain standard results for co-compact
groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space can be extended to negatively curved
groups, and would like to see in what ways the study of negatively curved groups
can be used as a guide to the study of groups which act co-compactly on spaces
of non-positive curvature.
