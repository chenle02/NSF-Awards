This Research at Undergraduate Institutions grant is for study of viewer-
centered spherical geometry as a useful basis for robotic perception, spatial
reasoning, and navigation. Spherical octrees are proposed as the fundamental
spatial representation, with appropriate coordinate transformations made as the
robot moves about in its environment. The study will include hierarchical
spatial inference, spatiotemporal cognitive maps, and other uses of the
spherical data structures.
