We propose the conception, development, production, evaluation and dissemination
of a series of interactive modules for the teaching and learning of fluid
mechanics for undergraduates in science and engineering. The modules focus on
fundamentals and will have impact across the curricula of Chemical, Mechanical,
Petroleum, Aeronautical, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Geophysics, Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics. The primary
objectives are to enhance student learning in the areas of (i) problem solving,
(ii) intuition about complex flow phenomena, and (iii) retention of knowledge.
These objectives will be met by providing experimental visualizations and
computational simulations of fluid flow phenomena in an interactive medium,
including student exercises and problems to be solved based on the material in
the module. Three modules will be produced, with emphasis on Basic Concepts I
&amp; II, and Boundary Layer Phenomena. The modules will be developed, tested,
evaluated and refined over a one year period, resulting in a final CD-ROM
version. The final version will be disseminated through a commercial publishing
house such as John Wiley and Sons. The project represents a national effort
centered at MIT, Stanford University, and the University of Illinois, and
involving researchers and educators drawn from the community at large. The
organization consists of a working group of seven investigatorts, including
undergraduate teachers of fluid mechanics, writers of successful textbooks, and
researchers with specific expertise. The evaluation will involve both formative
and summative components, and be conducted using graduate students from the
Stanford School of Education.
