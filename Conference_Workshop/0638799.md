This conference will focus on the current state of the Langlands program from
several viewpoints. Topics will include; automorphic L--functions and
functoriality, local representation theory and the Langlands conjectures,
applications to algebraic geometry, trace formulae and applications to
functoriality, and applications to number theory and special values of L--
functions. We expect this conference will attract a broad, international
audience, and will be an important opportunity to report on recent progress
within the theory of automorphic forms and discuss future avenues of
investigation. There will be approximately 25 hour long lectures, along with the
chance for researchers to engage in informal discussions.

The conference's broader impact will be realized through the opportunity of
young researchers to advance their careers. We also hope to attract members of
underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, and persons with
disabilities. We expect to provide funding for speakers, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, women, minorities, persons with disabilities, and
generally those without other Federal support.
