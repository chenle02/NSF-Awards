This project focuses on a novel merger of the fundamentals of computation and
engineering design at the introductory level in undergraduate engineering
education. Such a merger replaces the teaching of rapidly obsolescent technical
skills (programming and drafting/CAD) with a rigorous, fundamental
indoctrination in an accepted, sound, engineering design methodology. The
controlled introduction of the fundamentals of computation and software design
indoctrinates and illuminates the principles of good engineering design.
