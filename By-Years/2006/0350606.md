The objective of this project is to conduct the first in-depth study of the
creation and passage of the Uniform Small Loan Law (USLL), an effort spearheaded
by the newly established Russell Sage Foundation to regulate credit for poor
people in the United States during the first decades of the twentieth century.
The hope was to push exploitative and unethical lenders ("loan sharks") out of
credit markets, replace them with legitimate lenders, and thereby benefit poor
people as debtors. The Foundation's efforts dovetailed with the uniform law
movement, but represented a hybrid strategy that used market-regulatory law to
produce social welfare outcomes. The research methodology is two-pronged,
combining an extensive archival analysis of the inner workings of the Foundation
and its political lobbying efforts with a quantitative analysis of passage of
the USLL at the state level over the period from 1906 to 1939. The latter will
make use of existing data sets, supplemented by additional data gathered by the
researchers.
