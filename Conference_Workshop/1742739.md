This award will support student participation in the Field of Dreams Conference,
to be held in St. Louis, Missouri, from November 3-5 2017. The Field of Dreams
conference is organized by the National Alliance for Doctoral Studies in the
Mathematical Sciences (the Alliance), an organization whose goal is to increase
the number of students from backgrounds underrepresented in the mathematical
sciences who earn doctorates in those fields. Approximately 200 students will
attend the conference, and about 75% of those will be underrepresented
minorities. More details about the conference activities can be found at the
conference website: https://mathalliance.org/2017-field-of-dreams-conference/

The conference coordinates with the Alliance's Facilitated Graduate Admissions
Process (F-GAP), which has helped place approximately 65 Alliance Scholars in
graduate programs each of the last three years. The conference is an essential
part of a program to produce a more diverse professional mathematical workforce.
The conference will feature scientific talks by prominent mathematical
scientists, activities that assist faculty in mentoring practices, and events
that help academic departments transform their cultures to be more supportive of
student success.
