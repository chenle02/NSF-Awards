The effects of a network of cosmic strings in our universe will examined in
light of recent progress in understanding the formation of structure on these
networks. The principle concerns are gravitational radiation emission, the
perturbations in the temperature of the cosmic background radiation, and the
formation of large-scale structure in the universe. Aspects of quantum gravity
associated with noneuclidean topology, and related problems involving closed
timelike curves, will be examined. The Casimir effect will be studied as a
method for supporting the throat of a traversable wormhole against gravitational
collapse. Research in general-relativistic astrophysics will include efforts to
portray the spin-down of rapidly rotating neutron stars and to extend work on
normal modes, stability and equilibrium configurations of relativistic stars and
black holes. Observations during the next decade may well fix the upper limit on
neutron star rotation, and comparison with the theoretical limit would then
sharply constrain the equation of state of neutron star matter. The properties
of matter compressed to very high densities by gravitational collapse will be
studied as a possible mechanism for avoiding the formation of singularities in
general relativity. New methods will be developed for the numerical integration
of the generalized Einstein equations containing higher derivative perturbative
terms.
