This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics Research by a group
at Rutgers University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported
scientists. The group will continue studying polarized e+e- interactions at the
Stanford Linear Collider (SLC). They will also finish the analysis of neutrino-
neon interaction data taken at Fermilab, study the design of detectors for the
proposed Tau- Charm factory in Seville, Spain, and also study the use of diamond
films for use in high energy particle calorimetry at the Superconducting Super
Collider (SSC).
