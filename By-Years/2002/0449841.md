GeoSystems is a developing community-based initiative that focuses on the
importance&lt;br/&gt;of the deep-time perspective for understanding the
complexities of Earth's atmosphere,&lt;br/&gt;hydrosphere, biosphere and
surficial lithosphere using climate as the focus. The
GeoSystems&lt;br/&gt;initiative holds the potential to catalyze rapid and
innovative progress in research and education&lt;br/&gt;on Earth's climate and
related systems, but will require concerted effort in (1) networking
with&lt;br/&gt;other initiatives in Geoinformatics (e.g. CHRONOS), to forge
alliances on topics of mutual&lt;br/&gt;relevance and begin to formulate tools
appropriate for mining and linking large databases, (2)&lt;br/&gt;building the
community of GeoSystems researchers and stimulating collaboration within
that&lt;br/&gt;community, and (3) initiating outreach efforts aimed at education
in GeoSystems and the role of&lt;br/&gt;Geoinformatics in this effort. To begin
to realize these objectives, funds are requested for&lt;br/&gt;workshops and
meetings, and information dissemination via development of the
GeoSystems&lt;br/&gt;website and related materials (newsletters, brochures,
etc.).&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit--Ultimately, these efforts will augment our
understanding of Earth's&lt;br/&gt;climate and related systems, expanding our
grasp of climate-system behavior, thresholds,&lt;br/&gt;feedbacks, nonlinearity,
and positively impacting climate modeling and prediction.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact-Planned outreach and education efforts will capitalize on
the&lt;br/&gt;remarkable Earth-system couplings and biotic impacts preserved in
Earth history, which capture&lt;br/&gt;the imaginations of all-- the university
professor to the grade-schooler-- and thus provide ideal&lt;br/&gt;fodder for
science education at all levels.
