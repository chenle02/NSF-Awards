9627091 Wahl The project conducts action research to learn more about how
different groups use technology in meaningful ways, develops approaches that
significantly increase access for underrepresented groups, and proposes ways in
which technology might be modified or redesigned to engage, address, and
represent diverse populations. The project targets children and young people
from groups underrepresented with technology, informal and formal educators,
community groups and organizations, researchers, policymakers and funders,
industry, and the public. Products include: a report on the state of access of
underrepresented groups to technology; case studies; guides to increasing
community access to technology; guidelines about how to be critical viewers,
users, and makers of technology; report on the issues involved in producing
diverse and equitable technology design; exemplars and ideas for diversifying
technology design; suggestions for software publishers and industry;
commissioned papers on issues of access and design for particular
underrepresented groups; an agenda for action; and interactive World Wide Web
site; and a popular press book that synthesizes the knowledge gained through
this project.
