9350181 Haddad The objective is to develop advanced integrated control design
methodology that captures as many design constraints as possible within a
unified framework. Such as approach will provide the capability for
simultaneously performing multiple design tradeoffs for multivariable systems
with respect to competing constraints, such as sensor noise, control effort,
controller order, robustness, disturbance attenuation, mean-square error, sample
rate, and controller structure. Considerable attention will be devoted to the
multiobjective H2/H-inf synthesis problem with the aim of designing minimal
complexity controllers. This approach will lead to the design of industry
standard controllers that will fully encompass classical design objectives
within multivariable control theory. ***
