The conference will bring together 45 international scientists who are leaders
in studies of animal hearing and of the evolution of hearing and the auditory
system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Approximately 35 persentations,
from the viewpoints of comparative anatomy, physiology, biophysics, acoustic
behavior, psychophysics, evolutionary biology, ontogeny, and paleontology, will
synthesize past and current research. In addition to providing a structured
forum for the development and exchange of ideas and research findings on
peripheral and central auditory mechanisms in an evolutionary context, the
conference will result in a tightly-edited and integrated volume synthesizing
the data, methods, emergent principles, and future trends in the study of the
evolutionary biology of hearing.
