9360574 Barrett The project deals with the development of high bandwidth
electrical helicopter flight control actuators. The actuators are based on the
use of active torque plate concept. Torque plates, integrated in the blade
roots, pitch the blades to proper attitude by twisting. The plate system is
completely solid state resulting in a much cleaner hub without swash plates,
linkages or bearings. The active elements have extremely high efficiencies
leading to very low power consumption and high break frequencies. The
performance of the active plates is predicted using laminated plate theory.
Analytical models are refined to accurately account for torque-plate
nonlinearities. The performance of torque elements is compared to hydraulic and
other electromechanical actuation systems. ***
