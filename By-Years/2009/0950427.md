This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an award to cover the travel
and expenses of 11 rural Alaskan students, most from underrepresented groups
(Alaska Native) and 4 university faculty members to attend the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark,
in December 2009. The Convention brings together scientists, policy makers,
NGO's, indigenous people, and the public to discuss issues surrounding climate
change. The participation of the students in this conference is part of the
Arctic Social Science Program's goals to increase the exposure of rural Alaskan
students to science in order to develop their knowledge and hopefully their
interest in science studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation of the
DANRD students at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference in Paris,
France, also supported by ASSP, was instrumental in a number of students
completing their coursework and degrees. In this tradition, the PI expects that
attendance at COP15 will encourage Rural Development students' interest in
science and to pursue science degrees in greater numbers. In addition to
attending the convention, the students will meet with students and faculty from
the Department of Eskimology at the University of Copenhagen, the International
Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the Indigenous People's Secretariat of the
Arctic Council, and the Greenland Home Rule Government while in Copenhagen.
