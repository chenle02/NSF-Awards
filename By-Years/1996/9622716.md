9622716 Botez The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison will purchase a high-resolution (0.4um) mask
aligner equipped with backside illumination, which will be dedicated to support
research in engineering. The equipment will be used for several research
projects, including in particular: high-index-step phase-locked arrays of
antiguided diode lasers; monolithically integrated flared-antiguided master
oscillator power amplifiers; novel micromachined millimeter-wave antennas and
circuits; micromachined devices; and superconducting vortex flow transistors
fabricated in high-temperature superconducting thin films. ***
