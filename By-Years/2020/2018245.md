Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine the accuracy and fairness
of credit scores to improve the allocation of consumer credit and mitigate
disparities for disadvantaged groups, such as young and minority borrowers. The
research will implement a machine learning approach that is at the frontier of
computer science to explore this economic question. The research will
investigate the notion that there need not be a trade-off between accuracy of
credit scores and a more equitable allocation of loans. The project will further
look at factors related to credit conditions and default behavior for
disadvantaged groups. The resulting findings will generate direct and actionable
implications for policies and regulations pertaining to consumer debt to help
reduce inequality and improve welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
introduce pioneering advances in constrained machine learning to develop
predictions of consumer default that are fair such that the credit allocation
does not penalize borrowers in disadvantaged groups, such as young or minority
borrowers. The notion of fairness is grounded in economic theory, measurable in
the data, and has an intuitive interpretation. Constrained machine learning is
at the frontier of computer science, and this project will apply these
techniques in examining this economic issue. The project will isolate the most
important factors associated with default and how they vary over time for
different subpopulations. The results of the project will be useful in designing
policies on consumer finance that enables equitable allocation of credit that
improves welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
