This proposal presents a novel solution to the multilayer neural network
training problem - determining the connection weights of the neurons - using a
very powerful construct from combinatorial geometry called a Voronoi diagram. It
will also address the equally important problem of how to partition a neural
network into smaller subnetworks which can then be used either individually or
together to approximate the function of the original network.
