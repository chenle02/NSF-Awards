North Carolina State University (NCSU), in partnership with North Carolina
Community Colleges has successfully launched a program in renewable energy
technologies, Green Research for Incorporating Data in the Classroom (GRIDc).
This continuing project, GRIDcII, establishes a cyber-learning environment in
which STEM students with varied learning styles access real-time data for use in
classroom instruction. GRIDcII, builds upon the project team's past success to
develop the higher order thinking skills of undergraduate students in the
context of a data-rich learning environment. Real-time data on renewable energy
technologies from multiple systems (e.g., solar, wind, electric, alternative
fuels) is collected and stored in a central location. The Solar House at NCSU,
one of the most visible and visited solar buildings in the United States,
provides the location for many of the renewable energy technologies with
additional technologies in North Carolina being added to the data grid system.
Data is available for uploading into an Internet-based data acquisition system
where the data may be accessed by faculty and undergraduate students for use in
classroom instruction. Faculty teaching STEM courses are developing an
understanding for the effectiveness of an integrated, data-rich curriculum to
teach STEM concepts and support students' cognitive skills. Assessment
instrumentation measures the students' common core of knowledge associated with
renewable energy technologies and validates this knowledge for use in different
undergraduate courses at multiple 4-year and 2-year institutions. Partnerships
with community colleges create new avenues for post-secondary collaboration.
Middle and high school students are impacted through the participation of their
pre-service and in-service STEM teachers. This project creates an infrastructure
for continuing research on cyber-learning education across the nation.
