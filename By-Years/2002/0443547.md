With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities -
Multiuser Instrument Acquisition (CRIF-MU) Program, the Department of Chemistry
at Jackson State University will acquire a pulsed laser flash system. This
equipment will enhance research in the following studies: a) molecular design of
ionic nonlinear optical systems; b) laboratory studies of atmospheric reaction
dynamics by jet-cooled laser induced emission spectroscopy; c) spectroscopic
characterization of the gas phase chemistry and role of inert gas with hydrogen
atom in low-temperature diamond chemical vapor deposition; d) study of the
photochemical reaction mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; e) optical
characterization of polymer nanomaterials; and f) transient surface enhanced
Raman spectroscopy of biosensors based on hemeproteins in solution and sol-gel
matrix. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will enable research in several
areas from chemistry and physics at Jackson State University, a minority-serving
institution. In addition, researchers from several small liberal arts colleges
in Mississippi will have access to the instrumentation. It will also promote
interdisciplinary research in the interface of physics, chemistry, and
biotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
