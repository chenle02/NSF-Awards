In this project suppoerted by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism
Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, Shih-Yuan Liu of the University of Oregon
will develop polypyridine ligands in which a pyridine unit in 2-2'-bipyridine
(bipy) is replaced by an isosteric 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborine heterocycle. This
replacement results in low-symmetry polypyridyls ligands (BNbipy) that generate
upon coordination with transition metals complexes that are isostructural to the
corresponding metal bipyridine complexes. This isosteric replacement approach
expands the diversity of accessible bipy ligands for coordination chemistry. The
project encompasses synthesis of new boron-nitrogen heterocycles, coordination
chemistry of BNbipy ligands, and physical methods for characterization of the
new ligands and their transition metal complexes. Basic science in boron
chemistry, coordination chemistry, and photophysical characterization of these
new polypyridyl ligands and their corresponding metal complexes will be
unraveled during these investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-2'-Bipyridine
(bipy) is among the most important and widely used ligands in coordination
chemistry. The proposed research seeks to utilize the BN/CC isosterism approach
to expand the chemical space of bipy ligands. Successful accomplishment of this
project will positively impact the fields of coordination chemistry, dye-
sensitized solar cells, organic light-emitting diode materials development, and
biomedical research that utilize bipy derivatives. The project will also provide
comprehensive and diverse training to the graduate students and undergraduate
students involved, including internship opportunities at national laboratories
and private industry.
