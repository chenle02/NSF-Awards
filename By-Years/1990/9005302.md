This research is an extension of an ongoing project to image the subsurface
geometry of active faults associated with the San Andreas system in southern
California. The geometry of mapped active faults will be found by pre-stack
migration of existing seismic reflection datasets. The imaged faults will be
related to regional deep crustal structures and tested for evidence of Poisson's
ratio variations from amplitude-versus-offset trends, suggesting tectonically-
active zones of weakness. Data from the EDGE and Calcrust projects will be used
to investigate the Santa Maria Basin and Tehachapi Mountains areas. This
research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
