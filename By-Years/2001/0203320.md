Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jon Wellner&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
DMS-0203320&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with research on
statistical inverse problems and point process methods in combinatorics. The
first part of the proposal will involve work on non-standard asymptotics for
likelihood ratio statistics and profile likelihoods, distribution theory for new
limiting distributions, and new distribution theory for point processes. New
computational algorithms will be investigated and comparisons of various
competing algorithms for several inverse problems will be studied. Basic
empirical process tools and methods will be developed and applied to statistical
problems concerning semiparametric models and inverse problems. Applications
include regression models for panel count data, bivariate interval censored data
of several kinds, regression models for multivariate survival data, and studies
of non- and semi-parametric maximum likelihood estimators used in AIDS research,
two-phase data dependent designs, and animal carcinogenesis
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the research will involve
applications of point process methods to combinatorial problems, including study
of the longest increasing sequence in a random permutation and related problems
concerning random Young tableaux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
