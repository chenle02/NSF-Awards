Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 2012 Optical Fabrication &amp; Testing
(OF&amp;T) OSA Topical Meeting, to be held at the Monterey Plaza Hotel in
Monterey, California, on July 24-28, 2012, is to discuss the rapidly evolving
technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The conference will
assemble the key leaders in the field to present recent advances in Optical
Fabrication &amp; Testing to discuss future developments and applications. The
meeting discussions will advance the leading edge of this technology by bringing
together researchers from the different impacted disciplines, to define and
answer their emerging needs of the next decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impact: &lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this meeting will be instrumental in
defining the research required by the growing demands of Optical Fabrication
&amp; Testing. This Topical Meeting of the Optical Society of America will
contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be
disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.
