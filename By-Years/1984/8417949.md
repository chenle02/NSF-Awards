This research has two objectives: an economic model of flexible assembly systems
that embodies accepted accounting practices, describes different part management
methods, and allows different types of technology, different production batching
strategies, and different product life cycles to be described; and assembly
system design aids that help a designer to identify suitable assembly sequences,
select assembly equipment (people, robots, fixed workheads, assembly cells) in
the best mix, and create a system floor layout so that production volume, model
mix, and economic return goals are met. The approach is to modify and extend two
software programs, packaging and documenting them so that they can be
distributed to industrial firms. An attempt will be made to generate an "expert
system" for design purposes. Finally, various assemblies will be characterized
as networks. These will be studied to determine their suitability for generating
assembly sequences.
