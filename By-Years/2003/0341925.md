The broad focus of the Teachers Integrating Engineering into Science (TIES)
program is to develop a working partnership among the College of Engineering,
College of Education at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), and school
district to increase the capacity within Nevada to graduate highly qualified
engineers. Four goals for the planning grant are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Building a
strong working partnership among Engineering and Education professors
&lt;br/&gt; and K-12 school district personnel for the purpose of planning the
implementation of &lt;br/&gt; engineering curriculum into K-12 science classes.
&lt;br/&gt;2. Developing a work plan for identifying, cataloging, and
disseminating existing &lt;br/&gt; engineering educational materials to
educators. &lt;br/&gt;3. Planning, assembling and piloting three engineering
education modules for 7th- and &lt;br/&gt; three for 8th-grade science classes
in four rural Nevada school districts as a first step &lt;br/&gt; toward the
development of K-12 modules. &lt;br/&gt;4. Developing a work plan for
improvement of pedagogical practice for engineering &lt;br/&gt;
professors.&lt;br/&gt;
