9526767 Rudnicki This research is a theoretical examination of the effects of
coupling of shear deformation with pore fluid pressure changes on the stability
of slip in fault gouge zones. Pore pressure alterations arise from shear-induced
dilatancy or compaction and shear heating. The model incorporates idealizations
of material behavior observed in laboratory experiments and estimated and
measured in situ conditions. Numerical and asymptotic solution of the equations
describing the model yield predictions of the evolution of fault slip and the
temperature and pore pressure in the fault zone. The pressure and temperature
changes predicted by the analysis provide a basis for the interpretation of
hydrothermal mineralization and chemical alterations often observed in exhumed
fault gouge zones. This research is a component of the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program. *** ??
