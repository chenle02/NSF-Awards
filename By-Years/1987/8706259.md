This study is designed to analyze the diet of prehistoric peoples of Peru. The
student will work at the urban center of Pacatnamu that was occupied during the
Chimu period (AD 1000- 1350). He will focus on subsistence practices and relate
diet to social status. The idea that higher ranking social groups will have a
wider variety of foods to eat than lower ranking groups will be tested. This
dissertation study is an integral part of the Pacatnamu project, a large
interdisciplinary project. Most of the archaeological research in the past four
years has been designed to establish cultural and architectural chronologies.
The proposed systematic study of subsistence will be the first to determine the
interplay of ocean and land-based resources on the diet of prehistoric
Peruvians. By examining the diet of groups within a single place and time
period, the researcher will help us understand diet and subsistence in terms of
class composition. This, in turn, will provide us with a detailed understanding
of diet in complex societies.
