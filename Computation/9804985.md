The objective of the proposed research is to study high order numerical methods
for shock calculations and for computational electromagnetics. High order
methods can resolve complicated physical problems with a relatively coarse mesh,
hence reducing computational cost for such problems. However, high order methods
for shock calculations and for computational electromagnetics involve many
theoretical and practical issues which must be investigated. The proposed work
involves the development, analysis, and applications of high order finite
difference, finite element and spectral methods in the applications areas of
computational fluid dynamics and computational electromagnetics. Two emphasized
aspects of the proposed effort are complex geometries and efficient parallel
implementations. In particular, the proposal contains the following components:
high order methods for shock wave calculations, including finite difference ENO
and WENO schemes, finite element discontinuous Galerkin methods, spectral
methods, and high order methods in computational electromagnetics, including
spectral methods, spectral multidomain methods, and absorbing layers. It is
expected that the proposed effort will improve the state of art in high order
methods for discontinuous problems and long time integrations, especially in
complex geometry.
