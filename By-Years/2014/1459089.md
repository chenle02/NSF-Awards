This award provides partial funding for the Brookings Conference on
Macroeconomics and the accompanying conference volume, the Brookings Papers on
Macroeconomic Activity. The conference is designed to bring together economic
scientists to focus on the scientific analysis of economic policy issues. These
issues include the changing labor market, financial institutions, global
economic policy, heath care, data improvement, inequality, and long run economic
growth. The papers presented at the conference are available online to the
public. They develop empirical analysis, employ a wide range of research
methods, include real world institutions, and focus on relevance to policy. The
award promotes the national interest by improving the quality of the economics
used in making policy decisions.

BPEA's work not only adds to the body of economic literature but increases the
contributions of economic research to our understanding of public policy. This
is in part due to a high degree of interaction among the organizers,
researchers, discussants, and attendees. Each researcher invited to present
engages in an intensive process of three rounds of review, criticism, discussion
and editing. BPEA encourages scientists to apply the best knowledge of the
profession to pressing policy issues and uses policy concerns to point the
profession's way toward new science.
