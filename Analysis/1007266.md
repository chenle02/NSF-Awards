This research program focuses on several interconnected geometric themes of
complex and real low-dimensional dynamics. It includes polynomial dynamics on
the Riemann sphere and the interval, dynamics in the real and complex Henon
family, dynamics in some special families of rational endomorphisms of
projective space coming from statistical physics, and the geometry of associated
Riemann surfaces and hyperbolic laminations. Most of these themes are unified by
the idea of renormalization as a powerful tool for penetrating into the small-
scale structure of dynamical objects, aimed towards a complete classification of
these objects.

The project will result in deeper insights into small-scale structure of
dynamical systems, a subject that furnishes a key to the understanding of many
of the most basic processes in nature, the fundamental objects of study in
science and engineering. It will include the training of highly qualified
graduate students and postdocs, who will apply their skills in diverse ways and
venues: in academia and industry, in the creation broader interactions between
experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics and statistical
physics, and in promoting efficient communication within the field of dynamical
systems.
