Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a primary metabolic pathway that is
necessary to provide the fatty acyl components found in the lipids of membranes
and vegetable oils. The initial sequence of reaction for this pathway are under
reevaluation since a new condensing enzyme, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KAS
III), was discovered in spinach. KAS III has properties in vitro that are
consistent with it being the enzyme that catalyzes the initial priming reaction
of fatty acid synthesis. The objective of this proposal is to obtain in vivo
evidence that it is an essential component of fatty acid synthesis and normally
acts to catalyze the initial condensation. In addition, the metabolic role of
acetyl- CoA-ACP transacylase and KAS I will be reevaluated. Previously, these
two enzymes were thought to initiate fatty acid synthesis. The biochemical
characterization of KAS III to be completed includes substrate specificity and
level of acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase activity copurifying with KAS III. The
effects on rates of, and regulation of fatty acid synthesis will be evaluated.
IN addition, the in vivo role of KAS III and acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase will be
evaluated using isolated chloroplasts. The results of this proposal should help
to determine the initial steps of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants.//
