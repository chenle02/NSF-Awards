All organisms possess traits that affect their ability to survive and reproduce.
No trait exists in isolation from the whole organism; it is also true, however,
that the overall life- cycle strategy of a species or population is comprised of
some traits that interact and some that do not. Dr. Bradshaw has proposed that
insect life cycles are composed of genetically coordinated traits (tactics) that
may themselves be genetically coordinated. He has also argued that the two
fundamental components of an insect's life cycle are (1) direct development
under favorable conditions and (2) dormancy or migration under unfavorable
conditions. Further, Dr. Bradshaw has predicted situations under which these
fundamental components should, themselves, be coordinated or free to evolve
independently. To test these predictions, Dr. Bradshaw will examine the
coordination of life-cycle traits in a mosquito that develops only within the
water-filled leaves of the carnivorous purple pitcher plant from the Gulf of
Mexico to north-central Canada. The pitcher-plant mosquito has invaded North
America from South America, probably after the last ice age, and has evolved
from south to north. In studying this mosquito, Dr. Bradshaw is examining the
invasion and adaptation of a tropical mosquito into the temperate zone of the
United States. The tropical yellow- fever mosquito presently is established in
our Gulf Coast States and the Asian tiger mosquito, that can carry dengue fever
and encephalitis viruses, has recently invaded southern and eastern United
States. The results of this research will thus have direct implications on the
constraints or opportunities that tropical mosquitoes may have in successfully
spreading to more northern climates in our country.
