9417649 Monson Thermodynamic properties of a fluid adsorbed in a porous material
are substantially modified by the confinement created by the geometry of the
porous material. This plays an important role in adsorption equilibrium for pure
fluids and in selective adsorption from mixtures. Theoretical studies of such
phenomena have been mostly restricted to molecular models in which the porous
material has a well defined and simply characterized geometry. This proposal is
concerned with what happens if the microstructure of the material is not so
easily defined or characterized. Such materials are the rule rather than the
exception in practical applications ranging from adsorption separations to
catalysis to the modeling of oil reservoirs. The proposed work involves the
further development of molecular models of disordered porous materials and
studies of adsorption equilibrium using molecular simulation. This will be
accompanied by the development and application of cluster expansion, integral
equation and mean field theories. The nature of phase equilibrium in such
systems will also be explored. ***
