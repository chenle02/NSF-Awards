Many mathematical models for microbial ecosystems assume the environment to be
homogeneous, as simulated by the chemostat. It is well established that such an
environment does not support competitive coexistence. This project will focus on
two factors that can lead to coexistence: heterogeneous enviornment, and time
lag between nutrient consumption and population growth. The gradostat is a
laboratory system related to the chemostat and simulates ecosystems with spatial
heterogeneity in the form of substrate gradients. The mathematical model for
competition in the gradostat is an example of order.preserving dynamical systems
which have been studied in great detail in recent years. The study will give
better understanding of growth dynamics in gradient.like environments and
suggest new experiments to be performed with the gradostat. Growth delay has
been observed experimentally but its mathematical models have not been studied
extensively. The principal investigator will study model equations which are
integrodifferential equations where delay is described by a kernel in the
Volterra integral which reflects growth being affected by consumption at all
previous time, i.e. distributed delay. The goal is to determine if competitive
coexistence can be expected with growth delay in general, or only with certain
special forms of delay.
