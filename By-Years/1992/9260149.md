Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) has substantial utility as a
protein purification tool for both analytical and preparative applications.
There is a strong market need for an IMAC support suitable for high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chromatochem has developed an HPLC support with
good pH stability, low nonspecific binding, good capacity, durability and rapid
absorption kinetics. Capture ligands are immobilized on large particle silica
via a 50A hydrophilic tether. This research will combine the ChromatoChem HPLC
affinity support with well-characterized affinity support with well-
characterized affinity probes for IMAC of proteins. Phase I goals are to prepare
and characterize two new IMAC supports for HPLC, measure the protein on the
columns. These studies will define the utility of immobilizing IMAC affinity
probes on hydrophilic tethers for rapid, high resolution protein purification.
