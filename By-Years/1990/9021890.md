This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to Fisk University for the renovation
and repair of Talley-Brady Hall which houses that institution's research and
research training activities in chemistry and physics. This building was
constructed in 1931 and has not been renovated since that time. The ARFMP grant
of $800,000 and $1,400,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used
to modernize these research and research training facilities. This project will
address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by providing
adequate plumbing; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and
electrical systems in order to rectify the problems of poor water condition,
including the pressure and drain system, poor climate control, and poorly
grounded outlets. This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by
providing an improved environment for the conduct of a wide range of research
activities in chemistry and physics and for the training of quality
undergraduate and master's degree students in an institution with a strong
commitment to increasing the number of black science majors graduated.
