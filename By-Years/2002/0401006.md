The main aspect of the project is to consider decomposing families of
&lt;br/&gt;finite and infinite groups as the product of cyclic, Abelian or
solvable &lt;br/&gt;subgroups. The historical background comes from Ito's
theorem, Lazard's &lt;br/&gt;work on analytic pro-p groups and the connection
between bounded &lt;br/&gt;generation and the congruence subgroup property for
arithmetic groups &lt;br/&gt;established by Lubotzky, Platonov and Rapinchuk.
While the PI considers &lt;br/&gt;problems motivated by these major results, he
also investigates cyclic, &lt;br/&gt;Abelian and solvable decompositions in a
broader context: for finite &lt;br/&gt;simple groups, infinite permutation
groups, geometric groups and groups &lt;br/&gt;acting on trees. Besides rather
surprising constructions (e.g., the &lt;br/&gt;infinite symmetric group is the
product of finitely many Abelian &lt;br/&gt;subgroups), the existence of such a
decomposition leads to strong &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic restrictions (e.g. on
subgroup growth). On the other hand, &lt;br/&gt;trying to show that a certain
decomposition does not exist forces one to &lt;br/&gt;look at the subgroup
structure from a new point of view which then can be &lt;br/&gt;analyzed
further. An example for this is Hausdorff dimension of groups &lt;br/&gt;acting
on rooted trees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of symmetries of any object or
structure forms a group. Thus group &lt;br/&gt;theory naturally comes into the
picture whenever one needs to analyze &lt;br/&gt;symmetries (e.g. in quantum
physics and chemistry or inside mathematics in &lt;br/&gt;geometry, number
theory, coding theory and topology). The main goal of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed
project is to find certain 'coordinate systems' in families of &lt;br/&gt;groups
and so generate these groups in a transparent way using simple
&lt;br/&gt;structures or to show that such nice systems do not exist. An
elementary &lt;br/&gt;example is the fact that every plane isometry can be
obtained as the &lt;br/&gt;composition of at most three reflections but not as
the composition of &lt;br/&gt;two. There are manifold connections between the
existence of such &lt;br/&gt;'coordinate systems' and various other interesting
group properties. Other &lt;br/&gt;than deep and useful results, the project
also has elementary aspects &lt;br/&gt;which can be presented on an
undergraduate level and thus serve &lt;br/&gt;educational purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
