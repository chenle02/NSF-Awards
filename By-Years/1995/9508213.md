9508213 Coe The PIs will conduct a study of the variation in geomagnetic signal
in sediments with differing properties of the sediments, such as deposition
rate, lithic composition, grainsize distribution, and characteristics of the
magnetic grains. Samples from the sediments that record the Mono Like
geomagnetic excursion will be investigated, as these have been measured in the
past and will be a useful standard. Initially they will look at samples from
around Mono Lake and then at samples from elsewhere that record the excursion.
