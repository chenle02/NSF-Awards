Three of the basic ingredients in the structural foundations of modern analysis
and its connections with theoretical physics are the concepts of measure,
topology, and group. The first of these deals with the notions of volume and
size, the second with proximity and convergence, and the third with symmetry and
the idea of displacement in space or time. When combined together they form the
subject of dynamical systems, which in its classical origins models the time
evolution of physical systems but is nowadays applicable to a wide range of
phenomena involving transformations from one state to another. The project will
pursue novel relationships between measure and topology that have recently begun
to emerge within this dynamical framework and are tightly linked to the related
field of operator algebras. The goal is to use this perspective to develop new
ways of understanding how the particular symmetries of a given dynamical system
may condition different types of asymptotic behavior, from the deterministic to
the chaotic.

While the topological and measure-theoretic perspectives have long between
fruitfully intertwined in the theory of operator algebras, in the last several
years this symbiosis has been reinvigorated through not only the elaboration of
surprisingly far-reaching analogies but also the discovery of new kinds of
applications of von Neumann algebra techniques to C*-algebras with structurally
profound consequences. The central aim of the project is to reimagine these
analogies and techniques in dynamical terms. This will on the one hand forge a
novel line of investigation in topological dynamics that intertwines finite
approximation properties with asymptotic phenomena like mean dimension, and on
the other establish broader connections between group actions and C*-algebras as
part of the effort to understand general types of crossed products and their
K-theoretic classifiability.
