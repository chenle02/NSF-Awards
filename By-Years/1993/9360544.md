9360544 Owen If academic subjects are taught in isolation, students cannot
appreciate the development of and the relationships emanating from the concepts
that they are required to master. Integration of subjects or "integrated
curricula" is a new pedagogical approach that affords excellent platforms for
research and a far better educated populace than is to be found currently.
Presently, however, most middle and secondary teachers have neither the time nor
the administrative support to enable them to teach a subject in an integrated
framework--one that may use the historical and cultural context to show it
development. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
proposes to investigate the feasibility of developing a teacher assistant
software design for middle and secondary teachers of mathematics that uses
concepts and their contexts (cases) for case-based reasoning (CBR) for use on
Internet. The project has the potential to contribute an effective and
accessible teaching aid for integrating curriculum. This tool will facilitate
the maintainence of learners interest and the development of a mental facility
in students for linking concepts and thus enlarging their problem solving
capabilities. ***
