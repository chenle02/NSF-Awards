Information is carried through the brain by bundles of nerve fibers called
tracts. One of the well-known tracts is that from the retina of the eye to a
region of the midbrain called the optic tectum. Neuroanatomists traditionally
trace the connections of these tracts, from the cell groups of their origin to
their specific target nerve cells, by using special dyes. The tracing requires
cutting the brain into thin sections, to examine the cells microscopically, and
reconstruct the three-dimensional pathway from the series of sections. In
contrast, this study will explore a new method, called magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), to trace such pathways. The basic technique is already used in
clinics as a "non-invasive" way of revealing soft brain internal structures from
human patients, using a computer to reconstruct the 3-dimensional images from
the machine. This study tests whether magnetic material can be molecularly bound
to be taken up like other tracers by particular pathways in small animal brains,
and whether the resolution of small features in the brain can be achieved
satisfactorily. Then the animal can be examined with an appropriately scaled MRI
machine, and the computerized reconstruction of the pathway made, without
sacrificing the animal at all. If successful, this pilot study will have great
impact on neuroscience by introducing a fundamentally new way of doing
neuroanatomy on animals where the physiology is known, and will introduce the
possibility of repeated neuroanatomical study on the same individual by this
non-invasive technique.
