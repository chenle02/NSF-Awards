The objective of this proposal is to clarify factors influencing morphological
variation in plant roots by examining genotypic differences in root system
structure and responses to soil nitrogen (N) and water. The infertile wild and
cultivated accessions of lettuce (Lactuca serriola and L. sativa) will provide a
devierse set of germplasm adapted to a wide range of soil water and nutrient
regimes. Genotypic differences in root system structure and plastic responses to
enriched soil microsites will be studied using root topological methods and
growth rate measurements. Ability to extract water, ammonium, and nitrate from
enriched microsites will be studied using the root topological method, growth
rates, measurements of plant water balance including both direct (stomatal
conductance, leaf water potential) and indirect measurements (stable carbon
isotope discrimination), and short-term labeling with the stable isotope, 15N.
Improved understanding of environmental effects on root growth, including
differences in response among genotypes, will provide a basis for improving
water and N absorption of cultivated lettuce, a shallow-rooted crop with high
demand for fertilizer N and irrigation inputs.
