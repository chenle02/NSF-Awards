The source of energetic electrons in the radiation belts during magnetic storms
has long been and remains an unsolved problem in magnetospheric physics. In the
most common model electrons are first accelerated in the near-Earth plasma sheet
and these accelerated particles provide a ?seed? population for the radiation
belts. Under this model the seed electrons undergo further acceleration in the
radiation belts. Recently some studies have questioned whether or not this seed
population is necessary. In this view the electrons are locally accelerated in
the radiation belts. This proposal will investigate whether or not a seed
population is necessary. The investigators will examine the phase space density
of electrons as a function of radial distance by using observations from the
THEMIS satellites, the Van Allen Probes, SWARM (an ESA mission) and e-POP (a
Canadian mission). This will be a statistical study that uses a number of
events.

The PI has long involved secondary school students in his research. His research
projects for high school students have been very successful. He will continue
this under this grant. The research findings from this proposal are important
for space weather applications.
