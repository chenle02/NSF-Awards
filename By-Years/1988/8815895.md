This is a proposal for a renewal of an existing NSF grant entitled "Studies in
Theoretical Physics" which was aimed at the support of Leo P. Kadanoff and
Stephen Hart Shenker who are professors at the University of Chicago. As before,
the topics for investigation include pattern formation in hydrodynamic systems,
the scaling properties of dynamical systems, and the theory of well-developed
turbulence in convective systems.
