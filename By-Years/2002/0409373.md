0409373&lt;br/&gt;Royden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a study of
the Hellenic subduction system, one of several young subduction systems within
the Mediterranean region that are characterized by extension of upper plate
lithosphere and roll-back of the trench away from the over-riding plate. Such
subduction systems are thought to be driven primarily by the presence of a
negatively buoyant slab. The Hellenic subduction system exhibits large
variations in subduction rate and in the density of subducted lithosphere, in
space and in time, as slow subduction of continental lithosphere along the
entire belt was replaced by rapid subduction of oceanic lithosphere along the
southern portion of the subduction boundary at ~8 Ma. Thus it provides an
excellent opportunity to quantify the relationships among slab density and
geometry, subduction rate, deformation of upper plate lithosphere, and the
dynamic interactions between the slab and the surrounding
mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PIs will carry out a
multidisciplinary study consisting of geologic mapping, isotopic dating,
paleomagnetic studies, passive seismic studies, and theoretical and analog
modeling of subduction processes. Through better documentation of magnitudes,
rates, timing and geometry of this subduction system, the PIs aim at a
fundamental understanding of the dynamic processes that control subduction in
the Hellenic system and the way in which these processes are expressed at the
surface.
