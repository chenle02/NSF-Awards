Abstract

Award: DMS-0905977 Principal Investigator: Alexander Furman

The proposed project contains three research directions involving infinite
groups and dynamics of group actions. These three directions include: (1) A
uniform approach to a number of higher rank superrigidity phenomena. This
approach, based on the notion of a generalized Weyl groups, should cover many
known results, including the original Margulis' superrigidity, and its cocycle
version due to Zimmer, results for abstract products, new results for groups
acting on exotic affine buildings. (2) Measure-theoretic notion of imbedding
between countable groups. The project is to study the resulting equivalence
classes of Measurably Bi-Imbeddable groups, and the order between these classes.
The techniques include cocycle superrigidity results obtained in part (1). (3)
"Moduli space" of invariant metrics on a Gromov-hyperbolic group taken up to
bounded distortion. The guiding and motivating source for such metrics are
metrics lifted from Riemannian metrics of negative curvature on a fixed closed
manifold.

The project belongs to an area of research where Algebra, Geometry and Dynamics
interact. The common theme of the project is the study of intrinsic symmetries
of certain structures which appear in Dynamics, Algebra and Geometry, and the
impact that such intrinsic symmetries have on the studied objects. The proposed
problems suggest new points of view and possible generalizations to some
important recent results in these areas.
