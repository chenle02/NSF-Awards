CAREER: Improving Multiprocessor Availability with Dynamic Verification and
Autonomic Operation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses
on hardware-based techniques for fault detection and recovery in multiprocessor
systems. Specifically the project examines correctness with respect to the
following safety and timing properties of the system: dynamic validation of the
correctness of the consistency model, dynamic detection of deadlock and
livelock, and autonomic recovery from detected errors (transient or permanent).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved computer availability will provide a qualitative
benefit to society that increasingly depends on reliable computer systems. The
research is motivated by the tremendous economic and human costs resulting from
unanticipated downtime or unmonitored malfunctions in safety-critical
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
