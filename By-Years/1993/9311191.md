9311191 Lesch The history of biology has traditionally been the history of
complex organisms. By the mid-20th century, however, a radical shift had
occurred in the object of study for a significant component within biology: the
object of study became microorganisms, particularly viruses and bacteria rather
than the more complex organisms. This transformation resulting in the creation
of molecular biology revolutionized the whole discipline of biology. Ms. Susan
B. Spath, working under the direction of Dr. John Lesch, is studying one of the
sources of this transformation in the so-called "Delft School" of microbiology.
She is focussing her dissertation research on C. B. van Niel (1897-1985), who
brought the "Delft School" ideals to the United States when he became professor
at Stanford University's marine biological station in 1929. Van Niel taught for
over thirty years a celebrated course in which participated a remarkable number
of the major players in the development of molecular biology. Ms. Spath is
assessing the impact of this course on the way biology developed in the critical
period when molecular biology was first forming as a distinct research program.
She is also examining the definitions of the fundamental categories of cellular
life as formulated by van Niel and his student and colleague Roger Stanier in
1962. ***
