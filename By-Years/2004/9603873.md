Lighton 9603873 Insects are among the most important animal on Earth, yet we
know very little about their oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release mechanisms
(external respiration or `breathing'). Many insects breathe discontinuously, in
discrete events or "bursts" spaced several to tens of minutes apart. The
detailed nature of this pattern which is called a Discontinuous Gas-exchange
Cycle or DGC is being explored in my laboratory, using several diverse ant
species, other insects, and tracheate arachnids as model organisms. For a small
animal in an arid environment, breathing as model organisms. For a small animal
in an arid environment, breathing can be a major avenue of water loss yet must
continue if the animal is to live. We are investigating the internal physical
and chemical factors which control the timing of the DGC; how the DGC functions
in conserving water reserves; and the environmental factors driving the
evolution and maintenance of the DGC. The result will be the first in-depth,
comprehensive and quantitative account of discontinuous external respiration
phenomena; including their control, implications for body water conservation,
and independent evolution in several very different tracheate arthropods. Our
findings may also increase our understanding of potential physiological targets
for the control of medically and economically important arthropods.
