The PI will measure HF induced ionospheric Langmuir turbulence at high
resolution Arecibo and EISCAT enhanced plasma line spectra, hoping to locate the
cascade spectrum relative to matching and reflection heights during daytime
experiments. He will perform low HF duty cycle experiments with increased HF
power to investigate the effects of increased power on the free mode physics, as
well as experiments observing the effect of magnetic field geometry on
observations of the normal HF-induced plasma line, and on HF enhanced outshifted
plasma line. Moreover, he will perform nighttime observations during low HF duty
cycle heating using the 'chirp' technique to better compare daytime results with
nighttime coded long pulse experiments. Finally, time permitting, he will vary
the HF duty cycle to measure HF irregularity-induced broadening of the natural
plasma line at Arecibo and EISCAT.
