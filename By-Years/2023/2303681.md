Data science and artificial intelligence can offer many benefits for society.
Large important data sets containing private information about individuals, such
as electronic medical records or online shopping behavior, could be used to help
researchers understand human health and behavior, help governments evaluate
policies, and help companies offer custom products and services. However, even
when the data are stripped of identifying information, it may still be possible
to link specific people back to the data and violate their privacy. Because the
owners of these datasets are obligated to protect the privacy of the people
whose data have been collected, the potential to make the data available for
research to benefit society is lost. To address this problem the OpenDP
software, an open-source suite of tools and algorithms for differential privacy,
can be used to ensure that no individual whose personal data is in a dataset can
be identified. This project supports a community effort to develop a self-
sustaining ecosystem around the OpenDP software.

The project creates a sustainable OpenDP ecosystem of developers, contributors
and users, together with a governing board that can guide future development and
respond to community needs. Workshops, conferences, and media connect new
contributors, creating new ways to contribute, credit, and manage volunteer
effort. Outreach to industry and researchers in public health and genomics grows
the OpenDP user base. Planning for future growth of and finding new applications
for OpenDP will ensure the ecosystem's long-term stability. Through this award,
users of and contributors to OpenDP will have a stable community that will
assist them in developing privacy solutions for the future.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
