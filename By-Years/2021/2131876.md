The broader impact /commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a fundamentally different next-
generation SARS CoV-2 vaccine that addresses current gaps in efficacy, safety,
and national and global distribution of vaccines. The rapid global emergence of
the highly infectious delta variant underscores the importance of T cell
immunity, increasingly recognized as critical to eliciting effective and long-
term immunity to SARS CoV-2. An innovative DNA vaccine, delivered as a patient-
friendly intranasal spray that does not require refrigeration, will improve
public health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase I project advances a multivalent SARS CoV-2 T cell vaccine by
intranasal/pulmonary administration of calcium phosphate nanoparticle-formulated
plasmids. Proteins comprising the SARS CoV-2 ORFeome will be cloned in
proprietary plasmids (Aim 1) screened by in vitro challenge with PBMC from
recovered donors (Aim 2) and safety/immunogenicity/challenge in vivo in hACE2
mice. The outcome of Phase I will be identification novel ORFs that elicit T
cell responses in vivo and that in combination partially protective (50%
survival at 14 days post infection) against challenge with SARS
CoV-2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
