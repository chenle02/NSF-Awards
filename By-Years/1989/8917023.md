This proposal will help support travel expenses for approximately thirty U.S.
scientists who will organize and present invited papers at the 15th
International Biometrics Conference. The conference will be held in Budapest,
Hungary from 2 July to 6 July, 1990. The strength of the meeting lies in the
broad international participation of statisticians, biologists and
mathematicians interested in quantitative and statistical aspects of biology,
genetics, environmental pollution, and other fields. This conference is the
major international meeting of biostatisticians and biometricians, and should
attract 500 or more scientists from the international community.
