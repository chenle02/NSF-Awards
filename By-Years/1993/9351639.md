9351639 Burke This project is improving the quality of instruction in the Minot
State University Psychology curriculum. Psychology's previous affiliation with
the Education Department necessitated a curriculum centered on supporting the
goal of teacher training. As a separate department, Psychology has now
diversified its curriculum to include core courses in which a laboratory
experience for our students is essential. Minot State's students primarily come
from rural areas, where exposure to psychology is limited and experience with
laboratory facilities is nil. The majority of our psychology majors are female
(71%), and ten percent of their majors are Native Americans who have had little
educational opportunity to work with laboratory equipment. This project is
allowing Minot State's Psychology Department to establish a psychological
laboratory with computers providing the major experiential base. With modern
technology, students are simulating experiments, equipment, and physiological
dissecting at a great cost savings to the university and with adaptability for
the future. This project is giving students the opportunity to dramatically
increase their understanding of Psychology as a science. ***
