This "19th Informal Conference on Photochemistry" will be the next in a long
series of conferences that have attracted international groups of leading
research workers in its field. The conferences have played an important role as
media of exchange of information and ideas among scientists at the forefront of
photochemical research. These biennial conferences attract atmospheric chemists
because they are brought into contact with workers at the cutting edge of "pure"
gas photochemistry. On the other hand, workers in general photochemistry are
made aware of problems and research opportunities in atmospheric chemistry. The
19th Conference will have one full day of atmospheric chemistry papers.
