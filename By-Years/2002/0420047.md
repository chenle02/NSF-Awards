This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project provides for the
commercialization of composite UV-photocatalytic TiO2 nanofilms deposited by
Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) on nanosized ferromagnetic iron particles. The
iron nanoparticles are formed in-situ prior to ALD processing where conformal,
pinhole-free, chemically bonded films of TiO2 are deposited on the surface of
each individual substrate nanoparticcle. The substrate iron particles maintain a
high magnetic moment and are protected from oxidation by the TiO2 film. The
novel catalyst particles can be used to passively decontaminate polluted streams
and can then be removed magnetically from the decontaminated sites and
regenerated for further use.

The ALD nanocoating of individual ultrafine particles to control individual
ultrafine particle surface chemistry is enabling technology that is unparalleled
compared to more conventional CVD, PVD, PE-CVD, or wet chemistry solution
processing. It is now possible to produce ultrafine particles with designed
electrical, magnetic, optical, mechanical, rheological, or other properties.
Markets for such functionalized ultra-fine powders include microelectronics,
defense, hardmetals, cosmetics, drug delivery, catalytic materials, energetic
materials, and polymer/ceramic nanocomposites, among others.
