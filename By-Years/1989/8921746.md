Dr. Dunlap is extending his prior studies of wildlife biology in North America
to an examination of these issues in Australia and New Zealand. The fauna and
flora of these two countries present wildlife scientists with both unusual
opportunities for research and serious problems in control, management and the
application of ecological theory. Under this grant, Dr. Dunlap is comparing
North American and Australasian wildlife policies on pest mammals, on their
policies for animals in national parks and wilderness areas, and on the
development of scientific communities in wildlife biology. He is also testing
models of "colonial" science and "center-periphery" relationships among national
scientific communities. This project complements his previous NSF supported work
on US wildlife policy and his further studies on Canadian policy. This project
will contribute to our understanding of wildlife biology in Australasia and the
relation of wildlife scientists there to their counterparts in North America.
This grant will support Dr. Dunlap's travel and expenses for a six-week study of
archival and library resources on wildlife management in Australia and New
Zealand.
