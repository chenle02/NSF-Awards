*** 9761330 Reynolds This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop a self-calibrating optical sensor based on principles of photon
migration for on-line measurements of particle or droplet size distributions and
volume fraction for particulate and dispersed phase processes. It proposes to
build a prototype instrument for use in an industrial setting. The novel
approach consists of monitoring the time-dependent propagation characteristics
of light as it multiply scatters through a process stream of high solids. The
technique does not require external calibration or empirically derived
calibration factors. Feasibility of this technology has been demonstrated. While
particulate processes comprise seventy to eighty percent of the US. chemical-
based industry, no on-line measurements are available for the critical process
parameters of particle size and volume fraction in concentrated process streams
to enable control and effective optimization. The photon migration technique has
immediate industrial applications in emulsion processing (including
polymerization), crystallization, ceramic processing, and biotechnology. ***
