This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project addresses the topic of
size reduction of a ferrite junction at low frequencies. Circulators are needed
to separate the signal paths in a T/R module to protect the receiver amplifier
circuit. Also, isolators are required by a microwave system to reduce internal
reflection of the signal. However, at UHF and L-band, the size of a conventional
circulator/isolator junction turns out to be too big to be practically inserted
in a space-limited environment. Although lump-element circuits using ferrite
inductors and multiplexer circuits using semiconductor junctions may be employed
instead, however, they are extremely narrow-band devices subject to low power
ratings. Devices that are five times smaller in linear dimensions than the
conventional junctions have been fabricated. By incorporating high dielectric
materials with the junction ferrite even smaller junction sizes are expected,
giving rise to miniaturized UHF/L-Band circulators and isolators. &lt;br/&gt;
This research project directly applies to UHF/L-band power amplifiers deployed
in space-limited environments in ground vehicles, ships, airline jets,
satellites, and spacecrafts. Applications also include microwave radars
operational over a long distance and future broadband cellular
systems.&lt;br/&gt;
