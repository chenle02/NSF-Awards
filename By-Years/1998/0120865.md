The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) will develop a guide to mentoring
aimed at the Latino community, called Una Mano al Futuro. Studies demonstrate
that students are more likely to pursue science if they have mentors, have
opportunities to explore potential careers, and learn in a supportive
environment. Una Mano al Futuro will focus on reaching high school Latino girls
at a critical stage and providing resources that can be used by the young women,
their parents, teachers, and community leaders to create the environment that
allows the women to explore their interest in science and technology careers.

For the past 10 years, AWIS has established and improved community mentoring
programs for pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students with funding from
the Sloan Foundation, NSF and the NEC Corporation. AWIS's prior projects built
on the knowledge and success of the Sloan mentoring program and produced a new
publication: Creating Tomorrow's Scientists: Models of Community Mentoring. AWIS
will edit and revise their award-winning mentoring books, including A Hand Up:
Women Mentoring Women in Science and Mentoring Means Future Scientists, and
produce Spanish language editions with on-line companion materials in both
English and Spanish.

AWIS will work with several partners in developing materials and in
dissemination to the Latino community: ASPIRA, a non-profit organization
committed to Latino youth issues, and Minority Women in Science (MWIS). Members
of AWIS, throughout its 76 local chapters, will distribute materials and assist
in planning community-based events to reinforce the message of the materials.
