ACCESS will bring together, in scientific discussion and interaction,
atmospheric chemistry doctoral candidates soon to receive their degrees, recent
Ph.D.s, and funding agency representatives. The colloquium will provide the
opportunity to forge future professional relationships, and the entire
atmospheric science community will benefit by becoming more aware of innovations
in atmospheric chemistry through these researchers' efforts. The colloquium will
be held at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 13-15 June 1991 in conjunction with
the 1991 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry to be held in New
Hampton, New Hampshire, 17-21 June 1991.
