This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to investigate
a new imaging technique which involves dynamic control of the tilt of the camera
sensor plane. The proposed effort will investigate algorithms using this
geometry with two objectives. The first objective is to acquire the range map of
a scene. This is useful to construct geometric models of objects, which are in
turn useful for navigation, recognition and manipulation. Second, the imaging
technique delivers a focused photograph of multiple objects. This is useful for
photography because a larger part of the scene can be included in the foreground
than possible with normal cameras. Traditionally, range sensing requires the use
of an energy scan, such as using laser and range measurement from returned
energy. Both of these methods involve special purpose illumination of the scene.
The proposed work is aimed at fast acquisition of geometric models in natural
lighting. Imaging of surfaces that have large variations in depth are not
traditionally possible, so the proposed work has the potential of introducing
new photographic capabilities. The proposed imaging geometry and algorithms
exploit optics of image formation in place of mechanical control to achieve both
objectives simultaneously.
