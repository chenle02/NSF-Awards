The role of electron-electron interaction in systems with moderate disorder is
poorly understood but it is critically important to understanding quantum
transport and the metal-insulator transition. They propose to measure the effect
of this interaction for a system in which, for the first time, both the strength
of the interaction and the degree of disorder are controllable. The
investigation will provide solid experimental data to fill the gap between the
theoretically treated regimes of weak and strong disorder, and should also have
potential technological impact.
