The goal of this research is to develop a technique for the separation of 12;iC
and 13;iC by photolysis of dibutyl ketone in a magnetic field. Earlier work
shows that separation factors of about 1.4 can be obtained when the dibutyl
ketone is confined in micelles. The same effect can be achieved when the dibutyl
ketone is confined within the pores of a silica particle. The research centers
on the use of a fluidized bed photolysis reactor to implement earlier results
into a useful process. This particular configuration for a photochemical reactor
is unique and may provide insights into such other areas as heterogeneous
catalysis.
