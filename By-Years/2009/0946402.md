Concern about the potential impact of climate change on the eastern Bering Sea
ecosystem prompted a study of the species composition, abundance and biomass of
the mesozooplankton populations forming the ecosystem and estimation of
population trends as part of the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST). The PIs have
been previously funded to collect and process approximately 260 zooplankton
samples from the eastern Bering Sea during each of two cruises per year for the
three BEST field seasons, to analyze the data, and to publish the results in
peer-reviewed journals. However, during field collection, the need for
additional information was identified in order to ensure robust results. In
response to these needs, an additional 200 samples per year were collected
during the BEST cruises. This award funds the processing of those
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire rational of the BEST ecosystem study is
based on the fundamental hypothesis that the eastern Bering Sea ecosystem is
changing under the influence of climate. The goal of the BEST research effort is
to identify and quantify mechanistic links between climate and the ecosystem
response. An ecosystem responds to changes in climate forcing by altering the
abundance, biomass and species composition of its constituent populations.
Therefore, a central requirement of the research is to collect and process a
sufficient number of samples to determine robustly the state of the system
during the study, estimate the direction or magnitude of change, if any, to
validate or refute hypotheses concerning change, and to adequately validate or
parameterize the lower trophic level models generated by other program
participants. Processing of the 200 extra samples per year will substantially
improve our ability to detect statistically significant changes in zooplankton
populations during the BEST program, thus helping to address the above
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;
