The objective of this grant is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that are
responsible for the suppression of wear in graphene-polymer composites. Our goal
in this project is to develop an in-depth understanding of the enhanced ability
of graphene additives to resist wear in polymers. Graphene is interesting from
the point of view of wear suppression since it has in-plane sheet dimensions of
the order of several microns coupled with nanometer scale sheet thickness. The
microscale dimensions of the graphene sheets enables it to effectively interfere
with debris generation processes in polymers, while the nanometer scale
thickness, low density and planer sheet geometry of graphene enables a huge
interfacial contact area with very large number density of graphene platelets in
the matrix. Moreover, the sliding of individual graphene planes within graphene
platelets is expected to enhance the lubrication effect and reduce the friction
levels in addition to the material wear rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the proposed work will provide the fundamental understanding
necessary to enable the rational design of wear-resistant graphene polymer
composites. The excellent wear suppression ability of graphene fillers coupled
with their potentially low production cost makes this technology very promising
for industrial applications. Such composites offering reduced friction and wear
have a wide range of applications in the aerospace, medical, chemical,
automotive and electronics industries. Outreach activities include
demonstrations to students from New York State's New Visions high school
program. This will help to popularize science and to attract underrepresented
groups to careers in science and engineering.
