Estrogen is a steroid hormone that is important throughout the lifespan. It is
involved in functions including cell migration, bone development, reproductive
development, neurogenesis, heart function and even neural plasticity and
cognition, as well as its well-known actions as a reproductive hormone. Estrogen
acts at the cellular level through two main known molecular receptors, alpha
(ER-a) and beta (ER-B). These receptors are transcription factors that promote
cell growth and proliferation. The ER-a receptor is known from studies on
genetic knockout (KO) mice to be the major receptor involved in reproductive
social behaviors, and in non-reproductive behaviors such as exploratory
behavior, learning and memory, as well has having an important function in
development. &lt;br/&gt;This SGER project uses a novel approach to create an
'inducible' genetic KO mouse strain, rather than the simple knockouts currently
available. The concept of an inducible knockout is not new, but there has been
no reversible knockout developed for any of the steroid receptors, which have
such widespread distribution and functional importance in the brain. The
inducible genetic expression of ER-a will allow this steroid receptor function
to be manipulated reversibly, and so turn the gene expression not only off, but
also on again, during different stages of development and in adults, allowing
exploration of whether there are distinct 'critical periods' in life for the
function of this important receptor.&lt;br/&gt; This is a high-impact/high-risk
project because the outcome is not clear, but the potential impact of success is
wide-ranging. If successful, the results will lead to further studies on time-
dependent functions of steroid hormones, and will have a high impact extending
beyond neuroendocrinology into the areas such as developmental biology and
cognitive neuroscience. The project also provides a valuable training experience
for a graduate student bridging molecular biology with
neuroendocrinology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
