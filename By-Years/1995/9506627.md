9506627 Karlstrom This award provides funds for a workshop to bring together
investigators from diverse subdisciplines in geology and geophysics to discuss
and synthesize models for the structure and evolution of the lithosphere in
western North America. The main goal of the workshop is to coordinate and
facilitate interaction between workers from different subfields who are
investigating lithospheric evolution of two closely related and intersecting
transects: (1) the Rocky Mountain transect from Wyoming to Mexico, and (2) the
Arizona Transition Zone transect. ***
