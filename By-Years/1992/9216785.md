Project Description (Technical): This research investigates the dynamical
properties of disordered systems and quantum solids at low temperatures. The aim
is to determine the nature of the low-energy excitations in disordered solids,
the behavior of quantum confined structures and quantum rotors in reduced
geometries, and to develop new ultra-low temperature thermometers. Project
Description (Non-Technical): This project studies the properties of materials at
ultralow temperatures, where it is even difficult to measure the temperature in
a convenient manner. The research will study the motion of nuclei of matter by
detecting the precession of the nucleus in a magnetic field. In addition,
related measurements in pure metals will be used in attempts to develop a new
thermometer for these ultralow temperature measurements.
