This project emphasizes development of methods to test theoretical ideas in
current and future accelerator experiments. The first part of the project deals
with current problems concerning the very successful and indispensable "QCD-
based parton model" - the "small-x" behavior of the parton distribution
functions which governs the rates of events expected at all future accelerators,
including the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC); and methods of calculating
the production of new particles initiated by heavy quark-partons. The production
of the Higgs particle which is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of gauge
symmetries will be studied in detail. The second part of the project concerns
the physics of the W and Z vector bosons which mediate the unified electro-weak
interactions. Experimental consequences of the hitherto unverified tri-boson
coupling of these gauge bosons will be explored in depth with an eye for
incisive tests at the high-energy electron-positron colliders SLC and LEP.
Effects due to virtual W's and Z's, especially the "effective vector boson"
approximation to high energy processes, will be studied. The results of this
work should help specifically to ensure maximum effectiveness of the proposed
superconducting supercollider accelerator, in addition to increasing our general
knowledge of the full implications of the Standard (Salaam-Weinberg) Model of
electroweak processes.
