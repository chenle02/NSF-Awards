The Indiana University REU Site will provide a research program for
undergraduates during summers of 2009-2013, though support provided by NSF
Directorates of Biological Sciences (BIO) and Social, Behavioral and Economic
Sciences (SBE). Ten students will be selected each year to participate in an
intensive research program in an area of animal behavior. Students from biology,
neuroscience, psychology and anthropology are welcome to apply. The goal is to
increase students' likelihood to successfully enter a graduate school or a job
in science. Students are matched with individual labs and have the opportunity
to perform and complete their own research projects--including analyzing data,
preparing findings in a poster format, and presenting at a concluding symposium.
The program emphasizes an interdisciplinary environment beginning with
introductory seminar meetings with a range of Animal Behavior faculty, and
includes exposure to techniques of conducting genetic and neuroendocrine assays,
collecting data in zoos, and making science accessible to the public. Students
receive training in reasoning applied to the conduct of science with an emphasis
on basic and applied animal behavior research, assistance in how to present
research, strategies in taking GRE tests, and career options in science and
education. Because the core emphasis is on the research experience, the
scheduling of training events is designed to allow students to begin work in
their host laboratories during the first week of the program. Students from
institutions with limited research opportunities for research and those from
groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. More
