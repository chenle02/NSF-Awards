This award will fund the creation of an Online Ethics Center for Engineering and
Science (OEC) which will be an expansion of the existing National Academy of
Engineering?s (NAE) Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research (OEC) to
include resources for all the fields that NSF supports. Collaboration with the
Ethics Education Library (EEL) of the Center for the Study of Ethics in the
Professions (CSEP) at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) will provide
access to a wider array of materials than will be housed in the OEC and promote
interactions with other repositories of ethics-related information. The OEC will
develop best practices in ethics training, foster research on ethical issues in
science, mathematics, and engineering in both national and international
contexts, and serve as a living resource of multimedia materials that may be
used to train current and future generations of scientists, mathematicians, and
engineers in ethics and responsible conduct of research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Online Ethics Center will help educators,
researchers, administrators, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral
fellows, and practicing scientists and engineers understand the scope of
existing knowledge about both ethics and ethics education in science,
mathematics, and engineering. One of the intents of this resource center is to
help scholars and institutions meet NSF's implementation of Section 7009 of the
America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology,
Education, and Science (America COMPETES) Act by providing easy access to high
quality case studies, best practices, and original scholarship in ethics in all
of the fields that NSF supports.
