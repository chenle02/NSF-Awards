9405175 John Magmatic intrusions are commonly associated with major continental
extensions, however the causal relationship between them are poorly understood.
This study will focus on an area in the southern Basin and Range province where
a combinations of good exposure and large geophysical anomalies offer the
prospect of placing constraints on the relationship between extension and
plutonism. This work will obtain geometric data or the plutonic rocks and the
rocks will be dated by several techniques. The petrogenesis of the plutonic
rocks will be studied using major trace and REE chemistry. Combined with
extensive regional data, these new data will allow a vigorous correlation
between continental extension, middle crustal magmatisms/plutonism and the
documented geophysical anomalies.
