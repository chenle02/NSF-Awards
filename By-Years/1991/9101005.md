This program is a continuation of support for a REU site in the Department of
Civil Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. The support for 10
undergraduate students each year allows them to become involved in the research
activities of the faculty of the Department and provides students with an
improved understanding of research and encourages them to consider careers in
research. The research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in
civil engineering and includes projects in water resources, bioengineering and
pollution control, and structural mechanics. Components of the program include
identification of exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with
emphasis on women and minority participation; matching of student research
interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty with
the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate
study, university research, and careers in academia; an intense two month
research experience; mini-courses, as needed, to facilitate effectiveness in the
research projects; and a mini- conference for presentation of results. The goal
of the program is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation
about the challenges of a career in research.
