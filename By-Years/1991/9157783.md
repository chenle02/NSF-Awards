Studies will be undertaken to understand two cell behaviors important to tissue
engineering: secretion and migration. Understanding these behaviors is important
for efficient tissue development in order to replace defective hormones and
administer pharmacologic agents. Research will target mechanisms of stimulus-
secretion coupling, with emphasis on the role of cell membrane electrophysiology
in these mechanisms. Engineering principals are to be applied in the
experiments, and mathematical models will be used to investigate cell migration
in three-dimensional biological matrices.
