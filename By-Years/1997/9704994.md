The focus of this research is three-fold. First the enantioselective
carboalumination of unactivated terminal alkenes will be developed. Second,
several zirconium- and titanium-catalyzed reactions will be probed. Third, the
ring opening reactions of zirconacycles with single-bonded reagents will be
investigated. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is
supporting the research of Dr. Ei-Ichi Negishi of the Department of Chemistry at
Purdue University. Professor Negishi will focus his work on the development of
new synthetically useful organic transformations via organometals with emphasis
on catalysis and selectivity. The approach will lead to the production of
methodology which can be utilized for the synthesis of natural products,
compounds with interesting biological properties and compounds of interest to
materials chemistry.
