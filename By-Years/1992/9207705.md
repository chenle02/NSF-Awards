In this project, group-theoretic and geometric methods will be applied to
dynamical systems. An analysis from a geometric point of view will be given for
a nonlinear system modelling the evolution of baroclinic amplitude pressure
waves in the atmosphere. Nonlinear phenomena can be modelled by dynamical
systems. Small changes or errors in initial data can lead to dramatic even
chaotic behavior at a later time. The prediction of weather is such an example.
