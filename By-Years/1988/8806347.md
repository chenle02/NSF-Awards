Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite elements method for numerical
computation have great promise in applications to material forming simulations,
and related areas, such as wear and penetration mechanics due to its ability to
analyze fully nonlinear problems. The major advantages will be accuracy,
efficiency, and reliability in nonlinear analysis. This research project will
provide the bases for the implementation of ALE finite element modeling to
material processing. Three aspects of ALE will be studied: the development of
ALE mesh partitions within which mesh deployment is dynamically adjusted in
subdomains; the development of simple, efficient, and accurate ALE stress and
frictional traction update procedures; and the development of rapidly
convergent, computationally-efficient linearized ALE equations of motion in
adaptive ALE mesh in material forming simulation.
