EAR-0322119&lt;br/&gt;Bodnar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past decade
significant advances have been made in instrumentation for measuring the
vibrational spectra of solids, liquids and gases. Modern Raman microprobes use a
wavelength-specific polymer notch filter to remove incident radiation and stray
light. Earlier designs accomplished this through use of a series of mirrors and
lenses that focused the Raman signal onto the detector, with considerable loss
of energy along the beam path. As a result, modern Raman instruments have much
higher energy throughput and concomitantly, significantly lower detection limits
for all covalently bonded species. This project will upgrade the capabilities of
the Vibrational Spectroscopy Laboratory at Virginia Tech by acquiring a Raman
microprobe that employs a visible wavelength laser (514 nm), as well as a state
of the art system that uses an ultraviolet laser (325 nm) as the excitation
source. Unlike the visible system, this latter system is not affected by
fluorescence from the sample, permitting analysis of organic compounds and other
phases that fluoresce when illuminated. The instruments will be applied in a
variety of new and ongoing projects, including development of techniques for
determining water contents of silicate melt inclusions, quantitative analysis of
carbon dioxide and methane-bearing fluid inclusions, analysis of petroleum fluid
inclusions and in situ characterization of corrosion products in natural and
anthropogenic environments.&lt;br/&gt;
