&lt;br/&gt;Transportation accidents take thousands of lives and injure millions
annually. They also cause billions of dollars in property damage. Further
improving safety requires tackling on human factors, one of the major factors
causing traffic accidents. In this proposal we consider driver factors in the
realm of cognitive processing. For this purpose, this MRI project will acquire a
high fidelity driver simulator to study driver behaviors (e.g., drowsiness,
inattention, cognition) under realistic driving conditions. This high fidelity
driver simulator will both serve as a benchmark research platform and testbed of
new theories and technologies. It will support a variety of fundamental and
applied research on driver cognition, inattention and drowsiness, from which
robust physiological or psychology indicators of driver status can be uncovered.
Innovative driver assistant applications and clinic tools resulting from these
fundamental researches will help to implement effective driver warning strategy
for the prevention of accident. The safety and economic benefits will be
significant. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach to address this conventional
safety issue demonstrates the efforts of the proposal team to bring together
progress in multiple disciplines to provide a better solution for this critical
transportation safety problem. The team has a common vision of embracing driver
factors in the realm of cognitive processing and taking an interdisciplinary
approach for interventions in the interface between human behavior and the
operation of a motor vehicle. In addition to advance research, the PIs will
continue their long term commitments in integrating educational and outreach
activities with research activities. Through these efforts, the progress of
scientific explorations supported by this equipment will be timely disseminated
to undergraduate students, graduate students, K-12 students and
teachers&lt;br/&gt;
