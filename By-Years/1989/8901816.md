This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Timothy Byrne of
Brown University to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Asahiko Taira for
one year at the Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, Japan. They will
investigate the relationship between plate tectonics and the evolution of the
continents by comparing plate motions, as inferred from observations in the
ocean basins, with the geologic history of an active continental margin.
Specific- ally, they will document (using structural analyses on data collected
from continental rocks from the appropriate time period) whether or not the
geologic history of Japan records the major change in plate motions that is
evidenced by the bend in the Emperor-Hawaiian seamount chain. Although the
theory of plate tectonics has led to a relatively clear understanding of the
evolution of the ocean basins, little is known about the evolution of the
continents or how their evolution is related to the motion of lithospheric
plates. Dr. Taira's expertise, and the facilities and data available though the
Ocean Research Institute will be of significant value to Dr. Byrne as he
investigates the relationship between plate tectonics and the evolution of the
continents.
