conference focusing on issues and barriers pertinent to rural science and
mathematics education, and to develop systemic strategies for capitalizing on
the strengths and removing the barriers faced by rural schools and educators.

to Federal, state, local and regional agencies, as well as interested educators
and administrators. ***
