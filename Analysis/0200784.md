Abstract:

The theory of a priori estimates and solvability for fully nonlinear equations
with the convexity condition are well developed. While other concrete equations
like Isaacs equations from the stochastic optimal control theory and special
Lagrangian equations from calibration geometry do not have the usual convexity
condition. Only preliminary attempts were made toward this direction in recent
years. Though the complex Monge-Ampere equations have the usual convexity
condition, the holomorphic invariance is too large. There is no theory of a
priori estimates for the complex Monge-Ampere equations with non-smooth right
hand side. This project concentrates on the following four parts. In part one,
the objective is to derive Holder a priori estimates for finitely piecewise
linear Isaacs equations by further employment of the ideas in recent work. In
part two, the attempt is to study the regularity for general fully nonlinear
elliptic equations in 3-d in the light of recent work that any homogeneous order
two solution to fully nonlinear elliptic equation in 3-d must be linear. In part
three, the purpose is to answer whether any homogeneous order two solution to
special Lagrangian equation of dimension four or higher is trivial. In part
four, the aim is to study the Bernstein problem for complex Monge-Ampere
equations.

Differential equations and differential geometry are further applications of
Newton's calculus to the investigation of laws and shapes of nature, and even
some phenomena of our real world. This project deals with some particular
equations, like Isaacs equations from optimal stochastic control theory, special
Lagrangian equations and complex Monge-Ampere equations from differential
geometry. Understanding those equations would have impacts on not only the
related mathematical fields, but also fields outside mathematics like physics.
