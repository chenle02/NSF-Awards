Proposal Number: ECS-9610153 Principal Investigator: Amiya Sen Title: Control of
Plasma Instabilities and Turbulence New feedback control concepts will be
coupled with electron/ion beam non-intrusive suppresser schemes for control or
elimination of plasma instabilities, fluctuations, or turbulence. This research
could lead to significant advances in both fundamental studies of plasma
turbulence and in industrial plasma process control. Neural net controllers with
architecture suitable for plasma control will also be investigated. This
investigation will be the first real time application of a neural net controller
to a plasma system and, more generally, the first real time application of a
neural net controller to a distributed parameter system.
