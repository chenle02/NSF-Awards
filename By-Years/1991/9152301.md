The Animal Physiology labs at Holy Cross offer a rather unique lab experience.
Not only do the students do a number of exercises typical to many such labs, but
they also are heavily encouraged to be independent and to understand all aspects
of experimental work: design, ethics, principles of the operation of equipment,
the role an sources of variation, interpretation and written and oral
presentation. Recently, we have also incorporated independent projects. However,
we have been hampered by lack of two critical pieces of equipment: oxygen and
carbon dioxide analyzers. Whereas in other regards, we are exceptionally well
equipped, the lack of ability to easily analyze reparatory gases greatly reduces
the quality of labs that are central to the course (which emphasizes reparation
and metabolism). It severely restricts the scope of student projects and forces
them to do less than they are capable of and wish to do. To remedy this
situation, we are requesting an oxygen analyzer to augment the one already
present and three carbon dioxide analyzers.
