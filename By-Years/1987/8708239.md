Seismology depends on the measurement of ground motion by sensors involving an
inertial mass to produce an accelerogram. This proposal requests support for the
development of a seis- mometer that will incorporate a digital controller in the
feedback loop mechanism of a force balance accelerometer. The system is
constructed so that position of the inertial mass (the error signal) is
digitized at a high rate and then sent to a microprocessor which modifies the
signal in the desired manner to perform, for example, digital integration or
compensation. The microprocessor input is then passed to a digital-to-analog
converter or other output device to produce the controlling forces on the
inertial mass of the sensor. The seismic signal consequently comes from the
controller at a rate and precision (number of bits) tailored to the output
desired for any given application. A prototype seismometer of the proposed
design will yield the following improvements over current analog systems:
overall system simplification, stable linear response and accurate calibration,
increased dynamic range and adaptability to a variety of transducer systems.
