With the view that monoclonal antibodies are among the more important
biochemicals of commercial value, the objective of the proposed research is to
understand the basic biological phenomena of antibody synthesis, and to apply
the results to the improvement of bioreactor operating strategies. This project
is focused on the probable cell cycle dependency of monoclonal antibody
production, and will utilize flow cytometry with bromodeoxyuridine labeling to
measure cell cycle parameters, and molecular biology techniques to probe
transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of antibody synthesis. Data
are to be incorporated into mathematical models which use cell cycle dependent
kinetics. The results should provide a mechanistic explanation of the
experimental data, and should lead to a better understanding and improved
production of monoclonal antibodies.
