Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects -- called algebraic
varieties -- defined by systems of polynomial equations. A fundamental problem
is to classify algebraic varieties, i.e. to determine when one can be
transformed into another using algebraic functions. The main theme of this
project is to study the classification problem using certain algebraic
invariants (derived categories and Hodge structures), which can be thought of as
sophisticated "linear approximations" to algebraic varieties. These invariants
have connections to many fields, ranging from number theory to symplectic
geometry and high energy physics.

The project has three related parts. The first is to use Bridgeland stability
conditions to prove results about the geometry and period mappings of Fano
varieties; this relies on a newly developed notion of stability conditions in
families, and the existence of noncommutative K3 surfaces in the derived
categories of certain Fano varieties. The second part is to construct more
examples of noncommutative K3 surfaces, and to further develop the theory of
homological projective geometry (which gives a powerful tool for studying
noncommutative varieties in general). The third part is to study geometric
problems suggested by the first two parts, concerning the rationality of
algebraic varieties and the construction of holomorphic symplectic varieties.
