This project will utilize the Large Plasma Device (LaPD) located at UCLA to
conduct laboratory measurements of shear Alfven waves. The project will focus on
two aspects of Alfven wave physics that are of relevance and importance to space
plasma physics. The first topic is the wave dispersion relations over a wide
regime of plasma parameters including both the inertial and kinetic limits. This
topic also includes investigation of direct acceleration of electrons by Alfven
waves. The dispersion measurements will focus on the dependence of the
perpendicular wave number, which is of central importance for several models of
Alfven waves in space plasmas. The second topic is a comparison of lab
experiments and theoretical models for field-line resonances. The comparisons
will be used to discriminate between theoretical models which include parallel
ion flows and those which do not. The project will bring together space plasma
experimentalists and laboratory experimentalists, and it will incorporate
educational activities for both graduate students and undergraduate science
majors.
