The Santa Fe Institute and George Mason University are co-organizing the meeting
on Minimal Life to be held in Arlington, Virginia in August 2009. During the
past 50 years the concept of minimal life has entered biology in a number of
ways starting with the search for the smallest living cell, then the smallest
genome, the smallest free living cell, and following on with the minimum defined
growth medium and the minimum artificial system capable of growth and
replication. Minimality has been approached both structurally, as above, and
functionally, as in synthetic biology searches for minimal recombinable
functional units, or attempts in the origin of life community to identify
minimal necessary levels of exogenous support or control. Topics to be covered
include: Minimal-genome autotrophs and near-autotrophs; experimental genome
reduction and characterization; bioenergetic trade-offs and minimal metabolic
requirements; minimally complex ecosystems and geochemical environments;
minimality of chemical cycles; minimal functional RNAs and replicators; minimal
evolvable systems; functional decomposition of metabolism; minimal functional
units such as BioBricks; symbiosis, syntrophy, and ecological constraints;
engineered systems capable of reproduction; and cooperative information
processing and information-sharing. The participants will cover a broad range of
expertise from microbiology to physics and share a strong desire to communicate
across the disciplines to seek both empirical generalizations and underlying
principles. The kind of meeting envisioned is not a presenting of the latest
results but more a serious dialog and attempt to focus on what minimal means in
this context and what this has to tell us about biological
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting is co-sponsored by the Physics of
Living Systems program in the Physics Division and the three clusters in the
Molecular and Cell Biology Division at NSF.
