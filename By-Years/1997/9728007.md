9728007 Foley Seed dormancy represents a distinct physiological stage of
arrested development in the life cycle of almost all plants. Dormant seeds will
not grow when germinated under optimum conditions unless they have been exposed
for a period of time to certain environmental conditions. Seed dormancy is a
profound adaptation of nondomesticated plants to their environment and plant
survival in natural and agroecosystems depends heavily upon this trait. This
research is aimed at identifying genetic factors that influence dormancy and
germination of cereal grain seeds such as wild oat and rice. In the course of
this research, rice germplasm with varying degrees of dormancy will be
identified and cross-pollinated to produced populations for genetic analyses. A
genetic model for dormancy will be developed and molecular markers for genes
regulating dormancy identified. The genetic model will serve as a framework to
ask more in-depth questions about how genes and environmental factors influence
seed germination. Our initial molecular markers will be important tools in
cloning genes that control germination and dormancy in greases. Cloning genes
will be necessary to understand the fundamentals of seed dormancy and
germination.
