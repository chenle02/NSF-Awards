The quantum mechanics of spatially homogenous cosmological models is important
both as a paradigm for quantum gravity and as an arena for the study of quantum
effects in the Early Universe. The wave function of the Universe may be obtained
either as the solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation or from a path integral
formulation. For more than two or three degrees of freedom, neither analytic nor
numerical differencing methods can be used. Dr. Berger will apply several
numerical simulation methods which yield wave functions in many contexts (e.g.
for multi-electron atoms, condensed matter, and dissolved electron in fluid
systems with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom) to quantized
cosmological models. The physical behavior of the simulations will be examined
particularly with regard to the presence of inflation, fluctuations, and
singularity avoidance. Formal issues will be pursued with a lattice simulation
of quantum gravity as the eventual goal.
