An international Data Web Forum (DWF) has been proposed [DWF] to promote cross-
community coordination and development of global research data infrastructures
with the goal of accelerating global data-driven research and innovation. The
DWF will a) convene to coordinate, create, adapt, and identify community efforts
and deliverables that facilitate greater research data discovery, sharing,
exchange, and use, and b) bring DWF-vetted approaches and deliverables back to
their stakeholder / member organizations, institutions, nations and communities
for implementation and adoption. To support the efforts of the DWF and to ensure
that it is a public organization, national non-commercial non-governmental
structures (NGSs) are needed.

The DWF proposes: the development, implementation, and adoption of shared
approaches, practices, policies, standards and technologies that facilitate the
international sharing and exchange of research data; The development,
implementation, and adoption of a framework and appropriate tools for greater
discoverability and usability of research data that can be used broadly; the
creation and sharing of economic models for stewardship, management, and
preservation of research data that support research practice and broad use and
the development of analytics about the research data landscape that promote
strategic planning and resource allocation, as well as informed policy and
technology

A successful DWF will be a locus for action and development of the global
research data community. The U.S. NGS will work internationally to create,
launch, and sustain the DWF as an effective community forum that lowers
technical and other boundaries and facilitates cross-community data access,
sharing, exchange and use; promotes the creation of a global marketplace for
data services, tools, approaches, and enabling infrastructure; and raises
awareness of the importance of research data as a driver for innovation.
