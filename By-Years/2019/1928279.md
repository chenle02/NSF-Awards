This I-Corps project will impact a range of healthcare industry jobs, increasing
financial efficiency and reduce data-driven misdiagnosis and mistreatment.
Healthcare patient outcomes and experiences will improve with reductions in
medication errors, misdiagnosis, and other inaccuracies that can cause harm to
patients and create liability issues with healthcare providers. Processes
associated with acquiring electronic health data are often function slowly,
incompletely, and often without the full consent of the patient or adequate
metadata to track critical information required for treating a patient. The
solution developed here can potentially enable proper data correctness and
address inconsistencies which can lead to better patient outcomes and improve
legal liability framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project provides
intellectual merits that will improve the healthcare information industry. This
includes synthesis of mathematical models and algorithms that analyze data
completeness and consistency. Specifically, this will lead to a hybrid machine
learning approach that will utilize unsupervised learning to automatically
classify various electronic health records as complete or incomplete, and
supervised learning to confirm such classification and further grade the
likelihood that the entered data is accurate and correct. Furthermore, this will
also lead to evolutions in applications of reinforcement learning supporting
greater accuracy, and anomaly detection. Overall, this project will lead to
improving the quality of healthcare delivery and innovations in supporting
evolutions in data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
