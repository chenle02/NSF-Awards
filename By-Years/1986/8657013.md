Presidential Young Investigator Awards are given to provide support to the
Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering faculty.
Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier has been selected as one of the recipients of this award.
Dr. Droegemeier is fast becoming one of the atmospheric sciences' leading
experts using supercomputers in the solution of meteorological problems. Under
this award he will utilize supercomputers in attacking a variety of
meteorological problems including the development of a highly detailed storm-
scale numerical model. He also will pursue innovative methods of using local
work stations to interactively analyze the overwhelming amount of data that is
produced by numerical meteorological models. Additionally, Dr. Droegemeier will
use purchased hardware and software developed under this award in a unique class
which is focussed on applying numerical methods to solve problems in fluid
dynamics. Dr. Droegemeier's credentials and wealth of good ideas has helped him
in obtaining over $90,000 in matching funds from private industry in support of
this effort.
