9602949 Vitousek/Neff This Americas Program award will support dissertation
research by Jason Neff of Stanford University, under the direction of Dr. Peter
Vitousek. This project, entitled "Biogeochemical Controls on the Loss of
Dissolved Organic Nutrients from Tropical Ecosystems" will take place at two
sites, the Paragominas region of Eastern Brazil and at the Tapajos Forest
Reserve. The goal of this project is to address mechanisms which control the
source and fate of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and dissolved organic
nitrogen (DON) in two tropical forest soil types (Tapajos) and also soils from
primary and secondary forest at a second site (Paragominas) in Brazil. The
biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and phosphorus in tropical forests play key
roles in both the global carbon cycle and in the sustainability of agriculture
following land use change. This research will improve our understanding of these
loss pathways, providing a basis from which to evaluate their role in the
development and maintenance of fertility in natural and agricultural ecosystems.
