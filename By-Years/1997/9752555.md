Many undergraduate programs in mathematics and science do not adequately
emphasize the central role played by mathematics in the investigation of
problems that originate in biology and chemistry. The central role that
mathematics plays in the advancement of all branches of science has created the
demand for biologists and chemists who are quantitatively literate,
mathematicians who can work with scientists in collaborative problem solving
efforts, and educators who have a broad perspective on the interplay between
mathematics and the sciences. This project is developing a library of modules
through which students majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and
mathematics education will gain substantial practical experience in the
application of mathematical methods to biology and chemistry. Each module will
be developed through a collaborative effort by mathematics and science faculty
and will address individual applications at four levels -- precalculus,
differential calculus, integral calculus, and differential equations. At each
level, different aspects of the application will be explored depending on the
mathematical tools available at that level. Through use of the modules in
mathematics courses and science laboratory courses, science and mathematics
students will learn to work together as a problem solving team and to accurately
express the results of their mathematical and scientific investigations in
writing. The modules to be developed will be made available in hypertext and
printed forms and will be disseminated via the World Wide Web. Faculty workshops
on the use of the modules will be held at appropriate national meetings and
working relationships with faculty who adopt the modules for use in their
courses will be cultivated.
