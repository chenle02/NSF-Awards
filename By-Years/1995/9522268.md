This is a Dissertation Improvement project which will examine how child
condition plus other factors, including maternal age, sibship composition,
maternal marital status and access to resources, influence maternal reproductive
decisions. From a biological perspective, how might a mother allocate her
limited time, energy and financial resources among the premature child whose
outcome is questionable, her other children and/or her next pregnancy? The
mother's decisions will impact the timing, outcome and total number of her
children over her life course. An estimated 135 mothers who gave birth to
surviving, premature, very low birth weight infants 14 to 18 years ago and who
have been followed by the investigators from birth will be interviewed by phone
or in person. Care will be taken to include mothers in rural areas plus mothers
who represent diverse ethnic backgrounds. This unique population provides a rare
opportunity to conduct natural experiments to test predictions based upon
parental investment and life history theory. This study will contribute to our
understanding of the relationships between early maternal decisions and lifetime
reproductive outcomes. In addition, this information will provide information
which can be employed in health care policy decisions.
