This STS Dissertation Improvement Grant is a study of a medical imaging
technology in the colonial context. It historically traces notions of visual
culture as they were developed not only by colonial administrators but also by
users of radiographic technology. The idea of visual culture itself was
developed and used to legitimize and stabilize relationships in colonialism's
socio-technical work. The study shows what the political stakes of this
epistemological debate were by outlining the role of visual culture in
establishing a radiographic network in l'Afrique Occidentale Francaise (AOF). It
argues that radiographic technology, including its constituent discourse of
"representational tendencies," was used to negotiate the professional legitimacy
of medical image interpreters and solidify their role as political actors in
colonial and postcolonial West Africa. This study challenges the use of visual
culture in Science and Technology Studies (S&TS) to explain consensus and
reexamines the role of technology in colonialism. NSF funds support archival and
enthnographic work in Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Mali.
