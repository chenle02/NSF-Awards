ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kapranov, Mikhail

University &lt;br/&gt;Title: Representation Theory and Mathematical
Physics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups and their representations are a
fundamental area of mathematics, with connections to geometry, topology, number
theory, physics, combinatorics, and many other areas. Representation theory is
one of the cornerstones of the Langlands program in number theory, dating to the
1970s. Zuckerman's work on derived functors, the translation principle, and
coherent continuation lie at the heart of the modern theory of representations
of Lie groups. One of the major unsolved problems in representation theory is
that of the unitary dual. The fact that there is, in principle, a finite
algorithm for computing the unitary dual relies heavily on Zuckerman's
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been a fruitful interplay
between mathematics and physics, in geometric representation theory, string
theory, and other areas. New developments on chiral algebras, representation
theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras, and the geometric Langlands correspondence
will be some of the focal points of the conference. Recent developments in the
geometric Langlands program point to exciting connections between certain
automorphic representations and SYZ type fibrations in geometric mirror
symmetry. Problems about these representations may now be amenable to new
geometric techniques and insights developed for mirror symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;
