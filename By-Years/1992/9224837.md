The purpose of this post-disaster study is to qualitatively and quantitatively
identify and analyze the structural debris generated after Hurricane Andrew in
relation to the characteristics of the hurricane, the type of construction and
the land use in South Dade County. In addition, the social, technical and
institutional problems encountered during the removal and disposal of the
structural debris caused by the hurricane will be analyzed. The findings from
this work will help mitigate the magnitude and effects of this type of debris
produced by extreme wind episodes.
