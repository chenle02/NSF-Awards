Faust 9627711 Studies of the chemistry of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites
have focused on the stability of their volatile components (hydrous minerals
such as serpentine) and organic material, such as amino acids, hydrocarbons, and
fullerenes under shock conditions simulating those of meteor impact on an
accreting terrestrial planet, and large impactor events, like that thought to
have caused the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary extinctions. The stability of these
organic compounds during meteor impact is not well known, and is important in
understanding the organic chemistry of the terrestrial planets during and after
their accretion. The NSF fellowship will be used to study the stability of
organic molecules (such as biotic and abiotic amino acids, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and fullerenes) in natural carbonaceous chondrites and analogous
materials, using shock-wave and recovery techniques with Professor Ahrens at
CalTech. For the recovery experiments, the P.I. will use infrared spectroscopy
to study the structure and content of the organic material in the recovered
samples because it is an extremely sensitive technique to use when studying
hydrogen and carbon bonds in organic matter and minerals. The expertise in using
infrared spectroscopic techniques will provide her with an excellent background
with which to investigate meteoritic organic material, and knowledge of the
behavior of hydrous minerals at high pressures and temperatures will also give
her an excellent basis with which to understand their stability in meteorites
under shock conditions.
