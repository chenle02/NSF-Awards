This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
workshops "Workshop in Analysis and Probability" that will be held on the campus
of Texas A&M University during the period, July 2 - August 10, 2012, and the
summers of 2013 and 2014. The ongoing Workshop in Analysis and Probability at
Texas A&M University brings together senior and junior researchers and graduate
students in several areas of analysis and probability as well as researchers in
other fields (such as geometry and theoretical computer science) in order to
broaden the education of the younger participants and to promote interaction
among researchers in various fields. The Workshop also sponsors three day
conferences (SUMIRFAS-Informal Regional Functional Analysis Seminar),
Concentration Weeks, and mini-conferences. These conferences include
introductory lectures designed to acquaint junior researchers and non experts
with the basics of an area as well as advanced lectures for experts.

The Workshop activities have a wide impact by providing intellectual stimulation
for all participants as well as giving an opportunity to a diverse group of
junior participants to increase the breadth and depth of knowledge and to
interact with senior researchers in several areas of mathematics. There is also
significant outreach to applied mathematics and computer science. Indeed, a very
important aspect of the Workshop is to promote cooperation among researchers in
different fields, and every Concentration Week involves participants from
experts in two or more research areas.
