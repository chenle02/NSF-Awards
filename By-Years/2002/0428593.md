Abstract 0428593 Mark Sheplak University of Florida

A 3-year research and curriculum project in the development and use of silicon-
micromachined, floating-element, shear-stress sensors is carried out at the
University of Florida. Specifically, a new research and education thrust is
focused on the design, fabrication, rigorous characterization, and use of
miniature floating-element sensors that enable the direct, quantitative
measurement of time-resolved, fluctuating wall shear stress. Such measurement
technology is crucial to gain a fundamental understanding of and ultimately to
enable the control of the three-dimensional, unsteady separated flow phenomena
that prevents the controllable flight of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The accurate
measurement of fluctuating wall shear stress is currently not possible and the
realization of this capability not only inhibits MAV development, but impacts a
broad application spectrum that ranges from fundamental scientific research to
biomedical applications. The focus of the education plan is to prepare students
for engineering in the 21st century through the incorporation of
interdisciplinary design and problem-solving techniques into both the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum. Specifically, a laboratory course and
several course modules that focus on the development of interdisciplinary
problem-solving skills are established. In addition, educational opportunities
for students will be established via government laboratory internships and
distance-learning community outreach.

This project is supported under the Sensors Initiative NSF 04-522.
