This award supports student attendance at the 59th IEEE Annual Symposium on the
Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Paris, France from October 7 through
October 9, 2018, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral
fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister
conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the
Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by
students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience,
both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for
networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has
been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a
third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to about 20
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
