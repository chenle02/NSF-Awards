The University of Michigan's Fish Collection contains more than 3 million
specimens and approximately 2,000 type specimens, making it the largest
university-held fish collection in the country and the fourth largest fish
collection in North America. This collection was one of the first to be
catalogued on microcomputers, and it remains one of the leaders in its
applications of computer databases for research and curation. Dr. William Fink,
Curator of the collection, proposes continued curatorial improvements to the
curation of the collection and an upgrade for the database hardware and
software. New storage containers will assure the long-term preservation of large
specimens, and an active program of visiting specialists will identify new
accessions into the collection so that others may study them. New computer
equipment will provide dial-in access by research scientists at remote sites.
The proposed improvements will increase the research impact of this important
collection. Systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, and investigators from a
variety of other disciplines will benefit from the continued improvements to
this valuable research resource.
