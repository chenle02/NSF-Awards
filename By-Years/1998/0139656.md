&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to Louisiana State University (LSU) for
the support of a three-year, REU Site in the Chemical Sciences, under the
direction of Dr. Steven F. Watkins and Dr. Kerry M. Dooley. This is a renewal of
a successful site for summer research in the chemical sciences and will result
in the training of 42 undergraduate students (14 per year). The nine-week summer
program is a joint effort by chemical engineers, chemists, and biochemists at
LSU and offers a diverse cadre of students, who are drawn from all parts of the
U.S., the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to well-funded, active
research projects. The REU site builds on past achievements, most notably that
more than sixty percent of its interns haven chosen to attend top graduate
schools in chemical engineering or a closely related discipline. The program is
particularly successful in leveraging regional resources from industry and its
emphasis on written and verbal communications skills through mini-proposals,
final reports, oral presentations and posters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
