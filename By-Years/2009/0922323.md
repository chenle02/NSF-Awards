It is widely acknowledged that making decisions often involves the
consideration of both "rational" and "intuitive" inputs. This program of
research will examine how people decide the amount of weight to assign rational
considerations and intuitive impulses when making decisions. The work will focus
particularly closely on those situations in which people experience a conflict
between intuition and reason and must choose whether to follow their "head" or
their "gut." Much of the work will examine whether people pursue a "matching"
procedure in deciding whether to follow one or the other. That is, it is
hypothesized that people compare the features of a given choice problem (Can the
outcome be evaluated quantitatively? Will the outcome unfold in a series of
discrete steps?) with the features they associate with reason (precise,
sequential) and with intuition (fuzzy, wholistic), and then choose to decide
intuitively or rationally according to which input provides the closest match.
The proposed research will also examine how the bodily associations people have
to intuition (gut) and reason (head) influence their evaluations of intuitive
and rational arguments, and, ultimately, the decisions they make.

By understanding the processes that govern how people utilize rational and
intuitive inputs in making decisions, this research promises to further our
understanding of (1) what constitutes intuition and reason, (2) why and when
intuitive arguments can trump rational considerations, (3) how decision
environments can be structured to increase the impact of either rational or
intuitive inputs, and (3) how people can be aided in making more rewarding
choices.
