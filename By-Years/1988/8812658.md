In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in electrical
engineering between Zoran Andjelic, University of Sarajevo, and S.J. Salon,
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the investigators will develop a mathematical
model and computer based programs for three dimensional nonlinear field
modelling and optimization for 3D electromagnetic field distribution of
electrical devises. Such a model will be used to determine the optimal
performance of an electrical devise in the design stage or during operation. The
University of Sarajevo research team is expert in software development while the
RPI group is experienced in code verification and data testing on large
electrical equipment. This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board
on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund
consisting of matching contributions from the governments of the United States
and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of
State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants are made to the principal scientific
institution in Yugoslavia, but include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to
Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
