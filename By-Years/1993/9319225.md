9319225 Martis This project creates a relational database on congressional
history, 1788-1992, that permits secholars, for the first time, to use easily an
unprecedented range of variables pertaining to congressional careers,
committees, elections, party and roll call voting, presidential relations, and
workload. Some of the material to be contained in the new database is now
archived in separate Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research databases; other major aspects will be newly created. What is truly
path-breaking about the project, however, is not only the range and scope of the
data, but its relational structure. Scholars will be able to link easily data on
different congressional dimensions, facilitating the study of their
interrelationship in ways that until now have been virtually impossible. Project
participants will apply this data to their own research on the development of
congressional careers; the institutional impact of party realignments; the
institutional effects of elections; the development of congressional-
presidential relations; and the potential of national legislatures to resolve
sectional conflict. These are but a few examples of the various kinds of topics
scholars will be able to undertake more easily and more comprehensively. ***
