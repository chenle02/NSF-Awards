CISE/CNS/CSR PEC 7354 Org Code 05050000 $25,000 &lt;br/&gt;There is an urgent
need for curricular guidance on parallel and distributed computing (PDC) due to
rapid technological changes and mass marketing of multicores and general-purpose
graphics processing units. Educators struggle to decide the right balance
between theory and practice, and to choose from the diverse set of models of
computation, languages, software and hardware platforms, and tools.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The working group that has participants from various
institutions has deliberated upon various topics and subtopics, and released a
preliminary version of the curriculum in December 2010. A competition for
granting Early Adopters status was held in Spring-11. The proposing instructors
will be employing and evaluating the proposed curriculum in their courses. The
primary task ahead is to organize a follow-up curriculum workshop (EduPar-11 at
IPDPS) to bring together early adopters and other experts, collect feedback from
the early adopters and the community, revise the preliminary version of the
curriculum, and hold a second round of competition for Fall-11 for early adopter
status.
