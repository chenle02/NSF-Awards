This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore
methodologies for extracting increased parallelism for computationally demanding
problems with limited spatial resolution, through the use of space-time parallel
algorithms, and efficient parallel design-optimization strategies. The
formulation and implementation of adjoint methods at the petascale will also be
pursued in order to enable specific engineering-objective focused simulation and
optimization capabilities. For wind energy applications, this will result in a
better understanding of failure mechanisms, and more effective design
capabilities.
