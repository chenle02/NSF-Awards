9629060 Yin The long term objective of this research is to develop a general
methodology for the design, manufacture, and implementation of molecular-scale
machines that are able to recognize and manipulate components in their
environment. Examples include machines that would synthesize novel materials, or
process genetic information at the molecular level. Such machines do not
currently exist. However, insights toward their realization may be obtained by
focusing on viruses, biological entities that embody many of the desired
characteristics. ***
