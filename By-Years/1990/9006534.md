The Flora Novo-Galiciana is intended as an authoritative taxonomic guide to the
flowering plants, ferns, and conifers of a biologically rich portion of western
Mexico. It provides a working tool for identification of and research on the
approximately 7500 species of plants in this region of Jalisco and surrounding
areas, ranging from sea beaches and tropical evergreen forest to semi-arid
grasslands and mountain peaks that ascend to timberline and above. All species
are provided detailed morphological description, an illustration of technical
features, full references to literature in which the species have been treated,
brief discussion about habitats and geographical range, vernacular names,
economic values and uses. There is no complete such account of the plants of any
other part of Mexico. Dr. Rogers McVaugh has been working on this inventory for
over 40 years, amassing plant collections now deposited in herbaria in Mexico
City and in several U.S. institutions. Five volumes have been published thus
far, treating the legumes, the orchids, the grasses, the sunflower family, and
the bromeliads and some other monocots. Remaining volumes being prepared will
treat ferns, conifers, and other dicot flowering plants. The Flora is now used
as a standard text in the School of Agriculture of the University of
Guadalajara, attesting to its immediate practicality, and is widely cited as a
valuable reference work. With assistance from his botanical colleague Dr.
William Anderson, Dr. McVaugh continues to oversee the production of this
splendid inventory.
