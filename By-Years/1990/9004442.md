The research will document how regional shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions
during the Proterozoic-Cambrian transition may have influenced the record of
extinctions and radiations of early Metazoa. Recent work in South Australia has
shown that the inferred gap between the last appearance of complex vendozoans or
the Ediacaran fauna and the first appearance of Cambrian-aspect traces is, in
part, artifactual. It is suggested that the two faunas are in close
stratigraphic and, by influence, close temporal proximity. In order to test this
observation, detailed stratigraphic and paleontologic analyses will focus on the
exceptional exposures of the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition in the Flinders
Rangers, South Australia. Two principal data sets will be developed: 1) genetic
stratigraphic sequence reconstructions of the intervl comprising the Upper
Rawnsley Quartzite/Ediacara Member of the Pound Subgroup (uppermost
Proterozoic?), Uratanna Formation (uppermost Proterozoic?-Lower Cambrian) and
Parachilna Formation (Lower Cambrian); and 2) fossil/lithofacies associations of
Ediacaran and earliest Cambrian trace and body fossils. Integration of these two
data sets will allow the reconstruction of time- environment histories of faunal
occurrences and a test of the role that ancient environments have played in
biasing this record. By attempting to separate artifactual from factual
signatures within the record, this research will have important implications for
efforts to establish the causes and timing of the apparent demise of the
Ediacara fauna and the dramatic subsequent radiation of the Cambrian fauna. The
results of this work will contritube to on-going efforts to determine if there
is a link between latest Proterozoic/Early Cambrian faunal turnover and a
variety of geochemical and lithostratigraphic anomalies in the rock record. In
addition, this research will improve our current understanding of the
stratigraphy of a globally- significant Precambrian-Cambrian boundary section.
