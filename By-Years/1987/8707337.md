The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) is an industry cooperative
organized and operating in the area of generic research in support of the
industry's competitive needs. Government participation in this cooperative
activity will provide a valuable increment of resources and, of equal
importance, will provide the basis for an industry-university-government
cooperative activity to address the national need for a competitive, on a
worldwide basis, integrated circuit industry.
