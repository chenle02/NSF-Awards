9350944 Fonda This proposal concerns five field-oriented courses that partially
or totally involve the student in studies of a wide variety of aquatic
ecosystems. Physical and chemical variables are emphasized and are measured
using Hydrolab multiparameter water measurement systems with dedicated computer
support. Also, students are able to construct accurate profiles and to describe
completely the spatial and temporal patterns in these bodies of water. In
particular, the Hydrolab allows faculty to work efficiently with small groups of
students on concurrent measurements. The inclusion of computer analysis
introduces students to modern techniques of environmental monitoring, data
analysis, and graphing. ***
