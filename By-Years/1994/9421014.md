ABSTRACT D. T. Leighton CTS-9421014 It is proposed to partially support the
organization of the 6th Joint NSF-DOE Workshop on Flow of Particulates and
Fluid, Philadelphia (PA), October 5-7, 1994. The purpose of this grantees
meeting is to bring together NSF and DOE (PETC) grantees, as well as researchers
from industry, to review relevant projects sponsored by both agencies, promote
collaborations among different research groups, and review future research needs
and opportunities. Approximately 50 invited researchers from universities,
industry and national laboratories are expected to participate, including 22
speakers. The papers presented will include experimental, theoretical, and
numerical studies in the areas of particulate and multiphase flows. The workshop
proceedings will be prepared following the meeting, and made available through
the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce. ***
