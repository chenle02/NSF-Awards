9350746 Hampton Modern biological research and its technological applications
have come to rely heavily on our abilities to understand mathematical concepts,
apply statistical reasoning, and process and interpret data through the use of
computers. This project is designed to enhance these skills among undergraduate
students. A key component is a new computer laboratory which includes
microcomputers networked together plus software packages needed for specific
classroom exercises. The principal undergraduate course that utilizes the
computers, Biological Statistics, is a required course for all biology majors.
Also, computer-assisted exercises are being developed to improve understanding
of fundamental biological principles, the scientific method, or specific
quantitative skills of particular importance to biologists. ***
