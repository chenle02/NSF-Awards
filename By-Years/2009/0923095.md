This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Central Arkansas will acquire a liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer for non-chromatographable
materials and for in situ analysis. A variety of research projects will be
investigated including: Reactivity, Spectroscopic, and Sensing Properties of
Nickel Complexes on Solid Organic Supports; Photolabile Amino Acid Radical
Precursors; Synthesis and Oxygen Transport Properties of Highly Fluorinated
Dendrimers; Retinoid Metabolism in the Presence of Thiazolidinediones; Analysis
of Lipids from Bacterial Growth Media and their Potential in Taxonomy; Laser
Desorption Studies of Aromatic Nanofilms Adsorbed on Evaporated Metal Films and
Metal Powders; and the Characterization of Organic Binders in Ancient Cave
Paints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique
used to identify the chemical composition of a sample and to determine its
purity by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample. Liquid
chromatography is a separation technique that precedes the mass spectrometry
analysis. It separates a mixture into its several constituent chemicals which
are then analyzed and identified by the mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry is
one of the most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques. Because of
this, it is important for undergraduate students to be trained in the technique
on modern instrumentation as they participate in research projects such as those
mentioned above.
