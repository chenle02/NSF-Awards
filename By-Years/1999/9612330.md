9612330 Banerjee This grant provided partial support for a symposium on virtual
reality in manufacturing research and education. Virtual reality, and ability to
simulate real-world situations, is playing an increasingly important role in
engineering and engineering education. Improving computational capabilities will
accelerate this trend. This symposium will focus on the following topicq:
computational aspect of virtual reality in manufacturing, the current state of
software technologies, the current state of hardware technologies, distribution
and logistics in manufacturing, layout and location problems in manufacturing
education, manufacturing process design, product design and prototyping,
telepresence and telerobotics, and volumetric visualization. Results of the
symposium will be made public by posting them on the World Wide Web and through
a special issue of the Institute Engineering Transactions on Virtual
Manufacturing. This symposium help to accelerate the development of virtual
reality technologies and improve the quality of engineering education. This
would contribute to the economic competitiveness of American industry.
