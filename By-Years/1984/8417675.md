The primary objective of this research is to develop a verified method of
estimating the earthquake damage caused by permanent displacements and
distortions in retaining structures. Verification tests will be made in a
geotechnical centrifuge. This research will advance the state-of-the-art of
geotechnical centrifuge testing methods for earthquake hazard mitigation. This
study modifies the basic geotechnical stability of retaining structures to
analyze tilting and permanent deformations. The non-linear soil structure
interaction phenomena developed from this analysis will be tested with
appropriately designed dynamic experiments in a small geotechnical centrifuge.
Confirmation tests will then be performed in a large centrifuge. The results
will be valuable in advancing the state-of-the-art of geotechnical centrifuge
testing methods.
