A New approach to the Archean sulfur cycle from marine
carbonates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By &lt;br/&gt;Jess Adkins, Woodward
Fischer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The rise of atmospheric oxygen
from an originally reduced planet surface is a central problem in Earth history.
It is widely believed that the oxygenation of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere
occurred in abrupt steps. The Great Oxygenation Event at the Archean-Proterozoic
boundary is one of the better studied of these deep-time jumps, chiefly through
the mass independent fractionation (MIF) of the stable sulfur isotopes. However,
most of this evidence comes from the reduced forms of sulfur, chiefly pyrite
being enriched in the MIF signal. The current understanding assumes that the
complementary light MIF signal resides in oceanic sulfate at this time, a trace
phase in carbonates that has been analytically inaccessible until now. PIs will
use a new MC-ICP-MS method that lowers the current detection limit for sulfate
in Archean carbonates by over three orders of magnitude. Micro-drilling of
specific textures to unravel the simultaneous evolution of the sulfate and
sulfide phases in Late Archean rocks will be used to better understand how it is
that the early earth transitioned from an anoxic atmosphere to one with
substantial amounts of molecular oxygen. PIs will collect new outcrop and drill
core samples during a field campaign to the Campbellrand Platform in South
Africa and make hundreds of new sulfur isotope measurements on these samples.
Their goal is to create a history of seawater sulfate evolution during this key
moment in earth history.
