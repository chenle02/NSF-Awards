The goal of this program is to develop an innovative approach to galaxy redshift
and distance estimation based on spatial clustering, a new and independent
method. Measuring galaxy distances is fundamental to many investigations in
Cosmology, such as Dark Energy studies. Knowledge of the redshifts of
spectroscopically measured galaxies can be propagated to photometric objects
using information extracted from spatial clustering. Dr. Menard will improve and
generalize this idea to the point of being able to apply it to existing and
future datasets, such as those to be gathered by the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST).

Broader impacts of the work include training of a postdoctoral researcher,
sharing algorithms with the community, development of a graduate course on
modern statistical analysis, and lecturing to Baltimore area high school
students on distances in astronomy.
