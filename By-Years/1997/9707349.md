9707349 Nordell One of the most important decisions that an animal must make
during it's lifetime is determining which individual(s) to choose as a mate.
This decision is often made by the female since she usually incurs the higher
cost in reproduction and is therefore very choosy in her selection of a mate.
The mate will provide genetic material for the offspring and perhaps other
resources as well (such as food, care, defense, etc.) therefore it is important
to choose the best possible individual. How do individuals decide who to mate
with? The mate choice decision involves a decision about which individuals to
reject and which individuals to select as mates. This research will address the
question of how individuals assess the quality of potential mates. Prior
theoretical work assumes that females can perfectly assess the quality of
potential mates and that they should mate with the first male whose quality is
greater than the expected quality of future potential males (One-Step decision
rule). However, empirical studies often find that females sample n males and
then select the one of the highest quality (Best-of-n decision rule). One
explanation for the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and observed
behavior is that females can not perfectly assess the quality of potential
mates. This research will specifically address the ability of female guppies to
discriminate between pairs of males that differ only slightly in their quality.
This research will allow a better understanding of the discriminatory ability of
individual female guppies and therefore their mate choice decision process.
Understanding how animals make mate choice decisions is an important aspect of
the management and conservation of species.
