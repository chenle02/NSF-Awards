9704005 Fisher This grant titled "Disorder and Correlations in Low Dimensions"
is to support the theoretical research of a young and a well honored (Waterman
award, among others) PI. He is proposing work on a host of problems, all derived
from the effects one encounters in increasingly smaller devices. More specific,
the research includes work on: (1) transport in quasi 1d systems, incorporating
the novel correlations known as the Luttinger liquid as well as the compounds
that exhibit "high Tc superconductivity, (2) Quantum Hall transport and
tunneling in novel geometries, (3) electron localization transitions in 1-d and
2-d using supersymmetry and numerical methods and finally (4) non-equilibrium
transport in vortex lattices, driven through a random pinning environment. %%%
As the devices become smaller, the physical phenomena become increasingly
sensitive to the effect of coulomb interaction and presence of defects
(disorder). This grant is to support the work of a young, distinguished PI,
recipient of the 1995 Waterman award among other honors. He is proposing
research on phenomena which occur in small dimensions (thin films, wires or
dots) and also involve rather complex mathematics. The selected projects have
applications in cutting edge technology in superconductivity and magnetism. ***
