The primary objectives of this project are to (1) develop and test a
computerized risk-based management model that produces information for hazards
mitigation, planning of water supply system maintenance and repair, and for
establishing long-range strategy and policy concerning system reliability; and
(2) develop and test a technology for expanding the use of the risk management
model to other regions, considering earthquake and other hazards applicable to
the region. Implementation of a two-phased risk management delivery system will
achieve the following objectives. Phase I will develop and test a risk analysis
model in Louisville, Kentucky, and design a university-based risk management
data service to provide updated risk analysis information and continuous
consultation. Phase II will develop and evaluate a technology transfer strategy
targeted for water supply companies located in the seven states that are part of
the Central United States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC). This project, which
will be disseminated to municipal water supply systems, offers several rewards.
It will aid in achieving acceptable performance of water supply systems under
all hazard conditions that have the potential to produce breakdown in the
system. It will provide the opportunity to determine with greater certainty
which elements of the system are subject to breakdown from earthquakes and other
hazardous events.
