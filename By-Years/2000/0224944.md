The project aims to build understanding of the empirical and theoretical links
between the real economy and asset markets. The project considers a number of
specific questions related to the aggregate consumption-wealth link, and focuses
on the importance of macroeconomic indicators for separating permanent from
transitory movements in stock prices and for documenting the extent to which the
conditional mean of stock returns is related to its conditional volatility. The
research also investigates ways in which key asset pricing facts can be
reconciled with a complete business cycle model that preserves the realism of
the model's implications for real variables. The methodology is both empirical
and theoretical. The empirical methodology relies primarily on unit root
econometric techniques to identify the short-run and long-run relations between
various measures of real activity and asset markets, using U.S. aggregate time-
series data. The theoretical methodology builds off of recent insights in both
finance and macroeconomics to study a dynamic, general equilibrium model of the
economy.

Understanding how consumption is related to wealth is fundamental for the
informed conduct of monetary policy and macroeconomic analysis generally, and
for modeling, theoretically, how the real and financial sectors of the economy
are related. As yet, however, there has been little formal empirical analysis of
these relations. Moreover, we cannot hope to understand the volatility and
predictability of asset returns without understanding the sources of
macroeconomic risk that underlie this behavior. The empirical and theoretical
investigations of this research agenda have the potential not only to help
expand the state of knowledge about how consumption, production, investment and
asset prices must be related theoretically, but also to facilitate the search
for macroeconomic determinants of systematic risk factors that must ultimately
govern the behavior of asset prices.
