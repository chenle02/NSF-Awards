The PI has developed an efficient inversion method applicable to both two and
three-dimensional magnetotelluric data called the Rapid Relaxation Inverse
(RRI). The method is iterative and approximates horizontal derivatives of the
electric and magnetic fields with their values from the previous iteration. Then
the inverse problems for the conductivity perturbation beneath each site become
uncoupled from each other and closely related to the 1-D problem. The methoda is
very fast, and computation time grows only linearly with the number of sites of
data inverted. 2-D data for realistic data sets can be inverted on high end
technical workstations. This grant supports further work to resolve certain
computational difficulties, to work on large 2-D problems and extend the method
to realistic 3-D problems.
