A three-day workshop on biothermal engineering is to be held in April, 1990
under the auspices of the University of Illinois. Approximately fifty engineers
and biomedical professionals will listen to presentations and actively
participate in discussions on the following topics: the role of vascular anatomy
in biothermal processes; the effect of blood perfusion on heat and mass
transfer; local and whole body thermal regulation; tissue behavior and injury
during freezing and thawing; tissue behavior and injury during heating;
instrumentation, measurement, and imaging; and applications to hyperthermia,
burns, laser surgery, electro surgery, freezing of tissues, hypothermia, and
cryosurgery. Many significant issues related to heat transfer with biomedical
applications remain unstudied or wholely empirical primarily because of the
complexity of living systems, but also due to cultural differences in the
engineering and biomedical communities. This workshop is to be used to educate
the two distinct professions and to help layout a single, consistent long range
research plan.
