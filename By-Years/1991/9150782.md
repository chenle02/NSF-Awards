A new introductory biology course that begins the training of biology majors and
meets the general education science requirement for non-majors. Significant
biological content is presented within the following pedagogical framework.
First, students are introduced to the fundamental methodological and
philosophical principles of science, including: controlled experiments, analysis
of historical evidence, modeling and simulation, drawing correlations,
statistical inference, and reasoning by analogy. Second, students are introduced
to the history of biology, to provide them with an appreciation for how
scientific discoveries have actually been made, and provide insights into how
contemporary scientists go about their work. Third, students consider the social
context of science, because if students are to think critically about the
important scientific issues of today, they must realize that science interacts
with other social institutions in complex ways. Fourth, students learn about
science by doing science. The laboratory portion of the course is designed to
give students hands-on experience with research techniques. Students learn to
identify research problems, formulate hypotheses, design methods of testing,
analyze assumptions, interpret results, and present findings for peer review.
Fifth, students are given the opportunity to develop the thinking and
communication skills that are the hallmarks of the educated individual. This
framework produces greater understanding of biological concepts and provides
intellectual tools for life-long learning.
