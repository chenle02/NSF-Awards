The Scots Science Scholars (S^3) program is a four-year program designed to
increase retention and graduation rates of underrepresented and first generation
students in STEM majors at Maryville College in Tennessee. The program includes
three vital components designed to retain students in STEM fields to graduation.
(1) The summer bridge program coordinates lab work with mathematical content and
emphasizes discovery learning to prepare students for college-level STEM work.
(2) The specialized first-year curriculum is designed to build community and
provide academic support for the students through common coursework in STEM
disciplines. In particular, the orientation course includes strategies for
success in college level STEM courses, field trips and guest speakers related to
STEM disciplines. (3) The research/leadership experience begins in the first
year and is integrated with the Maryville College core curriculum through
experiential education and the capstone senior study project. Student
participants build leadership skills by acting as mentors, spokespersons and
role models for incoming S^3 students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program
reveals the impact of such efforts on retention of students from
underrepresented groups in STEM majors at a small, liberal arts college with a
majority white population. It also clarifies the significant effects of a bridge
program and undergraduate research separate from the extra attention and
mentoring student participants receive in similar programs at large
universities, since these are part of the Maryville College experience for all
students. S^3 informs the implementation of similar programs at other small
liberal arts colleges.
