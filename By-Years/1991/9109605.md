This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Malinowska's proposed attempt
to clone the gastric apical membrane chloride channel protein. This is the
channel which plays a major role in the secretion of hydrochloric acid into the
stomach by the parietal cell. Dr. Malinowska has a long-standing interest in the
biochemistry and biophysics of parietal cell chloride secretion. In order to
clone the channel, Dr. Malinowska will have to acquire new skills and expertise.
It is anticipated that the successful cloning of the parietal cell chloride
channel will lead to important new insights into the function and regulation of
the channel, and will significantly enhance Dr. Malinowska's career.
