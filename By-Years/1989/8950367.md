This funding supports development of multiple, portable fluids laboratory
stations. These stations provide for measurement of point fluid velocities, flow
rates, and flow energy. In addition, calibration of flow meters and complete
energy balances casn be accomplished, including electrical energy generated via
an air turbine. An existing turbofan system using a hot wire anemometer was
modified by adding a computerized data acquisition system. This computerized
system, including graphical displays, significantly improves the educational
program by allowing wide ranging parametric analyses by students within the
normal time alloted for fluids experiments. Experience gained is to be shared
with the educational community via the Engineeiring Education literature. This
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
