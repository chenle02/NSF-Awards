1604728 &lt;br/&gt;Zhang, Kechun &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, glycolysis
and the pentose phosphate pathway are the standard metabolic routes for sugar
assimilation. However, their lengthy reaction steps and complex regulation limit
yield and production rate of a variety of bioproducts. The objective of this
proposal is to apply metabolic engineering techniques to implement a pathway for
the direct conversion of sugars into intermediates of the citric acid cycle.
This will improve the carbon yield of a variety of products and improve their
manufacturing processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With higher theoretical carbon
yield and shorter reaction routes than the conventional glycolysis and pentose
phosphate pathways, this new non-phosphorylative metabolism has the potential
for efficient biosynthesis of citric acid cycle derivatives. Although this
pathway has been known for more than fifty years, the relevant enzymes remain
largely unknown and uncharacterized. To enable the implementation of
nonphosphorylative metabolism as a general biosynthetic platform, three specific
aims will be pursued: (i) discover and evolve new gene clusters for
nonphosphorylative metabolism; (ii) explore biosynthetic applications of non-
phosphorylative metabolism; and (iii) co-utilize lignocellulosic feedstocks for
biosynthesis. The successful realization of this project is expected to result
in the fundamental understanding of a novel catabolic pathway which promises to
be more efficient in many practical applications. In addition, this project will
enable the processing of non-food agricultural byproducts, such as corn stover,
wheat straw and citrus peel, into high-value products. The proposed new pathway
will enhance the economic viability of cellulosic biorefineries which would be
of significant social, environmental, and economic
value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical
