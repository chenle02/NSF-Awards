0405152&lt;br/&gt;Koralov&lt;br/&gt; The project concerns several closely
related problems in the theory of parabolic partial differential equations and
in random transport. The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of
solutions to the parabolic Anderson problem, the solutions to the equation of
the evolution of a magnetic field in a random flow, and a variety of
probabilistic aspects of transport phenomena. For the Anderson problem the study
focuses on the equations with random time-dependent potential. In the scalar
case this problem can be looked upon as a scalar model for the equation of the
evolution of the magnetic field in a random flow. In the vector case the
Anderson model is related to passive transport by random flows, which is also a
subject of the current project. The study of transport phenomena is concerned
with the long-time behavior of ensembles of points as well as connected sets
under the action of a large class of physically relevant flows. &lt;br/&gt; Most
of the proposed problems arise naturally in the study of various physical
phenomena in meteorology, oceanography, and the theory of turbulence. In
particular, when studying passive transport, one assumes that certain properties
of the media are known (for example, while the temperatures or velocities on the
surface of the ocean can not be measured in every single point exactly, certain
statistical information is assumed to be available). The problem then consists
of trying to predict the long-time behavior of a passive scalar (such as an oil
spill carried by the currents on the surface of the ocean) based on the
statistical properties of the underlying media. Several such problems can be
formulated in relatively simple terms, yet the solutions are very non-trivial,
and at times surprising. &lt;br/&gt;
