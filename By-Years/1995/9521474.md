9521474 Warner In this project the principal investigator will measure
distributions of dissolved Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as part of an Australian
expedition along the continental shelf and slope region of Antarctica between 80
degrees East and 165 degrees East. The cruise, on the Australian vessel Aurora
Australis, consists of eight transects of the shelf/slope region between 63
degrees South and the Antarctic coast, a region which is a significant source of
bottom waters to the Antarctic Bottom Water complex. Several important goals of
this project include studies of the formation and circulation of deep water off
of Adelie Land, the pathways of Ross Sea Bottom Water flow, and the interaction
of slope water with Circumpolar Deep Water.
