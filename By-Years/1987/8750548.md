Student-originated projects involving scientific experimentation are a key
component of the introductory natural science and biology courses required as a
part of Edgewood's general degree curriculum. Environmental biology is an area
popular with non-science majors. The goal of this project is to expand the
experience in scientific problem solving that the College can provide such
students. Approximately 75% of the undergraduates who will benefit from this
project are female, and a large proportion) approximately 30%) are teacher
education majors. Using controlled environment chambers acquired through this
project, students will be able to mount experiments in plant growth, plant-
herbivore interactions and other aspects of environmental biology which require
the ability to control such parameters as light intensity, light/dark
periodicity, humidity, atmospheres and temperatures. The Department's ability to
support controlled experiments in these areas should produce not only expanded
experimental capabilities, but also increased interest and enthusiasm on the
part of students and, most importantly, a better understanding on their part of
the process of scientific inquiry.
