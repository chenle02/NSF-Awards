This Science in Developing Countries award will support travel and equipment
expenses for Stanley Lindstedt of Northern Arizona University, in joint research
with Roland Favier of the Instituto Boliviano de Biologia de Altura, D.
Desplanches of France, and Hans Hoppeler, B. Kayser, and G. Ferretti of
Switzerland. The project aims to study the physiological adaptation of human
respiratory muscles at high altitude. The researchers will examine strength and
endurance in these muscles after chronic, high- intensity, whole-body training
designed to elicit potent hypoxic, exercise hyperpnea. They will test the
hypothesis that respiratory muscles, unlike other engaged skeletal muscles, do
not exhibit increased strength and endurance during pure exercise training, but
that an additional stress, hypoxia, is also required for this effect. The
project will increase understanding of respiratory muscles' adaptability. The
Bolivian side will benefit from learning research methodologies in which the
U.S. and other participants have developed expertise. The U.S. side will gain
from conducting the study with subjects at a high- latitude site.
