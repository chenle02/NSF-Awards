This project, supported by the NSF Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program, develops computational methods for the study of Born Oppenheimer
breakdown in excited electronic states, and their application to the study of
photochemical pathways. Methods using analytic energy derivatives for
multiconfiguration self-consistent field (MCSCF) wavefunctions are employed to
locate low energy surface crossings and avoided crossings. The theory is applied
to the study of spin-forbidden, non-adiabatic processes relevant to gas lasers
and atmospheric chemistry such as photodissociation of ozone, at wavelengths
below 310 nm, to produce both singlet and triplet products. The central goal of
this research is the development of the quantum mechanical theory of elementary
chemical reactions of molecules in electronically excited states, usually
resulting from the absorption of light of an appropriate frequency. An important
feature of these photochemical reactions is the fact that these excited
molecules can jump from one electronic state to another with a concomitant
transfer of energy between electronic, vibrational, and translational degrees of
freedom. This theoretical research project provides deeper insight into such
molecular processes revealed by spectroscopic and kinetic experiments. This
project develops basic theoretical tools widely applicable to photochemical
processes, in particular, to computer models of ozone depletion in the
atmosphere.
