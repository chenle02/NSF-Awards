The first conference on Protein Phosphatases will be held under the auspices of
the Federal of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) Ausust 5-10,
1990 in Copper Mountain, Colorado. As usual, participation will be limited to
150 scientists (including speakers and moderators), selected on the basis of
their expertise and interest in this area and their expected contribution to the
success of this program. It will be the first meeting entirely devoted to
Protein Phosphatases: their structure, function, regulation at the protein and
genetic level and role in the control of cellular processes as they occur in
health and disease. The Conference will consist of nine sessions, each with four
speakers and a discussion leader; selected among investigators who have made
seminal contributions to this field. In addition, poster sessions will be held
that will provide an opportunity for more junior participants to present their
data and discuss them with authorities in the field. This meeting will bring to
light the sum of evidence now indicating the crucial role Protein Phosphatases
are playing in such physiological processes as cell cycle, growth,
differentiation and transformation.
