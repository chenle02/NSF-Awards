ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23 July 2012&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1219610&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota Duluth&lt;br/&gt;PI: R.
Ricketts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests one Shipboard Scientific
Support Equipment (SSSE) item for the R/V BLUE HERON; namely up-grades to the
vessel?s winch wire monitoring system. This item will enhance safety on deck and
provide greatly improved science support
capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The University of Minnesota
supports federally-funded scientific research on the Great Lakes and routinely
exposes graduate and undergraduate students to the marine sciences. The R/V BLUE
HERON is scheduled to complete over 30 NSF sponsored days in 2012.
