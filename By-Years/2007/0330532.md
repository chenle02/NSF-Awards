ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0330532&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to
bring together every one or two years leading members of the scientific
community, along with post doctoral fellows and graduate students, to discuss
new and exciting research in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In
2003, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August
10-15, 2003 at the Tilton School in New Hampshire to discuss research activities
in the following areas: (1) the global carbon cycle and anthropogenic invasion;
(2) how N and P cycles drive the ocean carbon cycle; (3) oceanic changes,
climate variation and the marine carbon cycle; (4) the nature of marine organic
carbon flux; (5) organic carbon production and cycling in the upper ocean; (6)
carbon fluxes through the water column; (7) marine organic carbon cycling in the
seabed; (8) hydrothermal vent chemistry; and (9) technological advances in
marine carbon cycling.. The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an
important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine
chemistry and forge new scientific alliances. For this reason the National
Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor
the participation of 15 graduate students and 25 invited speakers in the 2003
Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research
Conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
