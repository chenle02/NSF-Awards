9711377 Walker This grant provides $100,000 as two-years partial salary support
for a technician to oversee operations and maintenance, train new users and
develop new geochemical techniques utilizing the thermal ionization mass
spectrometers (TIMS) in the Isotope Geochemistry Lab (IGL) at the University of
Maryland. This is a Phase II grant for technical support under the IF/EAR
program Continued support of a highly qualified scientist, Dr. Sonia Esperanca,
in this technical position is fully warranted and her added expertise provides
this group with a great deal of added scientific motivation for further
development of difficult chemical separation and mass spectrometric techniques
for the analysis of lithium isotopes and osmium isotopes in the Re/Os system.
The development of techniques in the Re/Os system has already brought
significant contributions to our understanding of the early geochemical
differentiation of the Earth and new developments in the use of lithium isotopes
as tracers of fluid flow in magmatic, hydrothermal and groundwater systems holds
future promise. Lastly, the addition of a new faculty member this summer, Dr
Christina Gallup, brings new expertise in uranium series dating and trace
element analyses in coral skeletons as paleoclimatic indicators. ***
