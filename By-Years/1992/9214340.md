The proposal requests funds form the Academic Research Infrastructure Program
for replacement animal research and support facilities for the Psychology
Department within the Division of Natural Sciences in our Natural Science
Learning and Research Center. Appropriate space for students and faculty will be
provided. This space will contain a behavioral neuroscience research laboratory;
a learning and conditioning research laboratory; the animal colony which
contains areas for animal holding and quarantine, cage wash, food and bedding
storage, waste holding/janitor's closet, storage, animal preparation, and a
procedure room. Improved research space for faculty and student's research
projects, in particular with the addition of Psychology 400/401 Directed
Research (Undergraduate Thesis in Psychology) and the increase in
student/faculty research over the past three years, will provide students and
faculty with the kind of research facility they require to fully engage in
mammalian research in the scientific study of psychology.//
