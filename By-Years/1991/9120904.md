During development of the nervous system, newly generated cells must extend
processes over substantial distances to establish contacts with their correct
target cells. A central issue in developmental neurobiology is to understand how
these processes navigate accurately through the embryo. At the tips of extending
processes are growth cones that detect guidance information and, on the basis of
this information, orient the direction of process extension. A unique culture
system of the exposed grasshopper embryo limb in combination with high-tech
imaging will be used to visualize the growth cones of growing neurons and study
molecular mechansims involved in growth cone steering. Specifically, the role of
actin molecules in growth cone steering will be investigated through the use of
fluorescent probes and laser photobleaching techniques. Experimental
manipulation of actin in situ will shed light on the relationships of actin to
other cytoskeletal components and cell-substrate interactions.
