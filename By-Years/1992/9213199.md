Nerve cells communicate with each other and with muscle cells at specialized
regions called synapses. The transmitting cell is capable of converting an
electrical signal into the release of a chemical signal, and the receiving cell
responds to this chemical signal. Ion channels are membrane proteins that are
essential both for sending and receiving these signals. The sodium channel is an
ion channel permeable only to sodium ions and is concentrated in muscle membrane
at the neuromuscular junction. Patch clamp electrophysiology confocal microscopy
of sodium channels labeled with tagged antibodies, and molecular techniques will
be used to study the development and regulation of sodium channels at the rat
neuromuscular junction. In addition, experiments will be done to identify
molecules, possibly released by the nerve, that are responsible for the
aggregation and immobilization of sodium channels at the synapse. These studies
will provide fundamental information on the development and regulation of
molecules critical to synaptic transmission and neuromuscular function.
