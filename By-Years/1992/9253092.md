Although most of the early events immediately following fertilization are
carried out by maternal factors, the sperm can play a critical role in these
early events by triggering egg activation, contributing a centrosome, and
specifying one of the embryonic axes. However, the identity and function of
these paternal factors involved in egg activation and early development remain
unclear since the preliminary biochemical studies are controversial. The
objective of this project is to initiate a genetic analysis of these paternally
acting factors in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Genetic screens will be
carried out identify new paternal effect lethal (pel) mutations and to estimate
the number of genes involved. Phenotypic analysis of these new mutants and of
three previously identified pel mutants (emb-27, and fer-14) will be undertaken
in order to analyze the function of these genes. The most promising mutations
from these studies will be selected for subsequent genetic and molecular
analysis.
