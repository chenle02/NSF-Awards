This proposal is for the travel funds for American attendees of
the&lt;br/&gt;conference ``Kolmogorov and Contemporary Mathematics'', an
International&lt;br/&gt;scholarly meeting to commemorate the Centennial birthday
of A. N.&lt;br/&gt;Kolmogorov -- arguably one of the best mathematicians of the
20th&lt;br/&gt;century. The conference will take place on June 16-21, 2003 in
Moscow,&lt;br/&gt;Russia and is expected to draw 600-800 participants from
around the world.&lt;br/&gt;Organized by the Russian Academy of Science and
Moscow State University,&lt;br/&gt;the Kolmogorov's Centennial Conference will
be one of the largest and&lt;br/&gt;most important gatherings of mathematicians
in 2003. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will cover many areas of
mathematics and Plenary Talks&lt;br/&gt;will be given by prominent
mathematicians in these areas. It is&lt;br/&gt;therefore, expected that the
conference will have a great impact on many&lt;br/&gt;areas of current active
research in mathematics and its applications in&lt;br/&gt;various areas of
science.
