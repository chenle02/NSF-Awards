This proposal on "Subsurface Flow and Transport Simulation" between Dr. William
G. Gray of the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Anton Leijnse of the National
Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The
Netherlands, is approved by NSF and the U.S.- Netherlands Cooperative Science
Program. This research will improve our ability to describe the flow of water in
the subsurface and the movement of chemicals in that water using numerical
simulation procedures. The flow is difficult to describe accurately when the
subsurface geologic formation is inhomogeneous or when the concentration of
contaminants is so high that it affects the fluid density. The computational
techniques to be implemented here will improve this description by automatically
refining the computational grid in the vicinity of these complex regions. The
work will be done cooperatively with basic theory and algorithms being the
primary responsibility of researchers at the University of Notre Dame and
testing and implementation for field situations performed by researchers at the
Netherlands Department of Public Health and Environmental Protection.
