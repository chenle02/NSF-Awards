Understanding geographic information systems (GIS) and techniques of
environmental simulation is important to professional urban planners, especially
in settings where physical planning projects, large and small, are an issue of
public importance. Planners are often expected by both public officials and
community groups to assess critically GIS analyses and computer-generated
simulations offered in support of and in opposition to proposed projects.
Understanding how primary spatial data are collected for proposals at all scale
levels is an increasingly important professional skill. Through this project,
the School of Planning purchases a differential global positioning system (DGPS)
and digital electronic transit to provide direct instruction to its
undergraduate planning students in primary spatial data collection in courses on
planning design, site planning, GIS, and environmental simulation. The purpose
of this instruction is to prepare the school's graduates with a technological
skill that is important in both professional and public policy terms.
