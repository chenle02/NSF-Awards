9355495 Jensen Evidence has been obtained that L-phenylalanine is formed in
several spatial compartments in higher plant cells (Jensen, USA). Secondary
metabolism converts phenylalanine to lignin precursors via enzymes which are
spatially sequestered as well (Osipov, Russia). The coordinated regulation of
these enzyme systems and mechanism for integrating the overall network will be
studied. ***
