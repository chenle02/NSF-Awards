9515169 Niou Alliances play a central role in international relations theory. In
the realist view, "the historically most important manifestation of the balance
of power . . . is to be found . . .in the relations between one nation or
alliance and another alliance." (Morgentahu, 1949) Two lines of research have
been developed: the first emphasizes inter-allkiance competition, studying
conditions under which an alliance system is stable, assuming that alliances are
unitary actors and that cvollective action problems among allies do not arise;
the second focuses on intr-alliance collective action problems, assuming that
external threats do not exist or can be kept constant. The study of inter-
alliance competiion is not complete without the consideration of intra-alliance
collective action problems, and the study of collective action problems within
an alliance must also consider the severity of external threats. The purpose of
this project is to study alliance politics by developing a game theoretic
framework that incorporates both inter-alliance competition and intra-alliance
competition in the context of international relations. This extension involves
finding the core in which no alternative grouping of allies can do better.
Specifically, the researchers are interested in the following questions: Are
large countries exploited by small countries in both strong and weak alliances?
When the number of allies increases, does the level of provision of public goods
within the alliance decrease? If countries may choose which alliances to join,
does a stable coalition structure exist? Are countries more likely to balance or
bandwagon? Can grand coalitions ever be stable? This study will provide an
opportunity to understand alliance politics from a different vantage point. For
example, the initial exploration of this period by the investigator several
years ago sometimes helps him question the truthfulness of conventional wisdom.
An in-depth study of this period will allow the inv estigators to conduct a
comparative study of the Chinese and European alliance. ***
