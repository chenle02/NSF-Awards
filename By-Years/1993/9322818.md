9322818 Lawson The objective of this (Phase II) research is to design, build and
test an airborne digital holographic instrument for imaging cloud drops and ice
crystals. This technique will provide an explicit measurement of liquid water in
clouds, as well as the size and shape of small ice crystals, which are needed to
determine the optical properties of cirrus clouds. ***
