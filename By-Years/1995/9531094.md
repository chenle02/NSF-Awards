This project involves an investigation of plasma wave phenomena which play an
important role in the nergization of ions and electrons in the topside
ionosphere. A new mechanism that enables the transfer of wave energy from large-
scale waves to small-scale waves is of particular interest. The small-scale
waves have been observed to be associated with elevated ion temperatures and
intense field-aligned electron fluxes. The recent Freja satellite observations
together with preliminary theoretical results indicate a causal relationship
between the transfer of Alfven wave energy to ion acoustic waves and the heating
of ions together with parallel electron acceleration. The primary goal of this
project will be to identify and characterize the underlying mechanisms of energy
transfer from waves to particles. The study involves a combination of analysis,
numerical simulation and comparison to spacecraft data to ascertain physical
characteristics of the phenomena as well as their geophysical relevance.
