This project will systematically examine the relationships between fires in
tropical environments and their corresponding stratigraphic signals, in the form
of particulate carbon in sediments of lakes, bogs, and caves (charcoal
stratigraphy). The customary methods for determining charcoal content of
sediments will be compared for precision, accuracy, and speed with a new method
being developed utilizing automated digital image analysis. Sedimentary charcoal
parameters (concentration, influx, type, practice size distribution) will be
measured in about 200 modern sediment samples collected in previous projects
from an array of sites ranging from 43 N to 25 S, including deserts,
rainforests, tropical savannas, temperate forest, cultivated areas, and montane
environments. Charcoal parameters will be compared with ecological data on the
sites (basin type and size vegetation, climate, and local/regional fire
occurrence). This information will be used to interpret fire histories derived
from laminated sediment cores collected form Madagascar. Kenya/Tanzania, and
Puerto Rico. Preliminary dating and other analyses indicate that these cores can
be expected to yield detailed fire histories for the sites spanning several
millennia. This time-series data on prehistoric fires will provide insights
concerning terrestrial carbon inputs to the pre- modern atmosphere, human
impacts on prehistoric environments and linkages between climate, fore , and
vegetation.
