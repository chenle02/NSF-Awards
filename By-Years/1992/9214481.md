The objective of this Research Planning Grant is to obtain precise, steady-
state estimates of the variance of the sample mean from simulation output data.
A new inference technique is proposed for estimating the variance by augmenting
existing estimators and their performance. The research effort includes
theoretical development of the techniques and empirical studies in comparison
with other estimators to benchmark performance. The long-term goal of the
required follow-up study is the design of an automatic run length control system
for steady state simulation studies. This research is anticipated to make
theoretical and practical contributions to the knowledge base of computer
simulation experiment analysis.
