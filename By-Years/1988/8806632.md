This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Takeshi Udagawa, Department of
Physics, University of Texas, to pursue with Dr. Byung-Taik Kim, Department of
Physics, Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea, for a period of 24 months, a
program of research in theoretical nuclear physics dealing primarily with
inelastic scattering. In their experiments a target bound nucleon is first
knocked out to an unbound orbit. The nucleon may then escape from the target
(knockout) or be recaptured by the target (knockout-fusion). In previous
research the collaborators have developed a theoretical approach to evaluate the
cross sections of these inelastic nuclear reactions, fitting well some of the
available data. In the present research, they will improve the theory so that
inelastic cross sections may be calculated in both bound and unbound regions on
the same basis. Having developed the theoretical basis for understanding
knockout-fusion nuclear processes, the collaborators will introduce the
necessary modifications, and Dr. Kim will develop a computer program for
carrying out numerical calculations. This computer program will be installed on
the Cray X-MP computer at the University of Texas and tested. Actual
calculations will be made by researchers at the University of Texas. This
project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science
Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean
scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,
skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
The U.S. and Korean collaborators are highly respected scientists with extensive
research experience and productive publication records in the field of the
proposal. They have collaborated successfully in the past.
