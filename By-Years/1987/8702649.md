This research is aimed at investigating a perceptual model for representing
information in speech based on spectral shape factors of short-time speech
spectra. Spectral shape factors are defined as the low-ordered components of a
cosine basis vector expansion of speech spectra. The primary objective of the
proposed research is to determine whether spectral shape factors are fundamental
information-bearing parameters for speech, or whether they are merely a
convenient method for encoding speech spectra. For both vowels and stop
consonants, a perceptual model which is based on spectral shape factors will be
directly contrasted with a perceptual model which is based primarily on the
peaks in the spectrum. In both cases experiments will be conducted to determine
the extent to which coustic invariance in the speech signal can be represented
by spectral shape factors. This research will not only contribute to a
fundamental understanding of the information-encoding process in speech, but
also has the potential for aiding automatic speech recognition research and work
in the area of sensory substitution for the hearing impaired.
