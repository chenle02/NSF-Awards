This action provides funds for continued research in elementary particle
physics by a group at the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics, University
of California, Santa Cruz. The group will construct and operate major portions
of a Cerenkov Ring Imaging Detector for incorporation into the Large Detector
(SLD) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. This research will exploit the
advances in instrumental techniques in such detectors made by this and other
groups over the last three years. It will culminate in the full utilization of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center linear collider's capabilities to explore
the physics of the Zo particle and of other physical processes extant at these
energies. In particular, this device adds to the SLD the capability to separate
emerging particles by type (mass) over virtually the entire spectrum of energies
expected. This in turn allows deeper analysis of the physics which dictated that
such particles would result from electron-positron annihilation. It is believed
that a modern detector without such capability would not be competitive in the
physics of this energy range.
