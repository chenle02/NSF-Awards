AST-9528860 Martha Haynes Terry Herter Kinematics, Dynamics and Star Formation
in Galaxy Disks and Their Implication on Distance Indicators. Drs. Haynes and
Herter will continue a study of the properties of disk galaxies and the
implications of the derived properties on distance indicators. The work covers
four basic areas. They will complete a comprehensive study of spiral galaxies
which includes over 500 neutral hydrogen spectra and I band images and 350
optical rotation curves in 11 clusters of galaxies in the local universe. They
will investigate the detailed distribution and kinematics of stars and gas
within a sample of non- interacting, spiral galaxies in the local supercluster
with radio and optical observations. They will continue an investigation of the
star formation process in the disks of spiral and irregular galaxies through
optical and radio-wavelength observations. And they will continue to study
starburst galaxies using infrared and optical observations.
