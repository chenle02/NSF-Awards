This three-year grant will support research by a faculty member, a Senior
Research Associate and three graduate students to investigate the structure of
heavy nuclei excited by Coulomb excitation reactions using heavy ion beams. The
research makes use of the large gamma ray detector array, Gammasphere, which is
presently located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During the period of
this grant this facility will be moved to the ATLAS facility at Argonne National
Laboratory to take advantage of other beams available there. Using NSF funds,
the Rochester group has constructed a 4-pi charged particle detector (Compact
Heavy Ion Counter) which can be used together with Gammasphere to considerably
enhance its utility for these measurements. Partial support will be provided by
the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), as part of an enabling
initiative in instrumentation development, to provide for the modifications
needed to CHICO in order to use it at ATLAS and for needed computer hardware for
data analysis. The Rochester group will continue using the methods already
developed in their past research to exploit these new opportunities.
