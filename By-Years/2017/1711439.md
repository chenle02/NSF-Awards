The proposed research work focuses on a number of open problems and developing
programs on canonical metrics in Kahler geometry, geometric flows, and complex
Monge-Ampere equations in relation to geometry and physics. Recent progress and
influx of new ideas have unraveled a deep, rich, and unifying structure among
analysis, partial differential equations, complex Riemannian geometry, and
algebraic geometry. The project also aims to bring in research and teaching
innovation in mathematics from various disciplines and have an immediate
beneficial effect on undergraduate and graduate students at Rutgers as well as
in the regional mathematical community. The principal investigator will continue
to organize and participate in the integrated research/education programs and
activities that will promote the education level of the nation. Furthermore, the
principal investigator plans to disseminate the exciting frontier research at
the interface of analysis and geometry to a broad audience through lectures and
survey papers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects will investigate canonical
metrics of Einstein type on Kahler varieties with mild singularities. In
particular, the principal investigator will study the Riemannian geometric
properties of such singular metrics and analytic moduli problems for Kahler-
Einstein manifolds. The PI will continue to make progress in the analytic
minimal model program with Ricci flow by studying both the finite time and long
time formation of singularities of the Kahler-Ricci flow on algebraic varieties.
Such singularity formation is reflected by canonical geometric surgeries
equivalent to birational transformations and should be understood through global
and local metric uniformization. The PI willy employ new theories and techniques
from L^2-theory, nonlinear PDEs and Cheeger-Colding theory. The research will
develop new tools and give profound insights and understanding of topological,
geometric and algebraic structures of complex spaces.
