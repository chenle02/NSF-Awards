9451512 Porter Computational science is becoming an integral part of science,
but is rarely treated from a balanced interdisciplinary perspective in
undergraduate curricula. This project by the departments of computer science,
mathematics, and physics develops an an interdisciplinary course in
computational science at Furman University. Students in this course are divided
into teams, composed of of one student from each of the three departments
involved. Each team selects a physical system, develops a mathematical model of
it, and constructs an algorithm culminating in the computer simulation complete
with sophisticated visualization tools used to display the output. The finished
projects will reach a wider audience in that they will become a basis for
demonstrations and laboratory exercises for other courses. Other disciplines,
including non-science majors, will eventually become part of the projects.
