9553030 Deng This is a NSF Presidential Faculty Fellow Award. Through
photosynthesis, light provides the energy source for plants and, ultimately, for
all living organisms. In response to a fluctuating environment, nonmotile plants
are able to sense varying light signals and to optimize growth and development.
Higher plants possess sophisticated photosensory and largely uncharacterized
signal transduction and itegration systems to monitor the direction, quantity
and quality of light signals and to adjust their growth and development
accordingly. This award will enable Dr. Deng to pursue those research directions
which are important to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of light
control of plant development, and to explore new research directions as science
dictates. As a Presidential Faculty Fellow, Dr. Deng is expected to be involved
in the training of the next generation of scientists and in activities that will
increase scientific literacy of undergraduate student populations.
