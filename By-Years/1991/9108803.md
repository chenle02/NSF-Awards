The main goal of the proposed research is to perform numerical simulations in
the field of high Tc superconductivity on the massively parallel Connection
Machine, CM-2. The dynamical properties of the strongly correlated electronic 2D
Hubbard model will be investigated, focussing on the two central issues of high
Tc theory, does the ground state have long range superconducting order?, and
what is the nature of the normal state? The simulations will be carried out with
codes using both exact and stochastic techniques. The study of the performance
of the different codes using this machine architecture, should yield a
substantial improvement in our understanding, not only of the physical problem,
but also of data-parallel programming.
