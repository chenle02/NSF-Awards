This proposal seeks to establish an NSFNET connection to the University of
Puerto Rico. This is part of a comprehensive plan to improve organized research
in science and technology throughout the Island which has received support from
the NSF sponsored Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR). The prime objective is to provide a link to NSFNET for researchers at
the Rio Piedras, Mayaguez, and Medical Science Campuses of the UPR, and the
National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center at the Arecibo Observatory. The
connection will also provide access to and promote the development of linkages
with major research and academic networks on the mainland. Access to NSFNET will
be eventually expanded to all researchers on the Island as well as other
Caribbean institutions. The NSF funding will supply seed money to purchase
gateway equipment for each node and a satellite link to the mainland connected
to an appropriate NSFNET Backbone Node. The University will provide for network
operations and information services for the intra-Island network - UPRENET. ***
