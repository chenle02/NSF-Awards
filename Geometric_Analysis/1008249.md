The principal investigator plans to continue his study of the analytic torsion
and its application in differential and algebraic geometry. He will study the
higher dimensional version of the BCOV conjecture on Calabi-Yau moduli. He will
also study analytical properties of torsion invariants, with emphasis on those
related to the extremal metric problems. This project should give insight on the
new construction and better understanding of the torsion invariant and its role
in the study of the Calabi-Yau moduli and the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture.

Torsion invariants have appeared in high energy physics theories and actually
are crucial components of N=2 Super Conformal Field Theory. The proposed study
will shed new light on understanding Mirror Symmetry, which is a developing
branch in current theoretical physics. Interaction with fellow mathematicians
and physicists is expected and will be necessary for the success of this
research project. The principal investigator is actively engaged in
undergraduate and graduate level education. He will continue to encourage more
people, especially women and minorities, to study mathematics. He will
participate in the integrated research and education activities that will
promote the education level of the nation.
