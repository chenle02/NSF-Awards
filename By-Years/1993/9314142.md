Wilson 9314142 This project will refine the Cenozoic paleomagnetic lime scale to
minimize noise and remove spurious synchroneities in plate-pair rate changes
which are produced by the currently-accepted scheme. This will be accomplished
by (I) using plate-pairs with faster rates, permitting more precise age
estimates, for time intervals with independent evidence that no rate changes
occurred; (2) noise will be removed by calculating rotation angles rather than
average distances; (3) ages will be determined from multiple plate pairs. The
result will be an improved time scale which will be widely used in geologic
studies, both continental and marine.
