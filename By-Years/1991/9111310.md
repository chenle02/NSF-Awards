The purpose of the research is to study the feasibility of nanocrystalline
Nb3A1 formation by mechanically alloying elemental powders. Nb3A1 intermetallic
was chosen for its highest temperature capability among structural aluminides as
well as for its high current density property as a superconductor. The appeal of
mechanical alloying for the synthesis of Nb3A1 intermetallics stems from its
capability to make alloys with controlled microstructure via solid-state
processing. This is particularly important for Nb and A1 which have large
differences in melting points and densities thereby causing conventional melting
techniques to be difficult, hazardous and less controllable. In addition,
mechanical alloying has the potential of obtaining very fine grain sizes,
eventually in the nanometer range that hold the promise for properties greatly
exceeding those of conventionally processed intermetallic compounds. The main
benefit of nanostructure processing -superplasticity- is more rewarding for
intermetallics that are usually known for their complete lack of ductility and
formability. Consequently, the benefits of Nb3A1 as a very high temperature
resistant, relatively less dense and oxidation resistant material may be fully
used in industrial and aerospace applications. These alloys are extremely
interesting in both superconducting and in aerospace/structural applications and
could be widely used if their ductility could be improved.
