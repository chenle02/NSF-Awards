Professor Vakilian's project involves a number of problems in statistical
mechanics. One set deals with the specific heat for layered aperiodic Ising
models. The solution of this problem could lead to the discovery of a new phase
of matter intermediate between random and quasicrystalline forms. Additional
problems deal with trace maps of aperiodic dynamical systems and one-dimensional
aperiodic Schrodinger operators. The general area of research of Professor
Vakilian is mathematical physics. In this research project, the principal
investigator will concentrate on the mathematical aspects of models of matter
which are not regular but not completely random. This type of matter is typified
by the quasicrystalline forms recently found in nature.
