While recent years have seen remarkable progress in programming, both
theoretically and practically, most of that progress has come in the solution of
pure 0/1 problems. On the other hand, mixed problems, problems with both
continuous and discrete variables-- usually 0/1 variables--dominate in practice;
moreover, practitioners regularly produce instances of these models that cannot
be solved using currently available codes. This combination of success in
solving pure 0/1 problems and the existing demand for methods to solve difficult
real-world mixed problems has received considerable attention in the research
community. Nevertheless, general-purpose mixed-integer solvers remain primarily
solvers, and while they often employ rather sophisticated ``heuristic'' devices,
they still use few of the algorithmic ideas implicit in recent theoretical
developments. This research will attempt to change that situation by developing
a research code including both the standard methods that have been successful in
practice, as well as incorporating ideas based upon recent theoretical
developments. The focus will be on actually solving real-world instances that
arise as general mixed integer programs but cannot currently be solved.
