0111090 &lt;br/&gt;Izpisua Belmonte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vertebrate eye is a
highly complex structure that is induced early in development by two different
tissue layers. Various proteins have been shown to be involved in this process.
Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-b superfamily of secreted
proteins, which have been shown to be crucial for correct vertebrate eye
development. In the absence of BMP-signalling eyes fail to develop and/or are
dramatically reduced in size. Experimentally induced over-activation of BMPs
change the structure and pattern of the eye. A newly described regulator of BMP-
signalling is BAMBI, an inhibitor of BMP-signaling. BAMBI is active wherever
BMPs are functional and represents an important component in the regulation of
BMP activity. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the function of BAMBI
in mouse eye development by genetically mutating and thereby abolishing the
function of BAMBI. The second goal of this proposal will be to abolish the
function at later stages during development, and thus study the function of
BAMBI in adult eyes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of the extracellular
modulation of BMP-signaling during eye development may eventually lead to
uncover a new set of interactions that are relevant for normal eye development.
In addition, the results obtained in mice are likely to stimulate research for
possible genetic alterations related to BMP-signaling in humans with congenital
eye malformations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
