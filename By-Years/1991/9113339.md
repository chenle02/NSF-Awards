This award provides one-half the funding necessary for the acquisition of an
electron microprobe analysis system that will be installed in the Geophysical
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The Carnegie Institution
is committed to providing the remaining funds for this acquisition. The electron
microprobe system will be used primarily in research projects by the staff of
the Geophysical Laboratory and the neighboring Department of Terrestrial
Magnetism. The rapid and quantitative chemical analysis of major elements and
many trace elements in solids, with a spatial resolution in the range of
microns, is essential in a wide spectrum of research in experimental and
observational petrology, mineral physics, and crystallography undertaken at
these two campuses of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
