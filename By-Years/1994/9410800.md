9410800 Liu This research seeks to develop new methods to solve the Navier-
Stokes equations using advanced two-equation turbulence models. These new
methods will permit the prediction of unsteady aerodynamic loads and hence will
have applications in the design of turbines and compressors. Current knowledge
in these areas is based on steady flow models whereas the actual flows are
highly unsteady. The proposed work has both analytical and numerical components
including: development of a flux-limited pressure split dissipation model and
k-w turbulence model, algorithms for massively parallel computers and new
techniques for solving both the Navier Stokes equations and the turbulence
equations. ***
