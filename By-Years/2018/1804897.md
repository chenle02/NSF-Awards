This program will develop a minimally disruptive approach for using light to
control enzymes in living cells. They will pick enzymes of importance in
diabetes, obesity, and cancer to address current gaps in knowledge. They will
develop a summer biotechnology training program for high school students
underrepresented in STEM, They will assist with the establishment of a core
facility for teaching and research in biophotonics, generate publicly accessible
educational resources in biochemical engineering and synthetic biology, and
create research opportunities for high school students and
undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will develop (i) protein architectures
(i.e., designs for protein-protein chimeras) that enable optical control of
phosphorylation-regulating enzymes (i.e., protein tyrosine phosphatases and
protein tyrosine kinases) without interfering with their native patterns of
localization and interaction, and (ii) a set photo-switchable enzymes modulated
by blue, red, and infrared light. They will supply a specific set of tools for
studying the role of signaling networks associated with diabetes, obesity, and
cancer, and develop a general approach for analyzing the contribution of
spatially distinct phosphorylation events to cellular function and
dysfunction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
