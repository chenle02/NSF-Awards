This action is to support a workshop on computational neurobiology. The
workshop is to be held in San Francisco, California, July 23-24, 1991. The
sessions to be held at the workshop will focus on biological issues in neural
networks. Not only will leaders in the field be presenting information relevant
to computational issues surrounding biological neural systems but a pre-
workshop, tutorial session is planned to allow hands-on experience for
mathematicians and theorists as well as for experimentalists. This workshop
includes students and an informal atmosphere in which ideas can be discussed.
