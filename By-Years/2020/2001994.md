This project investigates how pressures and circumstances of global production
and regional development create contrasting regimes of labor migration within a
single society. Using a strategic case, it examines how a variety of state and
non-state actors govern labor migration in relation to global seafood production
and regional economic integration initiatives. By examining the link between
local processes and wider pressures, the project advances social scientific
knowledge of migration governance, the social reproduction of labor, and state
influence vis-Ã -vis regional and global processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data
will be collected through participant observation and interviews. Analysis will
be through comparison of two cases of labor migration regimes: (1) a regime of
regularization that advances a formal guestworker system in an interior site of
seafood production and (2) a regime of flexible containment that maintains
flexible and spatially-confined labor in a regionally-linked border zone.
Interviews will be conducted with local officials and workers about practices in
each site. Workers from another industry, origin, and site will be interviewed
as well to provide comparison.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
