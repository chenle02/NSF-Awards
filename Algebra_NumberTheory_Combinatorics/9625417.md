de Jong 9625417 This proposal plans to investigate one of the fundamental
questions currently being studied in arithmetic geometry, namely the invariance
of certain cohomologically defined invariants using various cohomology theories,
especially l-adic (etale) cohomologies for varying l and p-adic (rigid)
cohomology. The questions to be asked are whether dimensions of certain spaces
are independent of l, whether the eigenvalues of correspondences acting on
certain groups are independent of l, whether the eigenvalues of Frobenius are
independent of l, etc. It is conjectured that the answers to these questions are
all positive. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -
a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
