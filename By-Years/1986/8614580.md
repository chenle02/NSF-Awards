This award is for funds to support research on the investigation of a
mechanistic basis and to develop a model for the microflocculation observed with
the application of ozone as a preoxidant in water treatment practice. The
research will address microflocculation due to preozonation highly on colored,
low alkalinity, low turbidity source waters. The influence of four mechanisms
will be investigated. These are (a) rearrangement of humic material particle
size distributions leading to more efficient coagulation and flocculation, (b)
recombination of humic ozonization degradation products via hydrogen bonding,
(c) oxidation and separation of metals complexed with humic material and their
subsequent action as coagulants, and (d) combination of dissolved bulk solution
metals with complexed metals to act as coagulants or even to precipitate. The
principal investigator is highly qualified to perform the proposed research. A
two year continuing grant is recommended. This award is for $76,100 for the
first year.
