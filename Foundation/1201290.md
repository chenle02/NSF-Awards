The project proposes to bring some recently developed techniques to the study of
countable Borel equivalence relations. These techniques, developed over the last
several years, involve new types of marker structures on the equivalence
relations. For example, these new structures have led to a proof that all orbit
equivalence relations of countable abelian group actions are hyperfinite. An
important goal is to extend the results to larger classes of groups, and to
delineate the extent of hyperfiniteness. A second new method concerns marker
structures on arbitrary countable groups, also referred to as ``blueprints". The
bluprints, for example, give a proof that the Bernoulli shift action of every
countable group has a free subflow. They have also been used to give other
results for general actions, such as results on the complexity of the
topological conjugacy relation. Another goal of this project is to explore the
connections between the possible blueprints that can exist on groups and the
marker structures on the equivalence relations induced by actions of these
groups. It is expected that progress along these lines will improve our
understanding both of actions by special types of groups, and of the nature of
Borel actions for general countable groups.

Countable Borel equivalence relations are fundamental mathematical objects
which occur in many mathematical contexts. Aside from their intrinsic interest,
their theory interacts with other important areas of mathematics such as
dynamics, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory. Thus, work in this area
involves techniques from logic as well as dynamics, combinatorics, and other
areas. Consider an equivalence relation studied by the ancient Greeks, that of
commensurability: two positive real numbers are equivalent if their ratio is
rational. A very basic question about this simple relation was not known until
recently, namely whether it can be described in an effective way as an
increasing union of finite relations. Several natural generalizations of this
question are still open. This project seeks to further develop some of the new
techniques to further the study of these fundamental questions. It is expected
that this study will also make new connections with other areas of mathematics.
