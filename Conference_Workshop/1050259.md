The US-Africa Advanced Study Institute and Workshop Series in Mathematical
Sciences is a collaborative effort between US and African mathematicians. This
program has three main goals: (1) strengthen the US and Southern African human
infrastructure in mathematical sciences research, (2) increase and sustain
research collaboration between US and Southern African mathematicians, and (3)
improve research collaboration between US and Southern African colleges and
universities. The Masamu Project (masamu means mathematics in Southern Africa)
will be an ongoing professional development program that will enhance the
capability of participants to continue to collaborate on research after the
Institute and Workshop.

The 2011 US-Africa Advanced Study Institute will be held in Livingstone, Zambia
on November 21 - December 1, 2011. The Advanced Studies Institute will focus on
analysis, dynamical systems, and mathematical biology, and the follow-on
workshop will center on mathematical modeling of biological systems. For 15
days, 13 US and 13 African advanced graduate students and early career faculty
will undergo rigorous training and will work collaboratively on research under
the supervision and guidance of 9 US, African, and European research
mathematicians. Participants will also attend a panel discussion on careers in
mathematical sciences. Furthermore, heads and chairs from US and Southern Africa
will have an opportunity to attend a one-day workshop that will focus on
cultivating sustained cooperation between and among US and Southern African
Mathematical Sciences Departments.

Funding for this award is being provided by the Division of Mathematical
Sciences, with co-funding from the Office of International Science and
Engineering.
