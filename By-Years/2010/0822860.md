This workshop will honor Dick Lipton?s fundamental insights, in complexity
theory in particular and computer science in general, via a set of plenary
lectures given by some of the most accomplished computer scientists. The
symposium will be held April 27-28, 2008 at Georgia Tech and will be open to the
public. It will primarily consist of invited talks by well-known computer
scientists but will also have a session for contributed talks. We will ask
speakers to submit written surveys related to these talks and compile them into
a single volume. Abstracts, slides, and video will be made available to the
general community via the world wide web. Several eminent computer scientists
have readily agreed to serve on the program committee and come to Atlanta for
the symposium.
