In a multicellular organism, cells signal each other to coordinate gene
expression patterns that dictate growth and development. In plants, cytoplasmic
channels called plasmodesmata form one pathway for cell-cell signaling.
Furthermore, the vascular tissue phloem forms a network of channels to allow
signaling between distant cells or organs. Increasing evidence indicates that
selected RNAs and proteins traffic from cell to cell through plasmodesmata and
from organ to organ through the phloem. RNA traffic appears to have important
roles in plant development, physiology, and defense. This project addresses the
question of how RNA traffic is regulated in a plant, using viroid traffic as a
highly tractable model system. Viroids are small pathogenic RNAs that infect
plants. They do not encode proteins and can replicate and move systemically
within an infected plant. It is likely that viroid RNAs have evolved the
capacity to utilize pre-existing cellular mechanisms to traffic through
plasmodesmata and the phloem. This work has three objectives: 1) testing the
hypothesis that an RNA uses different mechanisms to enter and exit the phloem
during systemic traffic, 2) identifying the cellular boundary that controls
phloem exit of an RNA, and 3) identifying the RNA motif(s) that mediates phloem
exit. Results from this project are expected to yield novel insights about the
RNA structures and cellular factors that are important for intercellular
traffic. Such insights may impact studies on how endogenous plant RNAs traffic
to regulate cellular processes underlying growth and development and how viral
RNAs traffic systemically to spread infection.
