This project continues joint cooperation between the U.S. Geological Survey and
the National Science Foundation in global seismology, and is conducted within
the framework of their Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in seismology. The work
centers around the development and installation of the Incorporated Research
Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) data collection center, and the installation
of new global digital seismic stations. The USGS is working on both aspects in
concert with NSF/IRIS.
