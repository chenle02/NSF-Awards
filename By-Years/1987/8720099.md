This awards provides funds to an outstanding group of biochemists for the
purchase and operation of instruments including a modern high field NMR
spectrometer, an EPR spectrometer, related computing equipment, and equipment
for synthesis and purification of peptides and other molecules. The group will
use the equipment for a variety of studies aimed at elucidating the structures
in solution of small DNAs and of certain proteins and antibiotics, the structure
and dynamics of larger DNAs in solution, and metabolic pathways in some bacteria
and fungi. The development and application of biophysical techniques, in
particular that of EPR and 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, to studies of
structure and behavior of macromolecules like DNA and protein is currently one
of the most exiting areas of biological research. Although NMR instruments have
been available for many years, it is only within the last few years that high
field instruments with the requisite resolution and sensitivity for such studies
have been developed. The Seattle group, which includes both junior and senior
faculty of international reputation, has been at the forefront of these
developments; ;they will continue to play an important role in application of
these instruments to problems of great biological interest.
