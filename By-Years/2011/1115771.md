Existing compilation techniques are unlikely to release the full potentials of
the new many-simple-core architectures, where a processor consists of tens,
hundreds or more cores that do not have fine grain instruction-level-
parallelism. The fundamental reason is that traditional compilation technology
is largely designed to maximize single-thread performance while the same
strategy will likely hinder the realization of the best overall performance when
programs on many-simple-core processors routinely run hundreds or even more
threads. A many-simple-core processor usually delivers the highest performance
when its resource is fully utilized. However, a thread compiled in the
traditional way has all resources at its disposal to maximize its own
performance. When applied to hundreds of threads, the resource requirement adds
up and will create a resource bottleneck that is much more likely than the
performance of single thread to be the main performance issue. More generally
speaking, the question of what is compiler optimization needs to be redefined in
the new context of many-simple-core processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research improves the tradeoff between single-thread performance and overall
resource utilization. The project includes a systematical study of techniques
and strategies that are needed to adapt existing compiler and code optimization
techniques to the new many-simple-core processors, and the development of new
optimization techniques and strategies that are oriented specifically to improve
resource utilization on the new architecture. Specifically, the investigators
study the modeling of shared resource utilization in compiler, compiler
optimizations and code transformations that redefine the profitability analysis
of existing techniques, and optimization strategy that orchestrates the
selection of compiler transformations and their parameter values to "de-
optimize" or "optimize" single thread to improve overall performance.
