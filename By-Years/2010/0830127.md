NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Secure
Wireless Ad-hoc Networking and Sensor Networking Systems
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators at Washington State University will acquire
laboratory equipment for sensor networking research. They will establish a
laboratory with an-hoc network capabilities consisting of several wireless
enabled computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a sensor network
of 50 motes. The PI's will conduct experimental research on topics such as: (i)
detecting misbehavior in ad-hoc networks, (ii) identifying and isolating
malicious nodes in ad-hoc networks, (iii) distinguishing congestion from
misbehavior in ad-hoc networks, (iv) quality of service routing in ad-hoc
networks, (v) secure routing in ad-hoc networks, (vi) energy-efficient
information dissemination in sensor networks, and (vii) receiver initiated MAC
for sensor networks. The infrastructure will allow them to do performance
testing and validation of their research in a realistic testbed. Broader impacts
of the research include addressing the growing applications of sensor networks
in research and societal applications. The facilities will be available for
education and course work, including courses that Washington State University
offers jointly with the nearby University of Idaho in Moscow,
ID.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
