Robotics is undergoing growth in recent years, over a wide range of important
areas, from transportation, to manufacturing, entertainment, space exploration,
health-care and education. While the field is progressing forward, both in
research findings and industrial markets, the percentage of female roboticists
continues to lag far behind their male counterparts. This award supports travel
for ten women robotics researchers to the workshop "Women in Robotics" being
held at the Robot Science and Systems (RSS) 2014 conference. This opportunity is
expected to have a significant effect towards helping them start their career
and establish themselves as young robotics researchers. The workshop plan
includes: (1) a full-day of invited talks by women leaders in the field from
both academia and industry, demonstrating that women can and do play an
important role in the field, (2) a poster session featuring works by junior
researchers, giving them exposure in the community, (3) a panel discussion on
the topic of "steps towards building a successful career in robotics," featuring
women at various stages of their careers, and (4) a networking dinner to provide
time for junior and senior participants have a chance to make real one-on-one
connections. Bringing together women from various disciplines in robotics is
expected to strengthen the community and provides an important opportunity for
networking.
