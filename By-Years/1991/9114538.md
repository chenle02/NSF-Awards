Research aimed at modeling the compaction and early stages of sintering of
powders when a liquid phase coexists with the particulate solid will be
conducted. The study will also shed some light on constitutive modeling of the
mechanical response of materials fabricated using such a technique. To
accomplish these goals, a continuum model will be developed on the basis of some
thermomicromechanical considerations, so that the effects of fabric anisotropy
and interparticle forces are properly accounted for. In addition, the model will
account for the relative sliding of grains during compaction, as well as the
sintering induced distortional and volumetric deformation rates. In parallel
with the development of the continuum model, a discrete material model of
compaction of granular materials will be developed using a linear programming
technique. After validation, this model can be used to verify the hypotheses
made in formulating the continuum model.
