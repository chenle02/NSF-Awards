The object of this work, the study of inverse problems in mathematical
analysis, is one of recovering physical properties of an object or phenomenon
from data obtained by remote observations. The problems are well-posed in the
sense that the data sets are not so burdensome as to rule out any solutions, but
sufficient for the reconstruction. The problem of determining a quantum
mechanical potential from its scattering amplitude goes back to the beginning of
quantum mechanics. But little attention is given to finding data sets for which
the problem is well-posed in the sense that the mapping from the potential to
the scattering data is continuously invertible. One likely candidate for such a
data set is backscattering data, the subject of this research. Much successful
work has been accomplished on the question in three dimensions, though mainly
confined to small potentials. The present work seeks to remove this assumption
and look for more general results, possibly giving up some degree of well-
posedness. Work will continue on two-dimensional backscattering as well, where a
type of singularity in a parameter makes backscattering a much more untractable
problem, even assuming compact support of the potential.Inverse problems in the
context of this project are formulated in terms of classical equations, such as
the Schrodinger equation. These equations may represent wave phenomena involving
magnetic and electric potentials, acoustics and other type of waves in the
presence of obstacles. Although much of the research focuses on the mathematical
analysis of the inverse mapping, its connections with the physical world are
easily traced.
