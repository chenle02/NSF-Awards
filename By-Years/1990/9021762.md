This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP) award from the
Research Facilities Office provides funds to the University of Wisconsin-La
Crosse for the repair and renovation of Cowley Hall which houses research and
research training in aquatic studies. This building was constructed in 1965 and
last renovated in 1974. The ARFMP grant of $120,000 and $128,400 provided by the
grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research
training facilities and thereby enhance the Department of Biology and
Microbiology's comprehensive aquatic research and research training program
which has substantially expanded its capabilities in the areas of aquatic
toxicology and chemistry in the last decade. This project will address the need
to improve the current research infrastructure by (a) upgrading existing
ventilation, heating and air conditioning (HVAC), (b) modifying existing
electrical and plumbing systems, and (c) adding or replacing laboratory benches,
fume hoods, sinks, water conditioning units, and other laboratory fixtures in
order to improve the utility and safety of existing facilities. This award
contributes to the infrastructure of science by providing an improved
environment for the conduct of research and for the training of quality
undergraduate students. Students trained in these laboratories are well prepared
to enter graduate programs or to directly enter the work force to help meet the
great regional and national demand for professionals with formal training in
aquatic toxicology and chemistry.
