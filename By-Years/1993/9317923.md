IBN- 9317923 Neuringer Abstract The ability to vary behavior when the
environment changes can be crucial. Behavioral variability is also an important
component of problem-solving, creativity, and possibly even mental health. Dr.
Neuringer's research is directed at providing basic information about how
variable and novel behaviors are generated and influenced. Dr. Neuringer has
developed a system to study the effects of positive reinforcement on behavioral
variability. He will examine basic theoretical questions as well as the effects
of incentives, drugs, and aging on the ability to generate variable behavior. He
will investigate what contributes to an individual preferring to vary its
behaviors as opposed to repeating a single act. He also will study the
contributions of reinforced variations to the learning of new responses,
cognitive strategies and categories. Dr. Neuringer's research will make
significant contributions towards our theoretical and practical knowledge of
this relatively unstudied but important dimension of behavior.
