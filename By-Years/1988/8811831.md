Computer Vision Research Instrumentation will be provided for researchers at
the University of Florida for research in the Department of Computer and
Information Science. This equipment is provided under the Instrumentation Grants
for Research in Computer and Information Science and Engineering program. The
research for which the equipment is to be used will be in the areas of scene
information, algorithm development for spatial reasoning, and algorithm
development for fast access and retrieval of multidimensional, multisensory
data.
