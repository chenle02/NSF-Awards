In this project the principal investigators will continue their study of what
are called "asymptotically holomorphic" (AH) functions. AH functions are smooth
functions that share many of the uniqueness properties of true holomorphic
functions. Specifically the principal investigators will establish certain
unifying results based upon a general Phragmen-Lindelof principle for AH
functions and upon the idea of a generalized Fourier- Carleman transform.
Asymptotically holomorphic (AH) functions are a recent generalization of
holomorphic (i.e., analytic) functions that arise naturally in connection with
problems in approximation theory, harmonic analysis and dynamical systems
theory. In this project the principal investigators will extend our knowledge of
AH functions and at the same time, examine further applications of these
functions in the three areas just mentioned. The researchers are working
currently on a monograph that will make these important ideas available to a
wide audience. ***//
