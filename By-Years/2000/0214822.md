This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop a software platform, GeneRx for depression. This platform will
incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing
anti-depressant treatment on a patient-specific basis. In this Phase I project,
a predictive algorithm will be developed using genetic and medical chart
information from patients diagnosed with major depressive disorders who have
taken the anti-depressant citalopram. Genetic data will be acquired by
genotyping DNA from blood samples for selected single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in genes that have been directly affected by citalopram. Prediction of
response to citalopram is important in order to avoid delays in receiving
adequate treatment and to avoid exposure to unnecessary side effects.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of healthcare
management and delivery.
