This proposal requests support for a group at the University of Cincinnati for a
program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
based on the BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
They are also completing the analysis of a hadronic charm production experiment
E791 at Fermilab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main aim of BaBar is to study the
origin of particle-antiparticle asymmetry (CP violation) as seen in the decays
of neutral B mesons (B0s) and their antiparticles. The Standard Model of
elementary particle interactions predicts such CP asymmetries. The BaBar
experiment is designed to detect many of the B decay modes and thus to study the
time-dependence of CP violation. In addition to the analysis contributions, the
group is also involved with the operations and software development of the DIRC
(Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov radiation).&lt;br/&gt;
