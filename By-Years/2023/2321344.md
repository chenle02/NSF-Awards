Mammals are ecologically dominant in ecosystems today. Their rise to prominence
after the mass extinction (K/Pg) that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years
ago is a classic example of evolutionary radiation. Study of such events not
only impacts evolutionary theory but also our understanding of loss and
origination of biodiversity and the fragility, collapse, assembly, and
maintenance of todayâ€™s ecosystems. Detailed understanding of the ecological and
evolutionary dynamics of this event are lacking. A diverse team of geologists
and paleontologists will build a study system in eastern Montana that spans the
first 7 million years after the K/Pg mass extinction to address two central
questions: 1) How did mammals rise to ecological prominence in local ecosystems
in deep time?, and 2) How did factors, like climate and vegetation, shape this
trajectory?

The team will generate and integrate critical records of fossil mammals and
climate proxies in a highly resolved temporal framework across eastern Montana.
This will provide a detailed Earth system view of the continental ecosystem
across the K/Pg and through most of the Paleocene (the first ~7 million years)
that will elucidate long-term connections between mammalian evolution, ecology,
and climate. Analyses will also clarify how perturbations to these systems lead
to large-scale ecosystem change and moderate biotic recovery and radiation. This
work will have implications for geochronology, paleoclimatology, paleontology,
ecology, and evolution. The team will engage a wider and more diverse audience
through (1) the multi-year outreach initiative the Discoveries in Geosciences
(DIG) Field School, which connects K-12 teachers and their classrooms with real
Earth science research via fieldwork and classroom activities; (2) broadening
the participation of underrepresented groups in research by supporting a PI and
a graduate student who are early-career female scientists and a PI from an
underrepresented group, in addition to providing full scholarships for 8
teachers from underrepresented groups to attend DIG; and (3) building STEM
talent through the education and training of 4 graduate students and at least 6
undergraduate students who will be introduced to the Earth sciences through
field and lab work.
