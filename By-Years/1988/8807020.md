Three studies will be undertaken of fundamental problems in quantum optics,
involving interference effects of single photons and collective interactions of
atoms and light. One project deals with a new experimental test of locality
violations; a second project deals with the observation of a quantum condition
for interference that has no classical analogy, and the third project involves
investigation of the discontinuous phase transition in the dye ring laser,
particularly near the critical point. The first two projects utilize the
phenomena of spontaneous parametric down conversion.
