Following an earlier conversation on "What it Means to be Educated in the 21st
Century", participants composed of educators, business and industry, government
and others will continue the conversation. The broader impact is that the dialog
on the nature of education and the changes needed in order to maximize the
benefits to students and society will promote those changes by spreading the
discussion. This brings together the many groups who are concerned about the
issue and are already working on positive changes. A transcript of the
conversation will be provided to NSF to be incorporated into a report on this
and other conversations, including a culminating conversation during spring
2005.
