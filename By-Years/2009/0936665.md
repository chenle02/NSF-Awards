The principal investigator (PI) will study the evolution of coronal magnetic
configurations and the corresponding free magnetic energy that is associated
with solar explosive phenomena, such as flares and coronal mass ejections
(CMEs). She plans to use photospheric vector magnetograms from the Hinode
satellite and from the forthcoming Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) as boundary
conditions for reconstructing the 3D coronal magnetic field. The PI will apply
multigrid-like optimization methods to this boundary data to extrapolate the
non-linear force-free (NLFF) coronal magnetic field, and ultimately, to
quantitatively estimate the free energy and nonpotentiality of the coronal
magnetic field.

The PI will focus on 3D magnetic configurations, such as magnetic shear,
magnetic inclination angle, and the electric current system, while investigating
the temporal evolution of free magnetic energy and flare productivity of active
regions. She anticipates that this work will reveal the pre-eruption
configuration of unstable magnetic structures, shed light on the complexity and
energy budget of solar active regions, and help establish the prediction
accuracy of specific flare and CME models in community use today.

Among other broader impacts, this effort will help improve the mission analysis
of data to be obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)
instrument on the upcoming SDO spacecraft. The PI also expects her observational
results to enhance the modeling and forecasting of flares and CMEs. This project
has a strong education and mentoring component, with the young female PI acting
as an advisor and supervisor to Ph.D. students.
