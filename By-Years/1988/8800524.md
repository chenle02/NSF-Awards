The project will measure the seasonality of foraminiferal production at high
latitudes. The samples will be collected in a time-series of sediment traps in
the North Atlantic and Norwegian-Greenland Sea near the present site of North
Atlantic Deep Water formation. A two year record of productivity and shell
chemistry (stable isotopes) will be compared to real-time observations of
surface water hydrography and chemistry in order to calibrate the foraminiferal
record of paleo-environmental conditions. %%% The shells of microscopic
organisms in the northern North Atlantic and Norwegian-Greenland Seas will be
collected with sediment traps for two years. The chemistry of the water will be
measured during the same time period. The results will allow the researchers to
calibrate the modern chemistry of these water with the chemistry of
foraminiferal shells which are preserved in the geologic record. This
calibration is important because the study area is the site of the formation of
North Atlantic Deep Water; this water mass plays an importnat role in the
climate history of the earth.
