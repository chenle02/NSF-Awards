Modeling microeconomic transaction costs is essential for a better understanding
of the behavior of most macroeconomic variables over time like consumer
durables, business investment, inventories, employment, and prices. In order to
obtain a genuinely structural interpretation of the time series properties of
these variables, a careful treatment both of the underlying microeconomic
problem and of the aggregation process is necessary. Available microeconomic
models of dynamic adjustment in the presence of realistic transaction costs
predict that individual units should not react to every innovation in their
environment, and that they may react discontinuously to those innovations that
trigger adjustment of variables determined by the model. The purpose of this
research is to extend available models of infrequent microeconomic adjustment,
to analyze their implications for aggregate phenomena, and to test these
implications and assess their quantitative relevance. This research is important
because it will provide a better understanding of the degree to which
transaction costs at the micro level might provide a plausible microeconomic
foundation for explaining the business cycle.
