This SBIR Phase I project will develop an automated in-line biosensor to monitor
pathogens in treated wastewater. It is intended for farms and other small
facilities. The focus is to include the sensor in package wastewater treatment
systems developed by Spiralcat of Maryland for treating swine and duck farms,
dairies, and other small scale applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact of the project will be an in-line biosensor to monitor
pathogens in the effluent from wastewater treatment at smaller facilities. Such
a low-cost, real-time monitor of wastewater pathogens will further enable
compliance with environmental regulations.&lt;br/&gt;
