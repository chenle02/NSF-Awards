9320958 Meer This joint NSF/ARPA award funds a research planning workshop to be
held on June 24-25, 1994 in Seattle, Washington, following the IEEE Conference
on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. The workshop will bring together
statisticians and computer vision researchers for discussion of improvement of
the reliability of computer vision algorithms by use of robust statistical
estimation methods which tolerate partially incorrect data, and methods for
estimating the confidence in the output of a computer vision task by either
analytical or computer-intensive methods. This topic is very important to the
computer vision field, as it should help to improve the linkage with
knowledgeable statisticians, and lead to more cogent application of statistical
knowledge to computer vision research. The funding will provide partial support
for many of the attendees, who will also be attending the Computer Vision and
Pattern Recognition Conference just prior to the workshop, and will enable a
number of others not involved in the CVPR conference (primarily statisticians)
to travel to the workshop. A proceedings will be made available to requesters at
a modest handling cost following the workshop.
