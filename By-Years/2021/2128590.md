This award supports participation of graduate students, postdoctoral
researchers, and early-career faculty in the session titled “The EDGE (Enhancing
Diversity in Graduate Education) Program: Pure and Applied Talks by Women Math
Warriors” at the 2022 and 2023 Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM). The 2022 JMM
session will be held in Seattle, Washington and the 2023 JMM session will be
held in Boston, Massachusetts. The EDGE program was founded in 1998 to improve
retention and completion rates for women and minorities in graduate programs and
increase diversity in the mathematics community. The 2022 and 2023 sessions will
showcase the research of women who are affiliated with the EDGE
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The session provides a platform for women in all
areas of mathematics to present their research findings and generate ideas for
new research techniques and directions. Opportunities to strengthen
participants’ network of women mathematicians and establish new mentoring
relationships with other women affiliated with the EDGE program are provided.
The session benefits the larger mathematics community by increasing the
visibility of women in mathematics by highlighting their research work, thereby
creating opportunities for recruitment and retention of women in mathematics.

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
