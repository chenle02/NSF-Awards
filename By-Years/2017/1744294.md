The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project will improve
the transition quality and efficiency of university students to companies. This
platform will potentially provide several customer segments such as students,
companies and universities with solutions that remove many barriers that
currently make job hunting and hiring a time-consuming, costly, stressful, and
often biased endeavor. The impact of the product goes beyond a specific academic
major, and has the potential to cover all scientific subject matters for which
there is a robust job market. Most importantly, the solution will remove the
current potential biases against underrepresented minorities by automating the
skill assessment process and minimizing the human involvement in the
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will develop effective,
unbiased, and automated platforms and algorithms for skill assessment. The
target customers will be the companies, and university graduates that would like
to enter the job market with no prior experience. This research will propose
novel techniques and working tools using artificial intelligence and machine
learning methods to provide interaction during the interview process between the
assessment engine and the interviewee. The project further develops novel formal
methods and programming language analysis techniques to analyze the answers
submitted by the candidate during the interview and adaptively select the next
sequence of questions for each specific candidate. A realistic test-bed
infrastructures on which the candidates will be asked to perform experiments is
used to assess the expertise level of the candidates. These novel techniques for
automated interviews will reduce the cost and time for both companies and
students.
