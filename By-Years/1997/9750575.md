A course in "Chemical Structure Determination" is being designed for non-science
majors. The course in organic structure determination has no prerequisites other
than a high school chemistry course. It is laboratory intensive and requires
problem solving skills, the application of logic, hands-on data acquisition and
interpretation, teamwork, and oral and written communication skills. Students
are gaining hands-on experience with modern instrumental methods and the use of
technology in solving scientific problems. An infrared spectrophotometer, an
ultraviolet-visible spectrophotomer, and a gas chromatograph interfaced with a
mass spectrometer, along with an existing 60 MHZ nuclear magnetic resonance
spectrometer, are being used in the course. The course is also forcing students
to recognize the interdisciplinary nature of science, as all of the laboratory
experiments and projects are serving as a bridge to phenomena in related fields.
The course satisfies a portion of the field of study requirements in the natural
sciences required in the curriculum. In addition, the instrumentation is being
used in the annual workshop for high school teachers and students which is
offered in the summer as part of the outreach program to the region. *
