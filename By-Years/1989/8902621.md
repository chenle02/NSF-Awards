The Principal Investigator's project is to develop a reciprocity law governing
the behavior of torsion points on higher-dimensional analogues of Drinfeld
modules; he calls these Abelian A-modules. One of the products of this would be
to attach a Hecke character to each Abelian A-module with complex
multiplication, and develop the theory of L-series attached to such characters,
following the work of Goss. This research is work in the Algebraic Geometry of
finite characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of
continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes, in this context
the Discrete takes over, and methods akin to those from the theory of whole
numbers are most useful. Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of finite
characteristic is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is
finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.
