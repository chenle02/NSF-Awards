This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) Site Proposal
to provide research experiences for selected undergraduates in an
interdisciplinary program which examines the physical and biological functioning
of estuarine ecosystems. It will acquaint the students with the excitement and
opportunities of academic research and encourage them to pursue graduate studies
and a career in ocean sciences.
