Mating for Variety: Activity and fitness in Pogonomyrmex Harvester
Ants&lt;br/&gt;PI: Blaine Cole and Diane
Wiernasz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research will test the hypothesis
that genetic variation increases efficiency and leads to higher performance
within social groups. The study will use the seed harvesting ant, Pogonomyrmex
occidentalis as a model system. Genetic variability among social groups
(colonies) in this species is generated by the mating behavior of queens, which
may mate with as few as two or as many as eleven males, producing colonies that
differ considerably in the genetic variation among colony members (workers).
This variation is correlated with the amount of time that colonies have to
search for food. Colonies with high levels of genetic variation are able to
spend more time searching for food. The research will determine 1) whether the
amount of time available for collecting food corresponds to the amount of food
or the quality of food that the colony acquires; 2) how differences in genetic
variation among colonies lead to differences in the duration of activity; and 3)
whether differences in genetic variability result in differences in survival and
reproduction among colonies. This study will begin to answer fundamental
questions about the role of genetic variation in determining efficiency in a
social organism.&lt;br/&gt;
