This project involves research into subband coding for video applications,
including advanced television, video conferencing, and high-definition
television (HDTV). The subband coding structure has been found to be an
attractive way of incorporating both coding efficiency as well as resolution-
compatibility between video formats. Aditionally, pyramid based motion
compensation strategies can be used within the subband structure to further
enhance the coding efficiency. Three-dimensional subband coding offers exciting
new possibilities to directly consider locally planar motions within the coder
module.
