Dr. Michael L. Connolly is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, and the Division
of Instrumentation and Resources in the Biological Behavorial and Social
Sciences Directorate. Dr. Connolly will develop computer algorithms to provide a
visual comparison of protein conformations which take into account the topology
as well as the geometry of the protein conformations. Dr. Connolly has developed
a new technique which maximizes the overlap of chemical volume to identify
structures in several molecules with similar shapes. Dr. Connolly will also
develop an automatic algorithm for identifying protein binding pockets and for
docking small molecules, such as drugs and hormones, into them.
