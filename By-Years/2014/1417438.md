The investigators propose to characterize the multitude of approaches currently
employed in the professional development of K-12 teachers of science, and to
measure the effectiveness of such approaches in increasing teacher knowledge in
the sciences. The project will study 150 professional development programs for
teachers of science in grades K-12. The sample will cover grade bands K-4, 5-8,
and 9-12. Subject matter will include life science (biology), physical science
(physics, chemistry), earth and space science. Such programs are funded through
competitive federal grants for local implementation (by universities, museums,
schools, and others), by state and local governments, by private institutions,
and conducted by many federal agencies. To date, there has not been a national
inventory and study of the effectiveness of teacher professional development
programs in science, using common outcome measures of teacher instructional
practice. If successful, the findings from this research will allow professional
development providers and policymakers to design more effective teacher
professional development programs and should provide a national landscape of
teacher professional development in science.

In specific, the researchers will focus on assessing gains in teachers' subject
matter knowledge and knowledge of student misconceptions, and will correlate
these with professional development program design features. Teachers of
students from underrepresented groups will be oversampled to ensure special
analyses for this group are possible. Hierarchical linear modeling will be used
in analyzing the results. The project will result in a website, conference
presentations, and scholarly and professional publications.
