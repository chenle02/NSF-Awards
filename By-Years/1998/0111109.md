Dr. Philip J. Grandinetti of Ohio State University is funded for his research on
new NMR methods for investigating structure in inorganic oxide glasses by the
Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division. Advanced magic angle
spinning (MAS) techniques, such as rotor assisted polarization transfer (RAPT)
and fast spinning gives transfer enhancement at rotary resonance (FASTER),
developed at Ohio State University and elsewhere will be refined for
applications to structural determinations in glasses. RAPT quadrupolar
sensitivity enhancement schemes will be refined for obtaining maximal
enhancements for a wide range of spin couplings and resonant offsets, and for
obtaining RAPT enhanced versions of dynamic-angle spinning (DAS) and multiple-
quantum (MQ)-MAS. Numerical and experimental studies of the dependence of the
FASTER rotary resonances on parameters such as nuclear spin, quadrupolar
coupling, asymmetry, and chemical shifts will be done in order to compare FASTER
with other MQ-MAS methods. Sensitivity enhanced versions of DAS and MQ-MAS will
be used to study binary (metal oxide silicates ) and ternary (bimetal oxide
silicates) glass compositions, with a view towards quantifying Si-O-Si bond
angles, coordination numbers, and geometries around bridging and non-bridging
oxygens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of inorganic oxide glasses
obtained from this research will impact researchers in several areas. The
potential importance of solid-state NMR methods in structure determinations has
long been thwarted by sensitivity issues. Many of these issues are being
overcome by accomplishments from Dr. Grandinetti's group and by others, and will
be further overcome by the the research done at Ohio State University. The
methods that will be developed for enhancing solid-state NMR sensitivity will
have a broad impact on researchers wanting to take full advantage of quadrupolar
nuclei as structural probes.
