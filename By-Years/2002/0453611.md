REU SITE: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Astronomy in Flagstaff,
Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST 0453611
Eastwood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue the operation of the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in astronomy at Northern Arizona
University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona. Eight students will be recruited
nationally each year, to work with a mentor on a specific research project at
NAU, the Lowell Observatory, and the Flagstaff station of the U.S. Naval
Observatory. The students will attend a twice-weekly seminar series, and
participate in field trips and social activities. The students will also receive
three hours of university credit by participating in the
program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU programs aims to make significant
contributions to the career development plans for the undergraduates that
participate in the program. In particular, the PI expects to build upon a
history, and continue to mentor young women in astronomy. The PI plans to
increase efforts to recruit underrepresented students into the REU
program.&lt;br/&gt;*** &lt;br/&gt;
