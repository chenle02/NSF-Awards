The proposed research will analyze the relationship between firm location
decisions, geographic concentration, and trade patterns by developing several
related theoretical models and empirically testing the results. The foundations
will consist of an imperfect competition model of firm location, in which
learning spillovers from direct contact with suppliers and customers provide an
impetus for concentration. The model will be extended to analyze the evolution
of firm location and trade patterns over the product life cycle. A second
extension will consider the effect of government intervention on industry
location. The research will conclude with empirical tests of the relationship
posited by the model between comparative advantage and concentration of related
industries and consumer density, as against competing hypotheses emphasizing
factor supplies and transport costs. The Research Planning Grant would be used
to review related literature, to develop a working paper version of the model
illustrating the core relationships, to assess the evidence on relevant
government policies, and to identify and tap data sources for the empirical
component. It would lead to the submission of a full research proposal to the
NSF at the end of one year.
