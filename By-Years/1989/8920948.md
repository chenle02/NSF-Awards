Research is carried on XRAM, a parallel access memory for multiprocessor
computing machines. XRAM will allow an unlimited number of processors
simultaneous access to READ and WRITE to a central (global) memory in fractions
of a microsecond per cycle. The research includes two iterations of design,
fabrication and testing of XRAM devices. The first iteration will consist of
designs for access of 1, 2, 4 and 8 processors. The second iteration will
consist of designs for access of 1, 2, 8, 32 and 64 processors. Characterization
of XRAM devices is performed with electrical and optical-Kerr effect testing.
Applications for XRAM include: Aerospace and automobile design, manufacturing
and chemical process design, theoretical physics calculation, and other
applications. XRAM will be an inexpensive memory because no exotic materials are
used in XRAM and standard photolithographic fabrication techniques are employed.
