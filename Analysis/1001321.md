The principal investigator and his graduate students will investigate problems
in the geometry of Banach spaces and the geometry of metric spaces. The problems
to be considered fall into several subcategories; namely, commutators of
operators on a Banach space, non linear factorization of linear operators, non
linear classification of Banach spaces, discrete metric geometry, approximation
properties, and miscellaneous problems. Sample problems are: 1. If a Banach
space has a Pelczynski decomposition and the space of bounded linear operators
on the space has a unique maximal ideal, must every bounded linear operator that
is not a commutator be the sum of a non zero scalar plus an operator in the
maximal ideal? 2. Must a Lipschitz complemented subspace of a separable Banach
space be linearly complemented? 3. Estimate the smallest dimension k such that
every n point subset of the space of integrable functions embeds, with
distortion at most D, into the k dimensional space normed by the sum of the
absolute values of the coordinates. (Here k will depend on both n, the number of
points in the subset, and D, the allowable distortion).

The topics treated in this project make contact with many areas of analysis and
areas outside of analysis, including operator theory, group theory, geometric
analysis, and theoretical computer science. One of the graduate students is
involved in developing the conceptual framework for understandings mappings of
large scale, high dimensional data sets into the normed vector spaces that are
widely used in science and engineering. This work and other aspects of the
discrete metric geometry part of the project can be used in the design of
algorithms. Moreover, positive results on dimension reduction will have
applications in compressed sensing. The questions on the factorization of non
linear operators are connected to recurring problems in geometric analysis,
while the linear finite dimensional investigation belong as much to convex
geometry as to analysis. Aspects of the non linear classification problems may
be as important for geometric group theory as for geometric functional analysis.
