Computer-assisted videodisc technology will be used in the general chemistry
course to incorporate the "Exploring Chemistry" software. The primary purpose is
to serve the expository and laboratory needs of impaired or disabled students.
It will focus secondarily on the needs of international students and those from
non-Western ethnic backgrounds who have difficulty with scientific language. The
hardware needed for the learning laboratory of this prototype project includes
three microcomputers and networking software. A three-year department plan has
been established for this project, with implementation and evaluation of the
course plan to take about two years. The methods will be extended to the whole
course and disseminated as appropriate. The grantee will match the NSF award
from non-Federal sources.
