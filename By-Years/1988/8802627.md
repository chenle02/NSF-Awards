Ultrasound is an emerging method employed for nondestructive evaluation. One
potential advantage of ultrasound is that the motion of an object can be
detected by observing the frequency shift of the returned signal. This research
will seek to exploit this advantage by developing procedures to measure motion
parameters with reflected ultrasound signals and by determining their
limitations. A wide range of motion types are considered, from determining the
motion parameters of a single moving point reflector through characterizing the
motion of a collection of random reflectors. The procedures involve analysis,
simulation and experiments. The fundamental limitations are due to the speed of
sound, the limited size of the apertures, and the presence of noise. The impact
of these limitations will be investigated by considering the placement of
multiple transducers and novel signal processing procedures. This should allow
translation of these physical limitations into bounds on the accuracy that can
be applied to practical instruments. The result of this research will enhance
the understanding of probing media with acoustic signals and determine the
feasibility of a new generation of measuring instrumentation.
