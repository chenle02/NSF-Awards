High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques will be used to separate
from the complex mixture of total organic carbon in coastal marine sediments
enough of several pure individual lipid compounds for carbon isotopic analyses
on the single compounds. The geochemical rationale for doing so is that more
valuable and specific process oriented information will be obtained from
determinations of 13c/12c ratios and ratios 14c activities in individual
compounds than from measurements on either total organic C or on classes of
compounds. The 13c/12c ratios should reveal whether the compounds are primarily
derived from marine plankton or are terrestrially derived, and the 14c
activities will reveal when they were formed. The key to the isolation of
milligram amounts of each compound in purities exceeding 95% is a
straightforward, nonaqueous, reverse phase HPLC technique which has so far been
overlooked by environmental chemists.
