9630740 MYERS In order to fully comprehend a text, the reader must be able to
understand continually how each currently read sentence fits with the
information presented earlier in the text. This often involves recognizing
connections between sentences that are currently being read and information that
occurred much earlier in the text. Readers are generally able to make these
kinds of connections quickly and easily, even when the related ideas span
relatively large distances in the text. This research will investigate the
processes involved in relating and connecting each new idea to what has been
read before. Specifically, the research will test a computer simulation model
which assumes that these processes are largely automatic, that is, occurring
quickly and with very little effort on the part of the reader. The research will
also test the model's predictions about factors that influence the kinds of
connections readers are likely to make and how those connections influence their
understanding and memory of the text. Such factors include readers' goals and
perspectives, the organization of the text, the syntax of the sentence being
read, the nature of the relation between currently read ideas and related
information read earlier, the distance between currently read ideas and related
information, and the extent to which the text elaborates upon various topics.
Although the primary goal of the research is to test a model of how readers
understand and remember text, another important result of the research will be a
better understanding of the factors that make texts easier to understand and
remember. Such an understanding should prove helpful in writing textbooks and
manuals that present information clearly, and in a way that improves readers'
memory for the most important points. ***
