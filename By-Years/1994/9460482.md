PSI Technologies proposes to apply a novel pulse current catalyzation (PCC)
technique to the development of a high-utilization anode for direct methanol
proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Previous work has demonstrated that
their preparation technique results in low-loaded, high-utilization
electrocatalysts with equivalent performance to platinum black in
hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells. They expect these PCC electrodes to have significant
cost and performance benefits over state-of-the-art catalysts which will make
the electrodes attractive for use in methanol fueled PEM fuel cells for
transportation applications.
