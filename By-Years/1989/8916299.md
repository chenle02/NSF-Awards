This award will provide funds for one-half of the costs of acquiring a computer
system to be installed and operated in the Laboratory for Geodesy and
Geodynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Institute is
committed to providing the remaining half required for this purchase. The
purpose of the laboratory is to provide research capabilities for modern geodesy
in order to study large-scale crustal motion, regional deformation and global
changes such as sea level fluctuations.
