ABSTRACT HRD 0929257

Lane College is implementing a comprehensive initiative to enhance and
strengthen STEM teaching and learning and to increase student enrollment and
retention in STEM majors. The goal of ?Enhancing the Potential of Lane College
Undergraduates in STEM Program? is to increase the number of STEM majors, and
provide all science, technology, engineering and mathematics students with a
challenging and enriching learning experience.

The project is being accomplished by implementing the following objectives: (1)
build students? interest and confidence so they will pursue STEM degrees; (2)
create programs that will enhance student retention and success in entry-level
STEM courses; (3) provide targeted recruitment of underrepresented students to
major in STEM disciplines; (4) create early undergraduate research experience in
STEM by providing Summer internships for students; (5) provide stipends for
faculty and students at collaborating universities and laboratories; (6) create
an environment at Lane in which research is now accepted as an important part of
a science student?s education; (7) provide professional development
opportunities for faculty to ensure their participation and support for the
project; and (8) improve STEM students? preparation for graduate or professional
school by providing courses/ workshops for standardized exams.

Lane College is a coeducational, private historically black college that serves
2003 students, including 460 who are enrolled in STEM disciplines. Lane College
offers the Bachelor of Science degree leading to majors in Biology, Chemistry,
Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. A major in Engineering is offered
through a dual degree program with Tennessee State University in Nashville. Lane
College is committed to increasing the number of minority students enrolling in
and successfully completing baccalaureate programs that will prepare them to
enter graduate and professional degree programs in STEM disciplines.
