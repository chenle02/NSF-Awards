The investigators continue studying the coupled thermosphere/ionosphere system
at the equator under a program referred to as MISETA (Multi-Instrumented Studies
of Equatorial Thermosphere Aeronomy). MISETA involves coordinated measurements
by a variety of instruments at Jicamarca, Ancon, and Arequipa in Peru. These
instruments provide data on the neutral and ionized atmosphere, including
vertical and zonal ion drifts, electron densities, ion, electron and neutral
temperatures, zonal, meridional and vertical neutral winds, spread-F and
scintillation activity. The investigators examine and characterize solar
variations in the equatorial thermospheric winds and temperatures, and how these
variations relate to developing scintillation activity and spread-F. The all-sky
imaging data characterizes developing depletions and F-region structures as
conditions become more dynamic with the higher solar fluxes. They also observe
developing zonal wind and temperature asymmetry with anti-correlated F-region
gradients as the increasing plasma density couples into the zonal motions
introduced by gravity wave oscillations, resulting in conversion of gravity wave
energy into a localized region of heating. The researchers are coordinating
observations with the Jicamarca Radio Observatory to observe the gravity wave
effects in horizontal and vertical ion drifts. MISETA is a collaborative effort
involving scientists at Clemson University, Boston College, and Boston
University.
