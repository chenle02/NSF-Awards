This award supports studies of star formation in nearby galaxies by analyzing
the distribution and properties of molecular gas in these objects. The principal
investigator has made extensive studies of the starburst phenomena in galaxies
utilizing radio continuum radiation, and now will explore the role of dense
molecular clouds in this phenomenon.
