Funds are granted to the University of California - Berkeley to hold a three day
workshop for pre-service and in-service teachers to inform the development of
teaching modules, activities, and strategies related to the Understanding
Sciences web page. The outcome of the workshop will be an online, flexible,
interactive syllabus that will facilitate the integration of Understanding
Sciences website material into science methods courses for pre-service teachers.
The expected goals include: summarize the characteristics of science methods
courses as pre-service teachers are currently being taught; articulate the
resource needs of those who instruct pre-service teachers; recommend components
of the Understanding Sciences website for incorporation into science methods
courses and propose models for re-packaging if necessary; identify effective
strategies for incorporating these resources into science methods courses;
development of self-assessment materials for each section of Understanding
Science 101; and determine strategies for dissemination. Attendees at the
meeting will include members of the Understanding Science project, pre-service
teacher educators, in-service teachers, scientists, and science educators from
around the country. The workshop will take place at the University Of California
Museum Of Paleontology, Berkeley in early 2012.
