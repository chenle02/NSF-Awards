Kirit Karkare is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral
Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education at the University of
Chicago. He will play a lead role in developing instrumentation and conducting
observations to study the large-scale structure of the distant universe. Results
from this project will advance our understanding of the physics of the early
universe. Along with this research, he will develop a program of public outreach
that connects artists from underserved Chicago communities to scientists at the
University of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the
instrumentation and analysis necessary to develop line intensity mapping (IM) as
a probe of large-scale structure. It will test the performance of the
millimeter-wave spectrometer and kinetic inductance detectors on the SuperSpec
instrument and analyze IM observations of singly ionized carbon and carbon
monoxide. It will also develop a software pipeline to assess scan and noise
reduction, and it will test a novel foreground cleaning algorithm to isolate the
cosmological signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
