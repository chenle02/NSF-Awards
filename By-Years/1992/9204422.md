This study includes the following: 1. Completion of the series of worldwide
Silurian Correlation charts: Continental Europe and Northern Asia (Asiatic
Russia, Mongolia, Korea, Japan). 2. Obtaining biogeographically critical
Silurian and Devonian brachipod collections from southern Thailand, northwestern
Saudi Arabia, northern Chile and adjacent Argentina, to fill in critical blanks
and establish better relations between large parts of the World. To further
investigate the implications of the newly discovered terrestrial biogeography of
the higher land plants (using spore tetrads) for the Llanvirn-Llandovery
interval of the Ordovician and Silurian, and compare and contrast it with the
biogeography of the associated marine environments. To further extend global,
studies of post-Ibexian brachipod biogeography for the Ordovician at the generic
level. Description of biogeographically critical Upper Silurian brachipods from
Iran will also be carried out. 3. Completion for publication of the global
studies involved in Project Ecostratigraphy. 4. Gathering information on the
Ibexian-Whiterockian boundary interval, which is one of the major times of both
extinction and subsequent adaptive radiation in the marine environment, and
about the minor extinction event that occurred in the earlier Wenlockian for
much of the World. 5. Completing the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology
assignment, as part of the brachiopod volume revision, on the pentameroids and
Paleozoic terebratuloids.
