Quck Reaction Corp. will develop a precise radar reflectometer, capable of
searching for the 100,000,000 land mines that are buried throughout the world,
which are responsible for maiming or killing thousands of innocent people
annually. This reflectometer will measure very small changes in reflection which
are caused by the presence of land mines. To locate land mines, the search area
is illuminated by an array of small foot print collimated antennas. The ground
caused reflected signal in each antenna beam is measured and continuously
cancelled by an active loop, resulting in a precise vector measurement in each
antenna caused only by the ground reflection. It is the difference between
adjacent beam's ground reflection vectors that provides detection. This approach
will improve detection and estimates of target location and size.
