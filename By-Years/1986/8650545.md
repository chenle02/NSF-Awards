Oregon Institute of Technology will purchase ten microprocessor development
systems for students taking microprocessor and senior project courses. The
system includes an IBM PC-AT computer engine, a universal microprocessor
emulator, software, and a printer. The universal microprocessor emulator was
chosen to obtain maximum flexibility in choosing the microprocessors to be
emulated. The unit allows changing microprocessors without having to change
emulators or computer engines. With the acquisition of the ten development
systems, the microprocessor and senior project instruction will be compatible
with contemporary practices of industry.
