This research program will develop the use of synthetically modified DNA as
probes for protein-DNA interactions. Two methods for analysis of the contact
regions of protein transcription factors with DNA are being developed by Dr.
Verdine. These are template-directed interference (TDI) footprinting and base-
specific photoaffinity (BSP) crosslinking. These techniques will be applied to
two human transcription factors, NF-Kappa B and NFAT, in order to understand how
these factors interact with DNA and regulate gene expression.//
