The PI proposes to investigate a number of topics in particle theory. One is
Family Unification in Extra Dimensions. Family unification models combine gauge
and horizontal symmetry groups while embedding all three standard model
generations into a single irreducible representation. Extra dimensions allow one
to eliminate unwanted mirror family zero modes in such models via the
appropriate choice of boundary conditions on the fields. This provides a new
framework for constructing and studying the phenomenology of realistic family
unified theories. The PI proposes to investigate a number of issues related to
the phenomenology of noncommutative field theories, which can be realized as a
low-energy limit of string theories. He will consider the only known consistent
and complete noncommutative generalization of the standard model and will
determine the bounds from low-energy searches for the violation of Lorentz
invariance. Lorentz-violating effective operators induced at tree-level, one-
loop and two-loops will be evaluated. In addition, the PI will study
noncommutative quantum mechanical theories with minimum length uncertainty
relations, and determine new bounds from atomic and molecular physics. Theories
that attempt to explain fermion masses and mixing angles in the standard model
generally include new matter and Higgs fields at a flavor scale, MF, which is
much higher than the electroweak scale. A high flavor scale is necessary to
avoid new contributions to flavor changing neutral current processes. The PI
proposes to investigate whether realistic models with smaller MF can be
constructed by arranging for a suppression of the higher-dimensional wave
functions of certain flavor-sector fields at points where ordinary matter is
located. The broader implications are that the PI is deeply involved in the
education of undergraduate and PhD research students at William and Mary.
