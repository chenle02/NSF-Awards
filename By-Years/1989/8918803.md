This dissertation research project will facilitate the study by a graduate
student in anthropology of illegal Garifuna immigrants who have settled in Los
Angeles (from Belize). The project will test a theory of "weak social ties" in
the personal network of immigrant job seekers, comparing the networks of women
and men. A study of the originating village in Belize will examine the "push"
factors in this migration. Methods include structured interviews, household
censuses, and participant observation. This research is important because
illegal migration is an important fact of social and economic life in the US
today. Increased understanding of the factors involved in migration and in job
searches in the US can help policy makers deal with the problems.
