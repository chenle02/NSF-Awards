The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 200 MHz FT NMR spectrometer for use
in its sophomore organic chemistry laboratory, as well as in other upper
division courses within the department. In the organic laboratory, students
produce spectra of reactants and/or products relating to standard experiments,
then use the instrument to identify unknowns. In the physical chemistry
laboratory, students use the instrument in connection with reaction kinetics
experiments and in studying reaction transition states. In the biochemistry
laboratory, students collect COSY spectra of dipeptides and follow the
metabolism of C-13 labeled glucose in E. coli. In the spectrometric methods
course, students work independently on a variety of projects involving special
techniques of FT-NMR spectroscopy.
