9452685 Kelly Hampshire College seeks to initiate a summer residential Young
Scholars program for 60 students during a six week session. The program is
called Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics. The faculty of college
professors, mathematics majors and graduate students live in the program
dormitory and join students for meals and recreational activities as well as for
more than 8 hours of mathematics each day. Small and lively classes and 3 hour
evening problem seminars of 15 students guided by a professor and two
assistants, will collaboratively investigate challenging and rewarding problems
from number theory, group theory, combinatorics, probability, the fourth
dimension, graph theory, infinity, fractals, chaos, and other active branches of
mathematics. Emphasis will be placed on the processes of mathematical thought,
discovering patterns, formulating questions and definitions, making conjectures,
and creating proofs, rather than the simple accumulation of results. Activities
include classes for four hours each morning, evening problem seminars, daily
Prime Time Theorems, visits by pure and applied mathematicians, a weekly program
journal, computers, math films, and field trips. Regular contacts will seek to
engage alums and their teachers with serious mathematics and to maintain the
spirit of the Summer Studies intellectual community. ***
