*** 9632407 Krstulovic-Opara This goal of this study is to explore a novel
concept of self-prestressing High-Performance Composite Infrastructural Systems
created through the selective use of high- performance materials. The
investigation will explore a distinctive new concept of using Shape Memory
Alloys as muscular systems embedded in continuous fiber-mat High Performance
Fiber Reinforced Concretes to develop an innovative, stay-in-place formwork
capable of self-inducing prestressing, after the "core" of the element has been
cast- in-place. The stay-in-place formwork will be used to: (1) self-induce
multiaxial post-tensioning of the entire structural element, and (2) act as
surface reinforcement, thus replacing conventional reinforcing bars. This way
partially-cast-in-place self-prestressing will be developed. If successful, the
proposed concept will lead to: (1) simpler, faster and more cost-effective
construction, (2) markedly improved structural performance, (3) reduction in
element size and weigh leading to the reduction in dead load, earthquake induced
loadings and an increase in usable floor space, and (4) improved durability of
the structure.***
