This research will investigate the contact problem between structures and
geologic materials subjected to static and cyclic loading. A continuum mechanics
model will be developed which will include many relevant phenomena such as state
of stress and strain, hardening an softening, fluid pressure in the geologic
material, and deformation modes. Experimental techniques will be used to
determine material constants and to verify the model. The result of this
research can be used in the design of structures founded on geologic materials
subjected to earthquake loading.
