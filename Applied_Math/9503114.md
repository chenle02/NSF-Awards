DMS-9503114 Santosa Our approach is to pose the imaging problem as an
optimization problem with constraints and penalty terms. The constraints would
represent a priori information, while the penalty terms are added to achieve
certain quality in the image. One of the main difficulties in this approach is
development of specialized optimization methods. The optimization methods must
be capable of (1) solving large problems, (2) dealing with constraints, (3)
dealing with nondifferentiability of the cost function. To this end, we will
explore the use of interior point methods. While this imaging technique has
several attractive features such as low-cost and portability, it suffers from
the ability to resolve fine features in the image. We propose to overcome this
difficulty by incorporating known side information as well as applying
enhancement techniques in the reconstruction process. This research concerns the
use of recent techniques in image enhancement and computer vision in overcoming
the blurring effects of an imaging method known as electrical impedance
tomography. Electrical impedance tomography is a technique for imaging the
interior of a specimen using DC electrical measurements collected on the
boundary of the specimen. It has found use in clinical applications, geophysical
prospecting, and nondestructive evaluations. It is anticipated that we will be
able to develop software, that when used with electrical impedance tomographic
devices, would deliver images with high resolution.
