9408297 Schimel The main objective of this research is to determine what causes
shifts in community composition during succession, and how do ecological
processes change as a result of these changes in species composition. This
research focuses primarily on how the vascular plant community in Alaskan taiga
vegetation changes during succession, and how these changes affect and are
affected by the soil microbial community. Evidence exists to suggest that plant
species may enhance their ability to occupy and maintain a site through
modification of the soil environment. This occurs because the litter quality and
chemical composition differs among tree species. Using field and laboratory
procedures, this research will directly determine whether or not plant extracts
affect microbial activities in associated soils. %%% The general notion that
reciprocal interactions occur between aboveground and belowground processes has
long been of interest, but rarely studies. With the development of new
technology such questions are just beginning to be answered. This research will
provide the baseline analyses for more detailed investigations of ecosystem
feedbacks between aboveground and belowground communities.
