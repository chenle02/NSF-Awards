The Mountain Research Station of the University of Colorado is one of the
nation's outstanding biological stations. The facility is a national and
international resource used extensively by researchers from a variety of
institutions and agencies. Research at the site, begun in 1914, has added
significantly to our understanding of biological and physical processes,
especially at high altitudes. The station served as a major site for the
International Biological Programme and is now a Long-Term Ecological site. An
extensive data base has been developed as a result of these and other programs,
including the Mountain Climate Program which the station has operated since
1952. This project will provide partial funding for renovation of the John Marr
Alpine Laboratory, the principal research building at the station. Specifically,
NSF funding will be used for elimination of hazardous asbestos materials and for
the provision of handicap access to the buidling. The University's commitment to
providing improved facilities for the conduct of field-based biological research
is demonstrated by a substantial matching contribution.
