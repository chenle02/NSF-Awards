OISE 09-59233&lt;br/&gt;Patrick Rousche&lt;br/&gt;University of Illinois at
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for
planning visits to Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, the University of Ulster
at Jordanstown in Northern Ireland and the University of Freiburg in Germany.
The US principal investigator is Patrick Rousche from the University of Illinois
at Chicago. The foreign collaborators are Michael Coey in Ireland, James
McLaughlin in Northern Ireland and Thomas Stieglitz in Germany.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of these visits is to form an international
multi-disciplinary team to create, implement, and foster a novel field of study
the researchers call ?nanoneuronics.? They define nanoneuronics as a new
discipline with the goal of harnessing the collaborative power and knowledge of
nanotechnology, neuroscience, electrical engineering, neural engineering and
ethics for the design and development of advanced medical interventions with the
nervous system. The primary research goal of this effort will be the
incorporation of nanotechnology towards the improvement of implanted medical
devices in the nervous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the
international cooperation; training of U.S. graduate students by providing an
early career introduction to collaborative international work in advanced areas
in two leading industrial countries; and promotion of a mutually beneficial
collaborative relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
