This project examines three properties of underground cybercrime communities: 1)
profitability, 2) connectivity, 3) and sustainability. It identifies qualitative
and quantitative metrics for these properties as well as discusses the relative
effectiveness of distinct operationalization of these metrics under different
levels of data granularity. The goal is to develop metrics that provide meaning
indicators even when data is limited. for example, if public posts are available
but not private messages between individual cybercriminals. The analysis targets
five underground forums: AntiChat, BadHacke, BlackhatWorld, Carders, and
L33tCrew. Finally, the project combines linguistic techniques, e.g. topic
modeling, social network analysis, and analysis to provide a repeatable,
verifiable, and systematic framework that enables a scientific exploration of
these forums and the impact of distinct interventions at mitigating underground
forums.

This project assumes that cybercrime is made economically feasible by
collaboration between criminals with specialized skills, as facilitated by
underground forums. Thus, it argues to change the fundamental focus of anti-
cybercrime efforts from making individual incidence of cybercrime unprofitable
to making cybercrime communities unsustainable. The findings inform defender
efforts, both for academic researchers as well as practitioners. The project
builds a scientific framework to evaluate the effectiveness of such
interventions. This framework is being used to develop tools for law enforcement
as well as pedagogical material to educate students in cyber-security.
