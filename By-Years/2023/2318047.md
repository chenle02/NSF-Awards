The 2024 Langenhop Lecture and SIU Mathematics Conference will be held May
16-17, 2024 at Southern Illinois University (SIU) at Carbondale, Illinois. The
conference is devoted to the scientific and professional training of graduate
students and young researchers. The SIU graduate students and recent graduates
attend the conference to present their research, meet with their advisors and
peers, and consult with senior mathematicians. This award will provide support
to bring in more graduate students and post-docs from other schools. This will
be especially beneficial for participants from smaller schools, such as SIU,
which do not have many research groups and do not have funding for travel
support for their graduate students. Finally, the conference contributes
significantly to the research enthusiasm and engagement in the SIU School of
Mathematical and Statistical Sciences.

The conference will cover a variety of topics in pure mathematics. The topics
are related to the SIU faculty research areas and include automorphic forms,
combinatorics, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, the Langlands program,
Lie algebras, logic, number theory, partial differential equations, quadratic
forms, and representation theory. Through the plenary lectures, the participants
will learn about research directions in different areas of pure mathematics. The
sessions will give the participants an opportunity to meet with specialists,
present their work, discuss questions, and possibly start new collaborations.
