This grant supports the eighth annual "Graduate Student mini-Conference in
Computational Mathematics" which will be held at Clemson University on February
5 and 6, 2016. Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in
the theory and implementation of numerical methods for partial differential
equations, including multiphase flow, porous media, numerical methods for
stochastic PDEs, turbulence, fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE
constrained optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be
given by graduate students. Approximately twenty graduate students from Clemson,
Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University
of South Carolina, Florida State University, the University of Tennessee, and
Emory University will present scientific research talks involving mathematical
modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous analysis and efficient
implementation of numerical methods for the modeling equations. The conference
organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups, and it
is expected that nearly half of the graduate student speakers will be from an
under-represented group. The goals of the conference are to give graduate
students an opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, to bring
graduate students and researchers (their advisors) together to discuss
collaborative research projects, and to exchange new ideas in many challenging
research areas.
