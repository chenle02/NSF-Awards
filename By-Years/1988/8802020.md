This research is in the area of algebraic geometry, more specifically Hodge
theory and algebraic curves. In Hodge theory, Noether-Lefschetz theory,
infinitesimal invariants of normal functions, the infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map
and the period map will be studied. In the theory of algebraic curves the
relation between the minimal free resolution of a projective curve and the
intrinsic geometry of the curve, especially which special divisors the curve
carries will be studied. The two postdocs on the grant will work closely with
the Principal Investigator. Cukierman will study the geometry of moduli spaces
associated to algebraic curves. Wu will study infinitesimal invariants of normal
functions. This work is in the very geometric side of algebraic geometry, that
is it emphasizes the geometric and sometimes analytic side of the geometric
objects defined by algebraic equations. This side of algebraic geometry tends to
have applications throughout mathematics.
