This fellowship supports research and training in the area of biophysics. The
thermodynamic and kinetic properties of in vitro and in vivo protein folding are
being studied by computational and analytical methods using lattice and off-
lattice models. The experimental problems being investigated involve protein
design, chaperone mediated folding, modeling of realistic protein structures
such as for cytochrome c and the analytical calculation of folding rates.
