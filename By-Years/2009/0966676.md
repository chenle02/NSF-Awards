The main goal of the Shuar Language Documentation Project is to digitalize and
process over 200 hours of Shuar recordings collected between 1955 and 1965 by
the Salesiano missionary, Father Siro Pellizaro. The recordings will be
digitalized, transcribed and translated. These recordings contain information
and stories which have disappeared from the collective memory of the current
generation of Shuar (Jivaro).

A strength of this proposal is the degree of collaboration with the Shuar. Young
Shuar will be trained to carry out the bulk of the work themselves. During this
process they will not only obtain important skills, but increase their knowledge
and involvement with their own culture. The majority of indigenous cultures in
South America, and indeed the world have undergone immense cultural and language
shifts during the last century. The project will provide a rich database for
those interested in language and culture change. The information will be
invaluable for linguists, anthropologists, historians, botanists and other
scholars.
