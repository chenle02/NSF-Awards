9604408 Berridge This project investigates how neural systems in the brain
control the sequential order of movements so as to produce effective,
coordinated action. The neural system targeted by the project, the striatum, is
known to control movement and some aspects of natural behavior, and in humans it
also appears to help coordinate the sequence of words in language and the
sequence of thought patterns. The goal of this project is to reveal the identity
and characteristics of the crucial neural circuits within the striatum that are
most involved in controlling sequential patterns of behavior, and to understand
how they provide normal coordination. Experiments test the hypothesis that the
sequencing circuit uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to communicate between
neurons in the striatum in order to increase the strength of particular natural
sequential patterns of action in an adaptive, goal-directed way. The project
also examines how the striatum uses modulation of sensory processing and
responsiveness to control sequential coordination of movements. The results of
the project improve the understanding of how the brain coordinates normal
behavior. They may also provide insights into the processes that are disturbed
in human diseases that are characterized by abnormal sequences of movement or
thought (for example, Huntington's Disease, Tourettes Syndrome, or obsessive-
compulsive disorder),
