This project is an investigation of the genetic structure of life history
variation among highly variable populations of the mountain dusky salamander
that lives throughout the Appalachian Mountains. Within discrete mountain
systems, strong predictable clines in a suite of life history traits are
evident, and phenotypic patterns contrast with the geographic structure
suggested by allozyme and ethological traits. The proposed work is to use mtDNA
RFLPS as characters in phylogenetic reconstruction analyses to elucidate the
genetic history of these populations. Knowledge of the genetic diversity of
groups such as these may help in better management and conservation practices in
the Southern Appalachians.
