Forty U.S. authors will attend and participate in the First Japan-USA Joint
Symposium on Flexible Automation in Osaka, Japan, July 14-16, 1986. This meeting
will focus on the control and design of robots, vehicles, flexible manufacturing
systems and their key elements. This symposium provides an international forum
for technical discussions on current research into flexible automation. The
researchers will also have an opportunity to observe first hand advances in this
field in Japan by attending the exhibition held concurrently with the symposium
and the scheduled technical visits to industry and institutes in Japan.
