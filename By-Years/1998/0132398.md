People pursue a variety of life goals, seeking to move closer to their "ideal
selves" by succeeding professionally, acquiring material possessions, developing
desirable dispositions and abilities, and improving their physical and spiritual
selves. Such goal pursuits do not transpire in a vacuum. Human dispositions,
motives, and behavioral tendencies are fashioned at least in part by
interpersonal experience. Among the many forces that shape the self, few if any
"sculptors" exert effects as powerful as those of our close partners. Such
effects can vary from exceedingly positive to exceedingly negative: Some close
partners help bring out the best in each other, supporting and promoting one
another's goal pursuits, whereas others either fail to do so or bring out the
worst in each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project identifies a process
termed the "Michelangelo phenomenon," a congenial pattern of interdependence
whereby close partners sculpt one another in such a manner as to bring each
person closer to his or her ideal self. A key variable in this process is
"partner affirmation," or the degree to which a partner's perceptions of and
behavior toward the self are congruent with the self's ideal. Partner
affirmation has been shown to be associated not only with greater personal
growth (movement toward the ideal self) and enhanced personal well-being, but
also with adjustment and vitality in ongoing relationships. This project
explores several previously unexamined components of this phenomenon by
continuing a longitudinal study of ongoing marital relationships.&lt;br/&gt;
