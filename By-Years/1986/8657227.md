The growth and device applications of ultra-thin epitaxial semiconductor layers
will be investigated. Growth experiments will involve the application of the
Limited Reaction Processing technique to minimize the thermal exposure of
strained layers. The technique also allows for the in-situ growth of multiple
layers of different composition. Such in-situ processing could be a crucial step
in meeting the uniformity and yield requirements of future generations of VLSI
technology. The use of vapor phase source gases also gives a process that has
the potential to be easily scaled up for industry. The device experiments will
exploit the material properties of these layers to develop new kinds of
electronic and opto-electronic devices. Fundamental studies of the electronic
properties of these layers, and their dependence on growth techniques, as well
as actual device fabrication are planned. Initial experiments will be designed
to explore the SiGe system and other silicon-based heterostructures.
