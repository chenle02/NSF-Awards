This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-fifth and twenty-
sixth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic
Combinatorics (FPSAC), to be held in Paris (2013) and Chicago (2014). The most
important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world,
FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely
with top mathematicians from many countries. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the
conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics
such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory
and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer
science, physics, and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
