This award will provide partial support for the 2004 Correlated Electron Systems
Gordon Research Conference to be held in South Hadley, MA, on 20 - 25 June 2004.
The traditional emphasis of the meeting has been on understanding material
systems with novel electronic properties, such as heavy fermion metals, oxide
superconductors, and low-dimensional magnets. The understanding of strongly
correlated electron materials contains many fundamental challenges as well as a
number of possibilities for technological impact. In an effort to break down the
traditional boundaries between communities with common research goals, the 2004
conference will include sessions on charge and spin in nanoengineered systems of
reduced dimensionality and on manipulation and control of ultracold atoms.
Support for the conference will enable the participation of under-funded junior
researchers and members of historically under-represented groups.
