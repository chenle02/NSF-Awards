This exploratory project will restructure the Freshman Engineering Program (FEP)
in the College of Engineering at the University of Cincinnati (UC) to include
new approaches to teaching, emphasize engineering applications of material being
taught concurrently in courses such as Calculus and Physics, and provide
students with information regarding career opportunities in various fields of
engineering through interaction with leading engineers from local industries.
This is expected to increase the graduation rate of students in FEP. The effect
of restructuring FEP will be evaluated by comparing the performance in Calculus
and Physics of students who have participated in the restructured program with
that of students who participated in FEP before the restructuring.

This project is part of a long-term program to transform undergraduate education
in the College which will include formation of a Department of Engineering
Education (DEE) to lead and coordinate undergraduate education in the College,
especially during the critical first two years. The results of this project will
help determine the effect that teaching methods, advising, and mentoring have on
retention to graduation and on performance in the workplace for students at UC.
The knowledge and methods developed will help address the growing need for
engineers in Ohio and in the nation.
