The three-day conference will include researchers and other stakeholders working
on issues around academic sexual misconduct. This conference is necessary since
most work related to sexual misconduct has focused on student-student sexual
harassment and there is limited research, knowledge-sharing, and expertise on
faculty or staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher education.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will be the first international forum to
share resources, discuss barriers, and identify institutional practices on
academic sexual misconduct. The outcomes of this conference include an open-
access online repository of resources, conference proceedings, and
recommendations for best practices for preventing and addressing faculty or
staff sexual misconduct in institutions of higher
education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
