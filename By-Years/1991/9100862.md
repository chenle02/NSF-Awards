This award provides funds to support undergraduate students at Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory for an intensive ten-week long summer research experience. The
students are housed on grounds and each one is assigned to a permanent
Laboratory staff member to perform an independent research project in the
mentor's field of expertise. Each student begins his or her project with the
advisor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work independently.
This allows students to develop to their full potential and to sample first hand
the excitement of experimental science. During the program, the students present
two series of seminars: one in which the students describe their proposed
research and a final series in which the results of each project are summarized.
There is also a series of seminars specifically for the undergraduates in
addition to daily lectures given as part of the Laboratory series of post-
graduate biology courses. This undergraduate research program is very
oversubscribed and, therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who, with
proper direction, are likely to make a contribution to science in their ensuing
careers. Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting minorities to encourage them to
pursue scientific careers.
