Animals respond to environments that are low in oxygen by increasing their
breathing. This increase in breathing is stimulated by oxygen sensitive cells in
a structure called the carotid body. There are a number of theories about how
the carotid body cells can transduce the signal of low oxygen levels (hypoxia)
in the blood into nerve signals to the brain that cause the increase in
breathing, but which theory is correct remains unresolved. Oxygen is carried in
the blood on hemoglobin that is present in red blood cells. Hemoglobin is a so-
called 'heme'-protein and there are other heme-proteins in other cells in the
body. One of the theories about how carotid body cells sense changes in oxygen
levels is via a heme-protein that can bind oxygen either inside the cell or at
its membrane. &lt;br/&gt;Comparative studies of several species of mammals,
birds and even some reptiles have demonstrated a good correlation between the
affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, or the ease with which hemoglobin binds
oxygen, and the amount of decline in oxygen in the blood required to stimulate
an increase in breathing. The mechanism underlying this observation may be a
matching or commonality of oxygen binding characteristics of the b-type heme
protein binding oxygen in the blood and a b-type heme protein binding oxygen in
the oxygen sensitive cells of the carotid bodies. If this is the case, the
mechanism may help elucidate not only how the carotid bodies work but how the
control of breathing has evolved to be well matched to the oxygen transport
properties of the blood. &lt;br/&gt;To explore this concept further this project
will investigate two strains of rats that exhibit different breathing and
metabolic responses to reduced oxygen or hypoxia. The binding characteristics of
their hemoglobin will be determined to see if they differ, and the response
characteristics, or sensitivity, of their carotid bodies to hypoxia will be
measured to determine whether or not the differences in hypoxic sensitivity of
the whole animal, in terms of breathing and metabolism, can be related to
differences in the hypoxic sensitivity of the carotid body. If they are related,
then future comparative studies of heme-proteins in the carotid bodies and
oxygen sensitive ion channels will be conducted. If not, then alternative
hypotheses about the mechanisms controlling the different hypoxic sensitivities
will be pursued. &lt;br/&gt;
