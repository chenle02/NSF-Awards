All eukaryotic organisms appropriately examined have been shown to possess the
capacity for endogenous temporal control and organization. The cellular
machinery that generates this ability is known collectively as the biological
clock. The importance of a detailed understanding of the circadian clock rests
on the apparent ubiquity of its influence on cellular and organismal processes.
Phylogenetically this ranges from control of cell division and enzyme activities
in unicells, to a multiplicity of human systems including endocrine function,
work rest cycles and sleep, and drug tolerances and effectiveness. Extensive
research in the past has thus demonstrated the extent and significance of clock
control of gene expression and enzyme activities, but in general little is known
regarding how clocks control the metabolism of the cells in which they operate.
One salient aspect of this regulation is clock control of mRNA abundance. We
have identified three genes that give rise to mRNAs whose levels are
unequivocally under circadian clock control. We propose to determine through
what mechanism(s) the clock is exerting its control on these genes, and in this
way to begin to identify the intracellular currency for temporal regulation.
Additionally, using one of these genes as a starting point, we will develop and
implement a mutant selection scheme that can be used to identify novel genetic
loci affecting clock function and suppressors of existing clock genes.
