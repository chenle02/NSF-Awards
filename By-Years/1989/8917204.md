Socorro and San Benedicto Islands in the Eastern Pacific Ocean are remarkable
because they are located on the axis of a recently abandoned spreading center
(-3.15 Ma ago) and yet are still volcanically active. Moreover, Socorro Island
is unique in being the only predominantly salic peralkaline oceanic island in
the Pacific Ocean. This research will document the geologic and geochemical
histories of Socorro and San Benedicto Islands in the context of ridge failure.
Major and trace element, 40Ar-39Ar geochronology, and Sr, Nd, Pb, and Th
isotopic analyses of whole rocks, glasses and phenocrysts will be conducted on
samples from submarine topographic highs in the region. The purpose of the
research is to: 1) characterize the geochemical evolution of Socorro and San
Benedicto Islands; 2) constrain the depth and possibly volume of the magma
reservoir beneath Socorro; 3) document the relative importance of compositional
stratifications versus mafic recharge in explaining both the eruptive history of
Socorro Island and the origin of salic peralkaline magmas; and 4) 4) establish
the temporal and geochemical relationship between sources of recent regional
magmatism and those of the abandoned mid-ocean spreading center.
