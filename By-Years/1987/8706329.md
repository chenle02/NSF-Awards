This project addresses problems in the design and implementation of interactive
program development environments for modern programming languages. These
environments are specially designed to aid both novice and experienced
programmers in the creation of correct and reliable programs. Particular topics
to be studied include: (1) Automatic generation of programming language
interpreters from formal specifications. Automatic generation of interpreters
speeds their creation and makes them more reliable. In interactive environments,
interpreters allow program testing to be intermixed with program creation and
editing. (2) Properties of a program, including variable and type declarations,
can often be inferred from the body of a program. Such inferencing can eliminate
the tedium of inserting, by hand, redundant information. Inferencing can also be
used to explore the effects of program changes before they are made. The
automatic selection of alternative library routines can also be supported. (3)
Traditional programming language design techniques are very slow and error
prone. This project will extend interactive programming support tools to the
realm of language design, supporting interactive programming language design and
evaluation.
