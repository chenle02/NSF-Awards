Gonzaga University will initiate an eight-week, residential and commuter Young
Scholars project in Biology and Chemistry for 21 students entering grades 10-12.
Activities include research seminars presented by the seven faculty
participants, a tour of the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, and social
events with students, parents, and faculty. Two Saturday sessions and
interaction with a distinguished visiting scientist during the school year will
provide follow-up to the eight-week summer program, and will also acquaint non-
participating students with science opportunities.
