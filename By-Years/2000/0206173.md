Nitrogen is an essential nutrient to all plants and animals, yet it limits plant
growth in many arctic lakes. The Arctic has warmed 2 degrees in the last 30
years. This warming causes frozen ground to melt and nitrogen inputs to lake
increase. It is imperative to understand how nitrogen controls plant growth in
order to predict how arctic lakes will respond to climate change. Even though
the atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, it is unavailable to most plants. Only
specialized bacteria can "fix" atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into forms
that are available to plants. If these bacteria can fix nitrogen fast enough,
plant growth will not be nitrogen limited. However, nitrogen-fixing bacteria do
not alleviate the shortage of nitrogen in arctic lakes. The goal of this study
is to examine how temperature, light, nutrients, and grazers interact to control
nitrogen fixation in these arctic lakes.
