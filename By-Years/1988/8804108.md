Obslervations by paleomagnetists indicate that small multidomain grains play an
important role in rock remanent magnetization. In contrast to this, there is
presently no generally accepted theory of how small non-uniformly magnetized
grains can acquire and retain a magnetization. The existence of local energy
minimum (LEM) domain states, the high stability of LEM states, and the intrinsic
magnetic moments of small multidomain grains, suggests a model of fine particle
magnetization which may rectify this situation. A remanence dependence on these
properties is called a "trans-domain" remanent magnetization. The PI will
develop this model into a theory of fine particle remanent magnetization. This
will be accomplished by the development of numerical models and placing the
results of these computations within the framework of statistical mechanics. The
theory of trans-domain remanent magnetization has the potential to explain the
physical origin of a number of natural remanent magnetizations important to the
field of paleomagnetism.
