Coral reef fishes occur as local populations occupying patches of habitat.
These populations comprise the basis of one of the most speciose assemblages of
marine organisms, with hundreds of species coexisting locally. Our knowledge of
the ecolgical processes that limit population size is scant and historically has
been biased toward studies of competition, and more recently, recruitment (the
process of young fish appearing on a reef following settlement of planktonic
larvae). Due to a variety of logistic constraints, other processes have not been
thoroughly studied. This is especially true of predation, which has been
demonstrated to be an extremely important process in other marine, freshwater,
and terrestrial communities. Dr. Hixon will investigate two corollaries of the
hypothesis that predation limits local population sizes in reef-fishes: (1)
survivorship of newly settled fish will be enhanced on reefs where resident
and/or transient piscivorous fish are removed; and (2) these effects on
survivorship will vary with the magnitude of recruitment. These will be tested
by controlled experimental manipulations of predatory fish on isolated patch
reefs at two sites: Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas, and St. Thomas in the U.
S. Virgin Islands.
