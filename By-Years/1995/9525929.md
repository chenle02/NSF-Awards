9525929 Spanos The research program involves wavelet bases for addressing the
structural mechanics problem of simulating random fields. Wavelets exhibit a
variety of useful properties and they have become an essential part of modern
engineering analysis. It is expected that the study will lead to quite efficient
Monte Carlo simulation algorithms. The results will be applicable to a broad
class of random fields commonly encountered in engineering practice such as
earthquake, wind and construction engineering. Preliminary results obtained in
this context are quite encouraging. All related aspects of the problem of
simulating random fields using different kinds of wavelet bases will be
carefully investigated. Upon completing the study of the theoretical aspects of
the problem, a user oriented computer program will be developed for simulating
one-and multi-dimensional random fields. Applications from civil and mechanical
engineering will be considered.
