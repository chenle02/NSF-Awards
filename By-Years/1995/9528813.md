9528813 Shadman The National Science Foundation and the Semiconductor Research
Corporation have entered into a partnership to jointly select, support, and
provide oversight for this new Engineering Research Center in Environmentally
Benign Semiconductor Manufacturing. The University of Arizona is the lead
institution along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford
University and the University of California at Berkeley. The award is for five
years with the possibility of renewal for an additional five years." The vision
of the proposed ERC is to create a unique multi-disciplinary culture to educate
a new generation of engineering leaders and to produce critical pre-competitive
science and technology for environmentally benign semiconductor manufacturing.
The goals of the center are: (1) to advance the fundamental science and
technology needed to reduce the water usage, the waste and hazardous chemicals
discharge, and the use of energy and chemicals, through source reduction,
process alternatives/modifications, and emission abatement, (2) to develop a
fundamental integrated approach to the design of environmentally benign
processes, (3) to develop new educational programs for teaching environmental
concepts to students who plan to work in the semiconductor industry, and (4) to
establish a pre-competitive and pro-active partnership between industry,
government, and academic communities. One of the major results from this center
will be engineers and scientists educated in several disciplines who will be
capable of incorporating environmental concerns into semiconductor manufacture
from the inception of process design. The research is organized within the
following six thrust areas: (a) plasma processes, (b) non-plasma etch, clean and
rinse processes, (c) integrated chemical mechanical polishing and clean
processes, (d) water and aqueous chemicals, (e) metrology and sensors for
environmental applications, and (f) exploratory areas for future thrusts. For
the semiconductor manufacturing industry to remain competitive and socially
responsible, environmentally friendly processes must be engineered from
inception since it is too costly and impractical to retrofit existing billion
dollar fabrication facilities. This center can create the urgently needed focus,
momentum and visibility to make a major impact on the semiconductor industry.
Unlike other areas in this industry, the proposed work is unlikely to be
realized except through a coordinated investment of public and private funds.
The environmental acceptability and efficient use of chemicals in manufacturing
will increasingly influence the cost of the technology, and thusly the rate of
technological development.
