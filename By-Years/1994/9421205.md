This is a Small Grant for Exploratory research (SGER) proposal to complete the
construction of 5 Electric Field Floats (EEF) and deploy them as part of an
oceanographic experiment. The EEF is a float, that when deployed together with a
conventional RAFOS float, provides a measurement of the vertically averaged or
barotropic velocities. The purpose of this SGER proposal is to complete the
construction of 5 EEFs from parts on hand and deploy them from the Canadian R/V
Hudson as part of a joint scientific program. This experiment will allow them to
test the performance of the instruments, coordinate modifications with other
investigators, contribute observations to a pool of conventional measurements
and provide unique observations of the partition of barotropic and baroclinic
velocity components.
