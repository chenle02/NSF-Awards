Humans can produce significant dynamic loads, both while remaining in place and
moving. Most building codes prescribe uniformly distributed static design live
loads for offices, corridors, and public assembly areas such as shopping malls,
airport terminals, gymnasia and dance floors. PIs' previous studies have defined
forces caused by in situ activities. The objectives of the research are: (a) to
define the dynamic loads generated by activities involving motion such as
walking and running; and (b) to establish the benefits and efficiency of low
power semiactive control technologies to mitigate excessive structural response
due to phase related occupant loads. A special force platform, with a flat
transfer function in the frequency range of the anticipated loads, will be
constructed, instrumented and used to measure forces generated by one, two, and
groups of subjects while performing prescribed activities. Loads due to
individuals and groups will be characterized using analytical functions,
multivariate regression analysis, and random simulation. Simulated results will
be compared with measured data for small groups and design loads will be
suggested both in time and frequency domains. A lightweight test floor system
will be constructed in the second phase of the project. The dynamic
characteristics of the floor system will be determined experimentally and
analytically. The structure will be instrumented with a variable damper device.
The variation in damping will be accomplished by using variable area in the
damper mechanisms. The test floor will be loaded by both in situ and moving
occupants and the response will be controlled using a closed loop system.
