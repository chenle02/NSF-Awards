The current generation of retargetable compilers can easily generate optimal
local code incorporating most instructions and all addressing implemented by the
target machine architecture. However, these compilers can not utilize the
complex instructions found on many CISC target machine architectures. These
instructions typically manipulate fields and strings, or implement complex loop
control mechanisms. The project will seek to construct a retargetable compiler
than can exploit complex instructions when compiling programs written in a high
level language in the Algol family. The system will have two pieces. The code
generator will be an attributed influenced graph matcher that can match and
transform an intermediate representation into a form that is directly matched by
a complex instruction. A high level language will be used to specify the actions
performed by a complex instruction. The specification will be analyzed and
transformed at code generation time into a plan that the code generator uses.
