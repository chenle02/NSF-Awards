Rinaldo Schinazi proposes new probability models in population biology. The
models are spatial (interacting particle systems) or non spatial. A special
effort is made to formulate models simple enough so that rigorous analysis is
possible but still interesting and relevant to the biological questions. Models
introduced by Schinazi often generate new and interesting mathematical
questions.

Rinaldo Schinazi proposes to study theoretical population biology questions
using probability models. The starting point is always a concrete question such
as: "Does a low mutation rate for stem cells protect from cancer?" or "Can the
immune system be overwhelmed by a particular virus only because of its high
mutation rate?" The end point is the testing of biology hypotheses or the
formulation of new hypotheses.
