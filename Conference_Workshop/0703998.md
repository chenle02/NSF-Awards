Applied Inverse Problems, 2007

The proposal is to provide support for the participation of US graduate
students, post-docs and other researchers in the International Conference on
Applied Inverse Problems to be held in Vancouver Canada in June 2007.

Inverse problems are one where the causes of observed effects are to be
determined from observations of a system. Applications arise throughout science
and engineering; important examples include biomedical imaging, location of
underground oil or mineral deposits and nondestructive testing. This conference
brings together mathematicians, computer scientists and scientists in both
universities and industry and is held every two years. It is the premier
conference on the subject and the proceedings will be published.
