This research project is concerned with making and characterizing thin epitaxial
ferromagnetic films, heterostructures, multilayer systems and superlattices.
Emphasis is placed on systems containing iron to permit Mossbauer spectroscopy,
including measurements of the magnetic hyperfine field. Work will be extended
and completed on (100) and (110) iron films grown with several other metals,
including silver, nickel, manganese, chromium, copper, terbium, and gadolinium.
Special attention will be devoted to interlayer magnetic coupling studied by
looking at changes in the thermal spin-wave behavior of the systems.
Characterization techniques for the systems include reflection high energy
electron diffraction, low energy electron diffraction, Auger spectroscopy, x-ray
measurements, scanning electron microscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and Kerr effect
magneto-optical analysis.
