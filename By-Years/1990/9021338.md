This FAW recipient is internationally known in the fields of biostratigraphy
and paleoceanography. This award will allow her to concentrate future research
efforts, in part, on the evolution of the Tertiary fauna after the K/T boundary
mass extinction. And,it would permit long range research planning, and
completion of a Maastrichtian through Cenozoic quantitative data base to provide
constraints on climate modeling, oceanic circulation models and evolutionary
theories. //
