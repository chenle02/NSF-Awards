This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program to support the research of
Dr. David Schuster of New York University on the photochemistry and photophysics
of cyclic unsaturated ketones. Properties of triplet excited states and reaction
intermediates formed in the photoexcitation of cyclic enones in the presence and
absence of alkenes will be studied by nanosecond flash photolysis, photoacoustic
calorimetry and time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The goal is to
obtain data which will allow specification of the molecular structures and
energies of singlet and triplet states, strained trans isomers of cyclic enones
and of triplet 1,4-biradical intermediates. These studies will establish how
energetic relaxation in cyclic enone triplets is affected by ring size and
substitution and how molecular structure affects rates of spin inversions to
ground states from triplet excited states, a matter of fundamental significance
in organic photochemistry. Mechanistic studies of the synthetically important
photocycloaddition of cyclic enones to olefins will be carried out. In
particular, secondary deuterium isotope effects will be determined for quenching
of enone triplets by alkenes and for formation of cycloadducts in order to
determine if enone-alkene exciplexes of any kind are on the reaction pathway to
triplet 1,4-biradicals.
