9350850 McGranaghan This project will allow the introduction of a Fluorescence
Spectrophotometer into the chemistry curriculum. Fluorescence experiments will
be added to the laboratory exercises scheduled for general, organic, physical,
analytical, and biochemical courses. It will also be used in projects designed
for Honors or Senior Research. This project will increase the knowledge and
skills of undergraduate women science students as they prepare for careers in
science, medicine or education. ***
