This CSEMS scholarship program at the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio is a
partnership between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, the School of
Engineering and Applied Science, and the Department of Computer Science and
Systems Analysis. The project provides some 29 scholarships for first-year
students, transfer students and graduate students. The project increases student
graduation rates while improving academic performance. It enhances the academic
environment for CSEMS scholars as they complete an undergraduate or graduate
degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or
Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The first year students
will live in the residence halls that are part of Miami's "Living and Learning
Communities". The living and learning communities support students as they begin
their scholarly journey. The mission of these communities is to create and
extend learning opportunities outside the classroom that heighten student
intellectual and personal growth, and they integrate curricular with co-
curricular experiences that complement and extend classroom learning. These
environments foster faculty and resident interactions that build a strong sense
of community for the students. The theme for the CSEMS students will be
"Technology: Cross Disciplinary Usage". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
The project includes efforts to recruit and retain minorities from
underrepresented groups by leveraging Ohio's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority
Participation program. Students are connected to the career/advising/mentoring
services of the university and the support structures designed specifically for
CSEMS scholars.&lt;br/&gt;
