The mathematical field of complex analysis has found diverse application in
applied and pure sciences such as engineering and theoretical physics; complex
analysis is also of foundational importance in certain subfields of mathematics.
For example, physical phenomena can often be modeled with differential
equations, and certain of these equations are best understood using techniques
issuing from the study of complex numbers. Another example is provided by string
theory in theoretical physics. Aspects of this model of high energy physics
require a deep understanding of the geometry of complex numbers. This project is
focussed on the geometry of spaces where complex and real variables interact.
The spaces studied with this geometry have a certain complexity that is not yet
well understood but is of great interest in the mathematical community. The PI
will study this complexity and work towards building proper foundations for the
field.

The PI will study the CR complexity of holomorphic mappings and real
submanifolds or real singular subvarieties. The key method is to study the
Hermitian matrix of coefficients of the defining equations. This approach links
the complexity of a real submanifold to a CR mapping to a hyperquadric, that is
a hypersurface defined by a Hermitian form. Hyperquadrics are the model
submanifolds in CR geometry. The greater the complexity of a submanifold, the
greater the dimension that the target hyperquadric must live in, and the greater
the complexity of the CR mapping involved. In particular the PI is interested in
further refining the results on the singular set of Levi-flat hypersurfaces,
that is sets which have in some sense the smallest CR complexity. The proposed
method is to refine the Segre variety approach that was successfully used in the
PI's previous work on the subject. To study the complexity of the set of the
mappings involved, it is necessary to also understand the complexity of mappings
between hyperquadrics themselves. The PI will work to refine the quantitative
results in previous work by applying a mix of techniques from commutative
algebra and analysis that has proved successful before. This work will then be
applied to more general domains.
