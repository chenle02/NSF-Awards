1428857&lt;br/&gt;Elwood-Madden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of an imaging Raman
microscope to allow for non-destructive, high resolution (micron scale) and time
resolved studies of geological, biological, environmental, archeological, and
engineered materials. The Raman microscope would have automated x-y-z
translatable stage, dual-wavelength laser excitation sources, and variable
temperature (-196 to 600 degree C) sample chamber. Specific studies that would
take advantage of the Raman system would include in situ observations of fluid
alteration and weathering processes at mineral surfaces, studies of gas
clathrate formation and dissociation processes in permafrost and deep-sea
environments, studies of biologically mediated material corrosion processes, and
trace metal speciation and oxidation/reduction mechanisms in natural and
contaminated systems. The instrument would serve faculty and their students
across several departments at Oklahoma and the PIs intend to engage
underrepresented students in experiential learning through an extant Louis
Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics program at the University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
