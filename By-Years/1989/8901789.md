The aim is to construct efficient query processing strategies in a general
distributed database environment. The database management systems at different
sites may bedifferent; the network can be a local network or a long.haulnetwork
or an interconnection of local networks by longdistance lines; the queries
submitted by the user can be standard database queries or logic queries,
permitting deduction. The system being developed needs to be capable of learning
important semantic information from previously processed queries so that future
queries can be processed efficiently. In this project, new strategies will be
implemented and their performance will be compared to strategies proposed by
other researchers. An integration of useful strategies will be carried out.
Results in the following areas are expected: new techniques to acquire knowledge
for semantic query optimization; new techniques to process logic queries
efficiently; and implementation principles for efficient query processing. These
results will have a significant influence on the design of advanced query
processing systems.
