Teams of faculty mentors from biological sciences and mathematical sciences are
working with groups of undergraduate majors in biology and mathematics on
projects stemming from four research themes: Biomolecular Sequence Analysis,
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Gene Expression and Proteomics Data Analysis,
and Protein Structure Prediction. Faculty members and students from both the
biological and mathematical sciences are also bringing about changes in the
undergraduate curricula of both disciplines. This includes modifications in the
contents of a number of biology and mathematics courses and establishing new
bioinformatics undergraduate courses, which will be the foundation for graduate
degree studies in bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: In
addition to the mathematical and scientific contributions directly resulting
from the research projects, this training program develops an interactive
investigative approach that combines rigorous mathematical methods, current
computing technology, and careful experimental verification together in research
endeavors. The validation of prediction results by wet-lab experiments will
encourage experimental scientists to make use of mathematical concepts and
computational methodology with confidence to assist their scientific
pursuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: At a minority-serving
institution with over 70% Hispanic students, the faculty investigators leading
this project serve as mentors and role models to encourage more woman and
minority students to engage in interdisciplinary scientific research. The
faculty investigators also form a consortium for exchanging information and
knowledge for research and education, and they integrate parts of this research
in their teaching. For the participating students, this project provides
collaborative interactions and research training that personalizes their
educational experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is partially
supported by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
