ABSTRACT EEC-9614219 Naylor Microfabrication research is opening up new areas
for specialized thrusts. One such thrust is microfluidics which can be applied
to miniature chemical analysis systems, micro-hydraulic actuators, precision
fluid dispensing systems and microfluidic component manufacturers. Research in
this area will expand the technological base for many possible applications.
This planning grant will fund an industry/university meeting to determine the
economic viability of forming an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Microfluidics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The research agenda
proposed for consideration in the envisioned Center encompasses: 1) Packaging
for microfluidics devices; 2) Integration of microfluidic devices with sensors;
3) Thru-wafer interconnects; 4) Microfluidic cooling devices in miniature high
power devices; 5) Design and modeling of microfluidic components: micropumps and
microvalves; 6) Miniature drug delivery systems; 7) Miniature chemical analysis
systems; 8) Fundamental studies of anisotropic etching for microfluidic
components; 9) Optical monitoring and diagnostics for miniature fluidic devices;
10) Magneto hydrodynamic micropumps and solder dispensing with microfluidic
devices; 11) Microhydraulic power systems; 12) Miniature NMR instruments.
