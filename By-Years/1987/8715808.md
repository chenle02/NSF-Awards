This project provides partial support for the operations of the world-renowned
Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC). The project will support the continued
maintenance, collection, improvement and distribution of genetic stocks of the
genera Neurospora and Aspergillus and, to a lesser extent, of other filamentous
fungi. The ready availability of over 6000 reliable genetic stocks from FGSC has
markedly stimulated the use of these organisms for research in genetics,
molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, systematics, oncology and other
related fields, as well as for educational purposes. FGSC also maintains and
distributes a cosmid library of Neurospora crassa sequences and intends to do
the same for Aspergillus nidulans, as well as distributing cloned genes from
filamentous fungi. In addition to culture-collection activities, the FGSC
prepares and publishes the Fungal Genetics Newsletter, an informal scientific
communication with a circulation of 600. The Newsletter also serves as a vehicle
for the publication of the FGSC catalogue of available cultures.
