This exploratory study will analyze and understand the ways in which players of
World of Warcraft, a popular multiplayer game, engage in creative collaboration.
World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game with ten
million players worldwide. The proposed research is novel in locating creativity
in the context of collaboration in a distributed online space. Most creativity
research is laboratory based. It takes the individual as the unit of analysis.
This research will examine creativity as a collaborative act, and will
investigate creativity in a distributed online context.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on modding - the creation and
distribution of player-created software modifications that extend the game - as
an act of creative collaboration. What is the effect of collaboration on
creativity? What motivates players to maintain engagement? How does the game
software itself support or hinder collaboration? What interaction tools do
players use to undertake creative collaboration? What can be learned from
creative collaboration in games about mediated collaboration in general? Can
these principles be translated to other environments such as work, or does the
very context of "play" have inherent qualities that cannot be easily translated?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing confluence of work and play in games and
virtual worlds is a topic of growing interest in industry and the military. The
practices of millions of young people are being shaped by participation in
multiplayer games. Players will take these practices into the workplace and
military service. Investigating how creativity is enabled by collaborative
online practices is vital to our understanding of how work and military service
can be reshaped to encourage and sustain creative activity in these arenas.
