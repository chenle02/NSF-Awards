A modern ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer and an electronic
analytical balance are used to improve courses in cell physiology and organic
chemistry. In cell physiology experiments in protein characterization, enzyme
kinetics, DNA quantitation, and chromatographic purification and assay of egg
white lysozyme are upgraded. In the organic chemistry laboratory ultraviolet-
visible spectroscopy enhances student understanding of the relationship of
structure to spectra, the determination of the distribution of coefficients of
ketones, and the study of the spectral consequences of hydrogen bonding. The
grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
