It is proposed to collect a one-month time series of detailed spectral profiles
of light attenuation in the upper 250 m of the Western Pacific Warm Pool as part
of the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) of the Tropical Ocean Global
Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) that is to
take place in late 1992- early 1993. Supporting measurements of incident solar
radiation, surface wind, as well as water sample collection, will be conducted
to estimate the heat flux through the mixed layer.
