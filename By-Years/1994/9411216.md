Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) exhibit a constellation of traits
associated with a monogamous social organization including the formation of pair
bonds between males and females. Among characteristics of pair bonding are
preferences for a familiar partner, usually of the opposite sex. Preliminary
data indicate that in male prairie voles corticosterone treatment produces a
dose-dependent increase in the preference for a familiar female partner; in
contrast in females it appears that treatment with corticosterone inhibits
partner preference formation. Conversely adrenalectomy, which eliminates
corticosterone secretion, reduces pair bonding in males and facilitates pair
bond formation in females. In the proposed research, this investigator will: (1)
examine the behavioral and endocrine parameters associated with the behavioral
effects of corticosterone. These studies will document the amount of stimulation
necessary to form a clear partner preference in males versus females.
Concurrently, she will (2) examine the time course of changes in endogenous
corticosterone titers following exposure to a member of the opposite sex. In
addition, she will (3) continue her studies of the behavioral effects of
corticosterone to determine dose response curves for the above behavioral
changes. Finally, she will (4) compare the behavioral effects of exogenous
corticosterone to those of a stress-induced release of corticosterone. The
results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the physiology
of social attachment and social organization. The existence of social bonds is
widely accepted, but we know relatively little - especially in adults - about
the factors that regulate the formation of social attachments.
