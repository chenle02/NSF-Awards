It is the contention of this project that the theory of local public finance is
based on a misspecified "production function" for local services--one that omits
the important role that community characteristics play in determining levels of
public output. This misspecification has both important positive and normative
implications. The positive implications concerning biased estimates of price and
income elasticities have been the subject of some attention in the literature.
But the normative implications have been largely ignored. In particular, the
central results of the Tiebout model, namely that an optimal system of
jurisdiction is characterized by communities that are homogeneous in the demand
for local services, no longer holds in a world in which community composition is
an important determinant of outputs of local public goods. This study develops a
general theory of local finance in a setting where community composition
influences local public outputs. The focus here is determining how the optimal
composition of local jurisdictions depends on the interaction of individuals in
the provision of local public goods. This project investigates in econometric
terms the production function of public safety. It uses existing data sets to
explore the form of the relationship between community composition and the
levels of public safety. Finally, a series of simulation studies are made using
specific utility and production functions to examine the optimal structure of
local jurisdictions where community composition matters in the production of
local services.
