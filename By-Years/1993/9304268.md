9304268 Skeel The investigator continues work on numerical methods for molecular
dynamics. The objective is to find numerical algorithms suitable for large
parallel computers that can much more efficiently model the dynamics of
macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and lipids. Emphasis is on the use of
integration schemes, notably symplectic schemes, that can use large time steps
to produce qualitatively correct simulations for long-time integrations. The
goal is to obtain the desired information with the least computational effort,
and the methodology is to use mathematical analysis and computational
experiments on model problems. The techniques developed are to be tested on
realistic molecular models as part of a different, complementary research
project involving software development. Among the techniques to be considered,
the better known ones are multiple time steps, constraint dynamics, and fast
Coulomb solvers. Mathematical formulas and computer programs are being devised
that can predict typical motions of large molecules such as proteins and DNA.
The aim is find shortcuts that enable very fast calculations on large computers.
These ideas are tested for accuracy and speed, and the more useful ones are put
into the software that biologists and other scientists use to study the action
of molecules. Computer simulations can help the scientist to understand how
molecules perform biological functions, which can be very difficult to observe
experimentally. Such studies are also useful in the design of molecules for
agricultural and medical purposes. ***
