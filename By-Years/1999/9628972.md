9628972 Katehi A spatial and temporal adjusted grid will be developed and
applied to simple propagation problems in an effort to further understand the
capabilities of MRTD in analyzing large and complex electromagnetic problems.
During this time period, an extensive comparison between Multi-Resolution, Time
Domain Method (MRTD) and Finite-Difference, Time Domain Method (FDTD) will be
performed in order to quantify the advantages of the new technique in terms of
required computer memory and time. This research will be performed at Michigan
by Prof. Katehi with the help of a graduate student. Prof. Cangellaris will
visit Michigan from May 1996 until the end of July 1996.
