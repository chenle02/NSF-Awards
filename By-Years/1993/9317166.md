9317166 Smethie This proposed work is the analysis of approximately 900 water
samples collected in the course of the Weddell Sea Ice Camp (ISW-1) drift and
two cruises of the RVIB N.B. Palmer for chlorofluoro- carbons (CFC's). The
results will be merged with the hydrographic data set and other tracer data sets
to determine time scales and pathways of bottom water formation. The technique
of collecting of water samples in flame-sealed glass ampoules has obviated the
need for their immediate analysis for CFC's, and will allow the analysis of a
greater number of samples form the ice camp. The merged data sets will be used
to identify sources of newly-formed bottom water, to estimate the time required
to convert shelf water to bottom water, and to determine the extent to which the
newly-formed bottom water is in disequilibrium with atmospheric CFC
concentrations. ***
