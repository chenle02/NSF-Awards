In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo- metallic Chemistry
Program, Dr. Hillhouse will continue his studies on the organometallic chemistry
of nitrous oxide. Specific objectives of the study include the development of
new preparative methods for the synthesis of oxometal complexes, development of
selective methods for oxidation of organic molecules, and exploration of the
binding of nitrous oxide by metal complexes. Both early and late transition
metal systems will be studied. %%% Nitrous oxide has a well deserved reputation
as an unreactive gas; however, thermodynamically it is a very potent oxidant and
when used as an oxidizing reagent would give dinitrogen as an environmentally
benign reduction product. In spite of its usual low reactivity nitrous oxide is
a threat to the environment. Therefore fundamental studies of its reactivity
have the potential for development of an oxidant with no harmful by-products and
to provide for new ways to deal with an environmental threat.
