University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ITR/PE(CISE): Tutoring Explanation and Discovery
Learning: Achieving Deep Understanding through Tutorial
Dialog&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary research project will develop
new instructional software, which will be evaluated in actual classrooms. The
project will yield research advances in computer science, education, and
cognitive psychology. With respect to education, the project will develop and
test new methods of instruction, namely, "tutoring at the explanation level".
These methods aim to achieve deeper student understanding, resulting in better
memory (retention) of the acquired knowledge, as well as the ability to apply
what was learned to unfamiliar problems (transfer). With respect to computer
science, this project will advance the state-of-the-art in intelligent tutoring
systems through the incorporation of natural language processing techniques for
assessing student explanations and improving them through dialog. With respect
to cognitive psychology, this project will create and test cognitive models of
how student understanding emerges from an integration of explicit-verbal and
implicit-perceptual learning processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
