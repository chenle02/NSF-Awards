ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Sottile, Frank J. Proposal Number: DMS - 0800253
Institution: Texas A&M Research Foundation Title: Workshop on Enumeration and
Bounds in Real Algebraic Geometry

A priori information about the real solutions to a system of polynomial
equations is important for the applications of mathematics, which typically only
need the real solutions. The current state of knowledge about this problem,
particularly counting or bounding the numbers of solutions, will be the focus of
a workshop to be held at the Bernoulli Center in the EPFL (Swiss Federal
Technological Institute) in Lausanne, Switzerland the week of April 21 to April
25 in 2008. This is embedded within a semester long program at the Bernoulli
Center on real and tropical algebraic geometry. This project will fund the
participation of scientists from the United States at this workshop.

It is notoriously difficult to extract any information about real solutions to
equations without first solving them completely by finding all complex
solutions. Recent breakthroughs have led to new insights about bounds, both
upper and lower for the number of real solutions to some structured systems of
polynomial equations. There are also new algorithms for only computing the real
solutions. At the same time, a better understanding has arisen about average-
case behavior, and other scientists have begun to apply these results. This
workshop will be small (about 20 participants) and very focused on current
developments and future prospects for this important problem of understanding
the real solutions to polynomial equations.
