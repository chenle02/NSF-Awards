The formation of specific, functional interactions between neurons is critical
to the development of the nervous system. The precise quidance of axons to
target cells is thought to result from a combination of stimulatory and
inhibitory signals. Barrier or boundary structures are hypothesized to function
by inhibiting the growth of embryonic axons into inappropriate environments. Two
proteins, EAP-300 and claustrin, have been identified in the embryonic chick
nervous system and shown to be expressed in barrier structures. The cellular
expression and biochemistry of these two proteins will be studied in detail. In
addition, functional in vitro assays will be performed to determine whether
these proteins negatively regulate axonal growth and interact to mediate the
function of barrier structures. These studies pertain to understanding basic
mechanisms involved in the development of neuronal specificity and the
possibility that barrier-associated molecules impede successful nerve
regeneration in the mammal.
