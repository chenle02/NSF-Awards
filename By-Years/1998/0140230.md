This is an excellent example of a successful program at an undergraduate
institution. The PI has focussed his efforts on experiments of a scale that
allows his undergraduate students to participate effectively. All of the
experiments are at the "sensitivity frontier" and even with a comparatively
large teaching load, the PI has established leadership positions. Further, he is
addressing workforce related issues by coordinating the recruitment of African -
American students.
