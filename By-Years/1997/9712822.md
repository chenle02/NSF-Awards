The notion of chaos and its accompanying consequences have had a profound
impact on our view of a number of phenomena in the macroscopic or classical
world. However, the extension of these ideas to the microscopic quantum world
largely remains a mystery, especially as a correspondence between classical and
quantum phenomena is expected to exist. What is established is that exclusively
quantum effects are seen in classically chaotic systems, behavior collectively
designated as quantum chaology. Two broad classes of `local` and `global`
distinguish effects which are, respectively, sensitive and insensitive to
details of the classical description. In the proposed work, these issues are
considered in the context of a recent atom optics realization of a simple
dynamical paradigm. Building on earlier work with these experiments, one
objective is to study `local` mechanisms in this experimental context with
particular emphasis on contrasting quantum coherence in systems with and without
classical chaos. The possibility of a direct assessment makes this a novel
realization. This would then provide a well-characterized system to assess the
interplay of local and global effects which has broader significance to generic
aspects in dynamics and non- equilibrium phenomena.
