9503794 Isaac This proposal requests funds for Lourdes College to connect to
NSFNET through OARnet. This connection will provide operations management and
information services and it will give the college a 56 thousand bits per second
connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)
National Backbone network. The benefits of this NSFNET connection include e-mail
between local and remote researchers and educators, file transfer capability and
the ability to use remote computer resources. Also the college will have the
ability to investigate innovation in educational resources and incorporate them
into their curricula.
