The shade avoidance syndrome, the ability of plants to elongate and flower
earlier in response to foliage shade, is an ecologically and agriculturally
important example of phenotypic plasticity that may facilitate plant persistence
across a range of light conditions. Despite the apparent adaptive value of the
shade avoidance syndrome, there is variation in the syndrome between populations
of many species. Functional arguments suggest that selection may favor shade
avoidance in open canopy sites but not closed canopy sites. Here population
differentiation in shade avoidance will be examined in seven pairs of open
canopy and woodland populations of the annual species Impatiens capensis. The
adaptive significance of differentiation in shade avoidance will be tested by
comparing quantitative trait variation to neutral marker variation partitioned
between canopy types and among sites. Potential constraints on shade avoidance
will be examined by testing for genetic correlations between traits related to
shade avoidance and traits related to light sensitivity in other life stages.

This research will improve our understanding of an ecological and agriculturally
important trait, and will enrich graduate education by promoting training in
molecular tools and fostering collaboration between ecological geneticists and
systematists at separate institutions.
