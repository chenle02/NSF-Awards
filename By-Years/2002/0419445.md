This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
low cost high temperature oxide ceramic composite for turbine blade application,
with 1700C service temperature capability, excellent strength retention, creep
resistance, high fracture toughness and isotropy. Tailored porosity structures
have been fabricated with interconnected passages suitable for infusion with an
oxide matrix for high strength composites. Sapphire/alumina chemically modified
ceramics (CMC) have been tested at high temperatures and have shown three orders
of magnitude better creep resistance than polycrystalline alumina composites.

The solutions provided by this new technology for ceramic composites will
address the serious cost/performance problems associated with current fiber
based oxide ceramic composites. By elimination of high cost fiber and preforming
steps, these oxide composites will cost orders of magnitude less than current
state of the art oxide composites.
