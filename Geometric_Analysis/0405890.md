ABSTRACT

In this proposal the principal investigator studies various questions related to
Dirac operator. This includes the use of Dirac operator in the study of
stability of Riemannian manifolds and positive scalar curvature metrics and
scalar flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds and other special holonomy
manifolds,the study of the significance of eta invariant in conformal geometry
and locally symmetric spaces, the behavior of analytic torsion under conical
degeneration and the use of conical singularity in the study of geometric
quantization in the singular case.

Dirac operator and related geometric invariants are playing more and more
fundamental and important role in diverse fields of mathematics and physics.
They reveal much about the structures of the underlying spaces. This proposal
aims for better understanding of conformal structures and special metrics
through the use of Dirac operator and explores the connection with the positive
mass theorems in the general relativity. As is well known, Einstein's general
relativity uses geometry to describe gravity, one of the four fundamental forces
in nature, and the most important one in determining the large scale structure
of our universe. The understanding of mass and momentum is thus of crucial
importance in our ultimate understanding of the universe. Calabi-Yau spaces and
other special holonomy spaces are now playing fundamental role in the string
theory, generally considered the best candidate for the ``theory of
everything''.
