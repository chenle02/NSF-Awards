Lasers are now ubiquitous in the modern world. In the past two decades, a myriad
of new applications have arisen due to the ability to sculpt the laser beam
profile for tailor made applications. Annular shaped beams called Laguerre-
Gaussian (LG) beams promise to greatly enhance communications channels, both in
the classical and quantum domains. The variety of applications of LG beams calls
for a large range of operating wavelengths and powers, and at present there is
no unified source. The proposed work is aimed at exploring the basic optical
science needed to create a high-power, tunable, and compact source of LG beams.
The approach is built upon the existing technology of Vertical External Cavity
Surface Emitting Lasers (VECSELs) that have been demonstrated as a source of
high-power and tunable Gaussian beams. Our proposed approach is to introduce
mode control elements into the laser cavity in such a way to force the
generation of LG as opposed to Gaussian beams. Our ultimate goal is to be able
to do this in a way that preserves the high-power, tunability, and compactness
of the existing VECSEL technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Laguerre-Gaussian (LG)
beams are in great demand due to their tremendous utility over a large range of
applied and fundamental sciences. The corresponding light beams carry optical
angular momentum (OAM) and are characterized by a spiral phase variation in the
transverse plane. Despite numerous applications the development of a compact
source of high power and tunable LG modes remains a major challenge. The goal of
the present EAGER proposal is to develop a unified and compact source for LG
modes that can deliver the dual virtues of high power and wavelength tunability.
In particular we shall explore the opportunities and limitations of extending
current VECSEL technology to produce LG beams by means of intracavity mode
conversion, which if successful opens the door to a high-power source of tunable
LG beams. The proposed research therefore has implications for both applied and
basic science, from future communications and information processing
technologies, to fundamental research in quantum information and nanotechnology.
The research will combine modeling and experimental investigation of advanced
semiconductor laser cavity, mode mixing, nonlinear beam generation, and
application based characterization.
