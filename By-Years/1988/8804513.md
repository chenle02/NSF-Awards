This award will establish an REU Site at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in
the department of Bacteriology. This intensive eight-week summer research
program will provide meaningful research experiences in microbiology and
molecular biology to ten undergraduate students. Women, minorities and the
disabled, from institutions where research opportunities are limited or non-
existent will be especially recruited. The long- term objective of this program
is to stimulate promising young scientists to pursue careers in research. The
Department of Bacteriology has an internationally recognized research faculty
who are committed to both graduate and undergraduate education. Participating
students will have the opportunity to work as part of a dynamic research team at
the forefront of basic research. They will be exposed to many modern
microbiological, biochemical and molecular techniques and will use state-of-the-
art research equipment. The Department's proven record of providing laboratory
research opportunities for its own undergraduates will insure success of the REU
project.
