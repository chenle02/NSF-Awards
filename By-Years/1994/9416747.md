9416747 Stolper This is a request for an Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR) to
continue the study of volatiles in basalts. This is important because small
amounts of water and carbon dioxide in the mantle have a large effect on the
amount of melting and the composition of magmas. The research will focus on the
amount of water and carbon dioxide, the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen, and the
abundance of trace elements in back-arc basin basalts. They will determine the
isotopic composition of basalts to understand the effect of the variable
composition of the mantle above a subducting plate on the compositions of lavas.
They will also conduct experiments to understand the effect of water on the
melting of mantle rocks. ***
