This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in mantle
geochemistry between Paul McMillan and Charles Angell of Arizona State
University (ASU) and J.P. Coutoures of the Center for High Temperature Physics
in Orleans, France. The objective of their research is to investigate the
structural properties of aluminosilicate liquids and glasses, using a
combination of high temperature and solid state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and MD (molecular
dynamics) simulation. The ASU group brings to this collaboration experience in
vibrational spectroscopy and Raman scattering of minerals, glasses and liquids.
This is complemented by the French investigators' innovative research using
ultra-high temperature NMR in liquids. Aluminosilicates are found in the Earth's
upper mantle. Knowledge of the structure-property relationship of
aluminosilicates is essential to our understanding of dynamic processes and
composition of the Earth and other planets. These high pressure and temperature
studies will allow researchers to simulate the melting and transition process
under conditions representative of the Earth's upper mantle.
