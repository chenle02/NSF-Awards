A comparison of the roles of intra and intersexual selection in the evolution
of sex-limited mimicry in two swallowtail butterflies. Both black and tiger
swallowtails (Papilio polyxenes and P. glaucus) exhibit mimicry of the
distasteful pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) that is limited to females.
Selection against novel mimetic coloration in males results either from mating
preferences for typical males by females or the reduced success of novel males
in direct competition with typical males. Using a series of parallel
experiments, the investigators will compare the impact of female intersexual
selection with that of male intrasexual selection on the maintenance of the
ancestral color in males. The profound differences in the mating systems of
these related butterflies will aid in distinguishing between the alternatives.
Intrasexual selection may be very important in the black swallowtail, where
males are aggregated and aggressively territorial, but is unlikely to be
important in the tiger swallowtail, where males are dispersed and patrol widely
for females. The influence of coloration will be evaluated by altering the
appearance of males to resemble females, then comparing their success in
courtship, copulation, territorial defense and mate location with unaltered
males. Observed effects will be attributable to either inter- or intrasexual
selection. The results of this research will improve our understanding of the
evolution of mimicry and protective coloration. It will provide the first
experimental test of the alternative sexual selection hypotheses and estimate
the relative importance of each. From the applied viewpoint, the research will
indicate the potential to control or alter mating success in visually oriented
insect pest species. In addition, knowing the mechanisms of reproductive
isolation will aid us in understanding gene flow in these species. This could be
important in predicting the movement of resistance genes to natural plant toxins
or pesticides in natural or pest populations.
