The engineering workforce needs to better represent the diversity of the society
it serves by attracting and retaining students from diverse backgrounds. The
process students experience to become engineers requires them to acquire
technical knowledge but also to identify with the profession. This project is
designing a new curriculum for freshman engineering courses to help shape
students' emerging engineering identities and expose students to the important
role diversity plays in engineering.

The curriculum is created to help students recognize the value that diversity
brings to engineering in terms of (a) designing better and innovative solutions,
and (b) expanding students' conceptions of who can be an engineer. The project
is evaluating the effect of the curriculum on students in two different freshman
engineering classes. The research questions include the following: How did the
intervention change students' attitudes toward diversity in engineering? How did
the intervention change students' ability to recognize themselves and others as
an engineer? Both quantitative and qualitative methods are being used in this
evaluation. The intellectual merit of the project is its transformational
approach to retaining diverse students. In particular, the project seeks to
change the culture in the educational and work contexts for engineers rather
than simply trying to support students from underrepresented groups in
engineering. Furthermore, the project contributes to our understanding of how
students form engineering identities. The broader impacts of the project include
helping to broaden participation in engineering, preparing students for a global
work environment, and improving STEM education.
