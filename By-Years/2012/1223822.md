Kinetic City After School is a project supported by a prior NSF award that has
produced over 80 activities in areas typical of after school activities such as
computer games/simulations, hands-on activities, active play, and art and
writing. This pathways project, KC Empower, will redesign and test five
activities of the 80 activities currently developed by Kinetic City using a new
approach to increase the representation of children and youth with disabilities
in informal science settings. The project will test how universal design
principles can be integrated with new technologies, not available when most
after school STEM content was created, to address the needs of students with
disabilities. The technologies used in the redesign include advanced mobile
platforms and applications; search engines that sift through audio, image and
video files; gaming input devices that respond to body movements; and
information restructuring that allows multiple representations of content. The
project will test how universal design guidelines will work with new
technologies, in the short-term providing hands-on activities more accessible to
students with disabilities, while increasing access for all students. The
project is expected to lead to a full scale development project that will update
all modules in Kinetic City After School. The target audience is 3rd - 5th grade
students.

The hypothesis of the project is that designing for disability can strengthen
activities designed to increase science knowledge. Rather than making
accommodations for persons with disabilities, it is the environment and design
that are disabled, and it is better educational practice to rethink the activity
from the point of view of all learners, including those with disabilities. Thus
the use of universal design will address how best to present material for all
users while influenced by the challenges presented by disabled users.

The project includes the Coalition for Science After School, the Center for
Applied Special Technology and the Afterschool Alliance.
