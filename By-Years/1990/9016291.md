This is an award to support exploratory research on a technique to decontaminate
soil by use of electroosmosis. In this process, an ionic liquid under action of
an applied electric field moves through the porous and permeable contaminated
soil in a manner thought to be less conducive to channeling than pressure-drive
flows. The drive-liquid containing the contaminant is then replaced in the soil
by a clean purge solution. The contaminated fluid is collected for appropriate
treatment. This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions outlined in NSF
89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER). The proposed research which
addresses a topic of significant National interest, has previously been
successfully applied in dewatering and consolidation of soils and may prove to
be useful for removal of organic contaminants of soil. It has significance and
potentially direct application to removal of contaminants from soil alone and in
conjunction with other physical, chemical and biological processes.
