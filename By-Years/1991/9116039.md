This award supports Prof. William D'Arcy from the Missouri Botanical Gardens in
a research collaboration with Prof. Carmen Benitez de Rojas of the Instituto de
Botanica Agricola in Maracay, Venezuela. The purpose of the collaboration is to
carry out joint research on the taxonomy and classification of two large genera
of the Solanaceae, a major plant family that includes petunias, tobacco,
potatoes, tomatoes, and many other economic plants. While this important family
of plants is richest in the Andean region, no modern floristic treatment exists
for northern South America. The two investigators have recently completed a
floristic treatment of the southern half of Venezuela, and they intend to
continue their efforts and produce a treatment for all of Venezuela. By bringing
together these two researchers, this project will enhance the capabilities of
the institutions involved in the project. The Venezuelan side will benefit from
the introduction of computer and other modern methodologies; the U.S. side from
access to the extremely rich and poorly known flora of Venezuela.
