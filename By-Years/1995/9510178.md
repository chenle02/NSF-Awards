9510178 Duffy In this Research Planning Grant the investigator will explore the
role that patriotism plays in political discourse among contemporary Native
Americans. This is part of a multi-phased research design to explore political
dynamics of nations within a nation, thereby gaining insight on such troubling
regions as Bosnia and Rwanda, or wherever political entities within a state
divide themselves along national or ethnic lines. The investigator will link
Q-methodology with a survey instrument. The objective of the planning grant is
to develop a research proposal which gives insights on: culturally-specific ways
of thinking about politics and political participation; cognitive mechanisms
members of subcultures use to adapt to two value systems; and, sources of
differences in political participation among and between tribes. Exploring these
issues will contribute to theories about political attitude formation and
change, political behavior, and linkage between attitudes and political
participation. ***
