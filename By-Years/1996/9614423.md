9614423 Mysen The principal objective of the proposed research is to investigate
in-situ at high temperature and pressure (crustal and upper mantle conditions)
the chemical structure of hydrous silicate melts and associated hydrothermal
fluids as a function of temperature, composition, and pressure. This pilot
project will focus on a systematic study of water-saturated potassium silicate
melts and coexisting aqueous fluids. The project will involve complementary
studies including (1) in-situ Raman spectroscopic measurements of both the melt
and aqueous phase, and (2) phase equilibrium experiments and necessary
analytical examination to determine the exact compositions of the two phases.
Spectroscopic studies will be performed using externally- heated diamond-anvil
cells which are capable of being used to temperatures of 1000oC and pressures in
excess of 2.5 Gpa.
