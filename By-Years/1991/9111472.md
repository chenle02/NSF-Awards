This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the Minority Research
Initiation program of the NSF, will provide for support to develop a research
proposal to address (1) the efficiency of a residential water-to-air heat pump
system by equipping it with state-of-the-art major components, and (2) the
performance of environmentally acceptable refrigerants in such a system.
