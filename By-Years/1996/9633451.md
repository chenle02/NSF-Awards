This project will analyze a set of OBH seismic data collected off the margin of
central Chile where the aseismic Juan Fernandez Ridge is being subducted.
Velocity structure will be determined along two transects normal to the coast
and in a grid sited over a possible buried seamount under the Valparaiso Basin.
The data will be used to (1) test whether there is a seamount and if so whether
it acts as an "asperity" which may have served as a focus for the 1985
earthquake and (2) determine the 3D shape and velocity structure of the
accretionary wedge and lithosphere to constrain sediment porosity and elasticity
of the subducting plate.
