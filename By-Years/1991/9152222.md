The Department of Physics at Morgan State University is modernizing its
Electrical and Electronics Laboratory with instrumentation capable of being
directly controlled by the students or by a personal computer or a combination
of the two. This permits tutorial exercises and also allows students to observe
physical phenomenon to reinforce and provide meaning to concepts presented in
the classroom. In cooperation with the Electrical Engineering Department, a
laboratory is being developed in which a personal computer controls and rapidly
gathers data from a variety of experiments. Students are able also to use the
personal computer to analyze and plot data and quickly experiment with various
formulas to attempt to characterize their data. Students may obtain high quality
plots using printers attached to the PCs.
