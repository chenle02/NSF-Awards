This three-year grant supports the work of Roy Weinstein and collaborators at
the University of Houston on the "Large Volume Detector" (LVD) underground
experiment in the Gran Sasso, in Italy. This experiment is operated by an
international collaboration in a deep-underground facility constructed by the
government of Italy. The experiment will have many goals. Several of the goals
are: (1) to search for neutrinos from supernova explosions; (2) to search for
oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos; and (3) to detect solar neutrinos. The
experiment will be somewhat different from previous underground neutrino
experiments. The apparatus will be sensitive to neutrinos of lower energies and
so will be able to answer new questions in the areas of elementary particle
physics and astrophysics.
