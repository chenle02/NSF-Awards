0201995&lt;br/&gt;Behrman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two major advantages to
quantum computing as such: the vast increase in computing power that comes from
the quantum evolution of states, and the ability (at least in principle) of
performing computations that cannot be done, classically. However major problems
exist to their practical implementation. The marriage of quantum computing to
artificial neural networks potentially solves three pressing problems in quantum
computing: 1) the paucity of quantum computing algorithms; 2) the need to have
continuous error correction to deal with decoherence and incomplete and/or
damaged data; and 3) the practical difficulties of scaling up to large numbers
of qubits. This marriage also addresses a major hurdle in neural networks: 4)
that of supplying the connectivity for large scale neural
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here the PI's propose an interdisciplinary
collaborative research effort between experimental work with SQUIDs at the
University of Kansas and theoretical work in quantum neural networks at Wichita
State University. This research is directed toward building a quantum neural
network to exploit the advantages both of quantum computers and of neural
networks. There are two avenues they wish to explore. First, they will extend
their work on temporal quantum neural networks, in which information flows in
the temporal dimension (temporal network), to the case of using superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) as qubits. An experimental physical
implementation of their temporal quantum neural network will be trained to learn
complex behavior such as logic gates. Second, they will continue and expand
their current work in theoretical characterization and simulation of a quantum
neural networks in which information flows in the spatial dimension (spatial
network), and extend their experimental work to the case of several entangled
qubits.&lt;br/&gt;
