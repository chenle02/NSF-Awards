This award uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly-concept Grants for
Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, for a project aimed at examining the
causes and significance of perplexing inconsistencies in radiocarbon dates
coming from 20,000 year old deep water sediments at the northeast Bermuda
Rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deep, northeast Bermuda Rise is a classical
location for study of climate over the last glacial cycle because of its high
deposition rates and good preservation of foraminifera. Since it is also
contains one of the deepest records of climate change and Bermuda Rise cores
have been studied for over 30 years, it has become a standard reference section
for climate history. Hence, getting the radiocarbon dating right is critical to
calibrating time in this region and, perhaps, elsewhere if the inconsistencies
in age dating are systemic and not simply local.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research activities fit well into the potentially transformative, high risk, and
exploratory nature of the EAGER programs because it is hypothesized that results
from this project will show that sediments on the seafloor can be "unmixed" by
dating every sample. If this hypothesis is rejected, the resulting chronology
will nevertheless be an improvement on the present situation, where important
results are waiting for an improved age model before they can be published. If
the hypothesis is accepted, however, the new chronology could inspire new
research on this and other locations in the western North Atlantic.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cores from the Bermuda Rise targeted for this project
would be a valuable resource for future researchers as they will have internally
consistent stratigraphies and chronologies and future proxies for ocean and
climate change will be linked in a common temporal and sedimentological
framework.
