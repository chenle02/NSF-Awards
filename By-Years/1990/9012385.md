Natural resource extraction strongly affects the environment. The methods of
extraction and export of extracted resources are crucial to the environmental
impact. This project will examine how planning of natural resource extraction
takes place in a fragile environment--the Brazilian Amazon. The investigator
will interview key actors inside and outside Brazil and examine archives of the
organizations involved to determine how resource extraction and export in the
bauxite industry are influenced by the nature of the commodity, the environment,
internal and export market forces, interests of importing firms or nations, and
the political and social organization dominant in the resource- exporting
region. This project is supported by NSF's special initiative on the Human
Dimensions of Global Environmental Change.
