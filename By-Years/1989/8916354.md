The development of deformation fabric in ductile shear zones has been well
studied in low to medium-grade metamorphic rocks, however there is little
available data from granulite and upper amphibolite facies rocks. As these
grades are thought to represent conditions of the middle to lower continental
crust, information on fabric development and rheological behavior will be of
considerable interest in understanding very deep-seated thrust faults. The work
will involve mapping of exposed shear zones of granulite to upper amphibolite
facies in the Parry Sound region of Ontario, Canada, and subsequent laboratory
analysis to examine the fabric and microstructural development in these shear
zones in detail, including the development of grain size and shape
distributions, lattice preferred orientations, and the relationship of
anisotropic mineral reaction sites to the fabric. Results are expected to
improve understanding of the deformation mechanisms and rheological properties
of the lower and middle crust.
