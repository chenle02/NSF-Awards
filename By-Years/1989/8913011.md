In this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal, the Principal
Investigator (PI) plans to continue with his investi- gation of large-scale
flows and magnetic field patterns in the solar photosphere. The basis will be
data collected during the past 22 years at the 150 foot tower telescope at Mount
Wilson, including data obtained since 1985 with the new fast-magnetograph. The
PI will focus on several interrelated phenomena: torsional oscillations and
their relation to solar magnetic activity, the poleward migration of magnetic
patterns and the polar magnetic field reversals, meridional flows, magnetic and
supergranulation rotation, and giant convective cells. The analysis will use
software developed by the PI. Undergraduates will be involved in all phases of
the project.
