This project proposes an innovative multi-layered array of computing elements in
which dynamic reconfiguration of the interconnection structure is possible.
Reconfiguration will be performed using distributed control, eliminating a
potential performance bottleneck and single point failure (hardcore) of a
centralized control mechanism. An architecture of this type provides an
increased level of system performance not typically found in current parallel
processing systems. Through the reconfiguration process, the underlying
architecture can be optimized to improve algorithm performance, faulty modules
can be isolated, and the yield of wafer scale based technology can be improved.
They plan to investigate this architecture for more efficient utilization of
spares and to provide on line fault detection and data roll-back features.
Second, they propose to optimize the reconfiguration algorithm for cost
effective implementation in the emerging wafer scale integration technology.
Finally they plan to extend the reconfiguration algorithm to permit its use on
alternative parallel processing architectures such as hypercubes and tori.
