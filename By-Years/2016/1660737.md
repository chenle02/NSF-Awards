This award is to assist approximately 35 US-based graduate students to attend
the 12th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2016) in
Savannah, GA, on Nov 2-4, 2016. The conference focuses on computer systems, and
brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in the
premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of
systems software. The OSDI Symposium emphasizes innovative research as well as
quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation. The
papers represent some of the most outstanding work in the areas of file and
storage systems, embedded systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile
systems, secure and reliable systems, virtualization and troubleshooting of
complex systems.

The purpose of this trip is to provide students with unique opportunities to
interact with senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading
edge work. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation
of students who would otherwise be unable to attend OSDI.
