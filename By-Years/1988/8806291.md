Static light scattering, dynamic light scattering, and viscometry will be used
to study polymer-polymer interactions and the internal dynamic behavior of
linear poly(ethylene oxide), PEO, in dilute and non-dilute aqueous solutions.
PEO is an important polymer additive used to help streamline the flow of water
in pipes, ducts, and channels and is also used in the formulation of aqueous
solutions used in tertiary oil recovery. The results of the PEO/H2O study will,
therefore, provide insights into the behavior of linear polymers in solution
generally, as well as information useful to those using polymer additives in
aqueous solutions that are important in certain industrial processes. This
research is being carried out under the program for Research in Undergraduate
Institutions.
