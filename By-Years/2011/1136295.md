This Noyce project is building the capacity for talented undergraduate STEM
majors to pursue teaching careers through two years of funding that will lead to
to a later Phase I Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Track project. The project
addresses state requirements for teacher certification as well as the research
on how students learn STEM material in the classroom. STEM majors from Texas
A&amp;M-Commerce, including alternative certification programs, and 23
surrounding community colleges are identified and recruited in preparation for
expansion of current STEM teacher production. In addition, a restructuring of
the current student pathway and introduction of new instructional strategies
strengthen the present STEM certification program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
strategy to rebuild the infrastructure and capacity for STEM teacher preparation
at the university includes merging advanced STEM content and teaching pedagogy
in advanced STEM courses. Pilot summer internships, integrating research and
education, are planned and implemented during the project period. The project
fully utilizes university research groups to build a community network to mentor
and support students while at the college or in the field. The uniqueness of
this region adds to potential impact of the project. The region has 15 rural
counties, with average family income well below the state average, as well as
the large urban Dallas Metroplex area. Implementation of this capacity building
model will be well-documented and can be replicated in other rural and urban
settings, thereby expanding the impact beyond the targeted region.
