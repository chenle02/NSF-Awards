The project is a short course intended to immerse faculty in the methods and
implications of teaching and applying engineering design graphics (EDG) with
microcomputer-based graphics workstations and professional computer-aided design
drafting (CADD) software. Participants will be guided through lesson plans,
exercises, and computer-assisted grading strategies utilized in a highly
successful and innovative instructional program for EDG instruction in the
University of Illinois College of Engineering. The micro-CADD experience will
include producing, modifying and interpreting graphic representations. It will
also emphasize database implications of CADD and the use of CADD as an effective
graphical interface to advanced systems for CAD, CAM, CAE, CIM, etc. This
approach reflects the growing awareness that the effective application of CAD,
etc. depends in large part on an individual's ability to visualize "objects" and
to create and interpret them in graphic form. The course will include lecture-
demonstrations in a specially equipped micro-CADD auditorium featuring a large-
screen projection monitor. Individual laboratory assignments will take place on
PC-based micro-CADD workstations, during which experienced graduate teaching
assistants will assist the instructors in offering individual help and advice.
The project directors will maintain personal contact with participants to foster
success after the course. In addition to NSF funds, participants' institutions
will provide about 30% in travel costs toward the operation of the project.
