9706997 Herrero-Bervera The PI proposes a study of geomagnetic polarity
transitions recorded by lava flows of Wai'anae volcano. The PI has located and
studied in detail two geomagnetic polarity transition boundaries in sections of
the Wai'anae Volcano. Preliminary dating and measurements of the polarity of the
transitions are consistent with the Gilbert-Gauss (R-N), Lower (N-R) and Upper
Mammoth, Lower and Upper Kaena transitions. Samples will be dated further using
K-Ar and Ar/Ar techniques to confirm this correlation. Progressive alternating-
field demagnetization has been completed on preliminary samples drilled at
widely-spaced vertical intervals in both sections to remove major lightning-
induced and viscous secondary components efficiently, revealing well-grouped
flow means. The PI will sample five transitional sections in detail and will
complete a study of the magnetostratigraphy and polarity of the transitional
fields. This work should help constrain the geometry of the geomagnetic field
during polarity transitions. ***
