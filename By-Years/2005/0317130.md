&lt;br/&gt;This research is funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division. In three related tasks Steimle will: a)
detect and characterize transition metal dioxides using transient frequency
modulation (TFM) spectroscopy; b) detect and characterize by laser induced
fluorescence spectroscopy Fe-containing molecules thought to be catalytic
intermediates in flame suppression; and c) perform Zeeman and Stark spectroscopy
to characterize 3d transition metal monoxides and mononitrides. The metal-
containing radicals will be generated using either an existing laser
ablation/supersonic expansion source or a dc-discharge/supersonic expansion
source. The molecular species will be characterized through the analysis of
their electronic spectra as well as of the optical Stark and Zeeman spectral
splittings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the oxidation reaction of
transition metals is both of fundamental importance in chemistry and is crucial
to many related areas such as surface science and metallurgy. Certain Fe-
containing compounds have been found to be substantially more effective at flame
inhibition and are environmentally friendlier than halogen-containing compounds,
whose use is being phased out. The proposed research will make important
contributions to the understanding of these topics. Although the experiments and
the analyses of the results are complex and sophisticated, they lend themselves
to the involvement by graduate and undergraduate students who work under the
supervision of the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;
