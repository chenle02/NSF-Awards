9421118 The project is to hold the Sixth Nilo-Saharan Linguistics Conference at
the University of California, Los Angeles, March 27-29, 1995. This will be the
first time this conference has been held in the United States. It will gather up
to 100 faculty and student scholars from all over the world, including most of
the prominent scholars working in this specialty field. The planned timing and
locale of the conference, just after the 26th Annual Conference on African
Linguistics, will make it possible for many of the participants, especially
those from overseas, to attend both meetings- a rare opportunity, given the
extensive travel usually involved. The NSF grant will allow the participation of
a carefully selected small group of African scholars who would otherwise not be
able to attend. It will also cover modest costs of publishing the proceedings.
