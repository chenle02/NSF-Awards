This proposal aims to secure travel support for the seventh ACM/IEEE Symposium
on&lt;br/&gt;Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems (ANCS),
which will be held in Brooklyn, NY (Oct. 3-4, 2011). Specifically, the PI?s
interest is in providing travel support to ANCS for students. The ANCS
conference has been created to provide a top tier venue to bring together
researchers from the areas of computer systems architecture and networking
systems, in order to foster greater collaboration between these increasingly
related research areas.&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to offer up to 15 NSF-sponsored
student travel grants for a total budget of $15,250. Applications will be
solicited via email mailing lists, personal contacts, and the conference web
site. The selection process will consider the applicant?s level of participation
in ANCS, followed by how closely the student?s research interests match areas
covered by ANCS.
