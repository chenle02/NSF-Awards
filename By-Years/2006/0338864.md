How do young children form relationships in the context of transitions and
change? In an attempt to answer this and several other related questions about
human development and complex social processes, this study, implemented by a
cross-disciplinary team consisting of an agent based modeler, several human
developmentalists, and a mathematician, will examine the ontology and evolution
of playgroups using an agent-based model (PlayMate) to simulate young children
forming play partner preferences. In conjunction with the development of the
agent based model, we will collect daily observations of 60 young children (ages
3-6) from three separate preschool classrooms over an academic year. Each child
will be observed 75-125 times per month, allowing us to generate about 1500 -
3000 observations per month per classroom. These data will allow us to
investigate the dynamic formation and evolution of playgroups, a micro-social
phenomenon well suited for agent based modeling. In addition to observations of
play activities, data will also be collected on child characteristics using
teacher and observer ratings. These data will be used to determine the
veridicality and validity of the simulation. This modeling approach provides us
with the opportunity to establish this methodology as a prototype of how to
simulate micro-social processes and compare the results against real data. By
combining empirical data with theory, the findings of this study will contribute
to building models of social influence that can be applied not only to children,
but also to humans throughout the lifespan. Moreover, our interdisciplinary
approach illustrates the potential richness of cross discipline work, and lays
the foundation for training future scientists
