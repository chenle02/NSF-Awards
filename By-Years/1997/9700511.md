9700511 Cleary This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions
(RUI) proposal advances education and research by involving undergraduate
students in a study of the synthesis of new transition metal based materials and
their characterization with respect to structure, chemical composition, phase
transitions, and second harmonic generation efficiency. The educational benefit
of this project will be derived from the undergraduate chemistry training to
better reflect important scientific and technological issues facing society. %%%
The materials to be synthesized and characterized constitute a new class of
layered materials with potential uses that included electro-optic devices and
frequency mixing devices. These device materials therefore are relevant to
applications areas such as optical data storage and optical communications
technologies, making possible educational benefits that lead to a better
understanding at the undergraduate level of education of scientific and
technological issues facing society. ***
