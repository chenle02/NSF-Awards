The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr. Zdzislaw
Musielak of the University of Alabama and Dr. Marceli Krogulec of the University
of Gdansk is to study the mechanism by which cool stars return matter to the
interstellar medium. To do this, the researchers will examine the propagation,
reflection and trapping of Alfven waves in atmospheres of late-type giants and
supergiants (stars). Findings will be used to construct models of cool massive
stellar winds which account for observed wind energetics and radiation losses.
Results are expected to provide an explanation of stellar mass loss and
contribute to our basic understanding of the complex physics occurring in the
atmospheres of such stars. This project on stars and stellar evolution fulfills
the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading
researchers in the United States and Poland to combine complementary efforts and
capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of
basic scientific research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality
of benefit.
