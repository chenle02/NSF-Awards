This project is a special research emphasis year on Lie algebras at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison during 1987- 1988. The primary, but not
exclusive, focus of the special year will be on characteristic p Lie algebras
with special emphasis on the problem of classifying the finite dimensional
simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic.
This classification problem has resisted attempts to solve it for over 50 years.
However, remarkable progress has been achieved in the last few years. It is the
intent of the special year to bring together the individuals currently working
on prime characteristic Lie algebras and related problems in order to share
research ideas and expertise. The plans for the special year include: (1) a
workshop devoted to the classification problem and related questions; (2) a
conference on a broader range of topics in Lie theory; (3) special seminars and
lectures throughout the year.
