A Gordon Conference on Nuclear Physics will be held at Tilton School, Tilton,
NH July 4-8, 1988, continuing a previous series of conferences on nuclear
structure. The latest developments in a wide range of areas will be covered,
both in terms of theoretical and experimental work. These include low and medium
energy nuclear physics, electron-nucleus interaction in the few GeV range,
neutrino problems, heavy ion collisions, relativistic treatment of nuclear
matter, nuclear matter, quark-gluon plasma and nucleosynthesis in the early
universe. The intent is to promote communication among scientists in these areas
and to promote the involvement of young scientists who will be responsible for
future developments in the field.
