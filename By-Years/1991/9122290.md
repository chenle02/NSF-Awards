In this project funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry in the Chemistry
Division, Prof. Berberian (St. Joseph's College) will study rotational motion of
dielectrically active molecules in solution with non-polar, structurally similar
species. The temperature, frequency, and concentration dependence of dielectric
constant will be used to distinguish among competing models for liquid state
dynamic behavior. By extending the measurements to low temperatures,
intermolecular forces characteristic of the glassy state will be elucidated. The
work is to be carried out with the aid of undergraduate assistants, who will
benefit by exposure to modern research equipment and methodology. %%% Some
molecules possess tiny electric dipole moments. By disolving such molecules in
mixtures of electrically inert species of similar size and shape, and making the
solution part of an electric circuit, it is possible to use variations in
current to study how the surroundings of a molecule influence its rotational
motion. This is important because at low temperatures where the motion becomes
extremely sluggish, detailed understanding of the intermolecular forces is
absent. Prof. Beberian's project in this area will lead to an improved
undertanding of this "glassy" state of matter.
