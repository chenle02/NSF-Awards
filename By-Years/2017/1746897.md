The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project connects society through communal exploration of
the universe. This product will be commercially useful to enhance scientific and
technological understanding of astronomy in the K-12 classroom, the college
astronomy laboratory, and in the hands of internet gamers around the globe,
adding value to the partnerships between academia, industry, and the public. Due
to the internationalism of both this project and the greater astronomy
community, this project will develop a diverse and globally active camaraderie
among players that fosters collaboration and socialization across geographic and
economic borders in pursuit of space education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed project addresses the need for relatable astronomy education by
gamifying space exploration through robotic telescope use. The project aims to
advance scientific knowledge of astronomy through the use of gamified, curated
astronomy curricula that bring authentic remote observing practices into the
classroom and any personal platform with internet access. The project will take
users through a series of quests to explore the regions of the night sky, and
the objects within, defined from the eighty-eight constellations recognized by
the International Astronomical Union. Explorer badges will be awarded on a
"gravity point" system of successful observing missions, encouraging the
practice of real astronomical observing, data handling and image processing
practices, and comprehensive content research. The methods to successful
implementation will include research of game design, establishing partners to
support distribution of the learning materials into classrooms, and web/mobile
application development.
