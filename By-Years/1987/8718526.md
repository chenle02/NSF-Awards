The general objective of this project is to understand the functional
organization of energy-transducing membranes. The subject of the immediate
investigation is the photosynthetic membrane, and in particular the proteins of
the reaction center designated photosystem I. At the heart of energy
transduction in this reaction center are two large proteins coded for by
chloroplast genes. It is currently believed that these large membrane proteins
are comprised of membrane-traversing hydrophobic alpha-helical amino acid
sequences connected by hydrophilic portions that protrude from one or the other
side of the surface of the membrane. The first question to be addressed
experimentally is: How are the two large PSI reaction center proteins disposed
in thylakoid membranes? This is to be approached by using small synthetic
polypeptides corresponding to amino acid sequences in predicted hydrophilic
regions of the protein, to generate peptide-specific antibodies. Electron
microscope immunocytochemistry and other methods will be used to determine the
topology of the proteins in the membrane. This information is to be used as a
basis for other experimental approaches to study the relationships of these
proteins to other photosynthetic membrane proteins, and to advance the
understanding of energy transduction and electron transport in membranes.
