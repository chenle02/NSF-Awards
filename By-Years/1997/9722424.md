This proposal requests support for a United States/Germany/Japan Tri-National
Workshop on Molecular Evolution to be held at the University of Munich, Germany,
June 5-7, 1997. The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting
of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE). The foreign
counterpart is Arndt von Heseler of the Zoologishes Institut, Universitªt
M¼nchen. The primary objective of the workshop is to promote the participation
of young researchers at an early stage in their careers in the burgeoning area
of molecular evolution. Major topics of discussion will include human molecular
evolution and the inference, based on segregating molecular- level variation, of
the demographic characteristics of extant and ancestral populations.
