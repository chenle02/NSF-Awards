The development of the field of lightwave technology depends crucially upon the
growth, characterization, and development of appropriate types of films, multi-
layered structures, and devices. Various types of equipment are available for
use in this area, one of the most versatile and economical is the so-called
sputter deposition system. In this an ion or electron beam strikes a target of
the material to be deposited. The material is then driven by electric fields to
the substrate on which the deposition is to occur. This basic principle can be
modified in a variety of ways depending upon the particular need; for instance,
deposition, cleaning or etching can be done. The system proposed for purchase
here is intended for use in the area of optical signal processing research.
