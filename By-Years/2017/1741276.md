This workshop on using design thinking for assessment and evaluation will
advance the knowledge of the field in its understanding of ways to engage
various stakeholder groups in using evaluative thinking from the beginning of an
initiative. It specifically supports education and diversity through the
audience of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) and the
nature of the NSF INCLUDES context with its focus on broadening participation in
the STEM enterprise (particularly higher education).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
scope is a workshop for approximately 100 APLU members to advance the use of
evidence-based approaches to foster career pathways towards the professoriate by
broadening participation pf underrepresented groups . The workshop will include
plenary presentations, small group sessions and extensive opportunity for
networking, reflection and consensus building.
