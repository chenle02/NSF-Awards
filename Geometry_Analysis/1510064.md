Manifolds are shapes which locally resemble Euclidean space but may have
complicated global structure. Four-dimensional manifolds (with three spatial and
one temporal direction) are used in General Relativity as models for the
Universe. Manifolds of other dimensions, such as two or six, are used by
theoretical physicists in String Theory models which may lead to a unification
of Quantum Field Theory and Gravity. Because the solution sets of many equations
arising in theoretical physics and applied mathematics are manifolds, the
ability to distinguish between manifolds is useful throughout the mathematical
sciences, as well as in Topology, Geometry, and Theoretical Physics. The work
undertaken in this project will lead to a rare mathematical proof of a
prediction from supersymmetric quantum field theory. The discovery in 2012 at
CERN of the Higgs boson confirms the Standard Model, but supersymmetry has not
yet been detected by the Large Hadron Collider experiments. However, the
Principal Investigators' research shows that at least some consequences of
supersymmetry can be mathematically verified. The activities in this project
should also lead to greater involvement of minorities, especially African-
American and Hispanic students, and women in mathematics research, given the
Principal Investigators' record and continuing desire to encourage women and
minorities to pursue careers in mathematics and to provide mentorship and
training. To communicate this work to a wider audience, the Principal
Investigators will write a research monograph based on this project, and
organize conferences at Rutgers University and Florida International University
and special sessions at national American Mathematical Society meetings each
year from 2015 through 2018. In 1994, using supersymmetric quantum field theory,
Edward Witten derived his celebrated formula relating Donaldson and Seiberg-
Witten invariants of a closed, oriented, smooth four-dimensional manifold with
admissible topology and simple type. The first goal of this project is to
complete the proof of Witten's formula, employing a mathematically rigorous
method based on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles; the Principal
Investigators have completed all steps of this program except their work on the
gluing theorem for non-Abelian monopoles. They will also use non-Abelian
monopoles to define new invariants of four-dimensional manifolds, investigate
higher- rank Donaldson invariants, and derive relations between the instanton
and Seiberg-Witten Floer homologies of closed three-dimensional manifolds.
