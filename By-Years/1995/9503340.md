9503340 Kabamba Digital computers are now routinely used in situations where
they interact in real time with the otherwise analog world, such as in digital
feedback control or digital filtering. The resulting combination is in general
no longer analog nor discrete-time, but is sampled-data in the sense that some
state variables evolve in continuous time whereas other evolve in discrete time.
There are currently well developed system theories for analog and discrete-time
systems. However, several authors have recently reported that sample sampled-
data systems exhibit phenomena which make the study of their interesting
behavior necessary. The purpose of the work proposed herein is the development
of a comprehensive theory of sampled-data systems, with a specific emphasis on
intersample behavior, and the investigation into its application to control
engineering. ***
