This award establishes an Research Experiences For Undergraduates site for the
next two summers at the University of Washington at Seattle for 8 students. The
students will work on numerical solutions of inverse problems for partial
differential equations. They will focus on certain specific problems, in
particular on inverse problems arising from the conductivity equation. The
inverse problem is to determine the conductivity throughout a body from
measurements of potentials and currents on the boundary. There is no known good
way to calculate the conductivity. We intend to explore the recent attempts by
Wexler, Isaacson, Kim and others to compute the conductivity numerically. The
program will run for eight weeks. For about two weeks there will be lectures by
one or the other of the Principal Investigator's describing the problems and
various possible numerical approaches. The students can then begin working on
projects of their own, using the available computing facilities. The students
will be encouraged to work in teams of two, three or more, possibly in
collaboration with the faculty members. At the end the students will be expected
to give a seminar talk on his/her progress.
