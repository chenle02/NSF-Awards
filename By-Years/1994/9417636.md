9417636 Dunand This grant examines the high temperature mechanical properties
and microstructure of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) aluminum and magnesium
alloys. A unique combination of particle size, volume fraction, and grain size
allows the probing of the fundamental mechanisms of dispersion strengthening.
The alloys feature oxides with: (1) volume fraction from 20 to 30 vol.% (above
typical values for mechanically-alloyed or precipitation-strengthened alloys);
(2) particle sizes between 0.2 and 0.8 microns (smaller than metal matrix
composites, but larger than mechanically-alloyed or rapidly-solidified alloys);
(3) grain sizes that are either very fine, 0.5 microns, or very coarse, 1
centimeter, spanning a larger range of sizes than most dispersion strengthened
alloys. Samples are tested in uniaxial tension at elevated temperatures in a
range of strain rates. Transmission electron microscopy is used to study
dislocation interaction with oxide particles. This research allows examination
of issues such as the nature of the threshold stress, dislocation climb
phenomena at particle-matrix interfaces, and the role of grain and subgrain
boundaries in the deformation of dispersion-strengthened alloys. %%% The
scientific goal is to correlate the microstructure with the mechanical
properties through micromechanical modeling of the dislocation-particle
interactions in the novel situation of very high volume fractions of unshearable
particles. This research could lead to improved high temperature, lightweight
metal alloys for structural applications. ***
