Modern Cellular Biology and Genetics courses for majors are being developed with
the purchase of major instruments including a tabletop ultracentrifuge, a high
speed refrigerated centrifuge, three general-use spectrophotometers and five
phase contrast microscopes. The equipment is being used in the preparation of
cell extracts and enzyme assays, plasmid purification, recombinant DNA
techniques, organelle isolation, the observation and experimental manipulation
of cell-cell interactions using animal gametes, and for various undergraduate
research topics in Cellular and Molecular Biology.
