SSC-9450318 Georgia State University Atlanta, GA Keys, Carolyn "The Atlanta
Science Summer Camp" The Atlanta Summer Science Camp is designed to involve
minority middle school students in an in-depth program of science and math
activities, career exploration, and reflection. Three years of programs are
proposed, each with a different theme: environmental sciences; space and
atmospheric sciences; and plants, genetics, and food. It is anticipated that
this three-year program will serve as a prototype for the development of many
more camps which will serve students throughout the city of Atlanta. Three major
conceptual components guide the design of camp activities: (1) collaborative
social interactions in science, engineering, and mathematics; (2) the
relationship between science, engineering, and mathematics and the quality of
human life; and (3) student authentic inquiry. Instructional activities will
emphasize: cooperative learning; interactions with scientist in their work
places; student design and implementation of investigations; field and outdoor
experiences; "real world" contexts for learning; and supportive scaffolds.
Students will participate in a variety of projects in which they learn to ask
questions, make predictions, design studies, analyze data, and reflect on
results. Instruction on technology as a tool for science and engineering will be
included. Career exploration will be integrated with field trips and projects. A
special feature of this camp is the provision for comprehensive teacher
education in cooperative learning, authentic investigation, constructivism,
technology, and authentic assessment. This project is being sponsored by the
Aslant Math/Science Collaborative Leadership Team including members from the
city of Atlanta, Atlanta Public Schools, Georgia State University, Georgia
Institute of Technology, Clark Atlanta University, and Jimmy Carter's Atlanta
Project.
