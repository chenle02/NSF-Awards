This award from the Chemistry Division and the Division of Materials Research to
New Mexico State University provides support for students who will be attending
the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) School on Neutron Scattering.
The School was initiated in 2004 with NSF/DOE support. The main goal of the
LANSCE Neutron Scattering School is to provide in-depth neutron-scattering
training in a particular topic predominantly to graduate students in their early
stage of thesis research. A particular emphasis is put on selecting a diverse
student body in order to foster cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary and
multicultural learning environment. The LANSCE Neutron Scattering School is
organized with the collaboration of the University of California and New Mexico
State University. The topic for this fiscal year is Structure and Magnetism in
Nanostructured Materials. The tentative topics for the upcoming two years are:
(1) Geomaterials and other Materials at Extreme Conditions in 2009; and (2) and
Polymer Sciences in 2010.&lt;br/&gt;
