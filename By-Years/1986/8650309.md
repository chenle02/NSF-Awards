The purpose of this project is to provide the modern laboratory research
equipment needed for establishing a contemporary teaching program in Plant
Physiology. The improvement plans are the results of an extensive evaluation of
the Biology Department by external and internal reviewers. The equipment is
being used to create largely an upper-division Plant Physiology course, but some
of it also will be used in other upper division courses and in a newly revised
Introductory Biology course. The Plant Physiology course stresses techniques and
concepts that are unique to plants (photosynthesis, transpiration, water
relations), but also includes projects that will familiarize students with
generally applicable techniques while illustrating principles in Plant
Physiology (spectral analysis of pigments, tissue culture, photomorphogenesis).
The laboratory equipment covers experiments with photosynthesis (an oxygen
electrode); transpiration (a porometer); water relations (a pressure chamber and
psychrometer); tissue culture (a laminar flow hood); spectral analysis (a
scanning spectrophoto-meter); and photomorphogenesis (an image analysis system
and a thermopile). Students using the equipment learn what types of questions
each technique can answer. They then design and carry out their own experiments.
It is expected that this experience will increase their appreciation for how
science proceeds, as well as for the principles of plant physiology. Many
students do laboratory research in their senior year, and many go on to graduate
school or medical school. This experience with modern equipment and experiment
design should serve them well. This project has the potential for becoming a
model in modern plant physiology which other undergraduate institutions might
adopt.
