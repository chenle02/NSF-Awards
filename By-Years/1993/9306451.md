9306451 Chang This two-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative research in
visual languages between Shi-Kuo Chang of the Visual Computing Laboratory at the
university of Pittsburgh, and Stefano levialdi of the Image and Icon Laboratory
at the University of Rome, Italy. The research will also involve participants
from the Institutes of Information Science at the University of Salerno and the
University of Bari. The objective of the resarch is to investigate the
fundamental methodologies and theory in visual languages for human-computer
interaction. The research will investigate three topics in visual languages:
user modeling for visual interface, data modeling for visual access of
databases, and visual language system design. The expertise of the research team
is complementary; all participants are well-known in the field. Chang and
Levialdi have strong research background in parallel image processing. The
participants from Salerno and Bari have expertise in databases, formal
languages, and visual language theory. * * *
