Bridges require routine inspection to detect flaws before they lead to damage
and dangerous conditions. The objective of this project is the application of
coherent laser vibration to detection of flaws by remote inspection. The method
will apply a laser technique to pinpoint flaws in individual structural elements
of this bridge. Phase I demonstrated the technique on the total structure and
was successful in detecting mechanical changes in the total system.
