ABSTRACT The proposed research seeks to characterize liquid sprays impacting
hot surfaces in cooling applications. The emphasis is on the pre-impact process
and sprays with droplets that are less than 150 mm in diameter. Sprays with such
fine droplets are more susceptible to the influence of the surrounding
conditions. The goal of the project is to determine the optimal conditions for
achieving maximum stable high heat flux in spray cooling applications.
Experiments will be conducted to measure the droplet velocity, size, and
temperature under different conditions. Innovative techniques such as the
Exciplex Fluorescence Technique will be used to measure the temperature of in-
flight droplets. Finite difference simulations will be carried out using a k-e
model to describe gas phase turbulence. The educational plan includes
participation of undergraduate students in the project and integration of the
knowledge gained from the research into existing courses.
