This proposal seeks travel support funding for the 42nd International Symposium
on Microarchitecture (MICRO-42), a top-tier conference on microprocessor related
research, to allow 34 awards (at least $300 per student).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds are to be solely used to provide
travel support for graduates students to defray the costs of attending and
participating in MICRO-42. The priority will be given to those students who will
present their research at MICRO-42 or its joint workshops. To broaden the
participation, the PI plans to strongly encourage women and members of other
under-represented groups to apply for the travel grant.&lt;br/&gt;
