In many database applications, especially scientific ones, the order among data
items plays an important role. To query such sequenced data, current systems
depend on recursion or iteration constructs found in programming languages.
Although powerful enough to express all computable queries, these constructs are
unnatural in expressing many intuitive queries and difficult to optimize. This
research focuses on overcoming such drawbacks by studying and developing
declarative query languages on sequenced data. The starting point is the query
languages formerly defined by the principal investigator. Two other declarative
query languages, using first-order logic on finite automata and temporal logic,
are explored. The expressiveness of sequence queries is investigated by
comparing these different languages and their variations. This expressiveness
study is extended by using computational complexity classes. Another part of the
research is to investigate optimization techniques for sequence queries, with
emphasis on transforming queries into equivalent but more efficient forms.
Experimental work is to be performed to test proposed query formation and
optimization. The results obtained by the research will lead to a better
understanding of declarative sequence queries, and provide crucial components
for database applications that demand easy-to-use and efficient query languages
on sequenced data.
