The focus of this proposal is to provide technical coordination for the 2013
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigators' (PI) meeting and multiple
CPS-related workshops in the areas of Energy, Transportation, Medical Devices,
and Agriculture in late 2013 and early 2014. The workshops, each comprising
50-60 leading academic researchers and government as well as industrial
technology managers, will help the community understand the research challenges
at the intersection of cyber-physical systems and these application domains, and
help build research agendas for these domains going forward. Technical
coordination to be provided includes creating web resources ahead of the PI
meeting and workshops; coordination and formulation of the program agendas via
planning committees for the events; developing, editing, and archiving content
from these meetings; and contributing to the writing, editing, and publishing of
research needs reports resulting from these meetings. The broader impact of this
project is comprised of the meeting/workshop artifacts, particularly a broad and
compelling research agenda to guide future investments in cyber-physical systems
R&amp;D, particularly in the areas of energy, transportation, medical devices,
and agriculture.
