The problems in this program are in the area of overlap between low-dimensional
topology and combinatorial group theory. W. Thurston's work indicates that the
most interesting 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, i.e. ones that admit a Riemannian
metric of constant negative curvature. By letting a sequence of such structures
degenerate, a tree is obtained. The first problem is to understand the space of
actions of a group on trees. The motivating question here is whether or not the
space of simplicial actions is dense in the space of all actions. The second
problem is to bound the complexity of 3-orbifolds in terms of their fundamental
groups. A main question here is whether there is a bound (in terms of the number
of generators needed for the group) for the number of conjugacy classes of
maximal finite subgroups. There is a generalization, due to M. Gromov, to
arbitrary groups of the notion of hyperbolicity of the fundamental group of a
closed manifold. The final problem is to show that the fundamental group of a
mapping cylinder of an irreducible automorphism of a free group is hyperbolic in
this sense. All the problems have in common that they heavily mix topology and
some other branch of mathematics, geometry or algebra, or both. This is a
perennial phenomenom in mathematics, but it waxes and wanes. At the moment
projects which form bridges between neighboring fields are proliferating. The
trend to blur boundaries, as in this project, is particularly pronounced.
