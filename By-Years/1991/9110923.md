The goals of this research are to understand the reasons for the appearance of
different solid-liquid interface morphologies during the autogenous full
penetration welding of single and polycrystalline thin plates. The research will
identify the role that heat flow, surface tension, interfacial kinetic effects
and grain boundaries play (which include the effects of crystallographic
anisotropy) in the development of the weld pool shape and the resultant
properties of the fusion zone. Methods of research include numerical calculation
of solid-liquid weld pool interfaces modeled as nonlinear free or moving
boundaries, that account for heat flow and are coupled with the interfacial
properties, by using finite difference, finite element, spectral and/or boundary
integral techniques. Furthermore, numerical calculation of sharp transitions in
classes of weld pool shapes using analytical (both linear and nonlinear)
asymptotic analysis will be performed whenever applicable; the analysis will be
helpful in gaining a clearer knowledge of special limiting cases and for
comparison with the numerical results. The results will be compared to existing
experimental results, and the goal is to ultimately provide a correlation
between a set of welding conditions and final material properties. This would
provide an understanding of the types of welding methods that might eliminate or
circumvent deleterious weld pools shape features which give rise to sites for
defect generation and textured fusion zones. The project has potential to
improve the quality and control of the welding process.
