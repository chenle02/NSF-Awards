This NSF award will provide partial funding for the conference: "Analytic and
Combinatorial Number Theory: the legacy of Ramanujan." This is an international
conference to be held at the University of Illinois from June 6-9, 2019. The
conference is expected to attract around 120 participants. The conference
proceedings will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of
Number Theory. This conference will bring together prominent national and
international figures to discuss current research trends and recent advances in
combinatorial and analytic number theory, and for collaborative research
discussions.

The invited speakers represent a broad range of topics including algebraic
combinatorics, representation theory, special functions,modular and other
automorphic forms, partition theory, symbolic computation, L-functions and many
others. In addition we will have many contributed talks on diverse areas of
number theory. More details are available at the conference website:

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
