9422111 Crossin The development of the nervous system is dependent upon
coordinated interactions among specialized cells including neurons, glia and
other types of support cells, and of these cells with surrounding extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins. Cell attachment and migration as well as neurite
outgrowth, guidance, and fasciculation are all affected by interaction of cells
with components of the ECM during both development and regeneration. This
research focuses on analyzing a specific ECM protein, called
cytotactin/tenascin, and its interaction with nerve cells and with other matrix
components. This molecule is particularly interesting because it has been shown
to promote cell growth under some conditions and to inhibit growth under others.
The results of these studies should reveal mechanisms of neurite outgrowth
promotion by molecules present in regenerating nerves and also promise to shed
light on general mechanisms of cellular guidance and repair occurring during
development and regeneration of the nervous system.
