It is planned to provide tools for interpretation of combined hard X-ray, soft
X-ray, and optical observations of solar flares by developing self-consistent
models of energy transport in flares. The MAX '91 program is providing
unprecedented multiwavelength observations of flares during the current solar
maximum. In particular, it is planned to compute a grid of physically self-
consistent atmospheric models which are in energy balance, including energy
transport by nonthermal particles, thermal conduction, and all important
radiation processes (X-ray, UV, optical). It is neither necessary or desireable
to carry out a fully time-dependent model. It is more useful, for interpretation
of the observations to consider two simpler limiting cases: the hydrostatic
limit, valid on timescales typically tens of seconds or longer, and the
impulsive limit, where the mass is frozen into its preflare distribution. To
determine the heating and cooling of the optically thick chromosphere, a
rigorous non-LTE treatment of the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium
in all important atomic lines will be employed. These models should provide an
important step toward using integrated multi-wavelength observations to
discriminate between thermal and nonthermal processes in solar flare
chromospheres.
