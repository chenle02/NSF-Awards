In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the
Chemistry Division, Zwier will conduct experimental research on the
conformational preferences and isomerization dynamics of flexible biomolecules
(dipeptide, tripeptide, triamide, and depsipeptide) cooled in a gas phase
supersonic expansion. These molecules are sufficiently large to have significant
conformational complexity to bridge the gap between small molecules and the
complexity of large ones such as proteins. An ultraviolet chromophore will be
incorporated in the molecules, thereby enabling sensitive detection via laser
induced fluorescence or resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy. The
dynamics of conformational isomerization will be studied with IR-UV hole filling
spectroscopy and IR-induced population transfer spectroscopy.

The results of this work will be applicable to problem of protein folding and
may provide information about the laser control of molecular shape, with
possible applications to a variety of areas including information storage.
Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research. They will
thereby acquire valuable experience in preparation for advanced studies or for
entry into the scientific/technological workforce.
