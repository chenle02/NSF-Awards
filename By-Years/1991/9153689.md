The increasing presence of sophisticated instrumentation in undergraduate
laboratories creates the need for excellent new experiments that exploit those
capabilities. We will develop and test six new integrated instrument-based
laboratory projects for upper level chemistry courses. They will emphasize
inorganic and biological chemistry and analytical instrumentation, and they will
be sufficiently modular to be insertable into a variety of upper level
undergraduate courses. The projects will address important, modern questions in
chemistry and will provide students with opportunities to use powerful
instruments to confront meaningful problems. The projects will cause students to
plan strategies, consult the literature, design experimental methods, solve
problems encountered, and collect and interpret data.
