This award is concerned about developing a new technology to study potentially
damaging characteristics of near-field seismic ground motions and their impacts
to building structures. By using a moving reference coordinate system, the
motion (acceleration, velocity and displacement) trajectories can be decomposed
into kinetically separated parameters that represent different effects of the
combined dynamic forces. This approach is useful to probe the various types of
structural damages caused by a near-field ground motion with prominent velocity
or acceleration pulses-a phenomenon that has been observed as the cause of
various types of near-field structural damages. The research will consist of
three major tasks: (1). Analyze and extract damage parameters from recent major
earthquake ground motions; (2). Develop a new sensing system to measure the
damage parameters; (3). Integrate the identified key damage parameters into
structural demand and capacity models for potential earthquake engineering
