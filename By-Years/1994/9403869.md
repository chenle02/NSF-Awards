9403869 Wensley Research in theoretical particle physics will focus on the
phenomena of quark confinement. Quarks are the fundamental particles which are
the constituents of nucleons. Experimental evidence indicates that quarks are
confined that is, they are so tightly bound within the nucleon that they cannot
exist as free and separate particles. Calculations of the forces between quarks
will be performed using numerical computer simulations. These calculations will
shed light on the physical mechanism that causes the confinement of quarks.
Magnetic monopoles, the magnetic analogue of electric charges, have been
proposed as the confinement mechanism. The results of this project will provide
a stringent test of the magnetic monopole confinement scenario. Determining how
quarks are bound within nucleons is crucial for our understanding of the
fundamental particles in nature. ***
