The main topic of this National Science Foundation funded research project lies
in low-dimensional topology and knot theory. Topology is the study of
mathematical spaces up to elastic stretching, and knot theory is the study of
how loops can be embedded into topological spaces. Knot theory and low-
dimensional topology address important problems in physics, chemistry, and
biology. In addition to its research goals, this project has an educational
focus. Several of the proposed research projects are intended for collaboration
with undergraduate students. This project also aims to make knot theory
accessible to a broad audience via mentoring and outreach programs involving
audiences that are not typically exposed to research mathematics.

Connecting combinatorial information describing a topological object with the
underlying topology or geometry is a common theme throughout topology. Despite
being defined in a combinatorial manner, alternating knots and links are now
known to have topological descriptions. These topological descriptions led to a
recognition algorithm for alternating knots as well as a new proof of a
fundamental theorem concerning alternating links. In this project, the PI plans
to expand these techniques to several classes of links that generalize
alternating links, including quasi-alternating links, almost alternating links,
links of Turaev genus one, and links with simple alternating tangle
decompositions. The Jones polynomial and Khovanov homology of links in these
classes will also be explored.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
