This applicant proposes to study the receptor for Neurite- Extension-
Factor/S100B, a glial protein which stimulates neuronal differentiation.
Specifically, he hopes to identify, purify, characterize and perhaps clone the
receptor for this growth factor. If progress permits, the applicant also hopes
to work on the signal transduction mechanism by which the growth factor exerts
its effect. This work is planned to take place int he laboratory of Dr. Daniel
Marshak at the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory.
