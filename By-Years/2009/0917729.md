The Association for Institutional Research (AIR) proposes a two-year
continuation of a program that has increased the capacity of the postsecondary
education community to utilize national sample surveys and other NSF and NCES
data sets, thereby improving the quality of information underlying decision
making in postsecondary education, and the quality of' those decisions. The
proposed program has four components that will 1) support new research
initiatives, 2) support dissemination of findings, 3) provide face-to-face
training in the use of national databases, and 4) produce media-supported
training in the use of national databases for dissemination via the Web. These
components are targeted to doctoral students, postsecondary faculty, and
institutional researchers who study higher education including trends in
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and institutional researchers
who use national data in comparative studies and decision support at colleges
and universities.
