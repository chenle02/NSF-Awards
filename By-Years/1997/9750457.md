The goal of this project is to set up a computer laboratory for use in the
teaching of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations courses. For the past
several years, members of the dynamics group have been involved in a complete
updating of course offerings at the undergraduate level in these areas. Recent
advances in technology have profoundly changed the way these courses can and
should be taught. No longer is it necessary to spend the bulk of time in
differential equations classes teaching cookbook methods of solution. Rather,
using technology, students can compute these solutions symbolically. Then they
can view solutions geometrically, they can see how phase planes change as
parameters vary, and they can explore bifurcation phenomena. Also, it is now
possible in dynamics courses to introduce even first-year students to such
contemporary topics in mathematics as chaotic behavior, Julia sets, factual data
compression, and more. The goal of this project is to provide the computational
equipment so that students can benefit from these types of enriching activities.
