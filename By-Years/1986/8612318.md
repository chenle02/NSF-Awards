This proposal requests funds to purchase a 600 NMz NMR spectrometer to be used
for biochemical studies b a primary group of six investigators and four
secondary investigators. The overall objectives of the biochemical studies are
to develop, refine, and apply high-resolution NMR methods to a number of
biochemical problems in the areas of enzyme, protein, and peptide structures and
interactions and antibiotic-DNA interactions; to learn the structures in
solution of several enzymes, regulatory proteins, their peptide fragments, and
the structural basis of their specific interactions with substrates and nucleic
acids; and to determine at the chemical level the mode of interaction of
bleomycin and its metal complexes with DNA and of intercalating agents with
defined sequences of RNA.
