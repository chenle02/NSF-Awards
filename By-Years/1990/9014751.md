Research focuses on probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems and
dynamic routing problems with queueing effects. Included are two areas: (1)
worst-case analysis of heuristics; and (2) multi-server and multi-facility
probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems. It will be shown that the
concepts developed for probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems can be
used for optimization of queueing systems and the design of dynamic routing
strategies. Research should lead to significant progress and expansion of
knowledge and have an impact on producing more efficient distribution and
communication systems.
