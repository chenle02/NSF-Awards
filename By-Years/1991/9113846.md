The objective of this project is to develop a computer- integrated statistical
process control (SPC) system for an electronic circuit board production line
that uses surface mount technology. The system will consist of a database
connected to an on-line bar-code data acquisition network, an SPC analysis
package and an expert system for identification and diagnosis of quality
problems. The project will explore technological advances related to surface
mount technology for industrial applications with the potential for enhancing
collaborative efforts between the university and related industrial firms.
