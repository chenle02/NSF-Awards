Algorithmic Issues in Large Scale Dynamic Networks

Michael Mitzenmacher, Harvard University Eli Upfal, Brown University

We propose to develop a theoretically well-founded framework for the design and
analysis of algorithms for large scale dynamic networks. In particular, for the
Web and related dynamic networks, such as the underlying Internet topology and
Internet-based peer to peer ad hoc networks. We plan to develop rigorous
mathematical models that capture key characteristics and can make reliable
predictions about features such as connectivity, information content, and
dynamic of these networks. We plan to apply this framework to test existing
algorithms and construct improved new algorithms.

The mail benefits of developing the mathematical models of the Web structure and
dynamics will be the improved theoretical foundation for the design, analysis,
and testing of algorithms that operate in the web environment. The tangible
results of this work will therefore be models that can be subjected to
experimental verification, analyses of algorithms based upon these models, new
algorithms that benefit from these analyses, and, finally, proof-of-concept
demonstrations and experimental evaluations of such algorithms.
