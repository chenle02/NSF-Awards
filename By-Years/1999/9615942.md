ABSTRACT OPP 9615942 NADELHOFFER MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY This project is
designed to characterize climatic and environmental controls on carbon inputs to
tundra soils from belowground sources and on carbon balances in tundra soils.
Specific objectives of this project include 1) quantifying root production and
root-derived carbon fixation in wet sedge tundra, 2) assessing how global change
influences both rates of carbon inputs from belowground sources to soils and the
fate of these carbon inputs in arctic ecosystems, and 3) characterizing the
fluxes of root-derived carbon across the soil-water-atmosphere interface under
current and projected climatic conditions. The carbon-labeled experiments
proposed here will permit measurements of plant carbon allocation to belowground
production, fine root turnover, rates of carbon transfer from plants to soil and
atmospheric pools, and rates of soil carbon turnover over timescales of days to
years. Without such research on belowground carbon dynamics, it will be
difficult to develop realistic predictions of arctic ecosystem responses to
climate and environmental change.
