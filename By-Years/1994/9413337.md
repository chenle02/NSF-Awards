9413337 Donahue This award provides partial funding for the upgrade of a
2-megavolt tandem particle accelerator operated at the University of Arizona as
part of the NSF-Arizona AMS Facility (Accelerator-based Mass Spectrometry). The
accelerator is operated as a multi-user facility for 14C age dating of a wide
variety of natural samples and artifacts. Science applications range from global
change to archeological. The upgrade will consist of the addition of a high-
energy analyzing magnet system, accelerator terminal insulating supports, a high
frequency pulser, and an injection system electrostatic analyzer. The upgrade is
aimed specifically at decreasing the turn-around time for analyses by increasing
the throughput capabilities of the accelerator and decreasing the chances of
machine down-time. ***
