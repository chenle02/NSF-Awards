Brizard The investigator develops and analyzes low-frequency plasma kinetic and
fluid models for studying the long-time-scale transport processes and global
magnetohydrodynamic behavior of strongly magnetized imhomogeneous plasmas. He
uses Lie transform methods to formulate the models. This provides certain
technical advantages, both analytically and computationally, in exposing
important features of global nonlinear plasma dynamics. Astrophysical plasmas,
space plasmas, and "laboratory" plasmas seen in magnetic and inertial
confinement plasma systems share certain fundamental properties that are not
well understood. In part this is because a plasma consists of a great many
charged particles in motion, and the plasma's collective behavior is the result
of interactions between all these particles. These interactions take place on
very small length scales and time scales, and show themselves on larger scales.
The investigator develops formal methods to produce effective descriptions of
the behavior of plasmas across multiple scales. This leads to a better
understanding of fundamental properties of plasmas.
