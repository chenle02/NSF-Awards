&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unlike typical eukaryotic taxa, Bacteria and Archaea are
thought to evolve primarily through gene acquisition, that is, through the
transfer of DNA between distantly related organisms. Such horizontal gene
transfer occurs at high rates in many bacterial lineages, and virtually all
prokaryotic genomes show a substantial fraction of recently acquired sequences.
This project will extend our current understanding of the impact of horizontal
gene transfer on the evolution of microbial genomes by examining constraints on
DNA transfer between taxa. First, methods for detecting and quantifying recently
acquired genetic material will be refined and extended by integrating
identification of atypical genes (those not conforming to chromosome-wide
sequence patterns) with detection of phylogenetic incongruencies. Second, these
approaches will be used to develop a framework for understanding how and why the
rate of successful gene transfer varies among species - that is, why some
organisms are better DNA recipients; here organisms containing large amounts of
low-value information may be more likely to accept horizontally transferred DNA
since the incoming genes will be more likely to confer a benefit. Lastly, the
probability of successful DNA transfer will be examined from a functional
standpoint: that is, can chromosome structure impose a physical barrier to
lateral transfer between distantly related organisms? Direct experimentation
will test the roles of skewed, asymmetrically-distributed sequences in stalling
replication forks, and computational analyses will determine if the strength of
this barrier (the differences in these sets of sequences) increases with overall
phylogenetic distance.&lt;br/&gt;
