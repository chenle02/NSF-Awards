This award will enable Dr. Carol A. Gross of the University of Wisconsin to
collaborate with Professor Takashi Yura of Kyoto University, Japan on the study
of heat shock response in Escherichia coli. They will investigate the regulatory
mechanism of this organism's response to exposure to high temperature. Heat
shock response appears to be similar in most organisms, and thus an
understanding of the regulatory mechanism of this response in E. coli could be
of fundamental biological significance. Dr. Gross has applied biochemical and
physiological techniques to the study of heat shock response, while Dr. Yura has
been pursuing a genetic approach. A collaborative study incorporating these
complementary approaches is timely.
