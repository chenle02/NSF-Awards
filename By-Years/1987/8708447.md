Theoretical research will be carried out in two general areas of elementary
particle physics. The first is the study of the proper formulation of non-
Abelian quantum gauge field theories. In such theories, the particle which
carries some force is itself the source of further force carriers. The second
area is string theory, in which elementary particles are viewed as the
vibrations of very tiny strings. This research, to be carried out by very
distinguished physicists, is of basic importance in our efforts to understand
the constituents of matter and the basic forces.
