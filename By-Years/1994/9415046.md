Russell Sage College, founded in 1916, was commissioned by its founder to
prepare women with a solid education in the humanities, arts and sciences. In
adhering to this charge, the Biology Department has continued to make major
contributions to science through its recruitment efforts and undergraduate
preparation of women scientists. The department's success, however, is in
jeopardy due to inadequate facilities in Science Hall, a 30 year old structure
that has never been renovated. The building is not conducive for research and
research training activities, currently being pursed in the areas of
environmental studies, genetics, cell biology and physiology. Space originally
designed for non-research purposes have been converted to research space. With
NSF support, the College will reorganize research space in a centralized area to
alleviate problems associated with the dual usage of space. Renovations will
primarily consist of: providing dedicated spaces for two research laboratories,
a herbarium, an instrumentation room, and a prep area for chemical and glassware
processing. Consolidation of research activities in dedicated laboratories will
provide more efficient space for faculty and student researchers, and adequate
space for instrumentation, assuring research spaces are made fully accessible to
physically challenged persons. Once completed, the renovated science facility
will not only provide modern research and research training space for seven
faculty members and students, but will invigorate the department in the historic
and important mission of Russell Sage College in the changed environment of a
new century.
