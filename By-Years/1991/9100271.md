The aim of the proposal is to explore the potential of multilayer structures by
studying their synthesis by sputter deposition with in-situ characterization as
well as measurement of their mechanical properties. Grazing incidence X-ray
scattering is used to examine the surface and interfaces during deposition. The
films are synthesized with alternating face-centered cubic and body-centered
cubic metal pairs. These films offer the opportunity to study strengthening by
finely spaced obstacles that inhibit dislocation motion and relating this
strengthening to film epitaxy, film thickness and misfit strains. A strength in
the program is the use of an in-situ analysis technique, which could lead to new
understanding of film growth.
