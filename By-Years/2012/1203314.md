DOCTORAL DISSERTATION RESEARCH: DOMESTIC WORK ESCALATION IN EUROPE

ABSTRACT

The paid domestic work sector is dramatically increasing in the EU, particularly
in Spain. This project addresses three main questions about social inequality
through a mixed methodology design that includes documental, survey and
interview data. First, this research examines how public policy debates framed
the change in this economic sector in relation to issues of gender equality and
shifts in immigration across the EU and in Spain. Second, the study investigates
the relationship between employing paid domestic workers and the gender division
of paid and unpaid work within households. Finally, the project analyzes the
societal-level implications of increases in paid domestic work for changes in
inequality between families over time. This research seeks to make a theoretical
and empirical contribution by connecting the dynamics of pay domestic work
sector to changes in the effects of gender, ethnicity and class on
stratification and the meaning of social inequality in the EU.

Broader impacts

The escalation of paid domestic work is taking place in different places around
the world under similar circumstances. This study provides a framework to
understand the implications of this economic sector for the broader structure of
inequality, which could be used to contrast with other countries. Current policy
debates, especially at the European Union level, legitimate the growth of this
economic sector and propose to professionalize and formalize it. This research
aims to inform this debate by providing more information about the actual
implications of such proposals and making visible some of the ways in which
inequalities based on gender, class and ethnicized citizenship may not only be
reinforced but also possibly enhanced. This analysis is also crucial to
understand the meanings and implications of current policy debates about
fertility, migration and women's employment broadly understood. The results may
be of interest to policy makers, domestic workers rights' advocates, feminist
organizations and other organizations working on related social justice areas.
