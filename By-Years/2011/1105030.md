This award supports an experimental research program to test Newton's inverse-
square law of gravitation to better than one part in 100 at a 100-micrometer
range and to search for hypothetical extra space dimensions down to 10
micrometers. The source mass for the gravitational force measurement is designed
to generate no Newtonian signal. To reduce thermal noise that could mask a
signal, the experiment is cooled to liquid helium temperatures. Any inverse-
square law violation signal is detected by a highly sensitive superconducting
differential accelerometer formed by two superconducting test
masses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore the very nature of
spacetime and test the foundations of General Relativity and theories beyond the
Standard Model of particle physics. The confirmed observation of a deviation
from Newton's law at short distance would revolutionize our understanding of
gravity and could lead to a unification of all fundamental forces. The cryogenic
technique that this laboratory has developed for measuring extremely weak forces
is of potential value in a variety of other fields which require measurement of
minute forces.
