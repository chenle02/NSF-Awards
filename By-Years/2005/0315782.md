Mogilner&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops deterministic and
stochastic&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional computational models of the lamellipodia of
fish&lt;br/&gt;keratocyte, fibroblast and nematode sperm cells. He derives
and&lt;br/&gt;analyzes model equations for (i) protrusion of the leading
edge,&lt;br/&gt;(ii) contraction of the lamellipodial cytoskeleton, and
(iii)&lt;br/&gt;turnover and regulation of the lamellipodial cytoskeleton.
The&lt;br/&gt;equations are integrated into the realistic two-dimensional
model&lt;br/&gt;of the lamellipod. Simulations of the model equations on a
free&lt;br/&gt;boundary domain produce maps of movements, forces and shapes
that&lt;br/&gt;are compared with available experimental data to validate
the&lt;br/&gt;models.&lt;br/&gt; The investigator uses a novel combination of
mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis and computer simulations to develop explanatory
and&lt;br/&gt;predictive models of migrating cells. Cell migration
is&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally important in morphogenesis, wound healing,
and&lt;br/&gt;cancer. It is based on a complex self-organized
mechanochemical&lt;br/&gt;machine. Some relevant velocities, forces, rates
and&lt;br/&gt;concentrations have been measured, but minute details
of&lt;br/&gt;integration of forces, movements and chemical reactions into
the&lt;br/&gt;cell migration are unclear. The investigator's goal is
to&lt;br/&gt;understand quantitatively the molecular basis of cell
movements.&lt;br/&gt;The models allow testing plausible scenarios of cell
movements.&lt;br/&gt;They provide a new interdisciplinary level of understanding
cell&lt;br/&gt;movements and new methods of predicting cell behavior
in&lt;br/&gt;important medical and technological situations such as
cell&lt;br/&gt;division, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and wound healing.
Students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral researchers are involved in the
project,&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the development of a trained workforce at the
critical&lt;br/&gt;intersection of mathematics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;
