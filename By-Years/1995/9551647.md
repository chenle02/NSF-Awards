This project funds a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus and
a capillary electrophoresis (CE) system. These bioanalytical separation
instruments are being used in the following undergraduate laboratories:
Biochemical and Environmental Analysis, Instrumental Techniques, Biochemistry
Lab and Independent Study. Initially students are exposed to these instruments
in the Biochemical and Environmental Analysis Lab, where they carry out HPLC
analysis of metabolically important compounds in the urine or artificial
sweeteners and additives in beverages. Students provide their own samples for
the analysis. A simple experiment on CE is being introduced to demonstrate the
power of protein separation using a coated capillary. A protein mixture
consisting of lysozyme, ribonuclease A, cytochrome C, and myoglobin may be
readily separated using free-zone capillary electrophoresis. In Instrumental
Techniques, the students learn to optimize parameters and conditions to achieve
high resolution for separations on these instruments. In Biochemistry Lab,
students are introduced to the field of experimental biochemistry through a
project study of a protein. The availability of HPLC and CE greatly affects the
methods available for the preparation of the protein and the analysis of the
purity of the isolated protein. As time becomes available outside of the formal
courses, the instrument can also be used by students doing various independent
research projects which are required of chemistry majors.
