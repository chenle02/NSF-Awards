0115134&lt;br/&gt;Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal
submitted by Dr. Cheng Zhu, Georgia Institute of Technology and Professor Long
Mian, Chinese Academy of Science, for hosting a U.S.-China young investigator
workshop on biomechanics. Dr. Zhu requests travel expenses for 10 U.S.
scientists to attend this meeting, which is to be held in Beijing, China on
August 1-5, 2001. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together young
scientists and engineers for an exchange of views on future trends in
biomechanics, to exchange research ideas and results, and to stimulate
U.S.-China collaborative research in this field. The NSF and the National
Science Foundation of China jointly support this workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
