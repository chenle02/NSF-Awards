The project examines changes in cognitive processes resulting from instructional
interventions and applies this information in developing a prototype
instructional program. The cognitive processes of interest are those involved in
constructing meaning for decimal number symbols and using the meaning to solve
decimal number tasks. Previous work suggests that for many students, the lack of
meaning for written symbols is the source of low performance across a range of
mathematical tasks. Classroom instruction designed to promote cognitive
processes that create meanings for symbols is implemented and evaluated in the
context of decimal fractions. Students in grades 4 and 5 will be instructed in
whole classroom settings. Written tests and a series of individual interviews
will provide information on changes in key cognitive processes and on how such
changes are induced by specific instructional events. The information on
cognitive change and instructional effectiveness, gathered through a sequence of
instructional studies, will be translated into a prototype instructional program
for developing meaning for written symbols in mathematics. Moving from research
to practice, from descriptions of students' performance to prescriptions of
instructional programs, is a major objective of this program of research. In
addition to providing new knowledge and product outcomes, the project provides a
model, based on chain of inquiry notions, for translating research into
practice.
