This project will provide both new theoretical means for predicting rates of
hindered transport and new experimental methods for measuring transport rates.
Progress in modeling hindered transport will be made by extending the effective
medium theory of the Principal Investigator to include the effects of local
hydrodynamic and electostatic interactions. In addition, a method for
dynamically simulating the motion of a spherical macromolecule in a bed of
fibers will be developed and implemented. The simulations will provide a
versatile approach to studying a variety of fiber configurations and solute
fiber interactions, and will provide results that can be compared directly with
the analytical results of the effective medium theory.
