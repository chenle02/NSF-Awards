This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in condensed
matter physics between Angus Kingon at North Carolina State University and
Bernard Agius at the University of Paris, Orsay. The objective of their research
is to study the use of ferroelectric thin films in advanced technologies. They
will investigate materials integration of thin films processing with regard to
use in thin-film devices, and the impact of microstructure on fundamental
properties. This project brings together complementary U.S. and French expertise
in thin film growth and characterization. Ferroelectric films have potential
applications in capacitor materials, filters, pressure sensors and other
devices.
