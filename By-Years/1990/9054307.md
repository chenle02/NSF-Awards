The objective of the two-day workshop, "Creative and Structured Design Methods,"
is to present various design methodologies to engineering faculty, to give them
the opportunity to share their teaching experiences, and to apply
interdisciplinary concepts to discipline-based instruction in design. The
workshop is conducted in conjunction with the 1991 National ASEE conference in
New Orleans, similar to the very successful, NSF-funded workshop conducted in
conjunction with the 1989 National ASEE Meeting in Nebraska (USE-8950029). In
addition, a second workshop will be held, which will complement the first by
providing a follow-up experience for the faculty who attended the 1989 workshop
as well as an alternative experience for those who are not able to attend the
two-day workshop.
