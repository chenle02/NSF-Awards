AST 0118263&lt;br/&gt;Dodelson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding is for a 3-week
workshop titled "Structure Formation and Dark Matter: Theory vs. Observations."
The Elementary Particles and Field Theory Group of Los Alamos National
Laboratories and the Cosmology Group at the University of Chicago are
coordinating the workshop. The workshop is designed to promote discussion
through both formal and informal talks. The funds for this grant will be used to
support travel expenses for approximately six students, thus enhancing their
training in the field of Cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this
project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy &amp;
Cosmology (AST/EXC).&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
