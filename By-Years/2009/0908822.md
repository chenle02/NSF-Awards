This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Andrew F. Boden of the California
Institute of Technology will undertake a study of the properties of binary stars
at various stages of their lives. Binary stars are fundamental calibrators of
stellar evolution, since the masses of the stars and the distance to each system
can be accurately determined. This in turn yields the stellar luminosity, which
measures the rate of nuclear energy generation. This award will support an
established program of interferometric, astrometric, and radial velocities of
binaries, including recently formed binaries and those with a high abundance of
iron-peak elements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to improve
physical models of stars and to provide important information on the process of
star formation.
