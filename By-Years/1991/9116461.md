This award provides support to the University Navstar Consortium (UNAVCO)
located in Boulder, Colorado. UNAVCO is a consortium of 30 U.S. universities
that manages a facility providing equipment and logistical assistance to earth
scientists making use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites for
research in crustal dynamics, earthquake, volcano, and global change research.
Using GPS, vector baselines between receivers separated by 100 kilometers or
more are now being routinely measured with one centimeter (or 100 parts per
billion) accuracy. Such measurements can be completed using portable equipment
in a few hours or less. The ability to make such measurements has found
immediate applications in research on global plate tectonics, earthquake
mechanics, volcano monitoring, and regional tectonics. The UNAVCO facility
offers a complete support program for university-based investigators including
assistance in planning filed work, training of personnel, equipment, shipping,
customs, field operations, technical troubleshooting, data management, analysis
and archiving. UNAVCO also represents the academic research community and acts
as a central clearinghouse for information on the scientific applications of
GPS. As a part of its service to investigators, UNAVCO tests GPS equipment and
techniques, and works to improve GPS surveying accuracy.
