The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Dr. K. Barry Sharpless.
Sharpless, Prof. of Chemistry at MIT, continues his pioneering investigations of
new reagents for organic synthesis. His current work is, in part, directed
towards examining how metals complex to existing groups in a molecule to direct
new reactions to a particular site. Notable new directions include trying to
develop methods that do not require an existing tether to direct the chemistry.
Sharpless's group continues to investigate the mechanistic details of ligand-
accelerated catalysis of reactions, and how this leads to the remarkable
enantioselectivity observed for the reactions. As part of his mechanistic
investigations he has recently discovered a process for dihydroxylating an
isolated alkene bond without prior binding of the reagent to the substrate. This
discovery opens a whole new arena for scientific enquiry, and has great
potential for synthetic chemists. His group is trying to also understand the
origins of this process. Sharpless will "comb the periodic table" looking for
new reagents to add to the arsenal already available to the synthesis chemist.
Initial scrutiny will be given to finding unique metal/ hydroperoxide
combinations to carry out asymmetric epoxidation to isolated alkenes. A unique
assay system, analgous to that used for screening for bioactivity of molecules,
will be employed to examine large series of reactions.
