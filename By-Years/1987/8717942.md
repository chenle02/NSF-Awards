They propose to develop a number of parallel algorithms for the new multicluster
CEDAR computer. The research will cover algorithms and methods that are used in
important areas in scientific computing. The parallel algorithms will not only
be targeted for the CEDAR computer architecture but also for other shared memory
multiprocessor computers possessing hierarchical memories. The topics to be
covered are: (i) solution of general large sparse systems of linear and
nonlinear equations; (ii) solution of large sparse eigenvalue problems; and
(iii) rapid elliptic solvers.
