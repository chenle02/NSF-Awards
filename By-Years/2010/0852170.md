This award will provide support to defray expenses of researchers participating
in the Conference ``Twenty Years of Wavelets" that will take place May 15-17,
2009 at DePaul University, Chicago, IL. Support will be provided to participants
who do not currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for some plenary
speakers. It is understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate
students, postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will
be funded as well.

The program will feature about thirteen invites speakers, who will deliver one-
hour lectures, and a number of contributed talks. The principal objective of
this conference is to provide a forum for presentation of the current state of
the art of the theory of wavelets as well as for dissemination of recent results
and discussion of outstanding problems. Another, equally important, objective
towards this end is to involve young mathematicians, female mathematicians, and
mathematicians from other under-represented groups. Several junior scientists
and graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.
