Iowa State University is awarded a grant to develop small interference RNA
(siRNA) design software. RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural phenomenon in
cells where siRNAs guide the recognition, inhibition and potential degradation
of target messenger RNAs (mRNA), resulting in the lost of their gene functions.
RNAi is an important molecular biology technology that can be used to perform
functional genomic studies. It is also suggested that siRNAs can be used as
drugs to stop oncogenes in cancer cells or to fight off viruses. The RNAi
technology depends on the quality of the artificially designed siRNAs - the most
critical task is to discover siRNAs that are efficient in knocking down their
target genes but produce no disturbance to the other tens of thousands of genes
coexisting in cells. Reducing or eliminating side-effects can dramatically
enhance the precision of RNAi technology. In fact, eliminating side-effects will
be the basic requirement of any RNAi uses in medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
two main goals of this project are 1) to create novel siRNA design software that
can select high quality, gene-specific siRNAs based on the comprehensive
thermodynamic analysis of an entire genome and 2) to validate the quality of the
designed siRNAs with RNAi experiments. The intellectual merit of this project is
the use of thermodynamic calculation in a whole-genome scale to perform optimal
siRNA selection. The RNAi experiments will not only test the siRNAs but also
guide the refinements to the project software algorithms and parameters. The
broader impact that is expected from this project will be the most precise siRNA
design software tool for biologists to use in their research. In addition, this
project will provide an ideal interdisciplinary training environment for both
computer science and biology graduate students to work together and advance in
computational biology research. The software developed under this project will
be made available from the Complex Computation Lab website at Iowa State
University &lt;http://www.complex.iastate.edu&gt;.
