Researchers often wish to synthesize data from independent studies, using
methods such as systematic review, meta-analysis, and expert elicitation.
Research synthesis presents difficult methodological questions and approaches
have evolved differently across academic disciplines. Both the choice of
synthesis method and its application can affect the conclusions, with important
implications for decision making. This workshop explores these issues in the
context of environmental, health, and safety policy, where such methods may
affect conclusions about the toxicity of a substance, the relationship between
exposure and health risks, the monetary value of risk reductions, and other
policy-relevant research questions.

The goal of the project is to improve the methods used for research synthesis so
as to promote evidence-based decision making. The objectives include: (1)
increasing cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration on methodological
issues by bringing together experts from diverse fields to address common
problems; (2) defining more rigorously the types of problems and types of data
for which different synthesis methods are most appropriate, alone or in
combination; (3) developing innovative approaches for addressing specific
challenges in applying these methods; and (4) identifying areas where further
cross-disciplinary work may be particularly fruitful. The project includes three
phases: developing background papers, convening an expert workshop, and
disseminating results.
