In this project, an interdisciplinary team of faculty from the College of
Natural Science and the Lyman Briggs School at Michigan State University are
working to develop and validate a new assessment tool for courses in biology,
chemistry, physics and geology. The idea is for students to construct concept
maps of their own. The Concept Connector, consists of a web-based, concept
mapping Java applet with automatic scoring and feedback functionality. The tool
enables students in large introductory science classes to visualize their
thinking online and receive immediate formative feedback. The assessment tool
and the methods of its application in the classroom are being designed to
motivate students to reflect, revise and share their thinking with peers as an
extension of the learning process. We predict (i) faculty becomes better able to
identify their students ' areas of incomplete, vague or misunderstanding of
science, and (ii) students confront their misconceptions and become better able
to reflect on, organize, and integrate their learning. Three primary goals of
this project are to: (1) develop and validate an online concept mapping tool
that can be used to provide immediate feedback (computer automated) to both
students and instructors about student understanding of conceptual
relationships, (2) detect and document students ' misconceptions regarding
relationships between concepts (e.g., interdisciplinary; relation between
ecology and quantum physics, or discipline specific; structure and function of
DNA), and (3) implement and sustain faculty development workshops to help
faculty design curricula and instruction that can better assess student learning
and enable students to use visual models to represent their
understanding.&lt;br/&gt;
