The triennial meeting of the International Political Science Association is the
principal venue for scientists from different nations with common interests in
political institutions, processes, and behavior to meet and exchange research
ideas. The participation of American scientists in these meetings is vital not
only to insure that American political science benefits from the latest
developments in the discipline world wide but also because American political
science has much to offer the world community in exchange. This modest grant
will help to defray the expenses of 50 American political scientists to
participant in the XV World Congress of the International Political Science
Association in Buenos Aires, July, 1991. In selecting scientists to participate
in the conference, emphasis will be placed on insuring balanced representation
of both younger and minority scholars as well as scholars from diverse sub-
fields.
