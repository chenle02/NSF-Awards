This proposal requests funding for a liquid scintillation (LS) system to
provide new and important technical capabilities in the principal investigator's
(PI's) research programs. Specializing in mass transfer through membranes and
porous media, the principal investigator is currently focusing her research
efforts in two areas: (1) percutaneous absorption of solutes, and (2) in-place
remediation technologies for vadose zone soils. The ability to measure
concentrations of radiolabelled compounds will greatly expand the scientific
issues which can be studied in these two programs. Although LS counting is
essential to the research endeavors described here, the extent of use on a given
research project makes justification of its purchase as dedicated instrument on
single research proposal difficult. Consequently, the proposed instrument will
be made available for campus wide use. Presently LS counting is not available at
the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). The proposed LS system will provide many
important new research opportunities for other researchers at CSM. As with many
other analytical instruments, the demands LS capabilities certainly will grow
once an instrument is available on the CSM campus.
