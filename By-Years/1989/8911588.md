What defines the collective identity of a 'generation'? Commonly perceived but
rarely studied systematically is the way in which formative events of the recent
historic past (like the Thirty's depression, the Vietnam war or the
computerization of the workplace) are differently experienced by various
generations then alive. This project will replicate and extend past work
concerned with generational effects on the collective memories of
individuals.The general question driving this work is whether different
generational groups have distinctive memories that are shaped by public
eventsand if so, when in the course of their lives do events make their
strongest impression or any memorable impression at all? Recently published work
by the Principal Investigator has established, atone point in time, the
disproportionate influence of political events occurring during the adolescence
and early adult years, rather than in earlier or later years. The work proposed
here would replicate the result and probe further into the range of events
(political, but also scientific and technological developments) for which it is
true,the explanations of this effect and the consequences for currentattitudes
and actions. //
