The objective of this research is to develop uncertainty-propagation procedures
for general-purpose finite-element (FE) codes. The extended codes will contain
several options, with the user being able to: specify which geometrical
parameters, material properties, loads, and other relevant environmental
conditions are uncertain; choose a probabilistic model for each random variable
or random function; select the response variables (displacements, deformation,
internal forces, etc.), the probability distribution of which is to be
calculated; and control the method of uncertainty propagation. There will be
also flexibility as to the representation of response uncertainty, e.g., second-
moment versus full-distribution and total-uncertainty versus separation of
uncertainty into contributions from different sources (loads, geometrical
variables, etc.). Stochastic-analysis options will be implemented on the
NONSAP-C code and illustrated through detailed study of one problem: creep and
shrinkage deformation of prestressed segmental bridges as a function of time.
