This research addresses the formation of a standard for performing point-to-
point message passing between pairs of processes in a MIMD distributed memory
computing systems. A small set of typed message passing routines form the core
of the standard, and are augmented by support for features such as noncontiguous
messages, communication contexts, and process groups. The proposed standard
activity is called Message Passing Interface Forum. (MPI). The main advantages
of establishing a message passing standard are portability and ease-of-use. In a
distributed memory communication environment in which the higher level routines
and/or abstractions are built upon lower level message passing routines the
benefits of standardization are particularly apparent. Furthermore, the
definition of a message passing standard, such as that proposed here, provides
vendors with a clearly defined base set of routines that they can implement
efficiently, or in some cases provide hardware support for, thereby enhancing
scalability.
