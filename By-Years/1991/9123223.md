Optical spectroscopy of actinide ions in glasses reveals variations in the
valences of these ions from the usual value of +3. This phenomena, recently
observed for americium, will be investigated in other actinides such as curium,
neptunium, plutonium, and uranium. Different glass hosts and reducing agents
will be used to control the valence state of the actinides. Absorption and
fluorescence measurements of the ions over a range of temperatures and
concentrations will be carried out. Line narrowing and spectral holes burning
studies will provide information on energy transfer and relaxation processes in
these materials. These processes are very important in the development of lasers
and other luminescent devices and can reveal the dynamic and static structure of
amorphous hosts.
