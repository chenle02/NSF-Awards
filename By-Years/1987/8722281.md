Crystallization is an important process for producing high-value fine and
specialty chemicals, biochemicals and pharmaceuticals. The process remains,
however, as an art rather than science. The proposed research is aimed at
establishing a scientific basis for the process. The crystallization of four
model amino acids will be studied in both batch and continuous crystallizers. An
understanding will be obtained for the mechanism of crystal nucleation and
growth. The results will have direct impact on the field of crystallization and
also expanding its application to bioseparation and purification.
