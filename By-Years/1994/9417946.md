This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the research of Professor
Stephen F. Nelsen at the University of Wisconsin/Madison. Radical cations and
dications generated by oxidation of tetrasubstituted C=C, C=N, N=N, oxygenated
N=N, and trisubstituted N=S functionalities will be studied. By successive
removal of one and two electrons from the double bonds, species with one unit of
positive charge (radical cations) and two units of positive charge (dications)
will be generated. The stability of these reactive intermediates as a function
of geometry will be pursued by incorporating them into bicyclic rings. Variation
of the ring size will permit an investigation of reactivity as a function of
ring size and through-space interactions across medium sized rings. A variety of
spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques will be used to characterize
radical cations and dications. ESR will be the prime spectroscopic tool that
will be used to elucidate structural details. The generation, stabilization, and
characterization of reactive intermediates formed under oxidative conditions
will advance the fundamental understanding of organic oxidation reactions and
define the important role of molecular structure in facilitating or inhibiting
oxidations.
