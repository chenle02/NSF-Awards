This study is developing adaptive error control algorithms for nonstationary
communication channels with feedback. The feedback channel allows for the flow
of channel state information from the receiver to the transmitter. The
transmitter uses this information to reconfigure data structures in accordance
with variations in channel noise and attenuation. There are three basic
questions that are being considered in the development of the adaptive
algorithms. First, how can the receiver derive channel state information from
received data blocks? secondly, how can the receiver use the feedback channel to
report this information to the transmitter? Finally, how is the transmitter to
react to this information?
