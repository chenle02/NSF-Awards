Dr. James A. Cowan has been selected as a National Science Foundation 1992 Young
Investigator. This five year continuing award recognizes the research and
teaching achievements of new faculty members. Cowan is a member of the chemistry
department at Ohio State University where he will continue to carry out research
in bioinorganic chemistry, concentrating on understanding the structural
requirements for the interaction of metals with nucleic acids and enzymes. His
work will focus on four areas: (1) the role of the magnesium ion cofactor in
polynucleotide processing enzymes; (2) sequence selective metal binding to
nucleic acids; (3) metalloregulatory mechanisms for DNA-protein interactions;
and (4) structural factors of protein binding to high potential iron protein.
Folding and sequencing in proteins imposes specific requirements for association
by a metal, but binding by a metal can also modify the protein's structure and
enhance (or reduce) its enzymatic activity. Cowan will investigate these
specific cases in order to understand the requirements for and consequences of
metal binding to DNA and certain polynucleotides and enzymes.
