Microorganisms are undisputed champions of biological diversity. They are both
numerous and biochemically diverse, and they play significant roles in nearly
all biologically relevant element cycles. But this diversity has made some
fundamental questions difficult to solve: How do co-existing microbes partition
ecological functions, and what are the evolutionary mechanisms of ecological
diversification? This project addresses these questions using coastal ocean
bacteria of the Vibrionaceae as a model. New statistical tools will be developed
to identify ecologically distinct populations among co-existing microbes, and
~70 complete genome sequences will be analyzed to identify the genes responsible
for differences among populations. The role of gene exchange within and between
bacterial populations will be quantified and used to critically test existing
theories of bacterial population genetics.

Populations are the fundamental ecological and evolutionary units of function in
changing environments, and this project advances understanding of bacterial
populations. The results will contribute to prediction of how microbial
communities (including pathogens, as well as microbes involved in element
cycles) will act and react in changing environments. A postdoctoral researcher
and graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research. The
project will create significant genetic and analytical resources and will
develop visual tools to better inform the public about microbes and their
important roles in vital ecosystem functions.
