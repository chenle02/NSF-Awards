9318636 Ceyer A knowledge of the detailed dynamics of heterogeneous reactions
will put our understanding of surface reaction chemistry on the same footing as
our detailed understanding of elementary gas phase reaction processes. This
research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, is
designed to obtain this sort of detailed information. Surface processes which
are induced by the collision of gas phase species with the surface are the focus
of the work of this project. Molecular beam methods will be used to investigate
the reaction of molecules with the surface and species adsorbed on the surface,
as a function of the translational energy of the incident molecule. The
hydrogenation of ethylene on the nickel surface and the packing of hydrogen
atoms into the bulk of the nickel sample are two processes which will be
explored in detail. Electron energy loss spectroscopy will be used to identify
possible reaction products and surface intermediates which may result from the
collision induced surface chemistry. %%% The basic understanding of the dynamics
of surface chemical reactions is important for our developing understanding of
many technologically important surface processes such as heterogeneous catalysis
and electronic materials processing. This basic understanding can best be
obtained by exploring the dynamics of elementary surface reaction processes
using the molecular dynamics methods developed to examine gas phase reactions.
This project addresses the specific question of collision activated surface
chemistry, using variable energy molecular beam studies to probe important model
systems. From this detailed experimental information, a framework for
understanding surface chemical processes will develop. ***
