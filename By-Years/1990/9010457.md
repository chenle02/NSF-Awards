Effects of electron transport dominate semiconductor device behavior. The main
objective of the proposed research is to develop a comprehensive, physically
accurate transport model, which is suitable for efficient numerical evaluation.
The model will integrate two approaches for characterizing electron transport:
the Legendre polynomial technique, and the energy transport method. In addition
to determining current densities and electric potentials, when fully realized,
the model will allow for rapid calculation of the electron distribution function
throughout a device. Initial studies will focus on numerically solving the
homogeneous Boltzmann transport equation, using Legendre polynomials, while
incorporating the effects of phonon scattering, one non-parabolic conduction
band, and impact ionization. The model will then be used to calculate currents
generated by ionization in MOSFETs. Next, the effect of several conduction bands
will be introduced. Finally, the effect of nonlinear electron-electron
scattering will be accounted for by using Fokker Plank formulation. Spatial
dependence will be obtained by evaluating the energy balance equation to
determine the space-dependent average electron energy. The space-dependent
distribution function will then be determined by simultaneous solutions of the
energy balance equation and the homogeneous Boltzmann equation. This study will
facilitate a better understanding of the physical phenomena which affect
submicron device operation, and is well suited for applications in CAD.
