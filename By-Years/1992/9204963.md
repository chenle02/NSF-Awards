This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. Widen Tabakoff and Dr. Awatef
Hamid of the University of Cincinnati and Dr. Vesselin Shanov of the Technical
University of Sofia, Bulgaria, will perform complementary research tasks at
their laboratories related to new temperature materials which are resistant to
erosion. Professor Shanov from the Technical University of Sofia will develop
high temperature erosion resistant ceramic coatings which will be further
investigated at the University of Cincinnati in regard to erosion and surface
impacts when the new coatings are exposed to high temperature particulate flows.
The proposed cooperative research project involves the collaboration of the two
teams in conducting complementary research tasks which will enhance the
knowledge derived from their research efforts, and will produce new results that
will benefit the scientific community in the critical area of erosion and high
temperature materials. This project in aerospace and engineering metallurgy
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
