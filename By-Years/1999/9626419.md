9626419 Wei The proposed research lies in the area of Riemannian Geometry. The
investigator wishes to study the effect of Ricci curvature and integral
curvature bounds on the local geometric structure and topology of the underlying
Riemannian manifold. For example, the investigator is interested in determining
the structure of the fundamental group for manifolds with a lower Ricci
curvature bound. Riemannian geometry is the study of abstract spaces, so called
Riemannian manifolds, possessing a distance function. Riemannian manifolds are
abstract spaces in that they do not necessarily lie in an ambient space, unlike
curves or surfaces in 3-space. The proposed research has to do with the
interplay between the topology of a Riemannian manifold - which determines its
overall shape without regard to 'curvature' - and the metric or distance related
properties.
