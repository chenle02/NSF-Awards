OCE-9529793 Scheirer This award will support participation in a research cruise
to the southern East Pacific Rise at its site of maximum spreading rate (17
30'S). The project will complement a sidescan-sonar and visual survey with near-
bottom magnetics and pencil-scanning sonar. Data collected will address
questions on the nature and rile of fissures (stress distribution, role in
magmatic and hydrothermal plumbing) and the axial depression (caldera or
graben?). Magnetometer data will determine the relationship, if any, between
high magnetization and fresh lava flows.
