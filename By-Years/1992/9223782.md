The methods of computational chemistry are being expanded and improved in this
study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the Division of
Chemistry in order to permit their greater applicability to very large molecular
systems including surfaces and other bulk forms of matter. New methods patterned
after electron density functional theory are being developed. Applications
include the modeling of chemisorption of metal atoms to graphite surfaces, the
interpretation of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, and studies of the
epitaxial growth of diamond. The work also involves the large-area (global)
networking of supercomputers. %%% New mathematical and computational models are
being developed to permit the calculation of the properties of very molecular
systems including the bonding of metal atoms to graphite surfaces and the growth
of diamond crystals. An important aspect of this work is its use of large-area
(global) networking of supercomputers.
