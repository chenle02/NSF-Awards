This research entails solution polymerization in a supercritical fluid (SCF) as
solvent. The thesis is that the advantage of polymerization in SCF is that
polymer (product) solubility can be easily controlled by varying the temperature
and pressure. This, in turn, implies that polymer of a desired narrow molecular
weight (MW) range can be produced because as soon as this MW is attained, the
temperature or pressure are changed, and all the monomer and polymer are
instantaneously precipitated out of solution. The reaction thus comes to an
immediate halt. There is an added advantage in that the SCF remains a gas and
the expensive, highly energy-intensive process of separating product from
solvent is eliminated.
