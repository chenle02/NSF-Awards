This goal of this effort is to develop the next general of firewalls by using
filtering rules and some intrusion detection techniques. Firewalls are a very
important area in information security. The project will incorporate filtering
rules in security policies. In particular specification of policies and
filtering rules as well as algorithms for analyzing and verifying the filtering
of the rules will be developed. The results will be used to detect intrusions as
well as to develop the next generation of firewalls.
