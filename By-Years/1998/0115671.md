0115671&lt;br/&gt;Hogg&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts will provide
support for acquisition of mooring-related instrumentation to be managed by the
Physical Oceanography Observing Laboratory (POOL) and made available on a
shared-use basis to US academic researchers funded for research that requires
oceanographic moorings. Specific instrumentation provided with this award
includes two moored profilers with acoustic current meters and CTDs, as well as
forty other acoustic current meters, plus temperature and salinity sensors,
acoustic releases and deck units for general mooring support. WHOI will
contribute 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
