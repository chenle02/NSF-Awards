This grant will continue an investigation of the interaction between waves and
particles in magnetospheric plasmas with emphasis on the problem of oblique wave
growth and the associated rate of particle scattering. Quantitative models will
also be developed for the effect of such scattering on the average rate of loss
of geomagnetically-trapped particles (the Van Allen radiation belts) the
concomitant energy deposition into a planetary ionosphere, and the anticipated
changes in the height-profile of ionospheric conductivity and its effect on the
bulk transport properties of magnetospheric plasma. This work will be important
to an understanding of the life cycle of the Van Allen radiation belts. It is
thought that the plasma waves to be studied here are a major factor in
controlling the Van Allen radiation belt populations.
