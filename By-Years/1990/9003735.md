This award provides one-half the funding required for the purchase and
installation of a spinner magnetometer to be operated in the Department of Earth
and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis University. The University is committed
to providing the remaining funds needed. The magnetometer will be used in
paleomagnetic research in the areas of oceanic crust magnetization, basic rock
magnetism, and pre-Cambrian and Paleozoic paleomagnetism.
