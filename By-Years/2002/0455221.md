This award is for the development of software for feature recognition in
minirhizotrons, which are tubes for the observation of living roots. Fine root
turnover is a significant component of ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles, but
methodological challenges have limited our ability to measure root turnover
under natural conditions. Recently, the use of minirhizotrons and miniaturized
camera equipment has emerged as the technique of choice for studying fine root
dynamics in ecological and agronomic settings. However, the time required to
process minirhizotron images is excessive. In this project, we will develop
open-source, feature-recognition software to assist in the capture and analysis
of minirhizotron images. By improving user interfaces and incorporating
algorithms used to identify blood vessels in medical images, we will automate
many aspects of minirhizotron data collection.

The production and mortality of plant roots represents a significant flux of
carbon and nutrients through ecosystems. Measuring rates of root turnover is
therefore crucial to predicting ecosystem responses to global change. This
software-development research will aid in measuring root production and
mortality, and it will help train students in an interdisciplinary research
area.
