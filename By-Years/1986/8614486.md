This project provides for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of North
Atlantic Hydrographic data. The base if formed by a combination of historical
Nasen bottle stations, a set for long lines of CTD data collection over the past
six years, and new long meridional sections in the North and South Atlantic (the
northern section would be done 1988 and the southern section 1989). Specific
studies in the North Atlantic include the zonal flow field within the subpolar
gyre, exchange of water between the subpolar and subtropical gyres, and the low
latitude nfluence of high latitude convection. In the South Atlantic the
endeavors are more exploratory because the data are more sparse and the general
goal is to bring our understanding up to the same level that has been developed
in the north.
