--------------- Abstract (100
words)------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of
supervisory control and actuator allocation in &lt;br/&gt;flexible structures is
proposed and the research objectives are&lt;br/&gt;to: (1) provide a theoretical
framework for the supervision and &lt;br/&gt;switching of actuators and
controllers in flexible structures,&lt;br/&gt;(2) develop and implement
efficient computational schemes,&lt;br/&gt;(3) verify experimentally the
theoretical results and the&lt;br/&gt;computational predictions on a flexible
plate. These would naturally&lt;br/&gt;complement the educational objectives
which are to: (1) integrate &lt;br/&gt;control and system identification
techniques in vibrations and &lt;br/&gt;mechatronics curricula, (2) design
laboratory experiments to enhance &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate courses using the
controls lab, (3) promote a hands-on &lt;br/&gt;approach to teaching controls
from a multidisciplinary point of view.&lt;br/&gt;
