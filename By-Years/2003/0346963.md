The main research objective of this proposal is to develop a formal theory of
distributed ontologies for use on the Semantic Web. The theory defines the
semantics of relationships that can exist between ontologies and those that can
exist between ontologies and information resources. The theory will be developed
in phases: a model theoretic semantics with different entailment relations for
each point of view will be followed by a possible world semantics that unifies
the various entailment relations. It will then be extended to allow for rich
expressions of trust. Scalability, an important issue for the Semantic Web, will
be a significant consideration in the design of the theory. Results from this
project would impact other areas as well, for instance, communication between
autonomous agents and distributed databases. The educational component of this
project focuses on using the Semantic Web as a tool for education and for the
training of semantic web practitioners and future researchers. Resources from
the project will be used in a course and will be made available for use by other
educators.
