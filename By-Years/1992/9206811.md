This two-year project will focus on 1) the development and testing of the GIS-
based analyses and models to explore the importance of topography, land use, and
landscape arrangement to nutrient discharges; 2) they will examine the effects
of spatial resolution on such analyses; and 3) will developing ways to
incorporate fine-scale insights into broad, regional analyses of nutrient
discharge. The work will focus on coupling the extensive records of nutrient
discharge at the Smithsonian's Rhode River study site with a very fine- scale
GIS data base. These researchers will also test the GIS-based analyses with
geographic and nutrient discharge data from our current studies of the German
Branch watershed on the outer coastal plain on Maryland's Eastern Shore and of
the Little Gunpowder Falls watershed on the Piedmont north of the city of
Baltimore.
