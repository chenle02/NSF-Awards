This project will support the purchase of workstations and software to improve
instruction in upper division mathematics and applied mathematics courses. It is
being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program,
which has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-
based undergraduate laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or engineering.
The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support
for the instrumen- tation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional
improvements at U.S. colleges and universities. In particular, the main
objective of this project is to provide upper division students in several
courses with powerful, user friendly mathematical software which combines
numerical, symbolic, and graphics capabilities in one package. The students will
be able to experiment with recently learned ideas, and to visualize solutions to
problems they have worked.
