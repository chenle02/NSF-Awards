This project is involved in interesting young minority women in future careers
in science and engineering by providing them with enrichment skills, incentives,
mentors and role models upon which to base their career choices. Twenty-four
minority girls who are in grades 9 and 10 and six high school teachers are
participating in a year-long program which includes a Saturday program during
the school year and a 10- day summer residence program. Objectives include
interacting with female scientists and university professors as role models,
raising sights toward higher education, developing a peer network, and upgrading
skills and confidence with computers.
