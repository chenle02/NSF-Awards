With National Science Foundation support, Xavier University of Louisiana will
implement institutional self-assessments and develop an action plan to
strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure. The objective of
the proposed effort is to better prepare STEM graduates for entry, successful
careers and leadership positions in the STEM workforce.

Project activities include (1) evaluation and improvement of student recruitment
strategies with the goal of increasing enrollment in SMET programs; (2)
identification of current impediments to successful completion of STEM gate-
keeping courses and development of strategies to increase completion, retention
and graduation; (3) evaluation of STEM curricula to discover methods to better
prepare students for success in the STEM workforce; and, (4) development of
strategies to integrate research and education.
