Although wind-blown dunes composed of carbonate sand are widespread along
subtropical shorelines, such dune deposits were, until very recently, unknown
from strata more than several million years old. Discovery of eolian limestones
of Pennsylvanian age in southwestern U.S. supports the view that the origin of
carbonate-rich dunes is related to the shoreline fluctuations that accompany
glacial epochs. I will conduct detailed field and laboratory study of eolian
limestones of southeastern Utah and of the Grand Canyon region of northern
Arizona and southern Nevada. Outcrop and subsurface studies will determine the
lateral extent of individual eolian limestone beds and document the vertical and
lateral relationships of eolian and marine facies. Laboratory work will
reconstruct the original texture and mineralogy of the dune sands as well as the
processes and products of their subsequent alteration. The study will
established improved criteria for the identification of ancient eolian
limestones and will test several hypotheses for their origin. One of these
hypotheses addresses the possibility that the incompleteness of many stratal
sequences is due to wind erosion. Although eolian limestones represent a minor
portion of the stratigraphic record, results of this study will be applicable to
other sedimentary facies deposited during periods of Earth history characterized
by rapid shoreline migration.
