This award provides funding for US participation in the conference "Hudson River
Undergraduate Mathematics Conference 2018" that will be held on April 7, 2018 at
the Saint Lawrence University in Canton, New York.

The purpose of the conference is to motivate undergraduate students to consider
careers and further study in the field of mathematics. The structure of the
conference is such that students will be able to network with peers and faculty,
as well as to listen to a lecture from an esteemed mathematician, as to the
opportunities and life style afforded mathematical science majors, and to give
students an opportunity to present the results of their research. A strong
effort will be made to invite students who are members of underrepresented
groups, first generation college students, and women. More information will be
made available at:
