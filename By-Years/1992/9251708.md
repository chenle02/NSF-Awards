The main objective of this project is to improve learning, retention and
application of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in physics
at Blinn College. This is being accomplished by using microcomputers, software,
interface measuring modules and video technology to introduce new experiences in
data acquisition and data analysis. This technology will provides immediate
feedback because of the speed, number and variety of the trials that can be
performed by the student, thereby promoting a better attitude for science and
building more confidence in their scientific ability. Support has been used for
the establishment and upgrade of eleven computer workstations. Each workstation
is equipped with laboratory interfaces, software and appropriate sensors and
probes. Support was also obtained for software and videoware which are being
used in demonstrations. This support is revitalizing physics at Blinn College.
