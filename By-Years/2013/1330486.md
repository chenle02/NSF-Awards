The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications
(BMSA) is a primary interface between the research enterprise and federal
agencies that rely on the mathematical sciences. Through studies and workshops,
the Board's 18 pro bono experts help to ensure that the nation's decision making
is based on strong mathematical modeling and analysis and reliable computational
simulations. Recent BMSA reports documented best practices for verification,
validation, and uncertainty quantification of complex simulations; the health of
the mathematical sciences enterprise and steps needed to improve the field's
vitality; and research priorities for improving capabilities for analyzing big
data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current grant will enable the Board to oversee
new studies on (1) analytical tools for the next-generation electric grid and
(2) improvements to the pricing of risk within the National Flood Insurance
Program. It will also support the Board's development of new activities of value
to the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the
Treasury, and National Institutes of Health. The grant will also allow the Board
to help stimulate community action in response to challenges identified in its
2013 report on "The Mathematical Sciences in 2025."
