Mesa State College, a primarily baccalaureate-granting comprehensive liberal
arts college focused on undergraduate education and research, has received a
Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award to purchase a spinning disk confocal
microscopy system that allows enhanced imaging of cells and tissues. Faculty
from the Biology Department at Mesa State College will use the microscope to
investigate a broad range of important topics. Research projects that will be
aided immediately by this equipment include studies into the development of the
vertebrate amnion, cellular signaling mechanisms in social amoebae, the
mechanism of action of rattlesnake toxins and the role of lysyl-oxidase in lung
cancer metastasis. These projects have regional, national and global impacts.
Because all of these projects involve undergraduate researchers, this equipment
will play an important role in training aspiring scientists. The requested
equipment will also strengthen ties with other institutions. In addition to
significantly expanding the research capabilities at Mesa State College, the
microscope will also be integrated into the curriculum, where students will use
it in inquiry-driven experimental exercises and independent research projects.
Results from the research projects will be dessiminated through student and
faculty presentations at regional and national meetings, and through the
publication of peer-reviewed journal articles.
