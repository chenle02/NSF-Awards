J.A. Woollam Co. Inc. will study the feasibility of extending the company's
range of ellipsometric capabilities into the mid-infrared, where there exists a
wealth of new monolayer, surface and interface materials characteristics to be
investigated. New monolayer level surface and interface science in
semiconductor-related materials systems will be studied, with the goal of
transforming present IR ellipsometer technology into a quality product
worldwide.
