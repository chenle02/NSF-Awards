This research program investigates an advanced video compression approach for
applications such as multimedia, video on networks, video conferencing, and
video on demand. It is a novel combination of object-based coding usually used
for very low rates and 3-D subband/wavelet waveform-based coding, usually
reserved for higher rates. In this method, the motion field is first segmented
into objects which make up the image frame, and move at different velocities.
The boundaries of these objects are coded using a type of contour coding which
preserves the shape of the edge. This contour coding is performed as an update
on the object boundaries found for the previous frame. Finally the interior of
these space-time objects is coded using the waveform coding method based on
motion compensated 3-D subband filtering. The overall goal is an efficient
unified set of video compression algorithms scalable from video phone up to
HDTV.
