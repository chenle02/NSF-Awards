This project deals with the synthesis, characterization, rheology, and
processing of thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers (LCP). Thermotropic LCP's
exhibit processing behavior and solid-state properties which make them very
attractive for commercial polymers for high-strength fibers, injection-molded
plastics, and printed circuit boards for the electronics industry. This research
addresses the many structural phenomena of these polymers on a molecular as well
as a macroscopic scale. The study is an interdisciplinary effort involving the
areas of synthesis, characterization, and properties evaluation.
