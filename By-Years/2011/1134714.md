The goal of the research is to determine the causes for more than 400 snow
related roof failures officially reported in 2010-2011 winter in the Northeast
United States such as in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. The failure
data collected by building officials will be analyzed to determine if the
failures are either due to excessive snow loads or due to structural capacity
being less than that envisioned by building code provisions. These key questions
will be answered by analysis of the roof load case histories provided by the
structural engineering officials and community in combination with detailed
weather information on snowfall and wind for selected sites from the Northeast
Regional Climate Center. The research results will provide the basic design
information to engineers and code officials to improve snow load demand
provisions and material resistance standards prescribed in the current
structural design provisions. The project outcomes will lead to determination of
appropriate response needed to ensure better building performance in the future.
The data and analysis results will be made available to the Structural
Engineering Institute of the American Society of Civil Engineers (SEI/ASCE) for
its publication and wider dissemination to the structural engineering community
for follow-up studies. A session on Roof Failures in the Northeast will be
organized for the April 2012 ASCE/SEI Structures Congress. The report and
session will result in practicing structural engineers and building officials
gaining a fundamental understanding of how real buildings respond to real snow
loads to design safer and more economical buildings in the future. The
undergraduate students will be involved in the project to provide unique
experience and insight into the behavior of various roofing systems.
