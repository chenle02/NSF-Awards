Merit, Inc. will serve as the organization responsible for NSFNET. It will
execute the required agreement with NSF/DNCRI and other involved parties, will
manage the financial aspects of NSFNET operation, and will provide the central
management, operation, and policy coordination for NSFNET. In addition, Merit
will acquire the equipment and circuits required to construct the network, will
operate the network, and will coordinate the process so as to meet the NSF
requirements for network engineering, protocols, and standards. Merit will
arrange for policy and planning support for NSF/DNCRI and provide a full set of
NSFNET Information Services. Merit has arranged for major involvement by IBM and
MCI to assist in acquiring the necessary technology and transmission facilities
needed for NSFNET. Merit's role as an integrator of the technology provided by
its two industrial partners in this effort makes possible an extraordinarily
powerful network architecture based on synergy between packet and circuit
switching under the control of sophisticated network management tools.
