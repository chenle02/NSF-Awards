Many human diseases and also many biologically interesting and economically
important traits in higher organisms and farm animals and plants are controlled
by multiple genes. Genetic dissection and mapping of these genes on chromosomes
have always been an important aim of quantitative genetics as it could lead to a
better understanding of the structure of polygenic systems and also to
identification of major chromosome regions for further genetic study, genetic
engineering or selection. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) accurately, a
complete linkage map is necessary and is now made possible with the rapid
advance of recombinant DNA technology. There have been many statistical methods
proposed for mapping QTLs, notably the interval mapping method proposed by
Lander and Botstein, but none of them has taken a full use of complete linkage
map information on mapping QTLs. This project proposes to study an alternative
mapping strategy which combines the interval mapping with an interval test. This
method will be able to test for a QTL on a marker interval independent of the
effects of QTLs at other regions of chromosomes and thus will be asymptotically
unbiased. Also by using a general linear model, the whole map information will
be used simultaneously in making statistical inferences about locations and
effects of QTLs and the efficiency of the test will be increased. This project
also proposes to study a more general polygenic mutation model for the study of
evolution of quantitative traits. With this model the expected genetic variances
within and between finite populations and the response of populations to
selection with reference to molecular evolution will be studied.//
