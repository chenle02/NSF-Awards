This RUI project is aimed at better understanding the composition, dynamics,
and energetics of the upper atmosphere through measurements and analysis of the
extremely faint nighttime airglow emissions. Four wavelengths of light arising
from different upper atmospheric processes are chosen to obtain information from
four different heights in the upper atmosphere. The institution has an eight
channel zenith photometer (for the four wavelengths and background reference),
and an intensified all-sky camera suitable for imaging the airglow in each of
four selected wavelengths. Special emphasis will be given to collaborative
projects in the CEDAR program to give the undergraduate students involved a
realistic research experience and exposure to a broad range of scientists and
scientific activity. In addition, improvement of a local observing site will
make possible regular observational programs by undergraduates.
