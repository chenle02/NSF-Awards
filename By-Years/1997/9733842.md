This research seeks to provide a new framework to support distributed programs
that access large amounts of data stored across millions of servers. The
framework consists of two parts: a set of extensible modules to provide basic
system services plus higher-level policies built on top of these modules to
coordinate distributed data access. This research leverages this framework in
the context of four key subsystems: (1) dynamic data replication to improve
performance, improve reliability, and reduce the need for human management of
storage, (2) extensible and scalable data consistency to coordinate data access
across multiple nodes, (3) scalable location services for mobile objects to
track where objects are stored in the dynamic replication framework, and (4)
market-based distributed resource management to balance large numbers of
applications competing for limited system resources. The impact of this research
will be a better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms required by large-
scale data systems and a set of techniques that will support new classes of
data-intensive applications in this challenging environment. This project also
places a heavy emphasis on modernizing the teaching of operating systems and
distributed systems to give students the skills and experience they need to
understand and build large-scale distributed systems.
