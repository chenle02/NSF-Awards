The Computer Science Department at IIT will select 10 undergraduate students
from the Midwest in the summers of 1990 and 1991 to participate in a summer
research program. A significant percentage of the students will be from under-
represented groups such as minorities and women. Students will work with IIT
faculty in several areas of computer science including artificial intelligence,
parallel programming, software engineering, and database design. The primary
goal of this program is to encourage promising undergraduate students to pursue
graduate studies in science.
