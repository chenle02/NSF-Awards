The plate boundary between the Easter and Juan Fernandez microplates appears to
have the fastest known spreading rate on East Pacific Rise. The lack of
transform faults suggests that a possible threshold spreading rate above which
the classic spreading center/transform fault configuration is not stable. A
proposed GLORIA/hydrosweep survey of this area will determine its present
geometry and its tectonic evolution over the past 4.8 m.y.
