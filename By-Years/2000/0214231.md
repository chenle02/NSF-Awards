The project is exploratory research on microbial diversity of Arctic sediments
at two specific locations in Greenland. The effort will go to the field and work
in the laboratory to

- Investigate molecular diversity of marine sediment prokaryotes. Using total
DNA extracts and 16S rRNA approach the PIs will characterize the Archaea and
Bacteria found in the sediments at the experimental sites. - Examine molecular
diversity of marine sediment Protista. They will characterize the genetic (18S
rRNA and other genes) diversity of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant
microeukaryotes at the experimental sites. - Explore in detail morphological and
genetic diversity of one specific group of marine sediment protists, ciliated
Protozoa. They will be looking for cryptic psychrophilic species that may remain
un- or misudentified because of their morphological similarity to their
relatives from the temperate areas.

This exploratory project will lay the ground for the future large-scale research
on ecology, evolution, genomics, and biotechnological potential of
microorganisms from Arctic sediments.
