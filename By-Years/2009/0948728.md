The textures and phase compositions in volcanic rocks preserve information about
the processes that expel them. The proportions, compositions, and
interrelationships of crystalline phases and glasses potentially reveal pre-
eruptive intensive conditions, the timing of changes therein, and the
devolatilization history coeval with eruptive ascent. These parameters are
recognized as important monitoring tools at active volcanoes, as well as for
interpreting geologic events at pre-historic and remote eruptions. This proposal
presents plans to (1) investigate crystallization kinetics, melt inclusion
entrapment, and isotopic fractionation in hydrous magma of mafic-intermediate
composition using dynamic cooling and decompression experiments, and (2) adapt
an existing professional development program for K-12 science teachers to
provide Hawaii's pre-service and seasoned teachers with skills and training
needed to implement student field trips to sites on Oahu, Hawaii, and Maui
islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate crystallization
kinetics and melt inclusion entrapment in hydrous magma of mafic-intermediate
composition using dynamic cooling and decompression experiments. These
experiments involve a complex but volcanologically plausible sequence of events
for which no prior experimental constraints are available. The study will
redress significant gaps in knowledge of crystallization of natural magmas by
examining crystallization kinetics in volatile-rich basaltic andesite, and the
experimental design will facilitate comparison with theories of nucleation and
phase transformation.
