Tennessee Technology University will initiate a four-week, residential, Young
Scholars project in engineering for 50 students primarily from the southern
Appalachian region of the U.S. entering the 11th and 12th grades. This summer
program will emphasize working in design teams to develop an engineering design
of a device or a system by using the university's Sun SPARCstation 1
workstations. The program will consist of lectures in an Introduction to
Engineering series, Introduction to Engineering Design, and Energy Utilization,
as well as individual research projects. Field trips will be taken to various
sites of engineering significance such as the Arnold Engineering Development
Center (US Air Force), a TVA Power Plant, and the NISSAN Motor Manufacturing
Corporation USA.
