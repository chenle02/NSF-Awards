This Small Grant and Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal supports the research
to assess the feasibility of isolating a specific enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase and oxygenase complex, from primitive microorganisms, which live
within sandstone in the Ross Desert region of Antarctica. These primitive
microbes include primary producers (lichens, green algae and blue-green algae)
and primary consumers (bacteria, yeasts, and fungi) and occasionally metabolize
under extreme environmental conditions of temperatures, light, moisture and
inorganic nutrients. The carboxylase-oxygenase system will be studied to
determine whether it has unique sequences in its amino acids which may
contribute to its ability to function under extreme environmental stress. If
unique amino acid sequences are found, nucleotide sequences in the gene that
codes for this enzyme complex will be examined. This information should provide
some understanding as to the evolutionary relatedness of this enzyme compared to
temperate species.
