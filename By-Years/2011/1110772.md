The existence of social monogamy (when a male and a female live together) has
long puzzled researchers since both sexes usually gain more reproductive success
by mating with multiple partners. This raises the question: under what
conditions will monogamy provide reproductive advantages? The proposed research
seeks to test three hypotheses that may explain the evolution of social monogamy
in the mantis shrimp Pullosquilla litoralis: even spatial distribution of
females, equal sex ratio between males and females, and the need for biparental
care. It also tests the effects of even female spatial distribution and sex
ratio on genetic monogamy (how many males sire each egg clutch) of P. litoralis
to discover, how social mating systems and genetic mating systems interact to
shape reproductive behaviors?. P. litoralis is a mantis shrimp that lives in
pairs in burrows in sandy marine substrates where both males and females care
for eggs by aerating them and removing fouled eggs. The proposed research will
be conducted through field studies and experiments at Lizard Island Research
Station, Australia. Field studies and experimentation in the marine lab will
examine the effects of female spatial distribution and sex ratio on social
monogamy in P. litoralis. Paternity testing will elucidate the effects of these
factors on genetic monogamy. Laboratory experiments will also examine the
effects of biparental care on the reproductive success of male and female P.
litoralis. Finally, this research will contribute to management strategies for
the conservation of marine crustaceans As charismatic invertebrates, mantis
shrimps are excellent ambassadors for the conservation of coral reefs. Co-PI
Wright will share her research with the public through K-12 classroom visits, a
field blog that will be hosted by the UC Museum of Paleontology in coordination
with the Understanding Science initiative, and undergraduate mentorship.
