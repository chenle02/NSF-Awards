The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project will be to address an
unmet need to identify and alarm for all seizure types. More than 60 million
people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic
condition. To reduce the risk of injury or death, neurologists frequently
recommend caregivers constantly monitor patients, resulting in co-sleeping,
significant changes in work and family schedules, and a substantial loss of
independence. However, even under monitored conditions, caregivers fail to
recognize more than 50% of seizures, resulting in sub-optimal treatment.
Although technology is available to detect seizures in clinical settings, the
necessary equipment is not currently suitable for continuous use in daily
living. The development and validation of technology to detect and alert
patients and caregivers to all types of seizures in a non-clinical setting would
have substantial benefits for timely treatment, improve patient outcomes, and
improve patient and caregiver quality of life.

This I-Corps project further develops a core technology that uses analysis of
eye movements to provide a reliable, reproducible means of identifying seizure
activity. The team is developing wearable eye-tracking technology and software
suitable for identifying all seizure types during wakefulness and sleep. This
work will significantly advance understanding of seizures through rigorous
mathematical analysis of eye movements which previously has been only
qualitatively described. The core technology analyzes eye movements, known as
oculometrics, to detect seizures. The goal is to transform how at-risk
individuals and caregivers identify and respond to seizures, potentially
reducing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and improving quality of life.
