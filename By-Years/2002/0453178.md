This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) site at Columbia University for the summers of 2005-2007. The program
director is Leonard Fine. Ten students, recruited from other institutions, will
participate in a ten-week program. The interests and experience of the student
are matched with the research groups in the department. Before the first day,
there are exchanges of information and literature. The selected undergraduates
fully participate in the research process in the laboratory, at group meetings
and in discussion groups, in seminars and at colloquia; they give oral
presentations, produce progress reports and contribute to the writing of papers;
and they interact on a regular basis with fellow students in other research
groups. In addition, there is a field trip to a comprehensive industrial
research laboratory and a joint colloquium with scientists from a National
Laboratory. There are career development discussions to assist in the graduate
school selection and application processes, and a workshop on professional
resume writing. Workshops on women in science and the ethical conduct of
research introduce these important professional issues. A professionally
developed evaluation and assessment plan will aid in determining the value of
the program, how well it is meeting its objectives, and the institutional and
individual impacts. The solicitation plan focuses on maximizing appeal and
access to women, historically under-represented minorities, and undergraduates
from four-year colleges seeking the research university experience. Publication
and presentation of results are encouraged.
