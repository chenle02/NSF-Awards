This project will develop and field-validate analytically tractable methods for
statistically representing large buildings, enabling more rigorous assessments
of their spatially distributed performance attributes. Measurements for each of
four single performance attributes will be made at selected points within the
building to generate a time series of attribute performance at a sample point.
Aggregating the sample point values into an estimated distribution over the
entire building is the principal objective, achieved through theoretical
research needed to develop a "Multi-characteristic Spatially Distributed
Sampling Method" (MSDSM), and through data from several large buildings and the
integration of the traditional single characteristic methods into the multi-
characteristic sampling procedures. Data gathering and management in the first
half will focus on a precise definition of the kind and quality of data needed
to initially calibrate the statistical models under development.
