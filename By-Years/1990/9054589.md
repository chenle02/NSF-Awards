Simmons College is being supported in a project to improve elementary school
science education through the collaborative efforts of teachers, administrators
and representatives from local industry. In a series of summer residential
workshops and academic year follow-up activities, they propose to assist 120
teachers, science coordinators, and principals to expand their own and their
students' understanding and appreciation of science. Among the activities
planned are: (a) a series of one- day, in-service workshops for science
coordinators, participant teachers, and participant principals, (b) 10-12 day
in-residence intensive seminars for science teachers which will include field
trips and tours of local industry, seminars, and work in the Simmons College
computing and laboratory facilities, (c) brief preparatory and follow-up
seminars with participants to assess the outcomes of the workshops, including
the effectiveness of the instructional modules generated.
