John Straub of Boston University is supported by an award from the Chemical
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to
develop algorithms for the simulation of molecular systems undergoing strong
phase transitions, including the characterization of metastable and unstable
states. Straub and coworkers have developed generalized simulated tempering and
replica exchange algorithms which exhibit superior scaling and sampling
efficiency for a series of benchmark systems. They are extending and
generalizing these algorithms for the simulation of a variety of outstanding
problems, including vapor-liquid phase change in simple fluids, freezing of
nano-confined water, and the aggregation and assembly of peptides into
functional channels.

Phase changes, such as the melting of ice or evaporation of water, are
ubiquitous in nature but are very difficult to simulate on a computer. This
research enables scientists and engineers to model nature more realistically.
The PI and his research group are also involved in extensive outreach to grade
school, middle schools and high school students through collaboration with the
Pinhead Institute, including visits by scientists to the schools and summer
internship programs for high schools students.
