ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;What is the ``typical" traffic of a link? What constitutes
``abnormal" traffic, and therefore warrants an alert for suspicious behavior
(intrusion)?&lt;br/&gt;How will the Internet look like next year? These are the
questions that the project focuses on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has two major
thrusts:&lt;br/&gt;The first is to find patterns in the network traffic, and the
second is to find trends in the Internet evolution. The technical merit is in
the synergy of the networking and data mining fields, pushing the envelope in
both:&lt;br/&gt;The networking field will enjoy novel insights and fast tools to
predict the network performance. The data mining field will benefit from new
problems&lt;br/&gt;and new tools (using fractals, power laws, large-graph
algorithms), that will be stress-tested on multiple Gigabytes of real, network
data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work will be a novel
insight of the network behavior at the micro and macro level. In addition, the
work will explore our ability to predict the network behavior and its evolution.
As a result, the work will provide new tools to identify abnormal behavior, that
could be due to a security breach like a DDoS attack.
