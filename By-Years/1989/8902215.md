The general aim of this research is to improve our understanding of concurrent
systems and of the mathematical techniques that are useful for reasoning about
them. In this specific project, interest is networks of concurrently executing,
communicating processes, and especially in "dataflow-like" networks, in which
processes communicate by transmitting "data values" over "channels." They are
modeled using concurrent transition systems, a generalization of ordinary
nondeterministic transition systems into which concurrency information has been
incorporated in a convenient fashion. The goal is to classify such networks by
relating their "transition structure" to their input/output behavior. This
entails search for classes of networks, defined by axioms imposed on their
structure as transition systems, for which one can obtain simple
characterizations of the corresponding classes of input/output relations.
