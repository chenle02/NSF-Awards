Dana Nance will continue his studies of calibrations and their impact on area
minimization. This research is also strongly related to the investigation of
faces of the Grassmannian. Calibrations have been studied from two related
points of view. First because they afford a quick method of showing that a
certain surface is area minimizing. The second is related to the first and
involves faces of the Grassmannian, these contain the tangent planes to the area
minimizing surface. Nances's recent work on the angle conjecture involved his
introduction of quaternionic forms which are an extension of the special
Lagrangian forms. Following this success he will study their further properties
and extensions.
