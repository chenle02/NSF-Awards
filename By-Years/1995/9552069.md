In reply to student requests and in recognition of the rapid advancement of the
neurosciences over the past decade, the Psychology Department has set a goal to
establish a neurosciences curriculum. This series of lecture and laboratory
courses provides a structured approach for studying brain and behavior
interaction. The equipment requested through this grant significantly enhances
the science education of lower- and upper- division students through
demonstration and active participation. However, the greatest impact is being
achieved through the creation of a Neurosciences Laboratory facility. This
Laboratory supports three new courses and four new laboratory classes in which
psychology students first learn, and then empirically validate, scientific
concepts and theories. Included in the new curriculum are laboratory sections
for existing basic courses in physiological psychology and learning, as well as
completely new courses with Laboratories in Experimental Neuroanatomy,
Electrophysiology and Behavior, and Neuroimaging in Neuroscience. With over 550
undergraduate majors in psychology, the cost effectiveness and educational
impact of this new science program can be significant.
