This is a request to provide partial support for a Symposium on Biomedical
Engineering and Opportunities in Eastern Europe, to be held in conjunction with
the 12th Annual International Conference of the IEEE/EMBS. The Conference will
take place in Philadelphia, PA, on Nov 1- 4, 1990. The funds will be used to
invite four prominent engineers/scientists from Eastern Europe who otherwise
would not be able to attend. The participation of these individuals would
greatly enhance the success of the symposium, and is likely to lead to increased
international collaboration between the US and Eastern Europe.
