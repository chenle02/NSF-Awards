9502636 Stankovic This research project will explore the dynamics of power
systems and electric drives in the context of dissipative dynamical systems.
Interesting connections between this class of systems and the theory of
nonlinear electrical circuits have been established in the past while links to
robust control design are of a very recent origin. Many control questions of
interest for power systems and electric drives can be addressed in this
framework, and it is felt that extensions (e.g. for the class of nonlinear
periodic systems) are also feasible. One distinctive feature of the intended
approach is that it is deeply rooted in the physical processes underlying
electromechanical energy conversion. This can be contrasted with the approach
that starts from a chosen theoretical framework, and then looks for an
application area in which the framework could prove successful. Design tools
resulting from this second approach are often conservative, and decoupled from
the designer's engineering intuition. ***
