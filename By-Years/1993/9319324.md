9319324 Wysession This research will study the upper mantle, including
subducting slabs, and the core-mantle boundary by means of a dense linear array
of 20 broad-band PASSCAL seismometers installed from Missouri to Massachusetts,
a distance of 1736 km. Data from earthquakes recorded by the array will
substantially increase resolution of structures such as the core-mantle boundary
under the Pacific, slab penetration depths in the Aleutians, Kuril-Kamchatka,
Peru-Chile, and Central America, and the details of the upper mantle under North
America and the Caribbean. This work should shed significant new insight into
details of the earth's convection engine and resultant driving forces of plates
and earthquakes. ***
