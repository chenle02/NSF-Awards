Biology has become an information science, fueled by high throughput genomic
sequencing and functional genomics analyses. However, although many biological
data resources are available, there is little ability to interoperate and
existing software and tools are reinvented. A set of data models and supporting
software libraries will be developed that support database interoperation. This
effort will occur in collaboration with other systems in development. Resources
developed under the NSF Plan Genome Research Program will be the resource
targets. The approach is to define XML-based descriptions for types of object
that are likely targets for inter-database queries. The effort will be in the
context of a series of workshop that will enable the community to identify the
target data objects and to cooperate in the implementation of software. The
project will provide electronic resources for a wide variety of data that will
enhance both research and education and training.
