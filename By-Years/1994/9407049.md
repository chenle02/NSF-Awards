9407049 Blackstone Much of the theory and data of modern evolutionary biology
converges on two related subjects: the evolution of development and the
evolution of life history. Curiously, these subjects have remained conceptually
and operationally distinct-studies of the former focus on evolutionary changes
in the timing of organismal development and on the morphological manifestations
of this process (e.g., size, presence of juvenilized, adult or derived
features), while studies of the later focus on the organism's allocation of
energy into various life history traits (e.g., size, timing of reproduction,
number of offspring). To unite studies of life history and the evolution of
development conceptually, it is necessary to elucidate a mechanistic link
between energy allocation and the timing of development. In particular, efforts
must be made to identify an appropriate organismal system which can illuminate
the withinorganism mechanisms mediating the connection between energy allocation
and the timing of developmental and life history traits. This system must show
correlations (1) in natural populations between variation of the putative
mechanism and the observed variation of life history and development, and (2) in
laboratory populations between experimental perturbation of the putative
mechanism and variation which mimics the naturally occurring variation. Recent
studies of colonial marine hydroids suggest that within-colony circulation
serves as a mechanism by which energy allocation mediates the timing of
morphological and life history traits. The PI proposes to initiate a research
program which will establish, for the first time, how ecological variation in
life histories is linked to evolutionary changes in the timing of development.
