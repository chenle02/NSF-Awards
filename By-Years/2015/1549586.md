The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology
Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable rapid blood clotting in order to
treat bleeding after a traumatic injury The majority of deaths that occur within
the first 24 hours following a traumatic injury are the result of hemorrhage.
The scientific merits of the project stem from the biochemical advantages of
using the physiological initiator protein of coagulation, tissue factor,
impregnated in the dressing, rather than a foreign substance such as those used
in current dressings. These foreign substances have no "off" switch, and can
cause downstream blood clots. Tissue factor, in contrast, has natural regulatory
proteins that limits its ability cause downstream clots. Tissue factor is also
the fastest known initiator of blood coagulation, and can cause complete blood
clotting in 12-14 seconds. This dressing has the very real potential to prevent
deaths from hemorrhage, and the outcomes from this project will literally save
lives. The results from this project will also provide compelling pre-clinical
data to demonstrate feasibility of the product, which will be attractive to
strategic partners and/or private investors for further commercial development
of the hemostatic dressing.

The proposed project relies on a new intellectual paradigm to initiate
coagulation with a hemostatic dressing. Trauma is the leading cause of death for
all persons between the ages of 1 and 44 years. The majority of deaths that
occur during the first 24 hours following a traumatic event are the result of
hemorrhage. The intellectual merits of this project stem from the biochemical
advantages of using the physiological initiator of coagulation, tissue factor,
rather than a xenobiotic initiator such as those used in current commercial
hemostatic dressings. Tissue factor has natural regulatory proteins,
particularly tissue factor pathway inhibitor, that prevents downstream blood
clot formation. The technical hurdles addressed by the proposed R&D plan include
the optimization of the amount of tissue factor on the dressing that is required
for rapid blood coagulation. In addition, the optimized dressings will be
compared to the current military standard dressing in a pre-clinical hemorrhage
control study in swine. The development of a tissue factor-impregnated dressing
that is significantly more effective than the current military standard dressing
in this swine model will be a major theoretical breakthrough.
