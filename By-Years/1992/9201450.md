CONCUR '92 represents the first conference on concurrency theory to take place
in the US since 1984 (an NSF-sponsored workshop at CMU). At this time, there are
major research groups in the field at MIT, Stanford, CMU, NC State, Stony Brook,
Bell Labs, Boulder, and a number of other places in the US. CONCUR represents
real opportunity since '84 for these researchers to interact with each other, as
well as their European Community counterparts, in a conference-like setting.
