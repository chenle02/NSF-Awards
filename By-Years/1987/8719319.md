Among the central problems in studies of the sense of smell is to discover the
ways in which electrical activity in neurons in receptor cells is processed into
a form in which odors can be identified and their intensity recognized. The
investigator has developed a system in which olfactory neurons from mice can be
grown in culture along with olfactory bulbs (the part of the brain with which
they connect) on plates from which it is possible to record from as many as 64
cells simultaneously. His preliminary work shows that the receptor neurons
spontaneously generate action potentials in such cultures. In this project he
will use odorants to stimulate the receptor cells while recording from those
cells and cells of the bulb, to learn more of the nature of the transmittal of
information at this level. He will attempt to determine the neurotransmitters
involved by using pharmacological agents, and will use electrical as well as
chemical stimulation of the receptor cells in order to sort out effects the
chemicals might have on cells of the olfactory bulb. In addition, he will
supplement the functional studies with anatomical studies at the levels of light
and electron microscopy, thus permitting structural connections to be correlated
with functional behavior. In addition to possibly adding a powerful new tool to
those available for learning how the sense of smell works, this project is
expected to provide further data on how nerve networks receive and process
information, potentially contributing to the development of better man-made
systems for processing information.
