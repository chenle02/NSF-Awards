This project's aim is to establish an undergraduate instrumentation laboratory
utilizing process control systems specifically designed for educational use.
Such systems provide the student with realistic situations likely to be
encountered in industry, permit the student to become familiar with a variety of
industrial sensors, and enable the evaluation of data for accuracy and control
of industrial processes. The equipment obtained under this grant is a proven,
integrated laboratory set-up including sensors for parameters most commonly
measured in industry and a controller for a variety of experiments. It provides
the laboratory experience necessary for the understanding of process control by
computer. This knowledge is useful in the many industries such as chemical
plants, refineries, power plants, food technology and pharmaceuticals where
graduates frequently function as technical and supervisory personnel. An
accompanying textbook is available. The award is being matched by an equal
amount from the principal investigator's institution.
