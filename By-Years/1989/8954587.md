This two-year project will adapt the model developed under a current award and
disseminate it to three additional elementary schools in Orange County,
California. Focused on a district with a predominantly Hispanic population, the
project will support minority students who exhibit potential in mathematics,
help parents to encourage their children in mathematics, and improve the
mathematical knowledge and instructional strategies of teachers in grades K
through 6. Thirty-three teachers in each of three elementary schools will
participate in the project, which includes instruction in mathematics content
and methodology and emphasizes the use of calculators. In order to accommodate
the region's year-round schools, this instruction will take place on fifteen
weekends throughout the year. It will be carried out by three teams of three
teachers each (two elementary teachers who participated in the previous project
and one high school teacher). Other project activities include a bimonthly
newsletter and visits by project staff to participants' classrooms. Evaluation
will include assessing the project's effects on teachers, students, and parents.
The university and the school district are contributing as cost-sharing an
amount equal to 159% of the NSF award.
