9321485 Brandon Dr. Brandon is examining the nature of experimentation in
population biology (ecology and evolution), and the relation between theory and
experiment in this field. After years of neglect, philosophers (as well as
historians and sociologists) of science are beginning to take experimentation
seriously. Much of this attention focuses on physics and assumes that experiment
is subservient to theory. Biology, rather than physics, is the focus of this
project, which also questions the assumption that theory generally dominates
experimentation. Dr. Brandon's preliminary work has already shown that
population biology is importantly distinct from physics with respect to
experimentation (biologists are much more concerned with what might be called
the "realism" of their experimental conditions). In this study, he hopes to
show, by means of case studies, that there are various reasons why theory and
experiment fail to make contact and explore the ramifications of this. Dr.
Brandon brings his skills in philosophical analysis (e.g. in answering the
question of what an experiment is and how experiments contribute to scientific
knowledge) and an intimate acquaintance with largely contemporary experimental
practice in population biology. ***
