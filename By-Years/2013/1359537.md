This award will support scientists to participate in a symposium at the 2014
meeting of the&lt;br/&gt;Society of Comparative and Integrative Biology in
Austin, Texas focused on unifying cellular and biochemical mechanisms with
studies of mate choice and social interactions within the broader investigation
of ornamental traits. It will bring together experts on the mechanisms that link
condition, stress, and ornaments (and armaments). Over the past two decades, the
hypothesis that ornamental traits signal the condition of animals has become a
prominent paradigm in behavioral and evolutionary biology. This symposium wil
integrate insights from physiological studies of stress response, particularly
related to endocrine control, immune systems, and oxidative state, with
evolutionary investigations of animal ornamentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By
convening a symposium on a central topic in evolutionary and physiological
ecology, information will be made available to the numerous graduate students,
undergrads, postdocs, and faculty who attend SICB meetings. By filling half of
the presentation slots with early career scientists including a majority of
slots filled by women, the symposium will promote the development of a talented
group of U.S. scientists. Through social events, students will have a chance to
interact with prominent researchers.
