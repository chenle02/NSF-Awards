Gardner Controlled environmental growth chambers are key to many of the research
projects on the campus of the University of Minnesota that study plants, algae
and fungi. This award supports the modernization of these growth chambers so
that research in plant biology, and horticulture science can be pursued in up-
to-date facilities. These renovated facilities will allow this university to
continue the high level of research on genetically engineered organisms and
remain competitive and compliant in the biotechnology arena. This award will
replace 54 growth chambers used by faculty and students in five departments.
Seventeen postdocs, 35 graduate students and 10 undergraduate students will be
impacted because of the newly planned facilities. This project will increase the
capabilities in biotechnology research at the University of Minnesota.
