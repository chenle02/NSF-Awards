1126763&lt;br/&gt;Caruntu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed instrumentation will
support projects (7 faculty from 5 departments) to advance understanding and
knowledge in biomechanics of human joints (modeling), human gait and motor
control, and research-based instruction in biomechanics. 1) The original
biomechanics models to be developed will contribute to new concepts of joint
replacement design, implant design, joint stability, and new rehabilitation
exercises that will benefit post-surgery patients. This research will
investigate muscle level of activation, and contact and ligament forces in
normal and deficient knees during various exercises. 2) The research on movement
disturbances in autism spectrum disorders will provide potentially
transformative concepts on musculoskeletal biomechanics and sensorimotor control
interactions of lower limb (coordination of balance and locomotion). 3)
Challenge-based instruction in biomechanics will address, in a creative
and&lt;br/&gt;transformative way, the integration of research and education. The
requested instrumentation will equip a Biomechanics Laboratory and will broaden
the research scope for all participants, allowing for new scientific problems in
novel and fresh directions.
