Cole, Blaine IBN-9507470 Abstract A critical assumption of empirical and
theoretical studies of reproductive allocation in social insects is that size
variation does not affect reproductive success. However, if males vary in their
probability of mating or if females vary in their probability of founding a
colony as a function of body size, then the optimal investment cannot be
predicted without knowledge of how size affects reproductive success. The
objective of the proposed research is to test the above stated assumption by
determining the relationship between the size of an individual and its
reproductive success. In addition, the variation in the size and number of males
and females within and among colonies will be quantified to evaluate whether
colonies have maximized their reproductive success. Finally, the relationship
between the availability of food and the pattern of investment will be examined
in order to assess the degree of lability among colonies. This project should
help to fill a gap in our knowledge concerning patterns of reproductive
investment in social insects.
