This project will study the deep interior structure of the earth by fundamental
and overtone modes, including body waves. They plan to perform three aspects of
mantle structure study using digital data such as IDA (International Deployment
of Accelerometers) and GDSN (Global Digital Seismograph Network). First they
plan to invert overtone waveform data, which often appear on radial component
seismograms. Preliminary study suggests that the mantle structure down to about
900 km can be resolved. But it also suggested that weighting of each datum is
important to uniformly fit all seismograms, since the data consists of various
size of earthquakes and various kinds of instruments. Unless weighting is done,
the results of seismic velocity patterns seem to be dominated by large
earthquake data. Careful analysis of inversion procedure is required in order to
understand what are robust features in the solution. Secondly, they will attempt
to retrieve attenuation structure from the same data set by inverting waveforms
of fundamental and overtone modes in the time domain. They will use odd and even
number pairs of fundamental and overtone data such as R1 and R3, G2 and G4 and
X1 and X3, in order to avoid the problem of amplitude asymmetry and direct
trade-off between estimated earthquake moment and attenuation measurement.
Thirdly, they plan to extend the frequency range of waveform inversion to 50
mHz(20 seconds). Extending the frequency is required to obtain structure below
about 1000 km, because most of the overtone data, other than the X phases used
in the above study, are from minor arc body waves.
