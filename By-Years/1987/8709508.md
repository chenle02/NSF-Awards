This is a proposal from several investigators of diverse interests to obtain
funds to purchase a liquid scintillation counter. The instrument will be used to
support five main projects. First, neuroendocrine factors that stimulate the
activity of crustacean ovarian tissue will be isolated and purified in studies
of the regulation of crustacean reproduction. Second, the interaction of several
lymphoma cell lines with fibronectin will be studied as a model to help explain
aspects of the immune response. Third, the gene for arginine kinase will be
studied as a model of regulated gene expression in a eukaryote (Drosophila).
Fourth, the significance of the recent discovery of substantial amounts of
D-amino acids (as opposed to the usually occurring L-amino acids) in marine
invertebrate tissues will be investigated from the stand points of function and
metabolism. Finally, antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus will be
investigated to determine if the resistance is related to a recently discovered
penicillin-binding protein.
