This research focuses on the adoption of new process technologies by firms. In
particular, it looks at how the consequences of technology adoption are related
to firms' organizational structures and the stages of the industry lifecycles.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Existing evidence on industry evolution shows that
industries go through one or more major episodes of restructuring during their
lifecycles. The evidence suggests that changes in the number of firms in an
industry often occur at times when new technologies are introduced that change
the competitive advantage among firms. We will identify how the firm's
organizational structure affects its ability to exploit industry transitions by
successfully adopting new technologies and acquiring capacity through mergers
and acquisitions in the restructuring of industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will help understand how new technologies diffuse through the population
of firms, and how this diffusion affects the size and organization of firms and
their incentives to merge or acquire other firms. Understanding how the process
of diffusion occurs will help statisticians project future productivity
increases and help in the evaluation of government policies to monitor increases
in productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
