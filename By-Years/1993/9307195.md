9307195 Coleman Professor Coleman will continue his work on rigid analysis in
particular to applying these techniques to modular curves. He hopes to obtain
information about he local behavior at a prime p of the representations attached
to a modular form. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks. ***
