The overarching goal of this project is to create a sustainable effort,
inclusive of curriculum components, international research partnerships,
research abroad experiences for undergraduates, and scholarly inquiries, that
will enhance the preparedness of undergraduate engineering and science students
at Howard University to be globally engaged leaders upon graduation.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has the objectives to develop a systematic
approach to preparing engineering and science students for global leadership
through curricular and course reform; to establish sustainable research
partnerships between Howard University engineering and science faculty and
engineering and science faculty at international institutions that will allow
for student participation on research projects abroad both virtually and in
person; to conduct scholarly examinations of the project?s educational
approaches to enhancing the cultural and global awareness of engineering and
science students; and to serve as a model program for other institutions seeking
to prepare globally engaged engineering and science students by widespread
dissemination of the program?s research findings and implementation
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a cross-sectional research
study takes a mixed-method approach to better understand the experiences and
perspectives of African-American undergraduate students who participate in an
international research experience. The study will identify the characteristics
of various international research sites, identify factors that help students
successfully navigate their international research experience, identify the
broader impacts of the international research experience on students, and
contribute to the scholarly literature on global engagement and culture.
