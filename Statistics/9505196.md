Title: Model Selection for Mixtures Abstract This research is concerned with the
problem of selecting a suitable model when the competing models involve mixtures
of distributions. Criteria for model selection among mixtures and convolutions
of exponential distributions are proposed and shown to be asymptotically close
to Bayes procedures. The performance of the criteria are compared to that of
complexity based model selection criteria. The methodology is then applied to
data from ethological science. The case of mixtures of multiple regression
models and logistic regression models is also considered and applied to the
problem of testing for son preference in Vietnam, using data from the Vietnam
Living Standard Survey. In many modeling situations, a single model is not
suitable for all the data. For example, when investigating whether there is
significant statistical evidence of son preference (preference for boys over
girls) in countries such as Vietnam, the problem is complicated by the fact that
some families display son preference and some do not. In ethological science, an
area of behavioral science concerned with detailed observation and recording of
the behavior of one or more individuals, interesting questions arise as to
whether a behavior can be split into consecutive activities or is a mixture of
several activities. These problems can be addressed by modeling with statistical
mixtures.
