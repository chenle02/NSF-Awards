This workshop/conference focuses on the development of alternative animal models
for research in vertebrate endocrinology. The topic is timely and important
because of current general concerns for animals used in scientific research. The
workshop will assess the current status of research efforts in this area and
evaluate suggestions/plans for alternative courses of action.
