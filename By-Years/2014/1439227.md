This is a project to review and synthesize the research literature on Computer
Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) conducted between 2005 and 2012. The
project team will identify major themes in the research results; analyze effects
on learning outcomes in CSCL research; identify moderating factors and trends;
synthesize major lessons learned; and identify important gaps that still exist
in our knowledge. Automated data mining and text analysis will be used to
validate results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project should result in a framework
for studying CSCL as well as an empirically-grounded set of design principles
for how CSCL should be used in different educational settings, whether in or out
of the classroom. Given the fast pace of development in the use of technology to
support STEM learning, this synthesis should help give a broader historical
context in which to understand them as well as encourage more directed and
targeted research and development in the future.
