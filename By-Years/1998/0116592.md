This project is about international collaboration between U.S. and Mexico. The
work focuses on development of mobile robotic systems capable of performing
sophisticated visibility-based tasks with minimal sensing requirements. The goal
is to construct algorithms and control laws that use information directly from
the robot sensors, such that the task at hand would be carried out without the
need for elaborate measurements that are usually
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
