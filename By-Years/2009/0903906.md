This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the
NSF/DoE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation
NSF 08-589. The award provides funds to support student travel to conferences
and undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being
funded separately by the DoE under contract to MIT (Grant DE-FG02-06ER54891)

This research supports deployment and development of SCEPTIC and related codes
to address fundamental plasma problems. The SCEPTIC code, a particle-in-cell
code, three-dimensional in ion-velocity distribution and space, was designed to
compute solutions to one of the most fundamental problems in plasma physics: the
interaction of a flowing plasma with an absorbing object. Specifically, (1)
further exploration of the effects of flow in 3-D plasmas of arbitrary degree of
magnetization, which promises to offer a first-principles understanding of
probes and dust interaction in typical plasmas where turbulence dominates cross-
field transport; (2) inclusion of additional particle species, such as refluxing
neutrals; (3) calculations of interactions with cylindrical objects, since
cylindrical geometry is widely used for probes; (4) comparison of the
specialized coordinate code results with more general coordinate codes to
establish the level of accuracy of the latter and to explore problems that they
are well suited to, such as the vexed question of the plasma wake, and the
problems of multiple dust-grain interactions.

The research activity will include the education of a graduate student, the
distribution of the improved SCEPTIC code for free use by other researchers, and
for educational purposes, and the publication of important fundamental results
from it. Note that dusty plasma research is frequently undertaken in
institutions that have only modest financial resources, including many
developing countries, and this work will help connect those institutions and
researchers to the wider plasma field.

The NSF support of undergraduate participation adds a broader educational impact
through the early-year training of students by introducing them to scientific
research as a possible career path.
