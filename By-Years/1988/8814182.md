This project will support the Conference on Nonlinear Phenomena in Fluid
Mechanics to be held April 13-15, 1989 at Pennsylvania State University. The
conference will be under the direction of Professor Jerry Bona of Penn State. It
will focus on modern developments in the field of fluid mechanics with the goal
of presenting a balanced view of current mathematical, theoretical, and
experimental trends in this subject. Lectures will be presented by A. Acrivos,
D. Benney, J. Hammack, J.-L. Lions, M. Longuet-Higgins, J.B. McLeod, J.W. Miles,
T. Mullin, P. Saffman, J.T. Stuart, R. Temam, and J.F. Toland. The proceedings
of this conference will be published and support for participants will be
available.
