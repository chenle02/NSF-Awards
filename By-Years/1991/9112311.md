The main objectives of the proposed Symposium/Workshop are: 1) to stress the
current state of knowledge and practice in computational mechanics in structural
engineering and to identify the frontal joint research opportunities necessary
to advance the current state of knowledge; 2) to stimulate future cooperative
research and development in the areas of common needs and greatest importance;
3) to evaluate the results of chinese research programs on computational
structural mechanics and their practical applications in the U.S.; and 4) to
continue to build the existing long-term bilateral scientific relationship
between academic and practicing communities.
