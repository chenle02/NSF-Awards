This applicant will study black-white differences in adolescent drug use.
Specifically, the work aims to clarify the sources of race differences in drug
use and to improve understanding of the correlates, causes and long-term
consequences of drug use among black youth. The work is planned to take place
with Dr. Jerald Bachman in the Institute of Social Research at the University of
Michigan.
