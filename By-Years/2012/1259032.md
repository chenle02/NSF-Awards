This project awards scholarships up to $6,000 per year to 34 students over a two
and one-half year period to pursue the following STEM degree programs at
Owensboro Community and Technical College (OCTC): Science, Biotechnology,
Mechatronics, Machine Tool Technology, Computer Aided Drafting, Industrial
Maintenance, Welding, Engineering Technology, and Information Technology. The
project provides support services that promote the success and retention of
participating scholars to complete an associate degree and/or transfer to a
four-year institution to continue pursuit of a baccalaureate degree in a STEM
area. Scholars are also provide with industry experiences through targeted
strategies with assistance from established partnerships that support the
successful transition of participating scholars to employment in STEM technical
areas upon successful postsecondary completion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
recruitment plan is to be implemented to target potential scholars, particularly
underrepresented groups, with awardees selected by a committee, comprised of
grant PI and co-PIs, relevant OCTC personnel, and industry partners. The project
increases participation of academically-talented, financially-disadvantaged
students in postsecondary opportunities in STEM areas of demand in Kentucky and
the nation. Data collected through project evaluation has the potential to be of
interest to the greater academic community by providing additional insight on
the effectiveness of high impact practices on the experiences of underserved
students in differing STEM areas.
