This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of
2021 (Public Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first few years of a child's
life are spent creating order out of the chaos of her native language, a highly
complex signal comprised of a finite number of sounds arranged into an enormous
number of words in an infinite number of configurations. This dissertation
research seeks to determine how children tease apart the interactions among
sound, grammar, and culture to master the intricacies of verbal morphology in a
highly concatenative language with productive stem alternation and hierarchical
alignment. It is the first holistic description of the acquisition of any
language belonging to its family. This analysis will yield unique insight into
how children internalize, shape, and reproduce linguistic knowledge, which has
significant implications for the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and
developmental psychology, as well as for our broader understanding of the human
language faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a combined longitudinal and cross-
sectional approach, this study will investigate the naturalistic speech of three
children between 2;0 and 4;0 over the course of 12 months to describe their
morphological development. In close collaboration with a native speaker, the
recordings made will be transcribed, translated, and coded for the structural
characteristics of child and adult speech to facilitate the comparison of child
productions, child-directed speech, and adult-adult discourse overheard by the
child. Qualitative analyses will include which morphemes occur with which verb
stems, as well as morpheme productivity. Quantitative analyses will include Mean
Length of Utterance, total number of utterances per hour, and frequencies of
each verb stem and affix.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
