AST-0116529&lt;br/&gt;Butler, Paul&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A planet-hunting
instrument (spectrometer) for the new Southern Hemisphere telescope: Magellan
will be built. A high-resolution echelle spectrograph for the southern
hemisphere-located Magellan Telescope will be designed, specified, fabricated,
assembled and tested. Precision radial velocities will be measured to look for
the characteristic signature that indicates small dark bodies (planets) in orbit
about a star. This special purpose spectrograph will be able to Doppler velocity
changes, at the level of 2 to 4 m/sec. This spectrograph-telescope combination
will enable over 1,000. new candidate stars to be examined for orbiting planets
and represents the astronomy community's first in-depth survey of those Southern
Hemisphere stars not available from Northern Hemisphere telescopes. The
telescope/spectrograph system will be available to members of the Magellan
community: Harvard, MIT, Michigan, Arizona and Carnegie Observatories.
