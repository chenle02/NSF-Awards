9503247 Buss Buss will investigate axiomatics and conditional separations of
bounded arithmetic theories; relative proof complexity of propositional proof
systems including Frege, extended Frege, constant-depth Frege, Hilbert
Nullstellensatz and cutting plane proof systems; problems in designing
computerized theorem provers based on extensions of the sequent calculus; and
various problems in low-level computational complexity. Buss' research concerns
(i) formal systems of mathematical logic and the complexity of proofs in such
systems and (ii) computational complexity and feasible complexity. A central
goal for this research is to relate the strength of proof systems to the
complexity or difficulty of computations. Buss' work centers on proof systems
corresponding to functions which are feasibly computable, especially on proof
systems for polynomial time computation. Buss will also investigate the relative
effectiveness of various proof systems for propositional and first-order logic.
This research is fundamental to understanding the power of computation in
mathematics. ***
