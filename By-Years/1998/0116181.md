With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Detroit-Mercy will
acquire a liquid chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. This versatile
system includes a photodiode array detector and a quadrupole mass spectrometry
detector with atmospheric pressure electrospray and chemical ionization sources.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including
characterization of verdazyl free radicals, isoflavones and their metabolites
and modified peptides.

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LCMS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research at this
primarily undergraduate institution. The LCMS will also be used in advanced
courses.
