The main research goal of this proposal is to fabricate mesoscale structures of
organized units of carbon nanotubes and then utilize the impact of capillarity
forces, arising from the infiltration and subsequent evaporation of solvents
from the interstices of these densely packed nanotube units, to reconstitute
novel nanotube architectures such as condensed nanotube fibers and two
dimensional cellular foams. The fundamental understanding of capillarity effects
in dense arrays of nanotubes will be studied. The effect of surface modification
of nanotubes, for example, via low temperature plasma etching, on the wetting
characteristics of nanotubes will be understood. The basic mechanisms of pattern
formation in organized nanotube units will be studied to tailor-make patterns of
known cellular structures from nanotubes prefabricated on planar substrates. The
condensed nanotube structures in the form of foams and fibers will be evaluated
structurally and tested for mechanical and electrical properties.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will lead to a fundamental understanding of
how strong capillary forces and interfacial interactions between nanoscale
building blocks can be used to assemble them into various shapes and
architectures. The ability to shape organized nanotube assemblies into unique
shapes, such as two-dimensional foams, and periodicities will allow us to
fabricate and evaluate new nanotube based structures for a wide range of
applications such as reinforcements in polymer composites, novel nanostructured
elastic membranes, damping microstructures and thermal conduits.&lt;br/&gt;
