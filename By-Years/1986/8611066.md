This research program will investigate the effect of local soil conditions and
topographic changes on earthquake-induced strong ground motion and the resulting
damage to buildings. For example, accelerograph records show that much greater
intensities of shaking occurred in those parts of Mexico City underlain by
relatively deep layers of soft clay as compared to other parts of the city
underlain by stiff soil deposits or rock-like conditions. It is also believed
that local discontinuities in soil conditions, such as the proximity of Metro
stations and tunnels, highway underpasses, and stiff soil interfaces, resulted
in a significant local amplication of the ground motions.
