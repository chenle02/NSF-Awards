Wright 9631316 Search theory provides a new way to think about many issues in
monetary economics. This project contributes to the foundations of monetary
economics by extending in several directions some recent development in the
literature that use search theory to formalize the role of money and related
assets in the economy. The major recent development in this literature has been
the use of bargaining theory to determine prices endogenously in the models,
while previous versions more or less assumed that prices were fixed exogenously
in order t focus on the process of trade (who exchanges with whom, using which
objects as media of exchange, and so on). In terms of methods, the current
proposal has three parts. First, it is argued that by using a simple special
case of bargaining theory, one may derive such stronger results and one may
therefore use the model to address more complicated questions than would have
been possible in general. Second, it is suggested that there is potentially
interesting new way to analyze government policy in these models. Finally, there
are several technical or mathematical issues that need to be addressed. This
research should eventually contribute to the analysis of currency reform, e.g.,
what are the costs and benefits of European currency integration.
