The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project results in democratization of silicon-based
internet of things (IoT) microelectronics systems. It enables more affordable
and easy to configure solutions, rapid time to market of customized chip
systems, and application of microelectronic systems in ultra small form factors.
The technology developed in this proposal will become the foundation of new
application-specific integrated systems built using pre-fabricated silicon
chiplets. The business model being pursued is based on a virtual store model
where customers select chiplets/components, form factor, and then receive
immediate feedback of electrical and mechanical models, price, and delivery
time. Additional monetization in the field is also possible using field
programmability mechanism. Features included in our technology and business
model address the high-mix need of IoT in a novel manner by designing a general-
purpose active silicon interposer for long usage life span by programming it for
specific applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research Phase I project includes development of a unique active silicon
interposer solution to enable Internet of Things (IoT) through three-dimensional
(3D) chip stacking in an affordable, small form factor. Low cost printed circuit
board (PCB) and assembly technology has form factor limitations. Justifying the
design time and cost for using an application specific integrated circuit chip
on an IoT system are way too large to be relevant. PCB designs are easy to copy
and vulnerable to tampering. Powered by its innovative 3D integration
technology, programmable silicon interposer architecture, and power-management
hooks, we address IoT needs by enabling a single package system that includes
three key components of IoT hardware: computing, communication, and sensing. The
research will result in a production flow for synthesis of chip systems for IoT
devices with off-the-shelf silicon components being combined into an integrated
system using our interposer. This activity will advance knowledge and answer
questions on the feasibility of low cost chip-on-chip assembly reliability,
interposer programmability, and high volume commercialization of such systems.
