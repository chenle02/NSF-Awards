ABSTRACT

This proposal is devoted to investigations in the analysis of operators
associated to singular integrals, product-like operations, function spaces and
approximations, estimates for commutators and null forms, and other related
problems. The main tools to be used are decomposition techniques related to
time-frequency expansions. Singular multilinear pseudodifferential operators
will be studied together with their application to nonlinear analysis, estimates
in Sobolev spaces, and partial differential equations. Another part of the
project is concerned with the mathematical modeling of transformations of quasi-
ordered geometries as measured by their Fourier spectra. This is motivated by
ongoing research in biology in the analysis of the scattering of light by
nanostructures in the tissues of living organisms.

A common task in both theoretical and applied problems is to find the best way
to decompose a complicated system in a way that efficiently quantifies
observable properties and effects and keeps the available information in an
organized and manageable form. Fourier analysis decodes such information by
resolving a signal or function into a spectrum of waves of different amplitudes
and frequencies, while providing also a way to study spatial order, structured
geometries, and patterns in data. Combined with this analysis, multilinear
approaches to complicated phenomena in nonlinear science will provide further
understanding of problems where simple linear or first-order approximations are
not sufficient. The analysis of ordered structures is also of importance to
research in other areas of biology and physical sciences. For example, it is a
relevant aspect in questions about the study of macroscopic physical properties
of materials in terms of their microscopic structures.
