This five-day workshop for college mathematics faculty will be held at Salisbury
State University and is sponsored by the MAA. The goal of the workshop is to
provide classroom environmental applications suitable for several levels of
courses, including general education as well as sophomore/junior level modeling
courses. The chief lecturer is H.T. Odum, a systems ecologist from the
University of Florida. The workshop will emphasis visual, qualitative, and
computational aspects in modeling and analysis. Participants will develop
materials for use in the classroom and present them at a subsequent follow-up
meeting.
