Predicting the behavior of an individual amidst a large number of other people,
such as a player in a multiplayer online game or a pedestrian in an urban scene,
poses a difficult challenge. This is because an agent's actions are strongly
influenced by others in its environment, even though they do not formally share
goals or plans. The majority of prior work on multi-agent behavior recognition
has either ignored the influence of an agent's social context or has focused on
tightly-coupled agent teams. In contrast, the research supported under this
award is making fundamental progress in activity recognition and synthesis for
humans in large, loosely-coupled groups by creating computational models of
group identity that inform agent action selection. Models are being evaluated on
problems such as recognizing group membership in video footage, analyzing player
strategies in multiplayer online games, and other social simulations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to make strong progress towards a
better understanding of group dynamics and processes in human psychology.
Educational initiatives of this award are introducing students to the exciting
area of socially-interactive agent systems, using agent-based simulations to
disseminate information about group bias and stereotypes (raising awareness of
these issues has been proven to reduce the impact of bias on decision-making),
continued curriculum development on multi-agent systems, the creation of public
datasets of multi-agent social interactions, and the expansion of
outreach/mentoring programs for women in computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).
