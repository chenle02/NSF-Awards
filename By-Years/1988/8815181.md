Kin selection theory predicts that closely related animals will exhibit more
cooperation than will more distantly related animals of the same species. This
project will investigate whether red-backed salamanders, a common inhabitant of
forests in eastern North America, conform to the predictions of kin selection
theory. Molecular genetic technology ("DNA fingerprinting") will be used to
determine the genetic relationships of individuals tested. This project
represents an exciting application of molecular genetic techniques to ecological
questions. The interdisciplinary approach holds strong promise for advancing
science both empirically and theoretically.
