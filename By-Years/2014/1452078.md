The AAAI Doctoral Consortium (DC) brings together established researchers and
mid-career Ph.D. students for a two-day workshop where students and faculty
interact in a range of settings to provide both formal and informal career and
research mentoring. As a means of encouraging young and upcoming researchers in
Artificial Intelligence, the AAAI Doctoral Consortium has been proven to be a
relatively inexpensive and extremely effective model. Many of the current
reviewers, mentors, and panelists were once student
participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of the AAAI Doctoral
Consortium lies in the unique opportunity for junior researchers to gain high
quality feedback on academic and social issues relevant to their career, from
senior researchers within their community. As part of the DC program, mentors
and students interact in meetings, panels, working lunches, and during oral
presentations and discussions. For many students, this is the only opportunity
to receive focused input from researchers other than members of their
dissertation committee. Students not only gain the experience of giving a talk
on their thesis research and receiving specific feedback on their work, they
also are given the opportunity to discuss more personal issues, such as
balancing work and family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of the AAAI
DC are centered on bringing together a wide range of students at different
stages of research, from different types of labs and universities and different
regions across the US and around the world, alongside an equally diverse group
of mentors and panelists. By interacting with established members of the
Artificial Intelligence community, students also gain a better perspective of
the AI community as a whole. The 2015 AAAI DC plans to reach out directly to
more students within the AAAI community?not only to the few who are accepted to
present their work, but also to the many early graduate students and
undergraduate students who attend AAAI, by inviting these students to attend the
panels. In doing so, the impact of the DC will extend beyond the directly-
support participants by encouraging other students to interact with mentors, and
hopefully apply to the DC in future years. &lt;br/&gt;
