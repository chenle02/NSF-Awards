With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program is supporting the
research of Professor Cynthia Burrows of the University of Utah. Professor
Burrows hypothesizes that simple chemical transformations of RNA bases could
have been the key steps in creating redox active catalysts driving early
chemical systems toward a primitive metabolism. With prior NSF funding, her
laboratory has shown that the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine serves as a
photochemical catalyst to reductively reverse cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers to
monomers. In this reaction, 8-oxoguanine acts as a flavin mimic to facilitate
excited state electron transfer. Future work will explore 8-oxopurines and other
redox active RNA purine and pyrimidine base derivatives for their ability to
mediate oxidation and reduction reactions. For example, key reactions of early
Earth must have included the ability to interconvert alcohols and aldehydes or
ketones (e.g. lactate/pyruvate) using redox cofactors analogous to NADH and
FADH2. Reactions such as these will be studied in RNA world-like conditions in
order to test the hypothesis that simpler versions of these RNA-based cofactors
could have presaged modern-day metabolism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impacts of this project are demonstrated in the unusual link between DNA damage
and repair chemistry pertinent to cancer and the chemistry of primordial Earth.
Photoinduced electron transfer appears to play a role in both realms, and
insights from this work could be broadly applicable to other disciplines.
Students trained on the project will be involved in interdisciplinary sciences
including aspects of synthetic and physical organic, analytical and
biochemistry. Professor Burrows has demonstrated continuing leadership in
broadening participation, including programs that advance the careers of women
scientists, and will continue to be active in dissemination of research to
public audiences.
