Students' ability to record, analyze and present biochemical and physiological
measurements is improved through the use of eight computer data acquisition
systems: each consisting of a computer, a printer, hardware and software for
data acquisition, transducers for the measurement of five physiological
variables, and software for analysis and graphing of data. Six of these systems
are in the mammalian physiology laboratory and two are in the laboratory of cell
biology. The units are also available for projects in undergraduate research,
allowing the conduct of experiments and the analysis and presentation of results
to be more quantitative and meaningful.
