Manolakos The main goal of this project is the design and evaluation of VLSI
architectures for the efficient estimation of Higher Order Statistics (HOS) from
time-series data. In addition parallel algorithms to speed-up off-line HOS-based
data analysis and modeling in parallel processing systems are being developed.
Simulations are being performed on a Transputer-based multiprocessor for
validation purposes and proof-of-concept prototypes will be designed using
hardware description languages for performance/area estimation. As a by-product
of this research, public domain parallel processing software will be provided on
various platforms (CM, Transputers, Monsoon dynamic data-flow) to allow
scientists who are not experts in signal processing to experiment with the
powerful HOS-based techniques in the analysis and modeling of large amounts of
statistical data.
