The College of Oceanography at Texas A&amp;M University will acquire several
items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared use
equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the
R/V GYRE, a research vessel operated by the University. A substantial part of
the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored
research projects. The instrumen- tation will also increase the capabilities of
the ship and of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
The instrumentation includes: -Seagoing computer, disk drives and other
peripheral equipment for shipboard data management system that is essential for
real-time acquisition and display of large data sets, and -CTD system and
support structure for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and
temperature as a function of depth. The instrumentation described above will
increase the capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored research,
engineering, and education projects.
