93525502 Woods Diode Array Spectrophotometers for Rapid Kinetics The project
will purchase diode array spectophotometers to measure sapid knetics in the
undergraduate biochemistry course. New experiments will be centered about
enzymatic kinetics with data collection required at less than second intervals.
The rates of formation and degradation of reactants, intermediates, and products
will be determined. ***y
