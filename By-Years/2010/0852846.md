The international planning grant will facilitate the development of
collaboration between the PI Dr. Tia-Lynn Ashman at the University of Pittsburgh
and Drs. Conchita Alonso and Carlos Herrera of Estación Biológica de Doñana
(CSIC) in Seville, Spain. The ultimate research objective is to determine the
response of pollination and pollen limitation of plant reproduction to
increasing diversity across a wide range of plant community diversities, and
determine whether this relationship differs for endemics. The work will take
advantage of a hotspot of plant diversity in the Baetic Mountain Ranges of
southern Spain. The goal of the planning grant is to jointly conduct feasibility
studies and to gather the necessary preliminary data that will inform the design
and implementation of the crucial experimental tests of hypotheses concerning
the mechanisms that underlie global pollen limitation-biodiversity gradients.
The project will contribute to the development of two students as members of a
global community of scientists. This work will ultimately result in a better
understanding of the relationship between plant-pollinator interactions and
biodiversity, which is important for effective conservation of both plants and
pollinators, especially in the face of modern threats such as changing climate,
pollinator declines and habitat loss.
