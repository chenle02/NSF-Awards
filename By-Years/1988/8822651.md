The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University will acquire
several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of shared
use equipment. This equipment is maintained for use on or in association with
the R/V POINT SUR, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the
University. A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989 is
in support of NSF.sponsored research projects. The instrumentation will also
increase the capabilities includes: .Acoustic transceiver for determineining the
precise depth under the ship and for measuring seafloor characteristics, .SAIL
data logging modules for increasing the number of environmental parameters that
are routinely monitored, .Navigational information distribution system for the
remote read.out of precision navigation data at several locations, .Deck
controller for the expendable bathythermograph system, .De.ionized water filter
system for making reagent quality water for a variety of shipboard experiments.
The instrumentation described above will increase the capability of the
organization to support NSF.sponsored research and engineering projects.
