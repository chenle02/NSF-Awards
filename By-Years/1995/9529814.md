9529814 Tarduno Preliminary data suggest that the assumption of hotspot fixity,
upon which plate motion is based, may be wrong. Comparison of paleolatitudes of
Pacific guyots with those of their presumed hotspot source reveals large
deviations. This award will test the preliminary work more thoroughly, using
recently recovered material from the Ocean Drilling Project, and comparing
paleomagnetic data from carbonate sediments with those of the underlying
basalts.
