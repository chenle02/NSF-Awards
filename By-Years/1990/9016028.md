We propose a collaborative research project between the Army Electronics
Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL) at Fort Monmouth and the University of
Maryland. It focuses on the development of integrating picosecond
photoconductors directly onto the MBE based microelectronic chip. The specific
research tasks under this program include: (1) Developing MBE material based
picosecond photoconductors for on chip waveform generation and measurement and
comparing their performance with those fabricated directly on semi-insulating
GaAs substrates. (2) Using picosecond optical characterization to study MBE
material electronic properties, carrier dynamics, and the effect of
metallization, such as the thickness of the metal strip, on the picosecond
electric pulse generation and propagation. (3) Characterizing the ps
photoconductors based on low temperature MBE grown GaAs. (4) Making S parameter
measurements on the coplanar microstrip transmission line to study the
millimeter-wave propagation characteristics.
