This project will produce a series of textbooks to be used in professional
development in mathematics for middle school teachers. The subject areas for the
textbooks are Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Number Theory, and Probability and
Statistics. The books will emphasize content and pedagogy and will include
ancillary materials such as videotapes of some of the professional development
classes. The texts will come from the Seminars for Elementary Specialists and
Mathematics Educators (SESAME) in the Mathematics Department at the University
of Chicago. The writing team includes teachers, mathematics educators and
research mathematicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
