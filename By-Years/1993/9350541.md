This SGER proposes to do exploratory research to determine impediment to
implement reform strategies in freshman mathematics so as to increase the
participation and success rate of minority students in those courses. The
research builds upon similar work in other campus settings (specifically that of
Treisman at the University of California, Berkeley) but is exploratory in that
it seeks to apply the model to colleges in the New Jersey system. Three kinds of
research questions are to be addressed: (1) to document the nature of
mathematical experiences that take place using a variety of kinds of data; (2)
to analyze the nature of organizational issues that attempts to reform
mathematics education at the lower division level; (3) to attempt to identify
strategies for addressing the variety of barriers to reform that are encountered
in this sort of reform.//
