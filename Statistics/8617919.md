The research will deal with the broad area of cluster analysis. Cluster
analysis is classification of objects in to groups of similar ones. The
principal investigator has been a pioneer in the field of cluster analysis. He
will investigate several statistical problems connected with clustering. The
major problems with the clustering algorithms are to answer the following four
questions. (1) How many clusters? (2) Are the clusters real? (3) Are the
clusters reliable? and (4) What algorithms should be used. Statistical methods
will help answer these questions. Multivariate density estimation procedures
will be used. Some of these techniques are used in spatial analysis as well.
