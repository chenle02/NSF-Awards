This grant supports acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry
(SIRMS) system to be housed in the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences (MEAS) at North Carolina State University. A dual inlet SIRMS with gas
chromatograph and elemental analyzer preparative devices will be commissioned.
The SIRMS system will allow for analysis of compound specific stable isotopes of
carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen and facilitate a wide range of basic and applied
geochemical and biogeochemical research projects in MEAS and the Department of
Forestry that seek to trace the fate, preservation or sequestration of naturally
occurring and anthropogenic organic species. Primary users of the requested
SIRMS will include lead PI Neal Blair and co-I's Elana Leithold, Mary
Schweitzer, John Fountain, and David DeMaster of MEAS and Elizabeth Nichols of
Forestry. Broader impacts include improved educational opportunities for
undergraduate and graduate students at NCSU and high school science teachers in
the state. In addition, proposed studies of organic carbon cycling have
implications for national policies concerning pollutant remediation and
greenhouse gas emissions. ***
