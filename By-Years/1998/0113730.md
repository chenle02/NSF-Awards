This program establishes a scholarship program for computer science graduate
students specializing in information assurance. Upon graduation, the students
participate in two years of federal service. The program of study is a dual-
track masters program, leading to either a master's degree in computer sciences
or an interdisciplinary master's degree with specialization in information
security. Students in both tracks receive special attention in seminar and
advising sessions to help them understand the context and role of information
security in today's society. This includes regular presentations by leaders in
commerce, academia, and government. Students have the opportunity to participate
in leading-edge research projects conducted by faculty. Through this program
students receive a valuable educational background in information security and
assurance, obtain hands-on research experience, gain perspective on industry and
research trends, and provide valuable service to the government while
experiencing real-world problems.
