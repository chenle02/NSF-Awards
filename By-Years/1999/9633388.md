A central problem in the management of large software projects and the
maintenance of libraries of reusable software is ensuring the consistency of
inter-module connections in the face of continuing system evolution. As bugs are
isolated and fixed, capabilities are added or enhanced in response to changes in
the user requirements, and support software and hardware is upgraded or
replaced, there are myriad opportunities for invalidation of prior assumptions
used in code development. In this project, techniques from logic, type theory,
and abstract interpretation are employed in the design and implementation of
tools to help automate the process of ensuring consistency. A partial-
evaluation-driven abstract-interpretation algorithm is used to analyze
individual modules for consistency with respect to local specifications, and a
linking and configuration manager will be used to check for correspondence
between module specifications. Using abstract interpretation, proof generation,
and realizability techniques, the manager synthesizes common additional code
that may be needed to provide trustworthy linkages. Two aspects of this approach
are essential for application to large-scale, evolving systems: (i)link updating
must be a local process, so that small changes do not incur large penalties, and
(ii)linkage information must be available to the programmer in a user-readable
format. Recent experience with building efficient, usable logic tools is applied
in the project towards satisfying these requirements. ***
