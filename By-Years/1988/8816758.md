The investigators will design, build and test a new upper water column time-
series sediment trap capable of collecting replicate samples of settling
particles and calibrate it using a novel calibration device. The KATS (Knauer-
Asper Time- Series) trap will be constructed by mating the existing and proven
technology of the Knauer MULTITRAP and Honjo rotary sample collector which is
currently fitted to his Mk VIc sediment traps. The new trap design will provide
sampling capability not available in any other trapping systems with higher
sampling resolution and accuracy than previously attained. The use of existing
hardware will result in a reduced pool of spare parts and supporting equipment
for programs which plan to use both types of traps (eg. GOFS). Calibration of
the KATS will be accomplished using a neutrally- buoyant sediment trap which
will be immune to hydrodynamic biases (GOFS sediment trap workshop report, in
press).
