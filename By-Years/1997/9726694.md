The research will investigate how modern organizations, comprising interlocked
ensembles of people and information technologies, can be understood as
`intelligent organizations.` As modern organizations redefine how they develop,
process, and assimilate information and manage knowledge, they are increasingly
being conceived as large-scale, distributed `cognitive' systems, with properties
and processes such as organizational memory, organizational learning, and
organizational intelligence. This project aims to build an empirically-grounded
framework and associated metrics for understanding the phenomenon of
organizational intelligence. The research will explore ways to conceptualize and
measure organizational intelligence, and will develop a sound conceptual
framework comprising variables that are related to organizational intelligence
and interrelationships among them. These variables will capture elements of
organizational structure, information technology and systems, culture, knowledge
assets, stakeholder relationships, and strategic processes. Both review and
empirical methods including interviewing will be used. The resulting framework
will form a basis for operationalizing the concept of organizational
intelligence, and for studying it widely with empirical approaches. It will
provide and disseminate insights and conceptual tools upon which other
researchers can build.
