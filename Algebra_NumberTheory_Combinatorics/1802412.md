The study of symmetry is a basic paradigm in science, with fundamental
consequences for crystallography, particle physics, general relativity, quantum
computing and signal processing. The study of the (bilateral, translation,
rotational, scaling and other) symmetries of a given chemical, physical or
mathematical system is often key to its understanding, and ultimate solution,
since their presence greatly constrains the system. Quantum groups are
deformations of the most basic symmetries of Nature. They were discovered in the
1980s as symmetries of one and two-dimensional statistical mechanical models
that describe, for example, thin layers of ice. Quantum groups have re-emerged
very recently as the symmetries of four-dimensional gauge theories that describe
the interaction of elementary particles such as quarks.

Quantum groups form a hierarchy that depends on the strength of the deformation
and their dependence on a spectral parameter: constant, rational, trigonometric
or elliptic. As the hierarchical level rises, an interesting trade-off occurs:
some of the structure becomes far more intricate, while some simplifies
radically. This project will further uncover relations that exist between
different members of the hierarchy by building conceptual bridges between them.
These conceptual bridges will have fundamental consequences for the quantum
groups they link. On the one hand, they will give a radically simpler
description of the multivaluedness of the differential or difference equations
for one quantum group in terms of its hierarchical superior. On the other, they
will give a self-contained description of the latter in terms of the former
which, in addition to clarifying its structure, has potentially far reaching
arithmetic consequences. More precisely, the present project will explore the
relations between affine quantum groups. One main theme of the project is to
extend the description of the monodromy of the rational Casimir connection of a
symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebra, in terms of quantum Weyl group operators, to
numerical values of the deformation parameter, and to the difference analogue of
the connection. The second main theme of the project is to use the meromorphic
tensor equivalence of finite dimensional representations of Yangians and quantum
loop algebras, and of quantum loop algebras and elliptic quantum groups, to
compute the monodromy of the trigonomeric Casimir connection and of the rational
and trigonometric qKZ equations, thus proving the difference analog of the
Drinfeld-Kohno theorem conjectured by Frenkel and Reshetikhin.
