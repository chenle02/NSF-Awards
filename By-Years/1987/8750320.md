Students in geology and biology have been using electron microscopy for
morphological studies of biological and geological materials. By adding a
quantitative microanalysis system with digital X-ray and video image processing
and analysis systems the students are being exposed to state- of-the-art
analytical and image processing. A new course is being developed between the
biology and geology departments to focus on the underlying theory and diverse
applications of analytical scanning microscopy and image processing analysis.
Students are receiving hands- on experience through extensive laboratory work.
In addition students in mineralogy and petrology are doing new experiments that
are made possible by the expanded system. The quantitative microanalysis
software is making it possible for the students to do Bence-Albee analyses for
geological samples and to do statistical and mathematical analyses for least-
squares filter fit, intensity ratio calculations and multiple point analysis.
