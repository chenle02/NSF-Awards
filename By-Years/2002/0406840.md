Independent Production Fund is producing a three-part public television series
focusing on the latest research in the science of music. The programs will
explore how cutting-edge science is revealing new connections between music and
the human mind and body, the natural world and the cosmos. The series will
follow researchers from a variety of fields including physiology, neuroscience,
psychology, biology, physics and education, as they use groundbreaking
techniques and technologies to unravel age-old mysteries about music's
persistence, universality and emotional power. It will show how these
researchers are shedding valuable new light on the way brains work. The impact
of the programs will be extended through a content-rich companion web site and
innovative formal and informal educational-outreach materials to both middle and
high school age students, as well as a complementary radio component. Mannes
Productions will produce the series; Goodman Research Group will conduct
formative evaluation and Rockman et al will conduct summative evaluation.
