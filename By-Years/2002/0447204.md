EAR-0447204&lt;br/&gt;Grove&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be
used to upgrade the MIT Experimental Petrology Laboratory. The Laboratory
carries out experimental studies that provide information on the processes and
time scales of chemical differentiation within the Earth and terrestrial
planets. Studies involve both phase equilibrium and kinetic investigations.
Projects include: experimental studies of the formation and chemical evolution
of the Earth's continental crust, studies of the processes and Pressure -
Temperature conditions of mantle melting in the Earth, moon and Mars, studies of
the processes of core formation on Earth and Mars and of chemical
differentiation and core formation on meteorite parent bodies. The upgrade will
replace critical components that are necessary for the laboratory to continue
productively and remain state-of-the-art. Funds are requested to carry out
upgrades in three areas. 1) Upgrade outdated and failing temperature control
equipment for furnaces used for externally heated gas pressure vessel, one-
atmosphere and piston cylinder experiments. This equipment is failing and needs
to be replaced with modern electronics. 2) Replace aging hydraulic equipment
used to pressurize our three piston cylinder devices and upgrade the hydraulic
systems. 3) Replace antiquated analytical balances and microscopes that are used
in sample preparation and examination with up-to-date instrumentation. The
acquisition of this new instrumentation will ensure continued efficient
operation of the MIT experimental petrology laboratory, will allow the lab to
sustain a high level of productivity and will allow us to continue to produce
high-quality experimental results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
