Travel support is provided for distinguished American scientists to attend an
international symposium on "Circulating Regulatory Factors and Neuroendocrine
Function" in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The Slovak Academy of Sciences in this
Warsaw Pact nation will provide transportation from Vienna to Czechoslovakia and
expenses for the American scientists while attending this meeting. The meeting
will focus on the mechanism(s) by which circulating factors derived from the
immune system, heart, kidney, adrenals, thyroid gland, gonads and pituitary
gland influence the brain mechanisms which regulate neuroendocrine and other
homeostatic functions. This meeting is of timely importance because it is now
clear that the lifespan and the function of brain neurons are modulated by
agents in the blood. While the blood-brain barrier is believed to protect the
brain from many direct influences, there is clear evidence that many circulatory
agents exert control over the development and maturation of neurons. The meeting
will address this crucial problem in a format which provides for integration of
data from many different disciplines. The proceedings of this important meeting
will published.
