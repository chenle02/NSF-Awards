This award supports Dr. Ceon Ramon and a graduate student from the University of
Washington in a collaboration with Hannes Howak and Jens Haueisen of the
Biomagnetics Center at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena. The
collaboration brings together the complementary capabilities of the German and
U.S. groups to develop an anatomically realistic, very-high resolution computer
model of the electrical and magnetic activities of the human head which accounts
for differences in tissue conductivity in different directions. The model will
then be used to investigate the electrical and magnetic activities of the brain
under normal and diseased conditions. Such a model does not presently exist, and
will lead to a better understanding of the electrical activity of the brain
which will, in turn, lead to clinical applications.
