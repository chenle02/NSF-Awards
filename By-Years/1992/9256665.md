ABSTRACT An innovative educational program for doctoral study in design and
manufacturing is proposed. Besides the current depth in graduate programs, this
program would provide cultural breadth in competitive manufacturing. Students
will spend four summers working in manufacturing companies: three domestic and
one foreign. Students will also be required to complete a minor in a foreign
language. The research program will emphasize a unified strategy to design
synthesis methods, new approaches to quality assurance, and advanced control
methods will be the focus of the doctoral research. With these new technologies,
the current separation between design, manufacturing, and quality engineering
disappears; instead the design and manufacturing process is unified into single,
rapidly modifiable approach. This educational and research agenda is imperative
for the future competitiveness of American industries.
