Protein elongation factors play a major role in ribosomal protein synthesis.
Dr. Jurnak has used both biochemical and X-ray diffraction analyses of
elongation factor complexes in her research. Her main goal is to understand the
molecular details of each step of the elongation cycle with a special focus on
the structural basis for the activity of elongation factor EF-Tu. She will
initiate new research projects which focus directly on the macromolecular
crystallization problem itself. Dr. Jurnak will explore the feasibility of
preparing large quantities of the purified complexes and to crystallizing each
in a form suitable for X-ray diffraction analyses. She will also learn quasi-
elastic light scattering (QELS) methods; a techique which will help to elucidate
key macromolecular properties that affect the crystallization process. These
complexes are of considerable biological interest. The Career Advancement Award
offers her the opportunity to open up new crystallographic projects and to
demonstrate the usefulness of the QELS technique for general applicability to
macromolecular crystallization.
