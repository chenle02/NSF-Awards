The goals of this research are: 1) to identify processes controlling organic
acid cycling associated with sulfate reduction and methanogenesis in organic-
rich sediments: 2) to understand controls on seasonal and non-steady state
variations in these processes; and, 3) to establish quantitative linkages
between the electron accepting processes and the input and degradation of
specific classes of metabolizable organic compounds. The research is divided
into five sections: i) studies of low molecular weight organic acid turnover,
ii) use of bacterial lipid ethers as tracers of microbial processes in anoxic
sediments, iii) characterization of size classes and composition of dissolved
organic carbon, iv) studies of temporal variations in organic matter delivery
and degradation processes; and, v) studies of early diagenesis in upper slope
sediments. The work will be carried out in nearshore marine, estuarine and upper
slope sedimentary environments.
