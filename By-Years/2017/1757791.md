Subduction zones are critical interfaces in Earth where the convergence of
tectonic plates gives rise to earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunami, and other natural
hazards. Subduction zones are studied using a variety of methods, including
seismic, geodetic, and satellite observation, numerical modeling, and laboratory
experimentation. For this conference we are bringing together a community of
scientists who use laboratory approaches to reproduce the pressures,
temperatures, stresses, and chemical environments inside Earth to investigate
the processes that control the behavior of subduction zones. This conference is
connected to the Subduction Zones in 4 Dimensions (SZ4D) initiative, a multi-
disciplinary effort linking observation, modeling, experiments, and theory, to
better understand the time and spatially-dependent evolution of subduction
zones.

The objective of this conference is to discuss infrastructural needs of the
experimental groups who study subduction processes. Experimental science
directly informs diverse subduction research into earthquake timing and
location, magma transport, and volcanic eruptions, through the study of material
properties: viscosity, friction, dynamic rupture, poroelasticity, electrical
conductivity, phase equilibria, melting, geothermobarometry, permeability,
reaction kinetics, and diffusion. Participants for the conference will be drawn
from the experimental rock mechanics, experimental petrology/volcanology, and
mineral physics communities. Topics to be discussed include community
organization and coordination, data and methodological standardization, and
technical issues related to experimental studies on subduction zone materials.
Participants will discuss solutions to persistent challenges, identify
stakeholders, and seek leaders to coordinate future initiatives.
