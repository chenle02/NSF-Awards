This project will create advanced computational tools to predict the strength of
Structural Composite Lumber (SCL) ? an engineered wood product that is used
extensively in light-frame construction. This predictive capability is critical
to encouraging the design of new SCL products and allowing engineers to predict
the strength of structures built of SCL. Project goals are to be accomplished
through experiments and analytical and numerical modeling of two SCL materials,
Parallel Strand Lumber and Laminated Veneer Lumber. The research will be
conducted in four phases: (1) an experimental phase that will establish the
strength of SCL under different loadings and will measure the internal structure
of SCL through x-ray computer tomography; (2) computational modeling that
incorporates explicit representations of the material structure and properties
(3) the development of models for the behavior of SCL that can be used in
structural design, and (4) making these material models available to practicing
engineers who use commercial analysis programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
will deliver long-needed tools for strength analysis of SCL - free to
manufacturers and inventors to develop and use. Quick and inexpensive numerical
evaluation of SCL will foster innovation in new wood product design with
significant environmental and economic benefits. By making the predictive
capability widely available, this project marks a first step in advancing the
practice of wood design to a state comparable to that of steel and concrete. The
work will lay a scientific foundation for investigations into other wood
products such as glue laminated timber or plywood. Graduate level course modules
on wood composite modeling are part of an integrated plan for research and
learning. &lt;br/&gt;
