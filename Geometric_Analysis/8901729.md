The three Principal Investigators will continue their studies of the
relationships between Teichmuller spaces, families of Riemann surfaces, and the
dynamical systems of the complex plane. Specific attention will be paid to the
degree three Mandelbrot set for centered polynomials and Julia sets which are
Cantor. Work on the Douady-Earle barycentric coordinates will continue. The
exquisite fractal Julia and generalized Mandelbrot sets will be studied for
degree three polynomials. These sets which can be generated by simple programs
on home computers have recently excited the general public about mathematics.
The Principal Investigators will continue to study the deep mathematical
properties of these fractals.
