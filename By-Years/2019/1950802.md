This REU Site award to Syracuse University, located in Syracuse, NY, supports 10
students for 10 weeks of chemistry research training during the summers from
2020-2022. At this site, funded by the Division of Chemistry in the Mathematical
and Physical Sciences Directorate, students take part in research projects
spanning the field of chemistry, gaining practical knowledge and skills through
hands-on learning. Alongside research, students participate in professional
development training where they gain new perspectives in chemistry, navigate the
different career and educational pathways in the chemical sciences, and practice
scientific communication skills. This site supports students with no prior
research experience, underrepresented minorities, and veterans, which serves to
broaden participation and increase diversity in the chemical
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students undertake research projects spanning the
field of chemistry, from modeling electronic processes in nanoparticles, to
understanding the cellular mechanisms of protein separation, to designing
biocompatible metal organic frameworks. From these, projects students gain
skills in literature review, experimental design, collecting and interpreting
data, and communicating conclusions through written reports, oral presentations,
and a poster session. In addition to research, students participate in weekly
lunch meetings, a career program, an ethics seminar, a multi-university poster
session, excursions, and social events. Students also interact with a diverse
cohort of peers, including international undergraduate researchers, affording
students a broader perspective of the chemical
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
