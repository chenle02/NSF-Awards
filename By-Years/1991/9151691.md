An instructional computing laboratory for pre-calculus students is being
developed. The project began in spring 1990, with a small-scale trial and will
continue with the collaboration of the Technical-Vocational Institute, a two-
year institution from which many students transfer to the University of New
Mexico. The goals are to implement use of a computer assisted instructional
program with an emphasis on cooperative learning as an integral part of the pre-
calculus level courses and accumulate a data base of information on students'
math backgrounds, performance, and attitudes, which will be used in determining
bow to more effectively meet the needs of minority and other groups that
frequently have difficulty in mathematics.
