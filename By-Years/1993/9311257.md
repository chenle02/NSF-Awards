9311257 Pahwa Restoration of power after an extended outage in a distribution
system results in load much higher than normal load due to cold load pickup. In
addition to initial transients, the load during cold load pickup has an enduring
component that can be 2 to 5 times normal load and may last for several hours.
The enduring component is mainly due to loss of diversity in the cycling type of
loads, such as air conditioners, refrigerator etc. An increase in load over a
period of time and a trend to utilize the existing facilities to maximum extent
will make cold load pickup and important issue in design and operation of
distribution systems. The proposed methodology is a new approach to design and
operation of distribution systems to handle cold load pickup problem. This
research will lay a foundation for integration of distribution automation into
the design of a distribution system. ***
