Texas A&amp;M currently possesses a General Electric 2 telsa, 31 cm bore MRI
system located in the Engineering Imaging Laboratory. Computer control of the
instrument is via a Nicolet 1280 processor. The PI notes that the processor is a
good, but not optimal system, and that it requires significant effort for the
configuration and execution of special tests. The PI proposes purchasing a
General Electric Omega System which includes a Sun processor and associated
electronics and software for more efficient instrument control, data acquisition
and data analysis. The upgraded instrument will be used in several projects,
most of which are concerned with applying MRI technology to the study of fluids
flow in porous media. Some of these projects are: (i) Using MRI to identify
fluids, their saturation, wetability and in situ velocity and permeability in
porous media, (ii) Using MRI to evaluate pore structure, (iii) using MRI to
study oil displacement by chemically stabilized displacers such as foam and by
polymer solutions.
