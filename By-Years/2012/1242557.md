This award is support travel to the Alpine Summer School, which brings together
leading experts working in the areas related to climate, aerosols, and the
cryosphere to give both fundamental and advanced lectures to graduate students
and researchers at the beginning of their careers as a means of educating the
next generation of researchers. In addition, round table discussions and
brainstorming sessions will be conducted between all participants to develop a
vision of future research as well as cross-cutting collaborations.
