A new series of experiments studying the excitation of complex atoms by fast
electrons will be continued. The light emitted after such excitation will be
analyzed with a novel apparatus that will allow new and important information to
be gained about the interaction process. The results will be useful in
establishing the range and accuracy of theoretical predictions.
