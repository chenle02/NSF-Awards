The proposed collaboration with Notker R`sch of the Technical University of
Munich will develop the necessary theory and computational tools needed to
examine the electronic structure, spectroscopy, and reactivity of large metal-
containing catalytic systems. Systems of particular interest are those that
involve electron, proton, and oxygen transfer, such as those prevalent in many
biological processes. Because experimental study of such systems is difficult,
this work seeks to provide a useful tool for both theorists and experimentalists
to understand the systems better. Most current models parametrize the
independent electron interactions, which makes those models inapplicable to the
study of reactivity. This work will parametrize at the many-electron level.
