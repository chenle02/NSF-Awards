This project will develop and implement a comprehensive data management strategy
for the western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) Phase II field program.
This work will take place in collaboration with the SBI Project Office and the
scientific investigators who are to provide datasets and information. The data
management program will help ensure that data are accurate, accessible, well-
documented, and disseminated in a timely fashion to scientific users. Initial
preparation of the program will be assisted by results from a questionnaire that
will be sent out to all involved parties including scientific investigators and
project managers. These results will help in establishing database structure and
to determine operational data needs. An on-line field catalog will support field
activities and will contain field reports and data products for review and
exchange during the progression of the field programs. Information included in
the catalog is anticipated to include satellite images and early data products
that may be useful to other ongoing work. Experience with past large research
projects has shown that data management components such as this are essential to
effective database generation and data dissemination, while the field catalog
can be very helpful in project coordination and in optimizing field sampling.
