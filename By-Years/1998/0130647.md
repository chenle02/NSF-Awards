This award renews support to the UTEX Culture Collection of Algae (UTEX) at the
University of Texas at Austin. The UTEX algal collection includes a variety of
mostly unicellular, freshwater algae, including diatoms and blue-green algae.
The collection provides several thousand sample cultures every year to academic
scientists (for basic research), to governmental agencies (for research and
water quality analysis), to companies (for aquatic animal food, applied
research, and biotechnology development), and to educators and students (for
teaching and learning). Over 1600 UTEX strains are currently cryopreserved.
Cryopreservation minimizes the cost of maintaining strains, and reduces the risk
of genetic drift which may occur when strains are maintained using serial
culture. The collection maintains a web site that includes a database listing
all cultures in the collection, strain histories, and recipes for culture media.
UTEX acts as a resource for information about the culture of algae, and provides
opportunities for short-term visits to learn methods and techniques needed for
use of algae in research. Awarded funds cover approximately two-thirds of the
cost of operation of the collection with the remainder covered by the University
and by user fees. Planned improvements within the next five years include
cryopreservation of nearly all UTEX strains, development of a reservoir of whole
genomic DNA, and addition of images of many UTEX algae to information provided
on the web site.
