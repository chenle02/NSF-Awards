The IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications
(PerCom), sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on
Distributed Computing (TCDP) and Technical Committee on Computer Communications
(TCCC), is the flagship conference of the pervasive computing community. In
addition to the main conference, the PerCom 2014 meeting will also feature 12
workshops on cutting-edge themes, a PhD Forum, work-in-progress sessions, poster
and demo sessions, a panel, and 2-3 keynote talks. The conference's technical
program also helps promote new directions of research in pervasive computing and
communications. Areas of interest including emerging areas like smartphone
sensing, participatory sensing and social networks with applications to
healthcare, security, energy and sustainability are all budding career learning
experiences for students. Student participation in IEEE Percom 2014, offers
opportunities in international collaboration, greater understanding of the
field, and an exciting view across the landscape of pervasive computing.
