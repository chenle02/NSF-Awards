Gannon University is modernizing the one year undergraduate physical chemistry
laboratory. The laboratory schedule is revised to include a greater emphasis on
modern instrumentation and laboratory techniques. New experiments include the
introduction of basic electronics, the thermal equation of state and critical
points, heat capacity ratio of gases, Raman spectroscopy, physical adsorption of
gases and magnetic susceptibilities. In addition, the equipment is used in
undergraduate research. The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal
amount of funds.
