Fundamental properties of certain electromagneticwaves in plasmas are
investigated. These waves, specifically known as whistler modes, are very
important in space plasmas and in plasma processing and propulsion. They have
not yet been studied in plasmas immersed in highly nonuniform magnetic fields
that change within one wavelength or less. The waves are excited and measured in
a large laboratory plasma with local magnetic fields produced by strong
permanent magnets and current-carrying coils. Wave propagation, wave refraction
and reflection, standing waves and nonlinear effects are obtained from detailed
measurements of three vector components of the wave magnetic field in three
dimensional space and time. The findings are expected to produce a new
understanding of wave effects in space plasmas and to improve industrial plasma
sources for plasma processing.

Specifically, whistler wave propagation will be studied near magnetic X- and
O-type null points, magnetic neutral sheets and dipole fields with high mirror
ratios. Such geometries are often found in space and laboratory plasmas, but
there is little knowledge about the wave properties in a regime where the
spatial changes of the magnetic field are comparable to the wavelength. Under
those circumstances, different group and phase velocities are possible and
complicate the wave propagation. The experiments produce complete data sets that
provide valuable insight for the understanding of whistler-mediated
reconnection, whistler eigenmodes on closed field lines, and whistler wave
reflection at the lower hybrid frequency layer as well as whistler modes near
lunar crustal magnetic fields, whistlers in small toroidal plasmas, and in
helicon and magnetron discharges. Thus, the research will open up unexplored
areas in plasma physics with broad relevance.
