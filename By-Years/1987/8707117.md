The purpose of this work is to compare two approaches to modelling and
predicting short-run transportation equilibria on large networks, e.g., the
variation inequality and the equivalent optimization, taking into account the
trade-offs between computational and behavioral considerations. Analysis
involves the selection of models and algorithms of both approaches and of real-
world transportation networks. Variables such as computer storage, convergence
characteristics, and problem size will be examined. Behavioral analysis includes
invoking alternative assumptions, functional forms, and values of demand and
performance, e.g., assimetry and non-separability. Trade-offs between
computational attractiveness and behavioral accuracy will be evaluated as well
as the relative predictive powers of alternative models. This project is an
essential step in improving the predictive capabilities needed for
transportation planning that could eventually replace the existing 4-stage
sequential process applied worldwide for the past 30 years.
