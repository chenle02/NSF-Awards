Outsourcing computation to the cloud has a difficult set of privacy challenges,
a primary one being that the client cannot really trust cloud or application
software. Encrypted computation achieves privacy by having the user specify
encrypted inputs to a program in the cloud and returning encrypted
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and implementation of a secure
processor architecture, called Ascend, that guarantees privacy of data computed
upon by untrusted programs and run on an untrusted operating system (OS) is
underway. Our security goal is to only trust the Ascend processor chip and show
that it is secure against software attacks and power analysis attacks on its
pins even though application and system software can be malicious. Our
performance goal is to show that execution time and energy overheads of
encrypted computation are reasonable. The key idea in Ascend to guarantee
privacy is obfuscated program execution: from the perspective of the Ascend
chip's input/output and power pins, an untrusted server cannot learn anything
about private user data regardless of the program
run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through innovations in architectural mechanisms,
security protocols, and applied cryptography, we hope to show that it is viable
to only trust hardware and not trust any software in some security-conscious
applications, thereby substantially minimizing the trusted computing base for
these applications. The development of simulator infrastructure and hardware
prototypes will allow the fruits of the research to be widely disseminated. This
project will introduce high-school students to research in applied cryptography
and security through an innovative high-school outreach program.
