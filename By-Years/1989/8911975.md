Intermetallic materials have a great potential as a high temperature structural
material. A study of fatigue crack initiation mechanisms in single crystals of
Ni3Al and NiAl intermetallics is proposed. These two compounds represent two
important superlattice types, viz., L12 (Ni3Al) and B2 (NiAl). The fatigue crack
initiation behavior in these intermetallics will be studies as a function of
orientation, test temperature, and environment. A vacancy-induced crack
initiation model for Ni3Al will be tested.
