Many aspects of atmospheric-ocean interactions at high southern latitudes are
still poorly understood. For instance the interaction of large cyclonic and
mesoscale storm systems with the atmospheric moisture balance in a changing
climate and with a warming ocean are curiously different from the corresponding
Arctic case.

This project seeks to better quantify the contribution of water vapor transport,
and especially the mesoscale drivers of synoptic variability, on the surface
mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets, and also to the annual progression of
Southern Ocean sea-ice. To investigate the role of these mesoscale cyclonic
storm systems, a variety of satellite data products, best available reanalysis
products and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model predictions will
be used to developed scenarios for changes in cyclone frequencies and strength
in an intensifying hydrological cycle, and the impacts these may have on
Antarctic sea-ice and continental surface mass balances.
