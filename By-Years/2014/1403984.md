Magnetic nanoparticles have been widely used in life science research and
medicine. Such particles are used for construction of biosensors, as well as for
detection of important immune or cancer cells from physiological samples.
Currently, magnetic particles must be synthesized through chemical processes,
and proteins or other targeting components are added to particle surfaces
through painstaking step-by-step processes. Nature has also developed an
approach to biomineralize magnetite to create magnetic nanoparticles. Several
species of ?magnetotactic? bacteria evolved to produce chains of magnetic
nanoparticles in specialized compartments called magnetosomes that aid in
alignment within Earth?s magnetic field. These bacteria may be ideal factories
for the next-generation of low cost magnetic particles that are pre-coated with
medically useful proteins. We will use microfluidic tools to apply selection
pressures for directed evolution of magnetotactic bacteria with a range of
magnetosome properties. We will also develop techniques to isolate magnetosomes
from the selected cell populations while maintaining the commercially useful
protein and lipid envelope surrounding the precipitated magnetite particles.
Besides use in creating customized and potentially economical protein-coated
nanoparticles for biosensing, imaging, and cell biology research, the genetic
changes within our evolved strain will give unique insights into
biomineralization, vesicle formation, and self-assembly processes that can be
used in a variety of biological systems.
