0300844&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to
study various applications of the Riemann-Hilbert problem method. These
applications include the perturbation theory of nonlinear Schroedinger equations
and several&lt;br/&gt;newly developed areas in connection with the theory of
random matrices. A book project on Riemann-Hilbert problems is also
included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemann-Hilbert problems have been found in
several important areas in mathematics in recent years. Some afore mentioned
applications also have interdisciplinary impact. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;main
application of the theory of random matrices is in physics and the study of
certain perturbed differential equations enhances the understanding of signal
transmissions in fibre optics.&lt;br/&gt;
