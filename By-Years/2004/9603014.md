This is a planning visit award for Dr. Yuval Flicker, of the Department of
Mathematics at the Ohio State University, to meet with Professor R. Sujatha, of
the School of Mathematics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in
Bombay, India. The purpose of the visit is to develop a cooperative research
activity on a technique to compute orbital integrals on the fundamental lemma.
The fundamental lemma plays a key role in the comparison of trace formulae,
which leads to a lifting of automorphic forms from subgroups--a main goal of the
Langland's program.
