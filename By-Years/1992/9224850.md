ABSTRACT---CTS-9224850 Lavernia Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have the
potential combining metallic properties of ductility, toughness, and
environmental resistance with reinforcement properties of high strength and high
modules. The attractive physical and mechanical properties that can be obtained
with metal matrix composites have been documented by numerous investigators. As
will be demonstrated in this proposal, despite encouraging preliminary results,
our understandings of the thermal mechanisms that govern the interactions
between the ceramic and metallic phases remain very limited. In particular, the
effects associated with the energetic co-injection of a distribution of ceramic
particulates into a partially solidified metallic spray, and its ensuing effects
on the heat transfer during atomization and subsequently during deposition are
not well understood. The objective of the present proposal is to outline a
research program to systematically investigate the thermal effects of ceramic
particulates on the evolution of microstructure during spray co-deposition of
metal matrix composites.
