This SGER is to investigate "to what degree it is feasible, given to the
constraints of a typical in-service teacher enhancement program, to teach high
school mathematics teachers to use a CCS [Classroom Communication System]
effectively and make their teaching become more learner-centered, assessment-
centered, and community-centered." The research is tied to the release of a new
generation of networkable calculators within the past few months and a unique
opportunity to work with teachers this summer who are being introduced to this
technology. The PIs are researching how readily teachers change their teaching
to incorporate some of the opportunities provided by this technology. Follow-up
visits to classrooms are included.
