This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a
software platform for intelligent library design in small molecule drug
discovery. High throughput chemistry and screening technologies combined with a
growing list of drug targets from genomics are flooding the drug discovery
process with data. Data mining methods are routinely applied to attempt to
extract valuable knowledge from these large data sets and build predictive
models. However, to maximize the perceptive power of these methods, the size of
a data set is secondary to its information content. This project will conduct
research towards the development of new algorithms for information-driven
library design that enable successful data mining and the rapid construction of
robust predictive models for activity. The commercial application of this
project will be in the area of drug discovery. Efficient library design and
subset selection are expected to maximize the potential of high throughput
methods for identifying promising drug candidates in the pharmaceutical
industry.
