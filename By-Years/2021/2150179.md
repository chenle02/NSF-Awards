The Mathematics Research in Charlotte REU site at the University of North
Carolina Charlotte is a three-year program where each summer ten undergraduate
students work for ten weeks with faculty mentors on research projects in topics
including financial mathematics, number theory, materials science, probability
theory, and statistics. Recruitment efforts focus on underrepresented groups in
STEM, and on students at institutions with limited research opportunities. The
objective of the program is to cultivate in the students an appreciation of
mathematics and its applications and to stimulate the students' interest in
pursuing careers in STEM more. The program fosters the overall professional
growth of the participants through presentations, training, and networking with
alumni and industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each summer the program
starts with an intensive start-up boot camp, which provides the participants
with the background needed to complete the research projects and includes
presentations on research ethics, best-practices, and how to communicate
research findings through presentations and in writing. Through engagement in
the project activities, the participants gain an appreciation for the
mathematical research process and for the close connection existing between
mathematics and other STEM disciplines. The site creates opportunities for the
participants to interact with scientists from industry and academia and to
disseminate their research results at professional conferences and by publishing
in peer-reviewed journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
