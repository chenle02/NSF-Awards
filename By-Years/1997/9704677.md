9704677 Freed If we can understand the time-dependent effect of an earthquake
on the seismic potential of the surrounding region, we will be able to look at
recetn events and predict regions and specific faults that are at an elevated
seismic risk. The goals of this project are (1) Use the Los Angeles basin blind-
thrust fault system as a case study in earthquake triggering; and (2) Determine
whether the southern San Andreas fault is in the midst of a failure stress
build-up resulting from the 1992 Landers quake. These goals will be achieved by
expanding the two-dimensional (2-D), time-dependent finite element code TECTON
to three-dimensions.
