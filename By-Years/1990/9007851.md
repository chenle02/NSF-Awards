Research in science is shifting from its traditional focus on the discovery of
new information toward the computationally intensive task of processing it. This
proposal aims at developing new algorithmic techniques to support the large-
scale computing requirements of high- performance applications. This project
will focus on incremental, parallel, and input/output (I/O) algorithms. For each
of these three computational models, several problems will be studied, with
particular emphasis on data structures, graphs, and computational geometry.
These problems include such key high-performance applications as sorting, FFT,
matrix operations, neural nets, caching, VLSI layout, robotics, network
optimization, computer-aided design, and graphics display. All three
computational models are motivated by the extreme demands placed by large-scale
applications, and thus it makes sense to consider hybrid computational models in
order to get even better performance. Examples include solving dynamic problems
in parallel and analyzing the I/O efficiency of parallel and incremental
algorithms. Finally, a new framework for incremental complexity and its relation
to sequential and parallel complexity will be studied.
