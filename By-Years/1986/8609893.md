Much design knowledge is expressed and communicated in graphical form, and yet
no practical method exists for automatically extracting this knowledge for use
within computer-aided design systems. In addition, no methods exist for
automatically comparing graphical designs for their similarities and
differences. A framework in which these two issues (graphical knowledge
extraction and comparison) can be addressed is created. One approach to
extraction of graphical knowledge is the creation of an expert system which can
employ not only facts and rules but can also reason about spatial patterns. The
theoretical framework for such a prototypical design tool will be created. Once
developed, this framework will be useful for all areas of design in which
knowledge is expressed graphically. The working system that will be created
under this grant will be a computer-aided architectural design (CAAD) system.
Once the framework for extracting graphical knowledge from a drawing exists, the
principal investigator will create an expert system for CAAD that will acquire
graphical knowledge from a design data base. From a large set of designs, the
expert system will make inferences about the characteristics of these designs.
