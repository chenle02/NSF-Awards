There has been significant interest in the industry and research community
regarding the ability to program the actions taken by network routers when they
process data packets. Such a capability (referred to as data plane programming)
can unleash exciting applications such as network performance diagnosis,
cyberattack detection, and fast training of machine learning algorithms.
Unfortunately, it is challenging for network architects to program data planes
naturally and efficiently. Existing approaches are too abstract, precluding
necessary optimization, or too low-level and burdensome to programmers. The
project’s novelty is a radically new approach for data plane programming, which
enables a network analyst to describe their network design and optimization
goals naturally, flexibly, and automatically. The project’s broader significance
and importance are simplifying data-plane programming, thereby benefiting the
networking and Information Technology (IT) industry, and training graduate and
undergraduate students in data plane programming and formal methods in
computing.

The project develops P4Sketch, a domain-specific, sketch-based language that
extends a representative data plane language Programming Protocol-independent
Packet Processors (P4). P4Sketch allows network architects to express their
high-level network-wide design ideas as a program sketch, describe their
customized, quantitative, and even indeterminate optimization targets, and
produce desirable and optimal P4 programs. The backend of P4Sketch is a domain-
specific synthesis algorithm which effectively handles external objects and
functions via model generation and the interplay between the model generator and
the code synthesizer. P4Sketch is also supported by a suite of tools for
testing, verification, debugging and optimization.
