9310535 KAGAN This project concerns the relationship between community status
and local environmental conditions. Significant evidence points to a
disproportionate impact of industrial environmental hazards on poor and minority
communities but little is known about the place of regulatory mandates and
administrative enforcement practices in the creation of such disparities. This
study will consider this question in the context of agency responses to air
pollution odor nuisance complaints, a regulatory arena subject to common law
reactive structures and a commitment to local norms and environmental diversity.
Detailed case studies derived from interviews of agency staff and administrative
records will be used in an analysis of the place of community and complainant
identity in the public nuisance enforcement policies of three air pollution
control agencies. Intra-agency comparison of complaint based enforcement within
demographically distinct communities will be combined with inter- agency
comparison of the handling of such disputes. The two tiers of this comparison
will allow distinctions to be made between the contributions to implementation
outcomes of, respectively, legal mandates and administrative choices. ***
