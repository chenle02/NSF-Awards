Galton This research is evaluating the viability of and will further develop a
novel technique for simultaneously performing the previously separate operations
of phase-tracking and A/D conversion. The technique gives rise to a family of
systems referred to as Sigma-Delta Frequency-to-Digital Converters (SDFDCs), and
offers the potential of significant reductions in analog circuit requirements
for a variety of applications. Each system uses coarse analog phase
measurements, quantization noise shaping, and decimation filtering to perform
instantaneous frequency-to-digital conversion. Because they operate on
instantaneous frequency in the manner that SD modulators operate on amplitude,
they share many of the benefits enjoyed by SD modulator-based A/D converters
such as reduced analog circuit requirements and amenability to VLSI
implementation. The research is developing rigorous theoretical results
supported by simulations with the goal of characterizing SDFDC performance. A
VLSI prototype targeted to a specific application will also be developed.
