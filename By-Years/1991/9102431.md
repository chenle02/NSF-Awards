This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of several items of modern
research equipment, including a DNA synthesizer, confocal microscope and a
computer workstation for molecular graphics applications. The group of
researchers who will benefit from the equipment have diverse research programs
in biochemistry and in developmental and cellular biology. These include studies
of gene structure and regulation, and the movement of organelles and cells
during development of both plants and animals. The equipment provided is typical
of advanced equipment developed during the last few years and now essential to
research in most areas of modern biology.
