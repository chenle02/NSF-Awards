9318848 Li The project consists on providing financial assistance for 5 leading
American specialists in the mechanics and technology of brittle matrix
composites for their participation at the next International Brittle Matrix
Composites (BMC) Symposium in Poland, September 13-15, 1994. The participation
of a representative group of American specialists will considerably enhance the
role of the Symposium BMC, and stimulate international cooperation. It will also
benefit the American research community in keeping abreast of European research
and development in ceramic and cementitious composites, and their manufacturing
and industrial applications. Research reports coming from the European community
(EC) joint projects such as those supported under the BRITE and EUREKA programs,
will be presented.
