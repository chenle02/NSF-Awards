The productivity of the oceans is limited by the availability of nutrients,
which has implications for the fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and
oceans. In a previous award the PIs found that previously unrecognized N2-fixing
unicellular cyanobacteria are active and abundant in oligotrophic oceans. This
finding has important implications for nitrogen cycling in the oceans and for
the role of "new" nitrogen in carbon fixation. The PIs will address three major
issues: First, there are at least two distinct groups of cyanobacteria that
appear to be separated in space and time, due to unknown ecological variables.
Second, the geographic distribution and factors controlling the distribution are
unknown, so it is not clear how these organisms should be included in
biogeochemical models. Finally, one of the groups of cyanobacteria appears to
fix N2 during the day, which revives the enigma of simultaneous nitrogen
fixation and photosynthesis that was previously limited to discussions of
Trichodesmium.
