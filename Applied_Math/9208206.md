To understand how large populations of neurons function, the investigator will
develop mathematical tools for describing and analyzing collective network
behavior. Models that account for the spatial and temporal structure of firing
patterns in large neural populations will be developed and studied. Population
behavior will be tied to and derived from the electrical and geometric
properties of individual neurons. Reduction methods will be used to streamline
the analysis while retaining varying degrees of detail. New developments in
cable theory will be used to explore the effects of dendritic structure and
synaptic placement on input integration. A newly developed reduction scheme for
conductance-based neuron models will allow the dynamics of ionic currents to be
included and reflected in spiking rates and patterns. Both firing-rate models
and models that explore the temporal structure of population firing will be
investigated. Almost all of the cognitive functions in the brain are performed
by large population of neurons working collectively. To understand how these
cognitive processes work requires developing techniques for describing and
analyzing the behavior of large neuronal populations. This project will use
mathematical and statistical methods to study the dynamics of large populations
of neurons, focusing in particular on the problem of extending knowledge about
the properties of single neurons and their synaptic connections to full neural
networks.
