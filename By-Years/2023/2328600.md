The CBMS Conference: Mathematical Methods for Novel Metamaterials will be held
at Auburn University in May 2024. The five-day conference will consist of a
series of lectures and intensive discussions between the lecturers and the
conference participants and also among the conference participants themselves.
The conference will (i) present the state-of-the-art mathematical research in
subwavelength metamaterials and the new development in material sciences for
graduate students, postdoc and junior researchers from Applied Mathematics,
Physics and Engineering; (ii) chart future directions and formulate open
problems in this field; (iii) establish new collaborations across the boundaries
of mathematics, physics and engineering.

The principal lecturer Professor Habib Ammari (ETH ZÃ¼rich), who is a world-
leading expert in wave propagation phenomena in complex media and mathematical
modeling in photonics and phononics, will deliver ten lectures and present a
coherent mathematical theory for metamaterials consisting of subwavelength
resonators in various settings and for time-modulated subwavelength
metamaterials. In addition, five supporting lectures will be given by five other
leading applied mathematicians and physicists in the field. The supporting
lectures are complementary to the principal lectures by focusing on the
following aspects of research in the field: (1) metamaterials and their
fascinating phenomena observed in the lab; (2) computational algorithms for
modeling the wave scattering in complex metamaterials; (3) pentamode
metamaterials; (4) mathematical theory for topological photonic materials; (5)
mathematical modeling for quantum optics in random media.
