This project will upgrade the teaching of basic botanical science in the
following courses: General Botany, Plant Ecology, Plant Physiology, and
Independent Research. The endeavor is contingent upon equipping an undergraduate
research laboratory where students can gather to plan research, carryout
research, and then analyze data. Nine laboratory exercises are planned around
the general theme of environment/plant-growth interaction. Three lighted
environmental growth chambers, two incubators, and two laminar flow hoods are
requested so students can grow plants, culture tissue, and germinate seeds under
controlled conditions. This collection of environmental control equipment will
challenge students to design simple experiments, identify and control important
variables, and then take meaningful measurements of photo-thesis. A drying oven
and a digital balance are required for tissue processing. A computer system is
requested for data analysis and dissemination of research results. As a result
of laboratory research using this equipment, hopefully more of our students will
pursue botany, agronomy, or forestry at the graduate level.
