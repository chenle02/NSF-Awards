9613802 Hynes In this project, quantum chemical electronic structure methods and
molecular dynamics computer simulations will be carried out to study the rates
and mechanisms of a number of reactions of chlorine and bromine species on the
surface of atmospherically relevant particles. These range from pure water ice
to more complex surfaces which include nitrate and/or sulfate ions.
Heterogeneous reactions involving chlorine and bromine have been strongly
implicated in the catalytic destruction of ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere
and in the Arctic troposphee. Specific examples include the one-step reaction of
chlorine nitrate with hydrochloric acid and the two- step version involving
chlorine nitrate hydrolysis forming hypochlorous acid which then reacts with
hydrochloric acid to form molecular chlorine. The bromine analogs of these
reactions as well as the mixed bromine/chlorine cases will also be considered.
This study will provide reaction mechanisms and reaction rates which are needed
as input for global chemistry and climate models. It is hypothesized that the
ice lattice plays an essential catalytic role in these reactions via proton
transfers. It is often difficult to determine experimentally whether a process
occurs in one or several steps, and whether reactions are ionic in character or
not.
