This research is an investigation of techniques for efficient and effective
testing of large sequential VLSI circuits. Two avenues are being pursued. First
is the development of self-initializing memory elements and test time reduction
techniques for circuits employing scan design. Second is development of new
functional test techniques for large sequential circuits. The approach is to
model large circuits as a network of finite state machines. From this model,
algorithms for test generation are being developed. The algorithms are being
optimized to provide good coverage for defects not modeled by stuck-at faults.
Software instantiations of the test algorithms are being built.
