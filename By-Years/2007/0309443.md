0309443&lt;br/&gt;Hole&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for the
12th international workshop of the Commission on Controlled-Source Seismology
(CCSS), a division of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of
the Earth's Interior (IASPEI). This will be the 35th anniversary of the first
workshop and the first workshop held in the USA for 23 years. These workshops
focus on technical aspects of reflection and refraction seismology as applied to
crustal and lithospheric targets. Reflection and refraction seismology are
essential components of almost every Continental Dynamics (CD) proposal and so
the subject matter of the workshop is very relevant to the CD program. The goal
of the workshop is the development and assessment of improved acquisition,
processing, modeling, inversion, integration, and interpretation procedures.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is particularly relevant to the goals of the
national EarthScope program, which will investigate the structure, composition,
and evolution of the continents at a vastly improved spatial resolution using
newly available instruments and facilities. Part of Phase I of EarthScope is the
USArray facility, which includes the purchase of at least 2000 seismographs
designed for reflection and refraction. The workshop will be small, &lt;60
people, and held in an isolated facility to encourage discussion and
interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
