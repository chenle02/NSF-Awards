This SBIR Phase II research investigates the scale up of a novel diode-pumped
solid-state laser suitable for materials processing. The advantage of this
pumping technique is that 2 micron Tm:YAG material can be used and that 1 micron
Nd:YAG lasers will be greatly improved. A highly efficient laser geometry is
used that operates independent of diode emission wavelength. The side-pumped
geometry will be applied to various laser materials and produce power at
wavelengths of both 1 and 2 microns.
