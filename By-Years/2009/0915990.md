Abstract ? Zhang/Wonka&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research investigates theory and
efficient algorithms for pattern design on surfaces. Patterns on surfaces appear
in many natural phenomena such as leaves, animal textures, and terrains as well
as man-made objects such as origami, glass ornaments, and facades. Patterns can
also be used to describe networks, such as street layouts, power grids,
aqueducts, and sensor networks. Pattern design has a wide range of applications
in art and entertainment, architecture, engineering, medicine, and city
planning. In addition, theory and techniques developed in the research can
benefit domains such as computational geometry and vector and tensor field
visualization.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;There are several fundamental challenges
when it comes to pattern design on surfaces. First, there is a lack of unified
mathematical formulations of patterns in terms of both symmetries and
orientations contained in the patterns. Consequently, the aforementioned
applications are typically addressed as being unrelated despite the intrinsic
links between them. Second, many past approaches to these problems lack
hierarchical control. This is required so that the user can design high level
information down to occasionally low level specifics and the layout algorithms
fill in the rest procedurally. In this research, the investigators explore a
unified framework that allows hierarchical design of patterns on surfaces. In
this framework, orientation and symmetry information is specified everywhere in
the domain through tensor field design. Next, the tensor field which contains
desired orientation and symmetry information is used to generate a complex which
can be a point set, a graph, a tiling, or any combination of them. Finally,
additional details are added onto the complex through texture and geometry
synthesis, or sub-patterns are added inside the cells of the complex. Ideas from
various mathematical domains such as dynamical systems, tensor calculus,
differential geometry, and algebraic topology are borrowed and applied in this
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
