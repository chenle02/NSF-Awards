This research is in algebraic K-theory. The principal investigator plans to
continue his research into cycles and K- theory on singular varieties and to
extend some recent work on the K-theory of fields to higher K groups of fields.
This research is in the general area of commutative algebra. In particular, it
concentrates on the area of algebraic geometry that involves K-theory. Recent
progress has made this area extremely exciting. One can expect results with
significance to the mathematical community.
