Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0113527&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Klewicki, University of
Utah&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to establish a repository of raw data
that are obtained from the NSF-funded Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental
Science Test (SLTEST) facility in Utah. The conceptual objective is to develop
software tools and data repositories so that the massive amount of data obtained
from SLTEST measurements can be managed and processed in an efficient manner,
and can be made available to the scientific community.
