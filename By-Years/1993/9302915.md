Lin 9302915 The PIs will analyze geophysical data and perform modelling on
Galapagos Hot Spot data to understand how hot spots interact with a spreading
center. This is an extension of the current work on modelling bathymetry and
gravity in the Galapagos. A 3-D modelling experiment will be performed to
explore the influences of viscosity variations, pressure gradients and buoyance
forces on plume entrainment and dispersion, temperature structure and melt
production. The model will be used to calculate excess crustal thickness, depth
anomalies, gravity anomalies and variations in the elastic plate thickness. The
overall goal is to better understand mantle dynamics of ridge-lume interactions.
