This award provides funds to the sociology department at University of
Missouri-Kansas City for an REU Site which offers students a research experience
in sociology during the summer. Students will be drawn primarily from junior
colleges, regional colleges that attract large numbers of minority students from
the Kansas City area, and from several small undergraduate colleges in the
region that have limited research opportunities for their students. The program
will provide research opportunities for nine students for ten weeks during the
summer of 1993. The program has two educational components: (1) The structured
component consists of daily instructional sessions, weekly colloquia, keeping a
research journal (log), and one outside invited researcher colloquia; (2) The
individualized component consists of four research groups composed of 2-3
students and one faculty member working on a common research project. The
emphasis of the research is on problem selection, approaches to literature
review, uses of secondary data sources, when appropriate, to address research
problems, processing and analyzing secondary data, collecting primary data when
appropriate, and organizing and writing up findings into
publishable/presentation form. Additional emphases within the program include
teaching team work, learning joint problem solving, utilizing time given
competing ends, and working within budgetary constraints. Students will work
alongside research faculty during the summer period and learn first-hand the
ways in which the research enterprise is conducted. This award contributes to
the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
science through active undergraduate research experiences.
