The relationships among the placental mammals are poorly understood at the
ordinal level. This study will employ enzymatic amplification (polymerase chain
reaction) and nucleotide sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase
subunit II gene in a number of eutherian orders. Specifically, the postulated
superorders Archonta (comprised of primates, tree shrews, bats, and flying
lemurs) and Glires (rodents, rabbits, and pikas) will be examined in detail. In
addition, this gene will be sequenced in potential sister taxa to some of these
orders, such as insectivores and elephant shrews. Interordinal variation will be
assessed for each group and hypotheses of relationship will be based upon the
identification of shared, derived characters (synapomorphies) using an armadillo
and pangolin as outgroup taxa. The results of this study should provide a strong
framework within which to interpret the radiation of a flying-gliding lifestyle
in eutherians and the unique cranial traits of rodents and rabbits.
