Glucocorticoid receptors transduce hormonal signalling information into specific
alterations in gene transcription. We have cloned the rat glucocorticoid
receptor coding sequences and characterized its functional domains. Here we
propose: (1) to clone genomic receptor sequences for wild type and mutant
receptor genes, characterizing the receptor promoter and its expression and
regulation, and attempting to relate receptor gene organization to its evolution
and function; (2) to pursue the mechanism of signal transduction, characterizing
in particular the DNA binding and nuclear localization activities of the
receptor, and selecting mutants in the overall process of transduction; and (3)
to produce and purify preparative amounts of intact receptor and receptor
fragments for biochemical and macromolecular structural analyses of the
receptor, receptor- hormone and receptor-DNA complexes. These studies will
broaden our understanding of the mechanisms of signal transduction and
transcriptional regulation.
