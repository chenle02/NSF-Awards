Hydrothermal precipitates formed from high-temperature fluids along seafloor-
spreading centers undergo a variety of reactions in seawater. At least two of
these reactions, scavenging and oxidative dissolution, have a significant
influence on the chemical composition of seawater. During the next two years,
the proposed research will consider hydrothermal precipitates as both sinks and
sources for trace metals in the ocean. The P.I.s propose to carry out a
detailed, quantitative study of the role and mechanisms where by hydrothermal
precipitates control the concentration of trace metals in seawater.
