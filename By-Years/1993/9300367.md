In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Wight of the University of Utah will measure the rates of solid-state
chain reactions in low temperature matrices in real time using FTIR
spectroscopy. Chlorine atom-hydrocarbon chain reactions involving ethylene or
methylcyclopropane will be initiated by laser photolysis and monitored as a
function of temperature and relative concentration of reagents. These reactions
are initiated by ultraviolet laser photolysis of thin solid films formed by
vapor deposition of the reagents at cryogenic temperatures (10-100 K). %%%
Kinetic studies of chain reactions in condensed, disordered environments are in
their infancy. The experiments conducted in this program will lead to a deeper
understanding of reactive processes of free radicals in environments that
severely restrict rotational and translational diffusion and will impact a wide
variety of technologies, including synthesis of polymers and advanced composite
materials.
