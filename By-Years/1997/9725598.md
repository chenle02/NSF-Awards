9725598 Humphreys This project is a collaborative, integrated study of the
Yellowstone hotspot and it's interaction with the continental lithosphere and
how it's processes effect active tectonism and volcanism. This study will
provide resolved images of the lithosphere-asthenosphere structure and the
deformation field (using seismic and GPS imaging and kinematic modelling) from
which a dynamic model of the asthnosphere-lithosphere interaction will be made
as well as understanding the relationship between the intraplate deformation of
the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain with the overall North American plate motion
dynamics. ***
