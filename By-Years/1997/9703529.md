w:\awards\awards96\num.doc 9703529 Maris Experimental research will be
performed to study nucleation processes in liquid helium. The first project is
an investigation of the nucleation of bubbles in helium liquid which is
subjected to a negative pressure. We plan to study how this nucleation process
is influenced by the presence of electrons and quantized vortices. The goal of
the second project is the detection of the nucleation of solid helium at
pressures above the normal freezing pressure of the liquid. The third experiment
is to look for the nucleation of bubbles at the interface between liquid helium
and a solid wall. As part of this last experiment, we will attempt to measure
the equation of state of liquid helium at negative pressure. %%% The way in
which bubbles form in liquids is important in many technologically important
applications. These include ink-jet printers, ship propellers, and liquid pumps.
Bubble formation can occur even in clean liquids but is often greatly influenced
by impurities or solid particles in the liquid. Studying bubbles in liquid
helium is worthwhile because the liquid can be made much purer than any other
liquid, and hence it is easier to perform experiments which are unaffected by
the influence of impurities. *****
