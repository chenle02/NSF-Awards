The PI proposes several research projects related to the local Langlands
correspondence, and in particular to the modular representation theory of
general linear groups over p-adic fields. One goal of these projects is to
address the question of extending the local Langlands correspondence to a
correspondence that works on the level of families of Galois representations.
This builds on previous work of the PI and Matthew Emerton that has had
applications to the Langlands program for global fields; in particular it plays
a role in Emerton's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture and is likely to be
important for generalizations of this result. A long term goal of the project is
essentially a "local theory of congruences" for automorphic representations of
general linear groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has its roots
in the Langlands program, a series of far-reaching conjectures that connect
topics in harmonic analysis and representation theory to long-standing problems
in number theory. The Langlands program is expect to shed light on questions in
theoretical physics, and also has implications for the theory of elliptic
curves. &lt;br/&gt;Advances in elliptic curves in particular could have
considerable practical applications in cryptography and coding theory.
