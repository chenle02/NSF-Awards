This award will help fund a computerized undergraduate laboratory in human
sensory processing. This laboratory will provide the tools for a wide range of
experiments in audition and vision that were not previously possible. It will
also provide a long lasting and versatile base for future experiments in the
skin senses and motor control. Twelve IBM/ATs have already been acquired through
a grant from IBM for an undergraduate computer laboratory. Funding of this
proposal will enable seven of these computers to be quipped with interfaces for
the generation and presentation of auditory and visual stimuli and the
collection of data. Each of the seven computers will have one combined digital-
to-analog and analog-to- digital converter, an amplifier and headphones, an
image frame store, display and software. The laboratory will train
undergraduates in modern computer laboratory skills, including programming, data
analysis and instrument control. Much of the recent progress in understanding
sensory processing has been made possible by computer technology. The students
will experience some of the excitement of these contemporary research issues in
sensation and perception. Student will have the opportunity to develop
individual research projects that address current issues in sensation and
perception. The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from
non-Federal sources.
