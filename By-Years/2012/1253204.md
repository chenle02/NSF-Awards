To date, the application of quantitative security and privacy metrics metrics
has seen its greatest successes when exploring the worst-case properties of a
system. That is, given a powerful adversary, to what extent does the system
preserve some relevant set of properties? While such analyses allow experts to
build systems that are resistant to strong attackers, many deployed systems were
not designed in this manner. In fact, there is growing evidence that users'
privacy is routinely compromised as a byproduct of using social, participatory,
and distributed applications. Given that people find inherent utility in using
systems that are not secure against worst-case adversaries, this project
investigates a complementary question: Can we help users better manage their
participation in systems that are not privacy-preserving in an absolute
sense?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a principled approach
that enables individuals to (i) quantitatively specify and assess their
security, privacy, and utility goals; (ii) qualitatively express preferences on
the relative importance of these goals; (iii) explore the implications of their
system interactions by leveraging the trade-off spaces resulting from these
quantitative and qualitative specifications; and (iv) enact locally-enforceable
changes to their system usage to better balance competing needs. This project is
designing computational tools that enable everyday users to better manage their
system participation by understanding the interplay between security, privacy,
and utility. Educational materials are being developed to support two
undergraduate courses---one for computer science majors and one for non-majors
---that explore the social, technical, and privacy implications of our
increasingly digitized society.
