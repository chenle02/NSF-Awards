9322390 Schwartz This research is concerned with the study of key areas of
mercury barium copper oxide superconductor related chemistry. Alternative routes
are developed for mercury barium copper oxide superconductor synthesis with an
emphasis on approaches that are relevant for bulk processing in particular, the
proposed approach emulates partial- melt processing while avoiding the hazards
and difficulties associated with hot liquid mercury. The results obtained will
indicate future directions in mercury barium copper oxide superconductor
processing and will form the basis for a subsequent peer-reviewed proposal to
the NSF under the Advanced Materials Process Program. ***
