Mayaguez Gustavo Lopez is supported by a Minority Research Initiation Research
Planning grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study
the behavior of clusters adsorbed on surfaces. Computer simulations will be used
to study the structural and thermodynamic properties of various clusters
adsorbed on model surfaces as a function of temperature and cluster size.
Examination of free energies as a function of cluster size will be used to
determine whether "magic number" clusters are to be expected. Characterization
of phase transitions will be investigated by looking for heat capacity
discontinuities as a function of temperature. Heterogeneous catalysis is a very
important industrial process which involves reactions of chemicals adsorbed on a
catalytic surface. A number of physical processes are involved such as sticking
probabilities, surface diffusion and mobility, interaction of the adsorbates
with the surface, etc. Computer simulations of clusters adsorbed on model
surfaces provide molecular level insight into processes which may have important
industrial catalytic significance.
