9408421 Meagher With support from the Sloan Foundation and Rutgers University,
the principal investigators are bringing together an impressive group of 45
evolutionary biologists at a workshop devoted to identifying the roles that can
be played by evolutionary biology in solving applied problems faced by society
today. Key areas to be discussed will be 1) environmental biotechnology and
bioremediation; 2) phenotypic expression in novel environments (including
genetically engineered organisms); 3) novel products and processes; and 4)
biodiversity and conservation. During the workshop, carefully designed sets of
questions will be tackled during facilitated break-out sessions. Responses will
be captured in a workshop report, which will be disseminated to a variety of
audiences including evolutionary biologists, industry representatives, policy
makers, and funding agencies. The two investigators have prior experience in
running workshops for scientists to discuss applied aspects of their research.
Facilities are well appointed and well organized. Current national attention to
environmental problems and challenges promises a ready audience for the
deliberations of this large group of evolutionary biologists.
