This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant is for research on
developing a commercially viable method for the conversion of sucrose, obtained
either from corn sugar or raw cane or beet sugar, into a usable chemical
feedstock. The objective is to build and test an electrochemical reactor for the
paired electrochemical synthesis of sorbitol and gluconic acid in aqueous
solutions from glucose (grain syrup) operated at ambient temperature and
pressure. Specific objectives of Phase I will be: (1) the design and fabrication
of a proton exchange membrane (PEM)- based single cell electrochemical reactor
that maximizes electrode surface area-to-reactant solution volume and that is
capable of operating at temperatures up to 100oC; (2) carrying out fundamental
investigations and evaluation of the performance of a single cell PEM-based
electrochemical reactor for the simultaneous transformation of glucose to
sorbitol and gluconic acid at the cathode and anode, respectively; and (3)
identification of techniques and the establishment of procedures for the
identification and quantification of organic compounds produced on
electrochemical treatment of glucose solutions in this manner. Various
cathode/anode materials will be tested to see if they are selective in forming
sorbitol and gluconic acid from glucose while at the same time lowering the
electrical energy needed to achieve fast reaction rates. The anticipated results
arising from the proposed technical approach are: (1) a clean technology for
deriving economic benefits from a variety of sugar compounds both hexoses and
pentoses (xylose to xylitol and xylonic acid); (2) a non-polluting, efficient
process, capable of paired electrochemical synthesis of sugar alcohols and
acids; and (3) an electrochemical process operating under mild conditions that
yields pharmaceutical-grade chemical feedstocks.
