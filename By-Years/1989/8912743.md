Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur around the globe.
Understanding of this phenomenon is a challenging problem because it is
necessary to understand both complex dynamic and microphysical processes at
scales of motion that are smaller than typically measured by conventional
weather networks. This scale of motion is termed storm-scale or mesoscale by
meteorologists. The National Science Council of Taiwan established a Multiple
Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological component focussed on improving
flash flood predictions. A major field project, entitled the Taiwan Area
Mesoscale Experiment (TAMEX), was held in the Spring of 1987. The project was a
joint effort of various Taiwanese agencies with participation from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation
(NSF). The scientific goals were to study the mesoscale systems that form on a
quasi-stationary and consistent feature known as the Mei-Yu front and cause the
heavy rains known as the "plum rains". Under a previous award from NSF the
Principal Investigator participated in the field phase of the TAMEX and began
analysis of the data. Preliminary results indicate that the mechanisms important
for the formation, intensification and maintenance of the Mei-Yu front may be
somewhat different than previously thought. Using aircraft, radar, surface and
upper air data, the Principal Investigator will continue his diagnostic studies
of the structure of the frontal systems and the severe rain events that they
spawn. //
