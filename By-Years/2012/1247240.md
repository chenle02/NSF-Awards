Processing 3D shape information (geometry) efficiently is crucial for many
domains: for example, computer-aided design, scientific computing, urban
planning and cultural heritage preservation. The amount of geometric data
generated and stored is rapidly increasing. The most common way to represent
geometric data is with unstructured meshes. Unstructured meshes enjoy many
attractive features, but inherently limit the efficiency and accuracy of many
algorithms for geometry processing and physical simulation, as well as
compactness of representations, compared to image processing algorithms. Mesh
parametrization is the fundamental geometric processing technique used both in
the context of converting surfaces to image-like representations, and for
mapping data to surfaces. While significant progress has been made in the
development of high-quality global parametrization algorithms a number of
important questions are unresolved, limiting the potentially broad applicability
of these techniques.

This exploratory project is developing mathematical and algorithmic bases for
controlling global parametrization quality as well as limiting the possible
amount of local distortion. The techniques being developed, based on the theory
of quasiconformal maps and efficient greedy optimization algorithms, will serve
as a foundation for future work on robust, high-quality and scalable global
parametrization.
