HRD 03-28403&lt;br/&gt;The Sloan Foundation's program, "Increasing Ph.D.s for
Underrepresented Minorities," has the goal of increasing the number of
underrepresented minority students (African American, Hispanic American, and
Native American) receiving Ph.D.s in mathematics, natural sciences, and
engineering. The program focus is on students who have enrolled in Ph.D.
programs, and, to a lesser degree, those who are undergraduate students or
master's degree candidates. &lt;br/&gt;
