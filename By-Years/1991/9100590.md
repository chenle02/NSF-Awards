This award supports two undergraduates working under the direction of the
principal investigator on problems in mathematical analysis and dynamical
systems. The work in analysis centers on geometric questions related to classes
of continuous functions. Specifically, the students will consider compositions
of continuous function and the structures one obtains by forming convex
combinations of the compositions. The work expands earlier investigations with
combinations of measure preserving transformations which occurs in the study of
Markov operators. Investigations into dynamical systems will focus on recently
developed ideas of pseudo-orbit shadowing. Shadowing measures the degree to
which an orbit can be traced by nearby orbits. The phenomenon is important
because dynamical systems with the shadowing property can be modeled on a
computer. Students will be encouraged to present the results of their work at
professional meetings.
