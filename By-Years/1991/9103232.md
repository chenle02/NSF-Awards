This project examines the biochemical mechanisms and molecular bases for the
ability of cyanobacterial cells (Nostoc commune) to retain functional and
structural integrity after repeated exposures to water stress, without involving
spore-formation. A recently isolated water-stress glycoprotein, "wsp", will be
the subject of more detailed characterization Ä±this will include
crystallographic analyses!, a protease specific for "wsp" will be purified and
characterized, and a transcriptional analysis of wsp formation will be
undertaken as part of this project's goals. //
