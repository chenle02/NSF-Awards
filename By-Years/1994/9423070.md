This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of New Mexico. The project involves testing hypotheses about
cooperative work in a small-scale society in Micronesia. The student hypotheses
that people will work more, give more reciprocal gifts, and attend to the
children of co-workers more in situations of cooperative labor when they require
the future cooperation of others Using quantitative and qualitative ethnographic
methods the student will measure the labor input of workers in fishing and
vegetable harvesting as well as various measures of yields and sharing to test
these hypotheses, which will be used to advance evolutionary theory about
hunter-gathers in small bands. This research is valuable because it will add to
the trained scientific manpower of the US in this important area of the world,
and will add to our basic knowledge of the causes and consequences of
cooperative work in small societies.
