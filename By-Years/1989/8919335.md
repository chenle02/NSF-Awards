Current studies of the effect of pretreatment conditions on the kinetics of
enzyme adsorption on, and hydrolysis of, lignocellulosic substrates will be
extended to include additional substrates and a wider range of enzyme
concentrations. The adsorption of cellulase enzymes on, and dilution from,
lignin will receive particular attention since it was shown in current work that
the adsorption capacity of the lignin can be reduced by pretreatment at high
temperature. It is proposed to study the changes in substrate particle size
distribution that results from pretreatment and during the subsequent enzymatic
hydrolysis. It is planned to combine these results with pore volume measurements
in order to estimate the total surface area that is available for enzyme
adsorption, an important parameter in the kinetics model. A quantitative model
of synergism will be developed in an effort to explain the unexpected discovery
in current work that the hydrolysis rate is proportional to the 0.67 power of
the enzyme adsorbed on the cellulose rather than a linear function.
