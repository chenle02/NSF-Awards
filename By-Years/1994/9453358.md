John Zhang is supported by a Presidential Faculty Fellow Award from the
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop new theoretical and
computational methodologies from first principles that will enable chemists to
understand and predict complex chemical reactions accurately and reliably. The
research will focus on two areas of interest including gas-phase reaction
dynamics and gas-surface reaction processes. The gas-phase work will seek to
develop practical computational methods for accurate and reliable quantum
dynamics calculations of polyatomic reactions with immediate applications to
diatom-diatom reactions of experiential interest. The primary methodology to be
employed is the time dependent wave packet approach. The gas-surface work will
also use the time dependent wave packet approach to explore reaction processes
on rigid solid surfaces which include corregation. Although the physical laws
that underlie chemistry have been elucidated since the discovery of quantum
mechanics over half a century ago, practical and useful applications of these
laws to solve real chemical problems still remains a remote possibility due to
the extreme difficulty of solving the complex quantum mechanical equations.
Despite the significant progress that has been made in electronic structure
theory, only the simplest chemical reaction systems are amenable to study by
first principle theoretical methods. Zhang has developed a number of
computational approaches which provide fundamental theoretical insights into the
chemical dynamics of simple reacting systems, and he is applying these
techniques to simple chemical reactions for which reliable experimental data
exists.
