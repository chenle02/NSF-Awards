This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research Equipment for the
Mathematical Sciences program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the
National Sciences Foundation. This program supports the purchase of special
purpose computing equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the
mathematical sciences. This equipment is required for several research projects
and would be difficult to justify for one project alone. Support from the
National Science Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions from
manufacturers and with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting
the proposal. This program is an example of academic, corporate, and government
cooperation in the support of the basic research in the mathematical sciences.
This equipment will be used to support five research projects in the Department
of Mathematics of Georgetown University: extremal problems for trigonometric
polynomials, directed by George Benke; phase boundaries in nonlinear
viscoelasticity, directed by Hans Engler; modelling, analysis and numerical
simulation in nonlinear structural dynamics, directed by John E. Lagnese;
numerical simulation of nonlinear mechanical control systems involving flexible
elements, Guenter Leugering; computation of exact scattering strength from a
random ocean surface at high wind speeds, directed by A. Paul Stokes.
