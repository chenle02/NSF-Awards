Localized optical-phonon modes are expected to occur in gallium (aluminum)
arsenide quantum-well structures and would be important due their strong
interaction with current-carrying electrons. They propose to examine their
unique dynamical properties. Long-term objectives are to study the effects of
interface roughness and dynamic electron screening as well as to explore the
possible generation of non-equilibrium phonon distributions. % % % This research
will have a direct impact on the design of new electronic devices of a type that
are already revolutionizing microelectronics technology in the areas of
semiconductor lasers and optical communications.
