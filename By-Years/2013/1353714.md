Under the supervision of Prof. Graham Jones of MIT, Ph.D. student Shreeharsh
Kelkar will study edX, a non-profit online learning enterprise jointly founded
by MIT and Harvard, focusing on three communities that have organized around
this infrastructure--programmers and computer scientists, educators, and
learning scientists--as they go about producing the infrastructure by coding
software, making online course-ware and analyzing online student activity.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a better
understanding of MOOCS (Massive Open Source Online Courses). University
administrators and faculty will be better informed as a result as they consider
deploying MOOCs to address curricula in US higher education.
