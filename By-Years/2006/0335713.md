ABSTRACT: EIA 0335713, Univ of Colorado, R. Schnabel,
PI&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant award provides partial support for
planning work toward the formation of a National Center for Women and
Information Technology. This work will result in a business plan for the center
including the center vision, goals, organizational structure, funding model,
etc., and preparation of proposals for large-scale funding (federal, industrial,
and individual) for launching and operating the center. The percentage of women
in information technology disciplines and occupations is relatively low as
compared with the number of women graduating from colleges. The proposed
national center is expected to bring existing research together, strengthen ties
between industry and academia, provide assessment tools and services and provide
comparative analysis of programs.&lt;br/&gt;
