Communication networks must support a diverse set of tasks while quickly
adapting to time-varying conditions. This project seeks to develop and
characterize fast and adaptive network control methods. The methods respect the
energy, computation, communication, and sensing resources of the network while
maintaining high quality execution of each task and providing fair sharing
across all users. The goal is to create smarter networks with faster response
times and lower delays while adapting to changes in user mobility and device
functionality. The research has broad applications to control theory, operations
research, smart grid scheduling, economics, and game theory. This project will
also train several graduate students on these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
work is challenging because of time variation, mobility, and asynchronous start
and stop times of each task. The fundamental optimization problems involve
nonconvex ratios of time averages that have not been significantly explored. The
optimal convergence times are unknown. Preliminary work of the principal
investigator develops a new method for improving convergence time of
subgradient-based convex programming. This project seeks to extend this method
and to develop new methods for solving the more difficult problems of task-
oriented stochastic networking. Another component of this work is the
development of fundamental lower bounds on convergence times in this context.
This can have a high impact on broader areas of optimization, stochastic
control, online decision making, and machine learning.
