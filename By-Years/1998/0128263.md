This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop novel
trimetallic nitride template endohedral fullerene (TNTs) materials for use as
contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TNTs, which offer
significant diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, are now available in
sufficient research quantities. Chemical functionalization reactions to
solubilize the TNTs are also now available. TNTs offer an exciting alternative
to current MRI contrast agents. TNTs offer the flexibility of excapsulating a
variety of paramagnetic metals into the C80 fullerene cage. As several of the
metals are paramagnetic, a production optimization plan balancing cost of
materials versus efficiency as an MRI contrast agent is a primary focus of this
project. The development of TNT based contrast agents is expected to lead to
smaller patient doses, increased T1 relaxation rates and increased product
safety.

The commercial application of this project is in the contrast agent segment of
the MRI imaging market. If successful, this project could result in a
significant expansion in MRI capability and usage, with the potential of
developing new business on the order of $700 million per year.
