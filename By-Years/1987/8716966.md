Diatoms are microscopic, single celled plants that are responsible for much of
the biological productivity in the ocean.Their absolute requirement for silica
makes them unique among the phytoplankton and the interaction of light and
silica in regulating the cell division (or growth) of these plants will be
addressed in this research. Dr. Chisholm and a post doctoral researcher will
collaborate with Dr. Olson from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to examine
several questions regarding the exact nature and number of block points in the
diatom cell division cycle that are controlled by light and silica availability.
The specific strategies for dealing with these limitations will be studied using
cell cytometry in a highly integrated cell biological approach to marine
biology.
