The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to research two specific topic areas;
Bivalent Antibody - Multivalent Antigen Interactions; and, Structure and
Dynamics of beta-Amyloid Protein Aggregation. For the first topic area,
experimental results will be used to construct a comprehensive numerical
simulation of the complex interactions between antibody and cell-surface
antigen. This quantitative analysis should be useful in developing antibody-
based diagnostic assays or antigen-targeted therapeutic agents, and in analyzing
other receptor-ligand systems. For the second topic area, aggregation of beta-
amyloid protein into fibrils and subsequent deposition in the brain is believed
to initiate processes leading to abnormalities characteristic of Alzheimer's
disease. Techniques developed to carry out this topic area may lead to a better
understanding of how beta-amyloid protein aggregation contributes to
neurodegenerative processes, and to the development of new methods to
investigate protein aggregation.
