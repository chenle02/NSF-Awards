The computer equipment requested in this proposal will form the core of a new
undergraduate curriculum branch in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at
Eastern Washington University's Department of Geography. The new GIS laboratory
will allow both the development of new undergraduate courses in spatial analysis
techniques and the updating of existing courses. Students will benefit from the
diversity of comprehensive training.The equipment will also contribute to our
undergraduate curriculum by providing the technical backcloth for studying the
uses and misuses of GIS in the economic, political, scientific, and social
environments in which it is applied.
