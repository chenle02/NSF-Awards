Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include a study of low
energy flavor-violating decays of the K and B mesons in the context of
supersymmetric grand unified theories, and a calculation of the production and
decay of heavy right-handed neutrinos in the explosive reheating which follows
inflation. The experimental observation and theoretical understanding of rare
flavor- violating processes provide an important low energy window into very
high energy physics, and such studies constitute a prominent component of the
present endeavor in particle physics. The production of particles during the
reheating process following the exponential expansion and cooling of the
universe during inflation is decisive in determining the structure of our
observable universe. The processing of heavy right-handed neutrinos subsequent
to inflation may generate the presently observed asymmetry between matter and
antimatter.
