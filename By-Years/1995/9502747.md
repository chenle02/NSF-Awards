The classical theory of NP-completeness shows that many optimization problems
of practical interest are hard to solve: i.e., NP-hard problems that have no
polynomial-time algorithms (assuming P is not equal to NP). A popular method for
dealing with such an NP-complete problem is to try to compute approximate
solutions: i.e., solutions whose cost is within some multiplicative factor of
the cost of the exact solution. The focus of this project is to demonstrate that
computing approximate solutions for NP-hard problems is no easier than computing
exact solutions. The underlying idea which is exploited, is that of a new
probabilistic definition of the NP complexity class, a definition based on
probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP's). Some of the major goals of the
project include: (1) To better understand the approximability of NP-hard
optimization problems (including cataloging the hardness of approximation of
many problems, improving existing results about the hardness of approximation,
and understanding the limitation of these techniques); (2) To develop further
connections between the theory of PCP's and cryptography; (3) To improve
existing ways of representing data by error-correcting codes; (4) To simplify
the techniques used in the proof of this new definition of NP. The Educational
Component of this CAREER Grant includes: (a) Development of CORE undergraduate
computer science courses (including Theory of Computation and Applied Discrete
Mathematics); (b) Development of a graduate computer science course and a
corresponding text dealing with PCP's and (approximate) complexity theory.
