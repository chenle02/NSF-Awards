Santa Clara University requests support from NSF for connection of its campus
network to BARRnet. BARRnet is the midlevel network located in the Bay Area of
California. It will provide operations management and information services and
it will give Santa Clara University a medium speed connection (56,000 bits per
second) to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National
Backbone network. The University needs greater functionality and network speed
to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along
with being able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty
research will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the
school to explore innovative educational resources.
