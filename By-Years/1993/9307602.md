This project investigates SINC methods for ODES. The following tasks are
undertaken; (1) develop a SINC ODE-IVP (sequential and/or parallel) program
package for solving ordinary differential equation initial value problems, (2)
develop a (sequential and/or parallel) program package to evaluate
multidimensional convolution integrals, (3) write a program package which uses
the Maple program to reduce a differential or integral equation to a system of
algebraic equations, based on SINC derivative and/or SINC convolution
collocation, (4) write program packages, based on SINC derivative and/or SINC
convolution collocation, to solve problems which are important for ongoing
research at the University of Utah (the forward problem Maxwell equations, with
variable permeability and permittivity, but with conductivity; the solution,
based on SINC convolution collocation, of the integral equation formulation of a
scalar conservation law problem in two and three dimensions), and (5) comparison
studies of complexity and stability of SINC and classical methods, especially in
areas in which one can expect SINC methods to have advantages over methods, such
as for problems with singularities, problems over unbounded regions, boundary
layer problems, stiff problems, and intensive problems such as the solution of
the above cited equations.
