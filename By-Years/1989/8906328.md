Qualitative reasoning is a fairly well established field in the domain of
artificial intelligence, qualitative reasoning, qualitative process theory and
qualitative simulation, however, it has not considered parameters over a range
of values (interval). This research considers the use of qualitative reasoning
in manufacturing process diagnostics for quality control purposes. A framework
which uses: (1) envisioning process, (2) confluences and (3) interval
mathematics, will be investigated. The approach is illustrated through a real
life manufacturing process. This scheme, when generalized will result: (1) in a
theory for implementing qualitative reasoning in manufacturing process
diagnostics and (2) in a computer shell that can be used for any continuous
manufacturing process diagnostics and control.
