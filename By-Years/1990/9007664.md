An international conference is proposed on "Multicellular Behavior of Bacterial:
In Nature, Industry and the Laboratory" to be held at Woods Hole Marine
Biological Laboratory. October 21- 25, 1990. The objective of the conference is
to examine the importance of bacterial multicellularity in a wide range of
situations, including environmental biofilms, mats and colonies, bioreactors,
bacterial pathogenesis and bacterial development on laboratory media. This is
the first conference devoted specially to consideration of bacteria as
multicellular organisms. The meeting has been organized to stimulate interaction
between scientists who study bacterial multicellularity from different
perspectives, such as fermentation and bioreactor engineers, molecular
biologists interested in signal transduction, microbial ecologists, medical
microbiologists, etc. It is expected that new insights will emerge into the
roles of cell-cell communication and multicellular organization in bacterial
activity, thereby helping to generate new concepts and research strategies
relevant to a wide range of disciplines. Areas where the ideas generated at the
meeting may be applied in practice include biofouling, bioreactor design,
biodeterioration and corrosion.
