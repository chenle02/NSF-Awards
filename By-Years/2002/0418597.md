This research will investigate whether the nature and fairness of court
procedures matter to families who are in child custody litigation. Variation in
the quality of judicial decision-making will be examined to determine whether it
affects the adjustment of families after child custody litigation. While the
earlier research explored the link between parents' subjective experience of
procedural and distributive justice and family outcomes, the current goal is to
objectively assess the quality of judicial decision-making in child-custody
litigation and to investigate its impact on family outcomes. To accomplish this,
the transcripts of study participants' court hearings/trials will be obtained
and their contents analyzed and linked to the already existing outcome data. The
intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in its potential to establish a
first, direct link between objective ratings of judicial decision-making,
perceptions of procedural and distributive justice variables, and family
adjustment. Findings that families are influenced in their adjustment by the
actual quality of judicial decision-making could have far-reaching implications
for the work of research psychologists and that of health and legal
professionals.
