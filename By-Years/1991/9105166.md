During the past two years, the PI's NSF grant has made it possible to generate
a new collection of computer graphics programs for the geometry of smooth and
polyhedral submanifolds in euclidean 3- and 4-space. This ongoing work has been
the result of collaborations with undergraduate and graduate students. It has
been applied in the proposer's research on the geometry of piecewise circular
curves and on highly symmetric combinatorial structures on the complex
projective plane. Preliminary versions of this research program have been used
to provide the illustrations for proposer's Scientific American Library book and
several articles, as well as the images used for Mathematics Awareness Week. The
P.I. and his assistants intend to continue the development of this system, and
to apply it to extensions of the problems, as well as other problems in the
geometry of submanifolds. The work of the P.I. has interest to the mathematical
Sciences community at large, as well as to mathematics educators.
