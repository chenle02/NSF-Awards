This SBIR Phase II project intends to bring transparency and efficiency to the
recruiting industry through a dynamic sourcing and analytics platform.
Currently, it is exceedingly difficult to identify ideal candidates when
recruiting for a position requiring exact criteria. The proposed platform will
enable recruiters to rapidly identify optimal candidates and understand where
these candidates are geographically concentrated, working, and being educated.
This data-driven transparency will improve recruiter/hiring manager interactions
and allow for positions to be filled more rapidly, with less productivity lost
by employee turnover. The platform will highlight the most qualified candidates
for a position, regardless of preconceived bias, to help uncover overlooked
candidates. These efficiencies will benefit recruiters, hiring companies,
individual candidates, universities, and society. Given the size of the industry
($160 billion) and the scale of inefficiencies, the project has vast commercial
impact potential.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase II research and
development will be primarily focused around machine learning techniques,
leveraged alongside a powerful computing framework, and applied to a substantial
dataset containing billions of data points. This technology will be used to
drive real-time dynamic analysis resulting in powerful recruiting analytics and
ideal job candidates via interactive dashboards. Phase II will build upon the
progress achieved in Phase I in the areas of machine-learning classification
systems, parallel computing environments to process large quantities of data in
real-time, and user-friendly visualizations. The goals of Phase II include
increasing the processing power of the data architecture, modeling imputed
attributes, improving the accuracy of modeling algorithms, and increasing
overall interface performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
