gThe major goal of the research is to understand the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the formation of new species of microorganisms. The research
will target a single gene known to separate two closely related naturally
occurring species of yeast in the genus Pichia. The two species live in two
different cactus types that have major differences in their host chemistry.
Toxic natural products in one cactus type deter the growth of one species while
allowing growth of the other. Identifying and isolating the gene(s) responsible
for this difference is the specific goal of the research. A molecular genetic
knockout library recently created for baker's yeast will be used to identify the
candidate genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the nature of the
fundamental process involved in the formation of new species. It could provide
us with 1) the detailed molecular mechanism responsible for adaptation to novel
chemicals in natural plants and 2) the reasons for increased genetic and
biological diversity in microorganisms. An important aspect of the work is the
use of modern genomic information from the widely studied baker's yeasts to
learn about the origin of new species in natural systems. &lt;br/&gt;
