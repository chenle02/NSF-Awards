This Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) project is located at the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre in England. This award from the Division of
Chemistry, Office of Special Projects will provide approximately 25 percent of
the support for access to this database by U.S. scientists from the academic,
government, and not-for-profit research communities. This contribution will be
transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as the Foundation becomes
a co-supporter of the CSD. The U.S. has over 1600 crystallographers who are
potential users of this database. The CSD contains the most comprehensive
collection of evaluated crystallographic data in the world. Data for about
80,000 organic and organometallic crystal structures were included in the CSD as
of January, 1991. Atomic coordinates, chemical connectivity tables,
bibliographic data fields including reference sources for the data, and
coordinates for chemical structure diagrams for each molecule are part of the
system. Software for search, retrieval, and analysis of the data will be
supplied as well as any improvements and updates of the software. About 8000 new
crystal structures will be added to the data base yearly. Thus this
international resource will remain accessible to crystallographic community and
other users in the U.S. through the joint support of NSF and NIH.
