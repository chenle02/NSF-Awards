The ionosphere has recently been recognized as an important source of
magnetospheric plasma and may during active times be as important as the solar
wind. On the day side at high latitudes plasma is accelerated away from the
Earth in ion upwelling events called the "cleft ion fountain". This grant is to
study the ion heating mechanisms and ion transport dynamics of the cleft ion
fountain using a generalized fluid model, with the microscopic effects of plasma
microprocesses built in. The generalized fluid model contains higher moments,
such as, temperature anisotropies and heat flows of multispecies plasma, and is
therefore particularly will suited for calculations of parting heating and
acceleration produced by kinetic instabilities.
