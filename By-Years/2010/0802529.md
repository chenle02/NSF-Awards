Johnson County Community College, Kansas City Kansas Community College, and
Metropolitan Community College are working in partnership to create the Bi-State
Bioscience Consortium for Curriculum and Faculty Development. The consortium of
three colleges seeks to prototype a model for a "virtual" community college that
satisfies employer needs for job candidates with relevant hands-on skills and
student needs for a coherent course of study from a multi-institutional menu.
The project is strengthening the hands-on science content of general education
technical math and writing courses, revising a foundation bioscience laboratory
skills and safety course, and fostering new relationships across institutional
boundaries that support course design and faculty development. Ultimately, the
project is preparing community college students for jobs in Greater Kansas
City's burgeoning bioscience sector.
