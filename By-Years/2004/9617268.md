This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award in
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(MPS/OMA) supports research by Professor Richard D. Ernst of the Department of
Chemistry of the University of Utah to investigate the catalytic properties of
pentadienyl and cyclopentadienyl compounds of titanium and zirconium.
Fundamental chemical structures, such as agostic interactions, which may lead to
selective C-C bond formation and cleavage, will be studied. Edged bridged
pentadienyl complexes, which will be prepared, are seen as precursors for metal
film depositions, material syntheses and complexes with the metals in higher
oxidation states. Studies will also be done on the configurational stability of
chiral complexes. Complexes with cyclopentadienyl and edge-bridged pentadienyl
ligands will be investigated in collaboration with the Dow Chemical Co. as
catalysts for olefin polymerization. Under the GOALI program this
academic/industrial collaboration will provide graduate students with experience
in moving new catalysts they have developed into an industrial trial.
Organometallic complexes of titanium and zirconium will be investigated as
catalysts, coupling reagents and materials precursors. Complexes with
cyclopentadienyl and edge-bridged pentadienyl ligands will be investigated in
collaboration with the Dow Chemical Co. as catalysts for lengthening hydrocarbon
chains. As part of its committment under the GOALI program, Dow will provide
materials, facilities, and personnel to adapt the process to industrial reactor
conditions. Dow will also cover travel costs for Dr. Ernst and his students
involved in the project as well as stipend expenses for the visiting graduate
students.
