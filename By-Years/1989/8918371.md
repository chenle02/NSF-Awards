The first objective of the proposed research is to quantify the relationship
between structural design and functional performance of the respiratory system.
The PI's testing a hypothesis of economic design of biological systems. He will
use an integrated systems approach, considering: all levels of transport of
oxygen from the environment to the target organelles, the mitochondria; and the
steps in transport of fuel from the capillaries to the mitochondria. This should
help to define the factors that limit muscular work, and to determine those
steps in the transport of oxygen and fuel, if any, where there is a built-in
redundancy or safety factor. These studies should also make it possible to draw
conclusions: about the importance of genetic determination of design at the
organelle, cell, organ and system level; and about the potential for functional
and structural adjustment in response to training or damage from injury or
disease. The second objective is to test the hypothesis that desert animals
possess special adaptations for dramatically reducing their food requirements
when they are faced with prolonged shortages of food during droughts. Metabolic
rate is affected by dietary energy intake in all mammals, including humans. It
seems likely the dramatic changes proposed for desert animals will be simply an
"exaggerated" response of general physiological mechanisms. Thus, our studies
may provide important new insights into this response and its modulation in
humans.
