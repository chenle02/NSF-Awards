The goal of this S-STEM project by Columbia University Engineering is to prepare
a cohort of engineers to meet the current environmental and societal challenges
by preparing the students in the areas of water, energy and infrastructure. The
project is building on education reform at the undergraduate and doctoral levels
and targets reform at the Masters level. By using a research-based Masters
degree, scholars will be supported to bridge the period from undergraduate
studies into the doctoral program. The program is emphasizing the recruitment of
underrepresented populations and will award 10 scholarships every year. The
scholarship recipients will also receive a full tuition waiver from Columbia
Engineering and a stipend from their faculty research advisor. Support
structures for the students include mentoring, cohort building and leadership
development. The work is focusing on the recruitment and retention of a diverse
group of graduate students and facilitates their integration into research
centers to promote connections between students, teaching experiences,
leadership and other research-based training.
