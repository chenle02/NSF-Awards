9624306 Gido An integrated career development plan is proposed which includes
strong components in both research and education. The major components of this
plan are: (1) to build a research group of graduate students; (2) to assemble
laboratory facilities and equipment; (3) to develop a nationally and
internationally recognized research program; (4) to develop educational programs
in graduate research training as well as class work for graduate and
undergraduate students. The research component of this career development plan
is interdisciplinary in the sense that the system of study is natural or
biological in origin, but the aspects of this system that are of primary
interest fall into the realm of polymer science and materials science. It is
proposed to investigate natural silk spinning processes in silk worms and
spiders so that these incredibly efficient processes may to be used as models
for aqueous processing of genetically engineered biopolymers. The techniques
employed in this research will be mainly electron microscopy, electron
diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron energy
loss image filtering (Gatan Imaging Filter) on cryogenically prepared samples.
Using these techniques, structure will be corrolated with protein concentration
in the aqueous silk solution and the concentration of various salts which are
naturally present in the silk gland, and are thought to influence chain
conformation and phase behavior. %%% The educational component of this CAREER
grant involves outreach to high-school students and teachers, summer programs,
and field trips. Results from this research will be incorporated into classroom
teaching in order to illustrate general principles of polymer morphology,
crystallography, electron microscopy, etc. The techniques discussed in classes
are general techniques of polymer science and materials science. ***
