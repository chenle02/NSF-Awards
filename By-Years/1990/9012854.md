Anti-reflection layers at the lens boundaries will be implemented to greatly
reduce the Fresnel reflection, to develop a new structure for the lens
waveguides to obtain optimal mode match, and to use GaAlAs for the host guiding
layer to make the lens transparent to a wavelength as short as .75um. The
through-put efficiency is expected to increase to 95%, making the new lens ready
for actual applications. Three applications will also be performed, including an
imaging relay lens, a collimating- transform lens pair and a micro-lens array.
The realization of these lenses would allow integrated optical devices to
progress further for actual applications. It would also cultivate new devices
concepts and applications, which in turn will improve future signal processing
and communications systems.
