Molecular and Functional Analysis of the Acid-Sensing Ion Channels Candice C.
Askwith

Ion channels produce electrical signals that are critical for the transmission,
reception, and integration of information in the nervous system. Ligand-gated
ion channels open in response to specific chemicals or neurotransmitters and are
especially well adapted for fast chemical-mediated synaptic transmission. The
acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) comprise a family of ligand-gated channels
which are activated by acidic changes in extracellular pH. These channels
generate voltage insensitive cation currents in many neurons. Mice with
disruptions in ASICs have alterations in sensory transduction and deficits in
behaviors linked to proper learning and memory. These results suggest that ASIC
activity and pH fluctuations play an important role throughout the nervous
system. ASICs are members of the DEG/ENaC family of ion channels and each ASIC
subunit has two transmembrane domains separated by a large extracellular
cysteine-rich region. Individual ASIC subunits associate to form functional
channels with distinct biophysical characteristics. The protein domains which
determine ASIC characteristics, however, remain largely unknown. The goal of
this proposal is to identify the structural and functional determinants of three
properties which likely impact ASICs contribution to neuronal signaling:
activation, desensitization and neuropeptide modulation. This proposal will use
simple expression systems and powerful molecular and electrophysiological
methods to characterize the specific protein domains involved in these three
properties. The experiments in this proposal are designed to integrate research
with a program of teaching and training undergraduate and graduate students. The
results from these studies will expand the knowledge of the large extracellular
region in DEG/ENaC channels and may eventually aid in the generation of
pharmaceuticals targeting ASICs.
