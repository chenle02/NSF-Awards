Term rewriting systems form an important computational paradigm in programming
languages, abstract data type specification and verification, automated
deduction and computer algebra. The theory of rewriting has developed rapidly,
and new application areas are being explored. However, not much is known about
the computational aspects of rewrite operations. In this proposal the basic
operations in rewriting, and the means to design and analyze efficient
algorithms for them, will be studied. Practical algorithms will be designed on
both sequential and parallel machines. Algorithms, which learn efficiently from
their history, will be designed for important and useful classes of rewrite
systems. Several facets of the matching problem will be studied from a novel
perspective. The practical performance of the designed algorithms will also be
investigated. This investigation will be useful in improving the efficiency of
rewrite-based systems as well as provide understanding of the inherent
complexities and limitations of the rewrite approach.
