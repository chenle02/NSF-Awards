This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will result in
transparent, conductive organic polymer antennas that have the potential to
revolutionize wireless communications. Recent advances in material science have
allowed for conductive organic polymers that can enable transparent polymer
structures on a variety of substrates. The principal technical activities of the
project involve: i.) Developing chemical formulations and fabrication techniques
to use commercial materials printers to inkjet print antennas out of flexible
and transparent conductive organic polymers and ii.) Measuring the radiation
efficiency, gain, and data transfer performance of the new antennas on a variety
of conformal antenna structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project include the significant commercial
potential of having antennas that are optically transparent and fabricated using
additive inkjet processing techniques. Antennas can be printed on transparent
stickers and adhered to different surfaces. Antennas that previously occupied
valuable circuit board space on mobile devices, could be printed conformally on
the surface of the device, allowing them to be miniaturized. The fabrication
technique described in this proposal is also eco-friendly, making use of an all-
additive processing technique that does not involve environmentally wasteful
mechanical or chemical etching of metal structures.
