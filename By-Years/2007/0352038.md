Workshop Proposal: Probability and Materials - links from Nano- to Macro-Scale
Workshop Chair: Lori Graham-Brady

Progress in understanding uncertainties in material behavior at the full range
from nano- to macro-scale, as well as the development of appropriate links
between randomness at different scales, will require contributions from various
disciplines, including materials science, applied mechanics and mathematics, and
civil and mechanical engineering. Furthermore, connections between experimental,
computational and analytical researchers will be a key component to developing
an understanding of the relationships between probability and material behavior.
This proposal outlines a 3-day invitation-only workshop entitled "Probability
and Materials: from Nano- to Macro-scale", which is to take place at Johns
Hopkins University in June 2004. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum
for researchers across multiple disciplines to discuss the state of the art and
to define critical future directions in the study of material randomness.
Approximately 30-35 speakers are expected to participate in the workshop, on
research related to one of three major topics: Data Gathering and Management,
Temporal and Spatial Randomness of Materials, and Multi-Scale Modeling.
