9720147 BAIRNSFATHER This award provides funding for computer networking
equipment that will establish a "backbone" of T3 ATM service (upgradable to OC3)
to connect 11 institutions in 5 major cities throughout the state of Louisiana.
It builds on and upgrades an existing network in Louisiana and will connect the
state to a multi-state network through Louisiana State University's
participation in the South East Partnership to Share Computational Resources
(SEPSCoR). It will also position Louisiana for submission of a strongly
competitive proposal to NSF's program for connections to the Next Generation
Internet. Additional support is provided for the salary and benefits of a
network manager (to be recruited). The funds provided by this award are only a
small portion of the total projected costs of the project; strong commitment to
developing the network is evidenced by major (ca. 90%) non-federal cost sharing
from the state and industry. The network will make available high performance
computing capabilities necessary for scientists conducting research in a broad
variety of disciplines and encompassing both basic and applied research.
