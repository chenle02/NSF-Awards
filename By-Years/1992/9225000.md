9225000 Serrin Work supported by this award will be done in three principal
directions: the study of radial solutions of nonlinear elliptic equations; the
asymptotic behavior and stability of nonlinear holonomic oscillators and the
relation of Newtonian mechanics to invariance principles. In the first
direction, emphasis will be placed on establishing existence or nonexistence of
ground states, especially when the governing nonlinearities have algebraic
growth both in the solution variable and its gradient. A ground state is a non-
negative solution (not trivial) which tends to zero off compact sets. Work on
holonomic oscillators, which arise particularly in Lagrangian mechanics,
concerns the stabilizing effect of various damping modes and nonautonomous
restoring forces. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of
intermittently applying damping mechanisms, specifically, to determine necessary
and sufficient conditions under which such damping causes transient effects to
decay. Finally, the derivation of equations of motion from invariance principles
continues earlier work of the same nature. It is expected that extensions to
chemical mixtures and micropolar materials will be carried out. These are cases
not well understood. Partial differential equations form a basis for
mathematical modeling of the physical world. The role of mathematical analysis
is not so much to create the equations as it is to provide qualitative and
quantitative information about the solutions. This may include answers to
questions about uniqueness, smoothness and growth. In addition, analysis often
develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of
these approximations. ***
