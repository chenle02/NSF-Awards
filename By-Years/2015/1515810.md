Modern approaches to data analysis often involve network structures. For
example, the spread of an epidemic in a specific population can be described
using a contact network representing the nature and strength of interpersonal
interactions among individuals. Historically, these models were intractable due
to the complexity of individual behavior and, therefore, many early disease
models utilized simplified representations involving population averages and
statistics. By differentiating individuals, network models carry a large amount
of additional information that has become more accessible thanks to increasingly
powerful computer processors and the advent of fast computational algorithms.
This project develops new mathematical theories and computational algorithms to
capture the essential features of networks and applies them to models in
epidemiology. Results from this project will allow researchers to identify a
number of valuable patterns in the data, including the subpopulations at highest
risk, vulnerable transmission pathways, and effective mitigation strategies.

The investigator and his colleagues study the mathematical concept of p-modulus
on networks, focusing on the analysis of theoretical properties, the development
of numerical algorithms, and the study of applications to the spread of diseases
in contact networks. This is an interdisciplinary project intended to enhance
both the theoretical understanding of the ways in which diseases spread in an
interconnected network of individuals or sub-populations, and the computational
tools available to researchers interested in modeling, simulating, and
predicting the behavior of epidemics. The theory of p-modulus was originally
developed in the field of complex analysis and has a connection to the concept
of effective resistance in the context of electrical networks. The p-modulus
provides a method for quantifying the richness of a family of walks: families of
many short walks have a larger modulus than families of few long ones.
Therefore, the flexibility of p-modulus provides a means for extracting fine
structure characteristics of linked data.
