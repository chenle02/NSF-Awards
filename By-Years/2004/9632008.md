Spall 9632008 A dual-processor Silicon Graphics Power Challenge L deskside
server will be purchased to provide supercomputing capabilities for the
Department of Mechanical EngineeringOs Computational Mechanics Laboratory. Each
of the R8000 processors is capable of 300 MFlops peak performance. The server
will be configured with 512 MB RAM and 13 GB disk space. The Large Scale Flow
Separation with Applications in the design of air-cooled aircraft engines. This
project is related to an existing research arrangement between the University of
South Alabama and local industry, the purpose of which is to increase our
knowledge of the fluid flow about and heat transfer about finned cylinders. The
results may then be used to improve the design of cylinder barrels and cylinder
heads for air-cooled aircraft engines. Numerical studies of the evolution of a
turbulent wing-tip vortex and vortex breakdown. This project is related to the
principal investigatorOs work with NASA to further our understanding of the
effects of turbulence on vortex breakdown. Unsteady mixed convection in
horizontal ducts with applications in chemical vapor deposition processes. In
this NASA sponsored work, the experimentally observed process of spanwise
symmetry breaking about the duct mid-plane will be investigated in an effort to
provide a means of improved deposition uniformity within horizontal chemical
vapor deposition reactors. The computational facility will also improve the
College of EngineeringOs ability to fulfill its support for graduate level
education and applied research. ***
