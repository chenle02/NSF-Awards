This project will use techniques from the present classical theory of
gravitation to investigate aspects of future quantum theories of this
fundamental field. Results of this work are likely to be important for the
creation and early history of the universe, as well as in examining proposed new
theories of the universe which incorporate unobservable "compactified" extra
dimensions.
