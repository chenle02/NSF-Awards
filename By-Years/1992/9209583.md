This research will create an entirely new approach to application prototyping
process modification and error recovery in manufacturing. Human supervisors will
communicate with robots and other automated equipment like they might direct
human subordinates-by pointing at locations while giving directives about
objects and actions. This point-and-direct approach to manufacturing will allow
new products to be introduced quickly and will lead to continuous manufacturing
improvement. Changes and corrections will be made in nearly real-time. The
development of a technology for remotely designating object orientation and
position anywhere in an unstructured three-dimensional workspace is critical in
realizing point-and-direct strategic control in manufacturing. This research in
point-and-direct manufacturing will lead to the development of a novel
manufacturing control technology where humans perform the task conception and
scene interpretation functions for which they are well suited while machines
perform the task execution function at which machines excel. Both small flexible
enterprises, and large multiple-cell manufacturers will be able to use this
control strategy to employ robots and other intelligent machines with greater
ease.
