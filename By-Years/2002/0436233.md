9819758&lt;br/&gt;Grouws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mathematics through Technology
and Internet Modules project (MTTIM) is in the area of Instructional Materials
Development. Co-PI's Douglas A. Grouws and Lucy L. Payne will create six
internet-based instructional modules and accompanying teacher guides for
students in grades 5-8. The modules will use internet sites as a source of
realistic, current data for students to use in classroom activities and
investigations. The mathematics focus of the project materials includes
exploratory data analysis, rates of change, proportional reasoning, and
relationships among fractions, decimals, and percents. There will be a project
focus on connecting mathematics to other disciplines such as science and social
studies. The project materials will link to the NCTM Principles and Standards
Initiative (Standards 2000) and the ISTE Standards. Connections will also be
made with existing NSF-supported middle-school curriculum projects as well as
other widely used middle-school mathematics materials. These materials are
designed to supplement existing curricula. Co-PI's Douglas A. Grouws and Lucy L.
Payne. NSF support - $774,732; cost sharing - $229,387.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
