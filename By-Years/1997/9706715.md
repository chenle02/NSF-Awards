9706715 Lion This is a renewal of support for research initiated under NSF Grant
No. 86-17408 and continued under 91-00209 to characterize the role that
transition metals have on hazards to environmental health because of their
toxicity, potential for bioaccumulation and their persistence in the
environment. Chemical equilibrium models integrated with mathematical models
that resulted from prior research will be extended in this project to account
for biological interactions with iron oxides that control iron cycling and
subsequent adsorption of environmentally significant trace metals. The research
includes consideration of biological processes that affect deposition of iron,
the effects that bacterial and algal cells and their extracellular polymers have
on adsorption of lead by iron oxides, and amelioration of metal toxicity to
microorganisms by the presence of iron. The research involves laboratory
investigations with controlled chemical conditions necessary to characterize
important biotic and abiotic components that will be used to guide field
studies. Results of this research are expected to be an improved understanding
from that which now exists of the behavior and fate of metals that pollute and
contaminate natural surface and groundwaters. Knowledge gained from this
research and the resultant mathematical models may be applied in engineering
design of processes and treatment systems for removal of metal contaminants from
polluted and contaminated natural surface water supplies, groundwater, and from
domestic and industrial wastewaters prior to their discharge into the
environment. ***
