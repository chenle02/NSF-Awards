Professor Wermer plans to generalize his work with H. Alexander on the
polynomial hull of a convex set in complex n- dimensional space lying over the
unit circle. Natural generalizations occur when the circle is replaced by the
unit sphere in complex 2-space or by the boundary of a multiply connected
domain. The area of application of these ideas is the theory of analytic
functions of several complex variables. An analytic function is one which is
differentiable in the sense of elementary calculus but where the variable is a
complex number. The imposition of the requirement of differentiability leads to
a large but remarkable class of functions whose properties are still poorly
understood in higher dimensions. Professor Wermer will investigate some of these
properties.
