9353946 Borrelli This project is continuing the activities of an ongoing project
using computer experiments in differential equations. The goals of the project
include (a) development of expertise in the use of interactive computer
experiments in a laboratory setting, (b) opportunity for creation of ordinary
differential equation exercises for classroom and laboratory use, and (c)
networking of faculty teaching ordinary differential equations. In particular,
this award is adding Stetson University to the differential equations consortia
consisting of the following six institutions: Cornell University, Harvey Mudd
College, St. Olaf College, West Valley College, Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, and Washington State University. Differential equation workshops are
being held during the summer of 1994 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
West Valley College and at Stetson University during the summer of 1995. ***
