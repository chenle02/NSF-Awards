The objective of this research program is to investigate the influence of ion
beam modification on the cyclic deformation behavior and resulting near-surface
damage accumulation processes which lead to fatigue crack initiation in Ni-Al
alloys. Materials ranging from pure nickel single crystals to the Ni3Al nickel-
aluminum intermetallic compound are being ion implanted (for alloying or ion
beam mixing) and the materials are being characterized using Rutherford
backscattering, ion channeling, and transmission electron microscopy. Mechanical
property studies will include analyses of surface residual stresses and
hardness, surface damage accumulation as a function of plastic strain, and
fatigue crack initiation.
