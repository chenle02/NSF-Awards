New concepts in the design of biomaterials have led to the moment in which
biomaterials may be designed to make decisions. These decisions - including
motility, replication, collective behavior, healing, and secretion - can be
driven by molecular computational and decision-making networks embedded in
materials. Increasing sophistication of both soft matter design and synthetic
networks allow for the possibility of embedded synthetic networks in artificial
cells and tissues that allow for intelligent information processing or self
replication of materials. This award proposes a workshop to develop connections
and ideas an international Research Collaborative Network (RCN) for the purposes
of supporting collaborative work between U.S. and European scientists in the
area of information-driven materials. The goal of this meeting will be to
identify key areas of intersection between biomaterials synthesis and response
and information encoding. The meeting follows upon a very successful Square
Table that was held at NSF in the Fall of 2018 that identified many of the key
scientific issues in this area. The focus of the meeting will be on fundamental
issues in the design of materials and networks, informed by quantitative methods
and computing, and to assess what can be achieved through state of the art
materials design. Because the discipline is highly interdisciplinary, the
meeting will bring together basic scientists from chemistry, physics, biology,
engineering, and biomaterials science. Furthermore, this meeting will focus on
how to activate an effective network of collaboration and identify areas of
potential support at NSF for future programs on information-driven
biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
