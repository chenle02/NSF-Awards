Fundamental experiments on the fluid mechanical and heat transfer aspects of
turbulent subcooled bubbly boiling flow were proposed. The experiments will
focus on the turbulent velocity and temperature fields of the liquid and vapor
phases and also on the spatial distributions of vapor fraction, bubble size, and
time-average interfacial area concentration. A two-component laser Doppler
Velocimeter featuring three detectors, fast micro-thermocouples, and phase-
sensitive dual sensor fiber-optic probes will be used for the measurements.
Closure laws and models will be obtained from the experimental data via careful
scrutiny and analyses. Quantities for which these laws and models will be sought
include: Reynolds stresses and turbulent heat flux in the liquid phase, local
time-average interfacial area concentration, and transfer rates of momentum and
thermal energy at the vapor-liquid interfaces. The closure laws and models will
be incorporated in a three-dimensional two-fluid computational code that is
presently under development at Electricit de France. The final goal will be to
contribute toward the validation of this computational code with appropriate
experimental data obtained in the laboratory.
