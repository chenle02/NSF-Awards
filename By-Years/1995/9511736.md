This is a study of sex equality, gender attitudes and quality of relationship
in Russian marriages, interviewing a random sample of 1400 households in Moscow
and its rural environs. Russia today presents a curious mix of ideology and
attitudes making it an important setting for research on changing power
relationships between the sexes. The contradictory factors include: the heritage
of the Communist regime which supposed gender equality; the presence of an
entrenched patriarchy and general lack of awareness of socially constructed
elements of gender difference; and the recent return to subjugating women in the
family. The theory to be tested predicts that when spouses have traditional
gender attitudes and wife's occupational prestige, educational achievement or
income are equal or superior to husband's, partners will experience lower
marital quality and the wife will be more at risk for abuse. If the spouses have
liberal gender attitudes, the theory predicts, equal or superior wife status
will not diminish their marital quality. In addition to testing this and related
theories, the project will provide baseline information about the quality of
Russian marriages that will be valuable for future studies. %%% The large-scale
processes of democratization and market transition occurring in Russia and many
other nations have serious consequences on the small scale of family units. It
may be the case that greater democracy at the level of the society produces, at
least for the duration of a transition period, less democracy within families.
Or, it may be that the short-term consequences for families of democratization
may depend in large part upon the attitudes that family members bring to their
relationships with each other. Thus, this study will test general scientific
theories about the effect of great social stress on families, as well as
providing a much clearer picture of Russian marriages in this time of great
challenge for their society.
