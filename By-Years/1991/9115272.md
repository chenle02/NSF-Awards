This is a proposal to develop an undergraduate computer engineering curriculum
in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. All the existing courses
in the Computer Science and Engineering curriculum will be redesigned to include
the use of CAD tools, programmable devices and hardware description languages.
After initial development of the project, the principal investigator plans to
coordinate development of these types of educational resources in selected 2--
year colleges in the Southwest.
