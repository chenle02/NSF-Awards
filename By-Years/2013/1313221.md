This project focuses on the analysis of certain vector spaces over finite
fields, called low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, that have a set of sparse
vectors generating the dual space. While these codes show great promise in
current and future communication systems, their performance has been limited by
the existence of so-called pseudocodewords. The main goal of this research is to
develop a comprehensive mathematical theory of these objects by combining tools
from coding and information theory, linear algebra, combinatorics, and graph
theory. It is achieved by an analysis of the codewords corresponding to the
cover graphs of the associated code graphs -- called protograph-based codes --
and the pseudocodewords obtained by projecting these codewords onto the code
graphs, an analysis of the pseudocodewords in the fundamental cones (with
implications in linear programming decoding and iterative decoding), and an
analysis of the pseudo-weights (the measure of performance under iterative
decoding) with implications in code performance.

Despite significant progress in the last decades, the performance of current
communication systems is still not satisfactory in many situations, such as when
delay is important, power is critical, or bandwidth is constrained. This project
studies the reasons why current coding techniques underperform relative to
theoretical limits and develops a mathematical theory that explains their
shortcomings and helps design better codes. The investigator's joint appointment
with the department of electrical engineering and her collaboration with
engineering experts from academia and industry ensure that the project has an
impact beyond the theoretical realm; the analytical findings are exploited to
improve the reliability of current and future communication systems. Because
reliable communication is at the heart of ubiquitous access to and exchange of
data, the nation's information technology infrastructure benefits from the
project. Its impact is, however, not restricted to channel coding, but extends
to areas such as computer science, networking, and compressed sensing.
