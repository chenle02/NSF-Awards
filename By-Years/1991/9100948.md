This grant is for continued support of an REU site program at the University of
Alaska-Geophysical Institute. The program will be patterned after previous
programs and gives undergraduates majoring in physics and closely related
disciplines experience in research conducted at the Geophysical Institute. The
program objectives are to acquaint students with the exciting research
opportunities in the various fields of geophysics, concentrating on Space
Physics and Aeronomy, and encourage these students to go on to graduate school
in these fields. The program will include an organized series of informal
discussions to improve interaction and the sharing of ideas.
