This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at George
Washington University to help purchase equipment that will allow redesign of two
undergraduate physiology human laboratories around microcomputer-based work
stations. Apple Macintosh SE personal computers will be interfaced with World
Precision Instruments MacLab data acquisition systems. The WPI MacLab includes
both the necessary hardware and software specifically designed to emulate a
polygraph and a storage oscilloscope. The most innovative feature of the
redesigned labs will be that PCs will be used as interactive "electronic lab
manuals". The software which will be designed for the manual will make possible
an auto-tutorial approach which will greatly improve learning during the conduct
of an exercise. In responding to queries, students will be required to answer
questions, provide data, or produce graphical or tabular data summaries. The PC-
based work stations will also allow the addition of new lab exercises to the
curriculum, including simulations. The proposed PC-based work stations will be
less expensive to purchase and much easier to use and maintain than high quality
pen and ink recording systems. No laboratory courses in the Department currently
provide students an opportunity to use PC's regularly for data acquisition and
analysis. Using PC-based work stations in physiology will better prepare
students to enter the work force or to continue their education at the graduate
level. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
