This grant provides funding for travel of speakers and panelists at the National
Nanotechnology Initiative Regional Initiatives Workshop in Oklahoma City April
1-3, 2009. The workshop brings representatives of regional, state, and local
nanotechnology initiatives together with representatives of US Government,
industry, trade associations, non-governmental organizations, and academia to
stimulate increased interaction of these groups with one another and with the
NNI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to improve the outcomes
of nanotechnology research, education, and business activities undertaken by
U.S. organizations and communities working to advance nanotechnology. The
strategy for reaching this goal is to exploit synergies between the various
initiatives, promote sharing of information and resources, and develop ongoing
mechanisms for relevant interactions. A full report of the workshop will be
prepared by the participants and distributed by the NNI and NNCO. Thus the
highlights of the workshop and the collective best practice recommendations will
be made available to the whole nanotechnology community in science, business,
government, and non-governmental organizations using the NNI and NSF websites. A
database of the financial resources and funding models, regulatory issues and
practices, and areas of technology focus of the regional, state, and local
initiatives will be prepared and updated on an ongoing basis.&lt;br/&gt;
