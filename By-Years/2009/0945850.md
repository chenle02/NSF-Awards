This SBIR Phase I project will develop a micro-variable circular orifice fuel
injector that is intended to result in clean combustion for light duty auto
diesel engines. The injector can provide flexibility for atomization in
different applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of
the proposed project will be the potential for improved fuel efficiency and
reduced automobile emissions. If successful, it will help U.S. automakers to
meet the challenges faced by new government regulations for emissions and fuel
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;
