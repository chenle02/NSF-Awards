The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project will be a secure domestic supply of isotopes. The initial target isotope
for production is lithium-7-hydroxide for use in US light-water nuclear
reactors. Currently the only source of this critical material is China or Russia
and so the supply is susceptible to disruptions that would cripple the US
electrical generating capability. A cost-effective method to enrich very large
quantities of lithium-7 is also required for the introduction of next-generation
nuclear reactor technology. Molten salt reactors will deliver inherently-safe,
environmentally friendly, carbon-free base load electrical power
generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project provides an innovative approach to enriching lithium-7. The
concept is to develop a liquid-liquid method for lithium isotope separation that
will work with an innovative high-speed counter current chromatography (HSCCC)
system. All commercial HSCCC suppliers (UK and China) build their bobbins by
winding tubing around a shaft. The sides of the bobbins have the inlet and
outlet fittings attached. This restricts the bobbins to only having a single
inlet and outlet and having only a single tubing 'style' on a bobbin. Using 3-D
printing to manufacture bobbins enables flexibility in design and manufacture
while lowering cost. In this project, 3-D printing will enable bobbins with
different configurations to be manufactured and tested quicker and cheaper than
the current conventional tube winding method enabling the bobbin configurations
to be quickly adapted alongside the liquid-liquid method extractant/diluent
formulations to optimize performance criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
