DMS-9500916 Boas/Straube The principal investigators will study the interplay
between the geometry of the set of infinite type points in the boundary of a
pseudoconvex domain and the regularity of the d-bar-Neumann problem. They will
also investigate geometric conditions equivalent to compactness of the d-bar-
Neumann operator. The techniques to be used combine ideas from function theory,
geometry, partial differential equations, and functional analysis. Several
complex variables arose at the beginning of the century as a natural outgrowth
of studies of functions of one complex variable. It became clear early on that
the theory differed widely from its predecessor. The underlying geometry was far
more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more affinity with
partial differential operators of first order. It thus grew as a hybrid subject
combining deep characteristics of differential geometry and differential
equations. Many of the fundamental structures were defined in the last three
decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic
mathematical forms.
