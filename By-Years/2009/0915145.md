This project aims at developing mathematical models to describe the dynamics of
large populations of interacting strategic agents. Detailed data concerning such
phenomena are becoming increasingly available thanks to the unprecedented
success of online social networks. Game-theoretic models provide a flexible
mathematical framework and Nash equilibria should describe the long term
behavior of such models. This research addresses several fundamental problems
with this approach: Which of multiple Nash equilibria is selected? How rapidly
does a system converge to such an equilibrium? How can one influence these
dynamics? Leveraging recent advances in theoretical computer science, efficient
algorithms will be developed to answer such questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
expression "social network" refers to a population of individuals together with
their one-to-one social relationships (which can be of personal or economic
nature). It is clear that the structure of such a network deeply affects the
behavior of society as a whole (in particular, from the economic point of view).
This intuition has never become practical or quantitative due to the lack of
detailed data on the structure and dynamics of social networks. The Internet,
and in particular the success of online social networking is dramatically
changing this situation. This project aims at developing mathematical models and
algorithms urgently needed to harness this data explosion. It will open the way
to the application of economic analysis tools to this new arena, and thus
facilitate new ways of exploiting online networks.
