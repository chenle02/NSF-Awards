This is a Research Equipment Grant for reactive-ion-etcher/PECVD/RF- sputtering
equipment to be used in research on microelectromechanical devices. This
research project focuses on the design, analysis, and fabrication of devices
with single or numerous micron-scale internal components forming either moveable
mechanical elements, which are actuated by strong fields, or sensor elements,
which infer relative positions of components based on local fields. Devices to
be produced using this equipment include sensors -- such as strain gauges,
micropositioners, and multi-axis tactile sensors -- spatial light modulators,
and actuators. Crucial to the design of these devices is the ability to build
deep or complete cut-outs into the structure, and to pattern metals, insulator
and magnetic materials. This equipment will allow the on-site generation of
microelectromechanical devices requiring vertical etching principally in
silicon-based materials, and the generation of such devices requiring deposition
of conductors, insulators, and magnetic films.
