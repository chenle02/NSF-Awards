With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa
will upgrade and refurbish an existing high resolution mass spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including 1) the organic
chemistry of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium compounds; 2) the biosynthesis of
tetrapyrroles; 3) applications of ionic liquids for fast atom bombardment mass
spectrometery; 4) studies of fluorine chemistry; 5) the characterization of
biomimetic chromium carboxylate assemblies; and 6) the incorporation of modified
nucleosides into nucleic acids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometry (MS) is
a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used
analytical instrumentation techniques. These studies will have a significant
impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and synthetic organic
chemistry. In addition, over 50 student researchers including graduate students,
undergraduate students and local high school teachers will use mass spectrometry
in their research projects at the university over the next few years. This
instrument will also be available to students and faculty at other regional
universities. &lt;br/&gt;
