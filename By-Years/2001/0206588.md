Nitrogen deposition has increased in several regions in the United States due to
inadvertent emissions from agro-industrial activities. This project is designed
to investigate three important fates for nitrogen inputs in temperate forests:
microbial immobilization, incorporation into slowly decomposing soil organic
matter, and denitrification gas emissions. The ability of these sinks to retain
nitrogen inputs may determine the sustainability of forest ecosystems and may
affect global warming and aquatic ecosystem health. For example, as nitrogen
inputs increase, increased denitrification may result in increased emissions of
nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. This project will investigate the
ability of soils to retain nitrogen through biotic (microbial) and abiotic
(physiochemical) mechanisms, and the response of denitrification to changes in
environmental conditions and changes in microbial biodiversity. The results of
this study will be critical to predicting the response of forest ecosystems to
increasing nitrogen deposition.
