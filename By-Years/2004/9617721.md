9617721 Millero In recent years, chemical and biological oceanographers have
come to realize that primary production in vast areas of the ocean far from
land, once thought to be limited by the availability of inorganic nitrogen
coming into surface waters, is in fact limited by iron. Now that further , more
detailed studies of this exciting discovery are underway, there is a need for
in-depth understanding of the molecular-level behavior of dissolved iron in
seawater. This proposal is directed toward meeting this need. The principal
investigator, a leading world authority on the physical chemistry of seawater,
will carry out a series of laboratory studies to determine the fundamental
chemical properties of iron in seawater. These investigations will include
studies of iron solubility under various conditions and of the complexation
behavior of iron - i.e., the ability of inorganic and organic substances in
seawater to bind iron and thus affect its solubility and biological
availability. Both the kinetic and thermodynamic (equilibrium) aspects of iron
solution and complexation will be studied in the context of more general
theoretical models of seawater chemistry. ***
