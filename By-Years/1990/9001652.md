The ability of anthropologists to determine aspects of an animal's diet from
morphological characteristics of its dentition has greatly increased in recent
years, especially through the use of new techniques such as SEM (scanning
electron microscope) examination of minute wear characteristics of the teeth.
The Principal Investigators will utilize this technique to determine food
categories of a diverse group mammals, including primates, and use this
information to make inferences about the diet of an important group of Early
Cenozoic primates, the Omomyidae. This study will be the first to assess
quantitatively hypotheses about dietary reconstruction of early fossil primates.
The potential application of this study for understanding dietary aspects of
other fossil taxa is great.
