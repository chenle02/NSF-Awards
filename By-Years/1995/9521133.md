9521133 Boyd In this project, the PI will continue his long and productive
studies of geophysical waves and algorithms, and extend his work on spectral
methods, nonlinear theory, and other topics in geophysical fluid dynamics.
Emphasis during the next several years will include spectral elements and weakly
nonlocal solitary waves, with particular focus on coastal modeling using the
spectral element approach which is particularly well-suited to massively
parallel computers, allowing higher resolution and faster turn-around of model
runs. ***
