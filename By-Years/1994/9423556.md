9423556 Panetta The central theme of this research project is to investigate the
factors which control the positions, structures, and interactions of the
atmosphere's subtropical and polar front jets. Three major topics will be
pursued. The first is to examine the factors determining the meridional extent
of the Hadley circulation. The second is to investigate whether the degree of
separation between the two jets is related to the frequency of blocking
formations in the large-scale flow. Finally, the principal investigator will
explore the generation of vortices through wave-breaking on tropical jets. The
principal tools are idealized, dry hydrodynamic models which differ in physical
extent and dynamical regime, depending on the aspect of flow organization being
studied. These include several versions of the NCAR Community Climate Model and
quasi-geostrophic beta- plane models. ***
