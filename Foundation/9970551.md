9970551 Starchenko S. Starchenko will continue his research in the field of
model theory. He intends to study structures definable in o-minimal models, and
he will also attempt to extend some recent results about Pfaffian functions to
o-minimal expansions of real closed fields. One of the main goals of this
research is developing a theory of analytic functions over arbitrary
algebraically closed fields (fields in which all polynomial equations in one
variable have solutions) analogous to the theory of complex analytic functions.
S. Starchenko strongly believes that many classical theorems of complex analysis
can also be proved in the category of ``tame analytic'' functions over such
fields. Understanding which theorems are available in this general context and
which are not would shed light on the classical theory itself; the new
perspective would be made to provide more insight into a highly developed and
venerable classical theory. ***
