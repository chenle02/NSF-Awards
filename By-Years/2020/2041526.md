The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of point-of-care device for monitoring stress levels in individuals
working in high-stress environments. Psychological stress has important impact
on physical health, but detecting and monitoring stress levels is difficult with
current methods detecting trace amounts of chemicals in sweat or saliva.
However, this is limited due to sensitivity, time, cost, portability, and
reproducibility. The proposed technology provides early stress detection and
communication through wireless connectivity. Potential users include athletes,
military personnel, commercial pilots, and individuals with preexisting health
conditions such as hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. The technology could be
linked to other stakeholders in industries such as health care, insurance, and
clinicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the
development of a point-of-care device for measuring cortisol hormone levels in
sweat and saliva. The technology uses molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) for
sensing cortisol â€“ a stress biomarker found in body fluids - by electrochemical
detection, which is designed to quantitatively monitor and detect cortisol
levels in real-time. An extended-gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET) is used
as a transducer to detect the electrochemical response of MIPs and to take a
direct readout from the sensor. This EG-FET cortisol sensing platform may be
easily produced at an industrial scale with miniaturization and automation
capabilities. The sensor will aid in low-cost clinical diagnostics by providing
real-time visualization of cortisol biomarkers. The goal is to translate this
device into an IoT device for wireless data transmission to a smartphone app to
monitor cortisol levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
