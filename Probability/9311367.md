Self-organizing data structures, which dynamically maintain a file of records
in easily retrievable order while using up little memory space, have been
investigated by probabilists and computer scientists for more than 25 years.
Such self-organizing systems have been applied to problems in very large-scale
integration (VLSI) circuit simulation, data compression, and communications
networks. The goal of the proposed research project is to apply techniques for
analyzing Markov chains, some only recently developed, to the study of self-
organizing lists and other data structures. The work will focus on furthering
the analysis of certain modifications of the standard schemes for list
rearrangement. Some of these modifications, such as the Markovian access model
for "locality of reference," are designed to model more closely the behavior of
the rules on data encountered in applications. In other cases, such as
stochastic algorithms, the rule itself is modified in an effort to improve
performance. A structure for maintaining a file of records is called self-
organizing if the rule for replacing a retrieved item depends only on the
location from which the item was retrieved. The idea is that the file will
organize itself, with frequently retrieved items tending to gravitate toward the
front of the file. Self-organizing structures are commonly used for storing data
in a computer. Probabilists and computer scientists have investigated certain
performance characteristics of self- organizing data structures for many years.
This research will continue such investigations.
