This research studies the labor market consequences of two developments---the
Internet and temporary employment agencies. The first project explores how the
migration of job posting and candidate screening to the World Wide Web affects
personnel outcomes using firm level data of a large national bank that will
migrate all of its branches and occupations in phases to exclusively online
recruiting in 2002 and 2003. This part of the research analyzes several issues
including how the move to online recruiting shapes the quality of worker-firm
matches and whether improvements in firm-level match quality due to online
recruiting yields aggregate changes in the quality of matches and hence
operation of labor markets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the
research studies hiring in temporary help sector. The temporary-help industry
accounted for 10% of U.S. jobs created in the 1 990s. This is a major conduit by
which less-skilled workers enter the labor market. This part of the research
studies how the growth of temporary help intermediation affects labor market
advancement of less-skilled workers. The first phase of the project explores how
the choice of job search modality for a given worker--- temporary help agency
versus direct-hire employment---impacts labor market progression.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational agenda of the proposal builds on these
research components. The project develops a semester length graduate class under
development that explores the consequences of technical change for the labor
market. The course will be made available freely through MIT's OpenCourseWare
Initiative (OCW), with partial support provided by OCW. The project will
organize a two-day conference titled, "The Growth of Labor Market
Intermediaries: Electronic and Terrestrial" to disseminate scholarship on the
role of labor market intermediaries in the U.S. and abroad. &lt;br/&gt;
