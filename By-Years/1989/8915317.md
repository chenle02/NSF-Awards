The 21st UPADI (Pan American Federation of Engineering Societies) Convention and
Congresses will take place in Washington, DC in August 199O. It will be hosted
by the American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES), which is the U.S.
representative to UPADI. UPADI is an international educational and scientific
organization composed of the national engineering societies of 26 countries in
the Americas. It is dedicated to promoting unity among engineers and furthering
the progress of science and technology for all people. UPADI educational
congresses and roundtables have been held twenty times since 1949, generally
every other year. The 199O UPADI Convention will mark the first time since 1952
that this prestigious meeting will be held in the United States. The 1988
meeting was held in Cuba. It is the desire of the United States engineering
community, as well as NSF, to encourage the convening of major international
scientific conferences in the United States.
