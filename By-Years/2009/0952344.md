Fish have a remarkable ability to detect the strike of a predator by sensing
water flow with receptors within the skin. The major aim of this research
project is to understand the mechanics of this sensory system, known as the
lateral line, in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio). This will be achieved by using
a novel combination of mathematical modeling, behavioral experiments, and flow
visualization techniques developed for aeronautical engineering. These
approaches will consider how the shape of the body and the direction of a
stimulus influence the ability of a fish to evade a predator.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance understanding in two
major areas. First, this work will establish the mechanics of a sensory system
that is critical to the ecology of a broad diversity of aquatic animals. Second,
this work will define relationships between mechanosensory inputs and behavioral
outputs in a major model system for neuroscience. This will inform our
understanding of how vertebrate behavior is affected by the integration of
mechanosensory information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will
also involve outreach and education. The investigators propose a novel K-12
educational program in collaboration with local schools and the U.C. Irvine
Department of Education. The PI and his students will also participate in a
number of outreach programs at U.C. Irvine that are designed to enhance
involvement of minority researchers and education to underserved local schools.
