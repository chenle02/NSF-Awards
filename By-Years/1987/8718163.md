The purpose of the proposed research is to characterize a novel genetic process
in Neurospora crassa referred to by the acronym as "RIPing" (rearrangement
induced premeiotically). Our preliminary work suggests that RIPing is
responsible for rearranging certain duplicated DNA sequences at high frequency.
The process also typically leads to methylation of the affected sequences, de
novo. We will: (1) test the hypothesis that RIPing is triggered by sequence
duplications; (2) determine the nature of the induced alterations; (3) explore
why some sequences appear resistant to the process; (4) attempt to isolate
mutants defective in RIPing: and (5) investigate whether RIPing is responsible
for a class of spontaneous mutations. Characterization of this process may
illuminate unrecognized genetic mechanisms, and at the same time should provide
information of practical use to scientists making modifications to the genome.
RIPing is almost certainly responsible for instability of transforming DNA in N.
crassa, and it seems possible that a process analogous to RIPing is responsible
for DNA rearrangements observed in other systems, such as in transgenic mice. It
is likely that an understanding of RIPing will also give us insights into why
the genome is organized the way it is.
