This is a project with three investigators in the area of mathematics called
number theory. Professor Katz will investigate varieties defined over finite
fields in particular their cohomology, the distribution of the zeros of their
zeta and L functions and monodromy. Professor Yu will study the analogue of the
Sato-Tate conjecture in terms of Drinfeld Modules. Professor Vakil will
concentrate on Chow groups of certain moduli spaces including the moduli space
of stable n-pointed genus g curves.

The main focus of this project can be described as the study of certain kinds of
solutions to polynomial equations called modular solutions. Many of the
applications computer scientists have for number theory involve these kinds of
solutions. A variety over a finite field is a collection of all the modular
solutions to a set of polynomial equations. Professor Katz will consider
questions involving the number of such solutions, how this number changes as the
polynomials change, and how solution sets of different polynomials are related.
Many abstract versions of these mathematical objects can help shed light on
these questions. Drinfeld modules can be used as a generalization of a variety,
and moduli spaces can be used to study collections of varieties as a whole. In
this project, three investigators will try to combine several different
techniques to a basic problem in mathematics.
