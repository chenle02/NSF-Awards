9410888 Carpino This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Louis A.
Carpino, University of Massachusetts, and one faculty member (Dr. El-Sayed
Mansour), one postdoctoral fellow, and three graduate student from the
University of Alexandria, Egypt. Project funding will allow the team from the
University of Alexandria to work for various periods of time in Dr. Carpino's
laboratory and also allow Dr. Carpino a research visit to the University of
Alexandria. Dr. Carpino, as Principal Investigator, will provide overall project
supervision. The focus of this cooperative research activity is the development
of generally applicable, reliable and rapid procedures for the chemical
synthesis of longer peptides and small proteins. This proposal brings together
research scientists from two countries working in the area of peptide synthesis
and coupling. It is anticipated that this collaborative research will result in
novel techniques for the synthesis of peptide segments. The Egyptian scientists
will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques and
equipment at the University of Massachusetts as well as contribute to the
overall success of the project. Therefore, this proposal fulfills the objectives
of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
international collaboration. ***
