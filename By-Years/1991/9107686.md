It is proposed to conduct the first detailed experimental study of inhomogeneous
superfluid turbulence. Present theory gives an excellent description of
experimental observations in circumstances where the turbulence is known to be
homogeneous. Preliminary results indicate that the effects of non-uniformity can
be large and it is important that these be understood.
