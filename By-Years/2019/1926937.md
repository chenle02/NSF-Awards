The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) project is to help address the issue of non-bio degradable
plastics polluting the planet through the development of biodegradable urethane
monomers, formulations yielding industry standard performance metrics for their
application. There are 2,600 pounds of plastic trash accumulated for each living
person today, with at least 18 billion pounds of plastic entering our oceans
every year. Sustainable products have yet to be commercialized at scale due to
high cost and low quality. We will change the urethane industry through the
commercialization of high-performance biodegradable materials and development of
high value consumer products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project proposes to
address the lack of biologically based materials in consumer products by
utilizing algae polyols, and their formulation chemistries, to develop and
optimize appropriate bio-based formulations, specifically polyurethane foams,
for consumer use as footwear. The company will demonstrate biodegradability of
the product. The company will also develop the supply chain and associated
processes for their algae raw materials to produce algae polyols at
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
