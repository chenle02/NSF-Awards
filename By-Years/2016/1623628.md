Cybersecurity competitions are an important component in security education and
research, as they complement and enhance traditional pedagogical approaches.
However, the benefits of security competitions may not be fully realized without
addressing a few challenges in current security education including lack of
competent training facilities and shortage of appropriate and shareable training
materials that cater to security novices. Moreover, security competitions may be
perceived as a burden to the many two or four year teaching institutions that
lack the necessary resources. As a result, these institutions miss an
opportunity to engage a large population of young talent in
cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project seeks to address those
challenges by developing a novel, virtual platform for both competition and
education, namely PROMISE (Platform for Competition and Education in Cyber
Security), and a set of learning and competition modules using the platform.
Built on top of state-of-the-art, open-source cloud computing systems, the
PROMISE platform is scalable and flexible and supports competitions of different
styles as well as hands-on security puzzles, labs and projects, which makes it a
versatile facility for both security competition and general education and
research. The learning modules cover a variety of important security topics and
each of them has four levels of content (including concept level content for
learners with little security background) to engage learners with different
backgrounds and interests. By sharing developed software and learning materials,
collaborating with diverse institutions such as high schools and community
colleges, and organizing cyber-defense competitions and professional development
workshop, this project is expected to make both immediate and long-term impacts
on cyber security competition and education.
