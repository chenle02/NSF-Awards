Parallel Processing has been widely used in image processing. A number of
parallel architectures such as cellular arrays, memory augmented arrays, and
pyramids have been proposed for these tasks. In the past, many problems in low-
and medium- level vision have been solved on these architectures. This research
will explore parallel architectures for a range of problems in computer vision
and develop efficient parallel algorithms for them. As part of the research,
several novel VLSI arrays including arrays with efficient global communication
features, arrays with reduced processing requirements, as well as reconfigurable
VLSI arrays will be developed. While these architectures are also suitable for
many other problems, they seem to be particularly well-suited for vision
applications due to inherent properties of problems in low-level vision. This
research will also investigate parallel algorithms for medium-and high-level
vision problems. Finally, the use of information theoretic techniques to study
the interprocessor communication requirements and inherent parallel complexity
of solving several fundamental problems in vision will be investigated.
