Recent work by the group supported here, and by other groups, has made it
possible to detect all the products of atomic collisions, and to measure their
flight paths and energies. This now allows a detailed comparison with
calculations, as well as the isolation of key factors that dominate these
interactions. The results will enhance our understanding and control of atomic
processes.
