Funds are provided for continued activities of Ocean Studies Board of the
National Research Council in the planning of the Continental Margins initiative.
The planning is being undertaken through a committee under the Ocean Studies
Board and Board on Earth Science and Resources of the NRC. An earlier workshop
recognized the need to identify research issue on the margins that are process
oriented and interdisciplinary in order to further the understanding of
lithospheric convergence and divergence. Funds will be used for workshops to be
held under the NRC aegis in late 1990 and 1991 for further planning and
completion of a Science and Operational Plans. The cost of workshops will be
shared by NSF, NOAA, USGS and ONR. Half of the funds are provided by NSF.
