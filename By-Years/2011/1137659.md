This project will conduct the first comprehensive demographic study of solar and
space physics and related scientific disciplines. This includes scientists who
investigate: 1) the Sun; 2) the nature of the region of space affected by our
sun; and 3) the response of Earth and the rest of our solar system to this space
environment. The disciplinary areas in which these scientists operate include:
solar physics, space physics, magnetospheric physics, aeronomy, and upper
atmospheric physics. The project is a collaboration between the co-chairs of the
Education &amp; Workforce working group associated with the ongoing National
Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics with the
American Institute of Physics (AIP). The objective of the project is to assess
the demographic health of these tightly coupled areas of scientific endeavor.
