This proposal presents a comprehensive study of rock anisotropy and the nature
of the stress field induced in anisotropic rock masses with irregular
topographies consisting of ridges and valleys. The first task of the proposed
research is analytical and consists of deriving closed-form solutions to
investigate the combining effect of rock stratification and topography on in
situ stresses. The second task consists of testing a variety of anisotropic
rocks under uniaxial, triaxial and true triaxial conditions to determine their
range of elastic properties. The third task is to conduct dilatometer tests to
determine the deformability properties of anisotropic rock masses in the field.
