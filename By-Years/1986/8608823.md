This is an investigation of the cycling and speciation of germanium, selenium,
arsenic, and antimony in the Black Sea, the world's largest permanently-anoxic
marine basin. The PI's will obtain detailed depth profiles of dissolved and
suspended particulate speciation (oxidation states and organic forms) through
the oxic, suboxic, and anoxic zones of the water column, and in the underlying
sediment and pore waters. This comprehensive data set will clarify the roles of
marine aerobic/anaerobic metabolism and particulate scavenging on the redox
behavior, speciation, and concentration of metalloid elements. Time scales of
processes will be deduced from data generated by other groups on the same
expedition (e.g., water circulation: T/He;/ 14C; Fe/Mn oxidation-reduction and
scavenging rates; microbial activity). The Black Sea is an ideal environment for
this work because its anoxic waters have a long residence time (ca. 1000 yrs.)
and are in quasi-steady state, and because of the intense and well-defined iron
and manganese cycling in the vicinity of the oxic/anoxic interface.
