Support is requested for a research conference to be held in the spring of 1988
on the subject of phosphoinositides as sources of second messengers in plant
growth and development. The area of second messengers currently is one of the
rapid growth areas in plant biology. This is especially so for research
involving the polyphosphoinositides where a role as a major second messenger
system in animal cells has emerged during the last decade. Our goal is to bring
a select group of experts in the area of plant second messengers together with
those whose work has focused on inositol metabolism to discuss critically the
second messenger concept in plants and the possibility that inositol phosphates
together with protein kinases and calcium fulfill such a role in hormone
responses. While polyphosphoinositides have quite clearly been shown to occur in
plants and to be modulated under certain developmental conditions, a second
messenger role remains to be proven for these substances in plants, and the
field is certainly very much in need of critical evaluation. This conference
will be designed to foster interaction among participants with a view toward the
emergence of new paradigms for the understanding of the mechanisms of second
messenger signalling in plants, and the role of second messengers in plant
growth and development.
