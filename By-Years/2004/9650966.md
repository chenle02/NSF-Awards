This project improves and expands an undergraduate digital laboratory to teach
digital cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, and
global positioning systems (GPS) in the Department of Geography and Earth
Science. These fields represent the latest developments in present day mapping
sciences. Because of the rapid conversion of traditional cartographic and
mapping methods into the world of high technology, applications that
revolutionize all mapping sciences, GPS, GIS, and digital approaches to remote
sensing need to be included and expanded in the curriculum. Three new courses in
the mapping sciences have been developed which will be greatly enhanced by the
equipment purchased in this project. The instrumentation and laboratory funds to
equip a laboratory provide undergraduate students with hands-on computer
experience in the mapping sciences while supporting both theoretical and
practical pedagogic values. These experiences can have a profound and lasting
effect on students' understanding of science and their motivation to pursue
further study.
