The purpose of this project is to develop empirically based, general equilibrium
models of the monetary transmission mechanism, and use them to evaluate the
desirability of alternative monetary policies. The research consists of five
parts. The first develops a monetary model of the aggregate economy and proposes
to investigate its implications for the proper conduct of monetary policy. In
the second part, the model will be estimated with a broad set of financial data.
The third part involves building a richer intermediate financial sector based on
findings from parts one and two. The fourth part of the research well entail the
investigation of the small sample properties of the statistical tools that will
be used for model evaluation. The final part of the study will investigate the
potential for seasonal demand shocks to the economy to help account for features
of the business cycle. The conventional view is that seasonal shocks are
irrelevant, and thus it is appropriate to use seasonally adjusted data for model
estimation. This project is important because it will provide a better
understanding of the interrelationships between monetary policy and the business
cycle.
