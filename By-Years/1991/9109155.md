This research project will investigate ion channels in the neurons of the
jellyfish and the flatworm. Although neurons in the jellyfish function in much
the same way as neurons in higher animals, they have at least one property that
may reflect their evolutionary position of being the most primitive animal
possessing a nervous system. The physiology of their sodium- dependent action
potentials is essentially the same as that of sodium currents of other animals
but the pharmacology of those currents is that of calcium currents. Biochemical
and electrophysiological techniques will be employed to elucidate the structure
of the fast sodium channel in neurons of the jellyfish. Dr. Anderson will also
examine the diversity and properties of ion channels in the flatworm. Flatworms
are the "first" animals to possess a centralized brain, therefore occupying an
significant position in nervous system evolution. These animals are the lowest
organism reported of being sensitive to tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker.
Furthermore these animals are a major class of parasites and information about
the physiology of their excitable cells may lead to the development of new
classes of anthelminthic drugs. This study will provide important facts about
how nervous systems evolved. The physiology and pharmacology of ion channels in
the most primitive animals possessing a nervous system will allow comparisons
with channels in primitive and more advanced animals. Results obtained from this
study will provide useful information to neurobiology in general by identifying
subtypes of ion channels with equivalents in higher animals.
