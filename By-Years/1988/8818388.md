The P.I. collected a large amount of physical and chemical data during October-
December, 1987 in the eastern South Pacific in order to study the hydrothermal
plume emanating from the East Pacific Rise, and its effects on the abyssal
circulation in the deep south Pacific basin. Shipboard data were collected and
deep- water floats were deployed, which are still due to surface, subsequently
transmitting data via ARGOS. Data show a strong, highly structured thermal
plume, which may allow estimates of vertical (cross-isopycnal) mixing rates on a
large scale. In this project, the data will be analyzed in collaboration with a
graduate student and other co-workers, and the results submitted for
publication.
