In the past decade there has been a revolution in our ability to carry out
detailed abundance analyses of stars in the Galactic halo, distant Milky Way
globular clusters, and the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, because, prior
to the current generation of large telescopes and efficient spectrographs, these
stars were too faint for high dispersion spectroscopy. Under this award, Dr.
Judith Cohen (California Institute of Technology) will carry out a study of the
chemical evolution of the halo of the Milky Way galaxy in detail, taking
advantage of this tremendous advance in technology as well as leveraging off her
previous, NSF-supported efforts, in which large samples of extremely metal-poor
stars were identified. The elemental abundance patterns in these halo stars,
both in the field and in the globular clusters, have direct implications for the
early epochs of our Galaxy, the onset of chemical evolution of the Galaxy, the
possible stellar sources which produced many elements at very early epochs (very
massive stars and Type II supernovae), the age of the Galaxy, the relationship
between the halo field stars and the galactic globular clusters, and the
composition of the interstellar medium and the intergalactic medium. Such stars
provide a chance to study the general chemical abundances in local material
representing the high redshift Universe. Through this research, new insight will
be gained into the relationship between the Galactic stellar halo and the
satellite galaxies around the Milky Way, both as seen now and in the distant
past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award Dr. Cohen will also continue to be
dedicated to the development of young scientists, particularly women and
minorities, by providing valuable research experiences for undergraduates. In
addition, lectures, both for the general public and at primarily undergraduate
institutions, will continue. Dr. Cohen also will produce an exhibit intended for
the general public in the lobby of the Cahill Center for Astronomy and
Astrophysics, located on the campus of Caltech.
