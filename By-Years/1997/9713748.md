This research project is to study and optimize the fatigue life for surfaces
machined by superfinish hard turning. This will be accomplished by: (1) modeling
the relationship between machining conditions, tool wear, surface integrity, and
fatigue life of the superfinish hard turned surface, and (2) developing a
methodology enabling optimal pre-stressing, through the optimal residual stress
distribution generated by the best cutting conditions for fatigue life. The
research results could lead to the replacement of grinding and superfinishing by
single-point machining, benefiting the manufacturing industries that make
bearings, gears, cams, shafts, tools, dies, etc. The research is fundamental and
could lead to a significant improvement in the fatigue life of superfinish hard
turned surfaces. A major strength of the project is its strong industry
participation and support.
