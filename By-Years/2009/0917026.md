The goal of computational complexity theory is to determine the computational
resources needed to carry out various computational tasks. The resources
measured may involve hardware (such as gates used to construct a circuit, or
area on a chip) or software (such as the time or space used in the execution of
a program on a machine), and the tasks considered may range from simple addition
of two integers to a large algebraic or geometric
computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will deal primarily with "low
level" complexity theory, in which the resources required grow modestly (at most
quadratically) with the size of the task. Examples of such tasks are furnished
by the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
and square-root extraction) performed by the executions of single instructions
in a computer. For these tasks, hardware-oriented resource measures are most
appropriate in most cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
project lie in the opportunity it will provide to explore a new model for
undergraduate research. The most common model for undergraduate research is to
give students problems that they may reasonably be expected to solve within the
time allowed (typically an academic year for a senior thesis, or ten weeks for a
summer assignment). This project will explore a new model, wherein students are
assigned the task of working on an authentic research problem (one that has
resisted solution for many years, and is unlikely to be resolved with a single
new stroke), with the goal of making a contribution (even a small one) that
might play a role in an eventual resolution. If explored with imagination, this
new model should provide a valuable complement to the established practices for
undergraduate research.&lt;br/&gt;
