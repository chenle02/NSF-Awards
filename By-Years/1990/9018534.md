The PI will continue his work on high precision dating of carbonates and marine
geochemistry of rare earth elements with multiple objectives in mind, including:
the determination of chronology of marine carbonates of the past 400 K years;
marine terraces and their relationship to sea-level changes; isotopic chemistry
of pore waters and the effect of diagenesis on U-Th chronometer; abundance of
Platinum and Silver in seawater; and geochemistry of Nd, U and Th. The work will
help refine the C-14 time scale and the chronology of sea-level changes of the
recent past.
