The design of efficient wireless communication systems relies on
a&lt;br/&gt;deep understanding of the basic characteristics of the
underlying&lt;br/&gt;channel. The most fundamental and unique characteristic of
wireless&lt;br/&gt;channels is the random time-variation of the channel
strengths, a&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon known as fading. Communication over fading
channels has&lt;br/&gt;been a topic of study since the 60's. A very different
view of the&lt;br/&gt;problem, however, emerges from recent research. The
traditional view&lt;br/&gt;of fading is that it is a source of unreliability
that has to be&lt;br/&gt;compensated for by various diversity techniques. The
modern view is&lt;br/&gt;much more&lt;br/&gt;powerful and considers fading as a
source of randomization from nature&lt;br/&gt;that can be exploited to get very
significant capacity boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project addresses
several key problems within this&lt;br/&gt;modern paradigm. They will be
centered around two areas: 1)&lt;br/&gt;opportunistic communication : the
dynamic rate and power allocation&lt;br/&gt;over the dimensions of time,
frequency, antennas and users&lt;br/&gt;so that transmission is done when and
where the channel is strong;&lt;br/&gt;2) multi-antenna communication: the use
of multiple transmit and&lt;br/&gt;receive antennas to increase the number of
degrees of freedom available&lt;br/&gt;for communication in richly scattered
fading environments. The issues&lt;br/&gt;studied are focused on how the random
fading can be exploited even in&lt;br/&gt;the face of&lt;br/&gt;channel
uncertainty, and the interplay between the modern and&lt;br/&gt;traditional
views of channel fading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
