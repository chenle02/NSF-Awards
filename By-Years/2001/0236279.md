In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Hartland will study the material properties of nanospheres
and nanorods by means of ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy. Specifically, the
technique relies on beats due to coherently excited vibrational modes that
result from short pulse laser illumination. Electronic properties are probed by
examining electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling. Six individual
projects will be undertaken, ranging from measurements of the symmetric
breathing modes of metal nanoparticles at high temperatures, through ultrafast
studies of electron-electron interactions in bimetallic particles, to
measurements of the time-resolved anisotropy of single Au nanorods.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research includes the development of new
methods that will result in applications to the technology of nanoparticles.
Teaching and training of students will be done at all levels, inclusive of
research participation. The students will thereby receive training in one of the
forefront areas of materials science and chemistry in preparation for advanced
studies or employment in industry, academia, or government
laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
