This award provides funds to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates
SITE at the Center for the Study of Early Events in Photosynthesis at Arizona
State University. Life on this planet is ultimately dependent on photosynthesis
for its energy requirements. The Center, comprised of faculty in the departments
of Botany and Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary approach to
understanding the energy storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms
and mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems. Undergraduate students
will participate in the individual research programs of the Center faculty.
Projects will include organic synthesis and spectroscopic studies of
photosynthetic model compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant
photosynthetic reaction centers, biochemical and molecular characterization of
mutant reaction centers, and molecular biology and genetics of photosynthetic
systems. Structured interaction between faculty and student participants,
including the weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group meetings,
instrumentation workshops and a concluding undergraduate symposium, will help
educate the students in the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of
photosynthesis. Student participants will be recruited from targeted colleges
and universities in the Southwest United States with the help of local
department chairs and individual faculty.
