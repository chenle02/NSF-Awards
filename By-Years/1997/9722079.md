Theoretical research into the interaction of strong electromagnetic radiation
with atoms is performed using a variety of analytic and numerical methods. The
works has three components; photoionization in laser fields, threshold effects
in photodetachment and photorecombination. The research program has and
continues to involve a substantial number of undergraduates.
