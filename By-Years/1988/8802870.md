This proposal is for support of a workshop on "New Directions in Plasma
Engineering", at the University of California, Berkeley, June 9-10, 1988. The
workshop will bring together industrial, government, and academic researchers to
discuss three emerging fields in plasma and charged particle beam engineering:
(1) generation of electromagnetic radiation, (2) plasma-assisted materials
processing, and (3) nonlinear processes in plasmas and beams. These areas have
seen remarkable growth in the past few years, developing both new scientific
knowledge and exciting possibilities for engineering applications. One goal of
the workshop is the preparation of a report to provide guidance for future NSF
support from the QEWB program in these fields. The report will address the
reasons for the emergence of each field, the current state of the art, the
critical problems needing solution, and the future impact of the field on the
practice of engineering.
