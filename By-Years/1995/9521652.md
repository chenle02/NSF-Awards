9521652 Demers This project will demonstrate experimentally and analytically the
feasibility of strengthening and retrofitting steel girders in composite steel
concrete bridges with epoxy bonded carbon fiber laminates. To upgrade the
flexural capacity, carbon fiber plates or tapes are epoxy bonded to the girder
tension flange. For retrofitting, this material is epoxy bonded to the girder
tension flange which may contain pre-existing fatigue cracks. Three beams will
be tested under static loading to determine the flexural strength of a composite
section of concrete deck, steel girder, carbon fiber tape, and epoxy. This will
investigate: Fatigue strength in the positive moment region with pre-existing
fatigue cracks; fatigue strength as a function of applied stress range;
classification of fatigue strength according to the AASHTO's Standard
Categories; and the ability of retrofit to arrest fatigue crack growth. This
project is a joint effort between the University of Arizona and the Worcester
Polytechnic Institute. All full- scale tests will be conducted at the University
of Arizona. The coupon tests will be performed at the Worcester Polytechnic
Institute. The analysis of results and development of guidelines and methodology
for application of this technique will be performed by the investigators at both
institutions. ***
