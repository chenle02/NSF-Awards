9453406 BURGESS This award provides support to Dr. Curt Burgess under the
National Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) Program. The
PFF Program was established at the request of the President of the United States
to recognize and support the scholarly activities of some of the Nation's most
outstanding science and engineering faculty members early in their careers.
Awards are intended to allow Fellows to undertake self-designed, innovative
research and teaching projects, to establish research and teaching programs, and
to pursue other academic related activities. This award will allow the
investigator to pursue his research in psycholinguistics. Three areas will be
pursued: (1) the structure in language and how the human language processor
assigns syntactic structure to incoming language; (2) memory retrieval in
language understanding and the role of sentence level constraints on recognition
processes; and (3) development of computational memory retrieval systems in
order to mimic human lexical/semantic memory. This research is important to
understanding the dynamics of human memory retrieval, and how humans integrate
new knowledge into an existing mental representation. In addition, it will
result in a better specification of the higher-level neural processes involved
in language comprehension, and a better understanding of how people recover from
making errors of lexical or syntactic misassignment during the comprehension
process. Ultimately, this knowledge can assist in more applied problems such as
reading impairment and language rehabilitation after stroke. This five year
award will also enable Dr. Burgess to train undergraduate and graduate students
in interdisciplinary research areas spanning psycholinguistics, cognitive
neuropsychology, and modeling with neural networks.
