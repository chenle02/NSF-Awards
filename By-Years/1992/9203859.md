Combining techniques from disparate areas (Algebra, Geometry,and Combinatorics)
the investigator and his coworkers recently determined the generic dimension of
trivariate spline spaces (of sufficiently high degree) defined on tetrahedral
decompositions. In this project the techniques will be further developed and
applied to multivariate spline research, particularly as regards the following
problems: exact dimension formulas, improved upper and lower bounds on
dimensions, dependence of the dimension on geometric degeneracies, existence and
construction of local bases,identification of useful sub- and superspaces of the
full spline space, solvability of interpolation problems, effects of
degeneracies on numerical stability and solvability of interpolation problems,
algorithms, surface design, approximation of functions defined on surfaces, and
investigation of domain partitions other than simplicial ones. Splines are
smooth piecewise polynomial functions. They are used ubiquitously to solve
problems involving functions of one independent variable. Regarding functions of
several independent variables, splines (which in this context are called
"multivariate splines") are much less understood and their structure is vastly
more complicated. Yet they have great potential for applications such as the
solution of partial differential equations (e.g., modeling fluid flow, heat
distribution, combustion, or radioactive decay), interpolation and approximation
of data, and the design of shapes (e.g., of a vehicle). They are also
fundamental objects that deserve to be studied in their own right.
