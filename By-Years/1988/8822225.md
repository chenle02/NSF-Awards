This award provides partial funding for a network of workstations that will be
used to support research programs in observational and theoretical astrophysics
at the University of Pittsburgh. The balance of the funding will be provided by
matching funds from the University. The research program will center on Quasi-
Stellar Objects (QSOs): the identification of new samples of QSOs, the
understanding of the Physical mechanisms operating within QSOs that produce
their enormous energy output, and the use of background QSOs to probe the sight
lines through matter located at very high redshifts, reflecting the conditions
in the early universe. Based around a file server and several powerful client
workstations with image display capability, this system will be capable of
running standard astronomical data reduction packages, thereby reducing the cost
of software development. It will also provide a powerful interface to
supercomputers for more general scientific computing and modelling tasks.
