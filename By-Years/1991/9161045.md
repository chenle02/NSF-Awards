This research is concerned with investigating the use of a 3D packaging
architecture along with memory and an active substrate to achieve low-power low-
weight mass storage for use in laptop and notebook computers. The effort
combines high density 3D packaging of conventional, domestically available SRAM
devices with active mounting substrates that control the device power
dissipation in the standby mode. A 50-megabyte hard disk replacement will
consume .5 cubic inch and have negligible impact on battery run-down time. In
addition, access time will reduce from milliseconds to less than 100
nanoseconds. This research effort will analytically verify the concept
feasibility, design test articles, and develop an experimental test plan.
