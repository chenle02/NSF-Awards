9730462 Henrik Materials are developed to teach field inquiry techniques
through the study of elephant seal biology. A continuously updated database of
images and environmental data from an elephant seal rookery is provided to
students nation-wide via the World Wide Web. Other web materials are designed to
teach field inquiry techniques with an in-depth set of modules covering key
aspects of elephant seal biology including natural selection, behavior,
reproduction, physiology, metabolism, genetics, population and conservation
biology. A graduate studnet researcher will maintain a menu of frequently asked
questions and responses for teachers to consult. Materials on the web include
virtual tours of the Island where the seal rookery is located in Mexico. The
materials are bicultural and include an introductory video in both Spanish and
English.
