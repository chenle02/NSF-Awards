This award will support a six month visit to Japan by Dr. John P. Hughes, High
Energy Astrophysics Division, U.S. Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical
Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts to carry out a collaborative project
with Professor Katsuji Koyama, Department of Physics at Kyoto University. The
researchers will also be cooperating with scientists at the Institute of Space
and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which is located outside Tokyo and serves as
the "hub" for X-ray astronomy in Japan. The research will be based on
information to be transmitted from the X-ray Astronomy Satellite (ASTRO-D) which
is scheduled for launch in February l993. This satellite is a collaborative
mission between the U.S. and Japan and will be the fourth in a series of X-ray
satellites launched in Japan. This mission has high capability of imaging and
spectroscopy in the hard X-ray band. The first phase of the mission will be
devoted to performance verfication and on-orbit calibration activities. This
will be followed by studies and analyses of supernova remnants and clusters of
galaxies. Knowledge provided by this data will develop fundamental new insights
into the nature and emission processes of all classes of astrophysical sources.
The Japanese have been the leaders in this area of X-ray astronomy. Professor
Hughes has expertise in the areas of verification and calibration of X-ray
satellites which will be valuable to the Japanese. Both he and the U.S.
scientific community will benefit from very early access to the data. It is
anticipated that the collaboration developed between these researchers will
continue for many years.
