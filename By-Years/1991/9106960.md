Semiparametric models incorporate both parametric (finite- dimensional)
components and nonparametric (infinite-dimensional) components. Proportional
hazards models for single observations or for linked observations are examples;
other models for partially censored data also lead to models of this type. This
research will develop efficient estimators and will address the problem of
testing hypotheses about the parametric portions of these models.
