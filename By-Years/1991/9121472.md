This research is in the area of computational complexity theory. It will
continue to develop the complexity theory of real functions. The main idea is to
apply the concepts and techniques of discrete NP- completeness theory to prove
lower bound results for important classical theorems in real and complex
analysis, as well as important computational problems in numerical analysis. The
research will study the notions of generalized Kolmogorov complexity and
instance complexity in the context of structural complexity theory, and the
relationship between these notions and other important ideas in complexity
theory: one-way functions, average-case completeness and pseudorandomness.//
