9419737 Bishop This proposal requests funds to establish a travel costs award
program for American scientists to attend the Fourth International Congress of
Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry to be held in Birmingham, U. K. , August
6-11, 1995. The award program is divided into two parts for the support of young
scientists and students presenting contributed papers and for the support of
primary symposia speakers that require assistance with travel costs. The award
program will require application with justification by interested parties. The
applications will be judged by an awards committee managed by the Division of
Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry of the American Society of Zoologists.
