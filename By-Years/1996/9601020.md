This research project will fill an important gap in the description of human
genetic variation - a comprehensive analysis of genetic materials from Island
Melanesia, focusing on mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome loci. As Sykes re-
cently suggested, Island Melanesia is the key to understanding early population
migrations in the Pacific region. It is well known for its linguistic and
genetic diversity, but newer techniques have not been applied to genetic
analyses on samples from this region in any significant way. The pattern of
variation revealed by this study in mtDNA and Y chromosome DNA will be used to
estimate the timing and nature of the initial and subsequent peoplings of Island
Melane- sia, and Melanesia's relation to the surrounding Polynesian, Southeast
Asian, and Australian poulations. The analyses will be performed on a total of
800 unrelated individuals from a chain of islands stretching from the coast of
New Guinea out into the Pacific, including: New Britain, New Ireland, and
Bougainville. There are also ramifications from this study for estimation of the
time of first appearance of modern humans.
