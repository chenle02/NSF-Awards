9311805 Wachs This award supports the research of Professor Wachs to work in
algebraic and enumerative combinatorics. The first and major part of this
proposal deals with the study of combinatorial aspects of topological properties
of partially ordered sets. These studies provide a deep and fundamental link
between combinatorics and other branches of mathematics, such as topology,
algebra and geometry. The research is in the general area of combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections can be organized. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely
important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks,
as in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all
deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. ***
