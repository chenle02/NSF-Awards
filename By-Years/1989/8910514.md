One of the least understood chapters in the economic history of black Americans
is their experience in the cities and industries of the northeast and midwest
between World War I and the 1950's. The purpose of this project is to remedy
this situation by developing samples of black workers from the employee records
of several large industrial employers, who hired significant numbers of blacks
and who kept detailed work histories, including information on race. These data
sets will allow a comparison of the conditions for the entry of black and white
workers in terms of entry-level wages, hiring criteria, and initial job
assignments. It will also be possible with these data to track the progress of
workers within a company over time in terms of wage trajectories, job
performance, quit rates, and promotions. This project is important because it
will make a significant contribution to better understanding the economics of
discrimination, and will provide a better basis for analyzing the economic
progress of blacks and for assessing the impact of public policy aimed at
increasing job opportunities.
