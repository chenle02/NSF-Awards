To develop a superconducting seismometer which will resolve ground noise at
frequencies of 100 hertz and higher. The new instrument will have improved
linearity, will have a dynamic range of 140 dB or more, and will maintain high
sensitivity over a broad range of frequencies. The new seismometer will use a
SQUID sensor to detect displacements of a magnetically suspended superconducting
sphere. The resolution of this instrument is enhanced by the sensitivity of the
SQUID and by the reduced Brownian motion of the suspended sphere. The linearity,
dynamic range, and frequency band are enhanced by the inherent properties of the
sensor, by the stability of persistent fields in superconducting magnets, and by
the facility with which the potential energy surface of the suspended mass can
be controlled.
