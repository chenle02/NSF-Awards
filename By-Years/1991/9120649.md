This grant will continue to support three professors, nine graduate students
and a junior postdoctoral fellow in studies of production of particles made up
from the constituents of the strong interaction. These constituents are the
quarks and gluons, and the former are usually distinguished as to whether they
are "light" (as in the case of the proton or neutron for instance) or "heavy" as
in particles discovered only within the past decade having a property called
"charm." Two experiments are to be carried out. In the first, E687 at Fermilab,
data will already have been accumulated, and the analysis of the production of
charmed particles will be carried out during the three year period, and set the
agenda for several theses. In the other experiment, E852 at Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL), the equipment is still under construction. This experiment
focusses upon study of particles made primarily from light quarks, and more
speculatively upon those made from gluons.
