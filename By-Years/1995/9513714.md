95-13714 Sazer Yeast cells of the species S. pombe respond to nutrient
limitation by undergoing a number of physiological and morphological changes
that allow the cells to survive the temporary absence of nutrients. The
starvation response in fission yeast includes cell cycle and growth arrest,
decreased cell size, enhanced resistance to heat shock and identification of
proteins that positively regulate the transition of fission yeast cells from a
proliferative state to starvation induced arrest. A genetic screen will be
conducted for the identification of cDNAs which when overexpressed in wild type
cells induce the starvation response even in the presence of nutrients. The
rationale behind this approach is that ectopic expression of a key regulatory
protein can mimic its normal activation state. The initial selection will be for
cDNAs from growing cells that at high levels of expression induce heat-shock
resistance and growth arrest in wild type cells. Further characterization will
include a comparison of the phenotypes of cells overexpressing these cDNAs to
wild type cells starved of nutrients, sequence analysis, constuction and
analysis of loss of function mutants and determination of the pattern of
expression of the genes in wild type cells starved of nutrients. A small-scale
trial of this screen has already yielded positive results: the identification of
5 novel fission yeast
