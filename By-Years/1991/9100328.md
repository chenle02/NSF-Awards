This project involves a graduate student in cultural anthropology who will
study the activities of people in Papua New Guinea who have left regional high
schools before graduation to return to their villages. These "secondary school
leavers" have participated in both traditional and Western forms of education,
and the project will investigate the impact of this "Western" experience on the
traditional forms of education. Methods include participant observation, in-
depth interviews with teachers and students, a household survey of a local
community, and participant observation and focused interviews at four regional
high schools. This research is important because people from diverse cultures
are engaged with "Western" style schooling all over the world, with varying
degrees of success. Knowledge about how forms of classroom education differ and
are similar to traditional forms of indigenous education will help educational
planners devise programs to increase the chances for success of multi-cultural
educational programs in other settings and nations.
