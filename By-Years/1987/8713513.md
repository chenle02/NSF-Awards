This special research year in differential algebra at Rutgers University will
provide for the first time the opportunity for a large number of scholars in
differential algebra and differential groups to work together for an extended
period. The timing is particularly appropriate since three of the researchers
have sabbatical years and will be able to participate, as will Ellis Kolchin,
one of the foremost scholars in the subject, who has retired from Columbia
University and will continue his activity and leadership at Rutgers. The Rutgers
New Brunswick campus is appropriate since Richard Cohn and Joseph Johnson, who
have devoted most of their research to this topic, are members of the faculty,
and William Keigher, a category theorist who has worked extensively in
differential algebra, is nearby at Rutgers Newark Campus.
