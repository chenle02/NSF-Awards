Fundamental issues of the methodology, convex modelling of uncertainty,
dedicated to unified treatment of geometric and material characteristics, are
put forward in this research. Instead of classical probabilistic methods, no
probabilistic treatment is utilized, but the new set-theoretical description of
the uncertain variables and functions is presented. In addition, instead of
usual optimization problems, where the minimum possible responses or least
favorable shapes of the structures are sought, here an uncertainty modelling is
developed as an anti-optimization problem of finding the least favorable
responses due to shape or material uncertainty. Special emphases are placed on
vibration and dynamic buckling of viscoelastic structures. The novel dynamic
stability criterion based on Lyapunov exponents is introduced for viscoelastic
structures. New treatment of uncertainty is especially attractive from the
design point of view-since extrenal responses can be used for valid design of
structures, with scant experimental data needed for their substantiation.
