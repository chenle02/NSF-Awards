ABSTRACT

MEAN CURVATURE FLOW IN HIGHER CODIMENSIONS

The mean curvature flow is the gradient flow of the volume functional of
submanifolds. The analytic nature is a parabolic system of nonlinear partial
differential equations whose stationary phase corresponds to minimal
submanifolds. Minimal hypersurfaces and mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces
have been studied extensively for decades but many applications in mathematical
physics and topology call for understanding of the higher codimensional case.
This project proposes to embark on a systematic investigation of minimal
submanifolds and mean curvature flows in higher codimensions. Three immediate
goals are to understand the minimal surface system in higher codimension, the
Lagrangian mean curvature flow in Calabi-Yau manifolds and the deformation of
maps between Riemannian manifolds by the mean curvature flow.

Minimal surfaces are like soap films, they are surfaces of least area. The mean
curvature flow is an evolution process which movesT a surface in space in such a
way that its area is decreased most rapidly. This is a very natural yet highly
nonlinear process and it models physics phenomena such as the motion of an
interface in forming metallic alloys. Understanding the behavior of this
evolution is important for simplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces in the
most efficient way. This process, as a geometric evolution equation, tends to
deform a geometric object to its optimal shape. A goal of this project is to
apply this process to study certain special surfaces in Calabi-Yau manifolds,
the spaces of string theory. It is believed that underlying structures of
Calabi-Yau manifolds are encoded in these special surfaces, called special
Lagrangians. The success of this proposal will have important impact on image
processing, material science, mathematics physics and other nonlinear problems.
