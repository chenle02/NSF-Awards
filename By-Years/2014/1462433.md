An international conference on "Stratified spaces in geometric and computational
topology and physics" will be held at the University of Wisconsin in Madison,
WI, during March 30 - April 2, 2015. This award provides support for participant
travel. The event will bring together researchers and students interested in the
topological study of singular algebraic varieties, topological data analysis,
and interactions between knot theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical
physics. Th conference, intended to disseminate recent developments, will also
have a significant educational component, featuring introductory lectures at a
level accessible to graduate students, as well as discussion sessions to
strengthen connections among the various research groups represented. Moreover,
the conference aims to provide an opportunity for junior researchers,
postdoctoral associates, and graduate students to broaden their perspective and
create research ties with more senior members in these fields.

The conference program will include the following topics, each driven by recent
and fundamental advances: (1) Codimension two embedding theory and hypersurface
singularities; (2) Topology of stratified maps; (3) Hodge-theoretic aspects of
singularities; (4) Characteristic classes of singular varieties; (5) Singular
spaces in mathematical physics; (6) Stratified spaces in computational topology.
The proposed topics intersect a broad range of research endeavors in fields
ranging from pure mathematics to more applied areas, thus conference
participants will reflect a broad cross-section of mathematical disciplines. In
recent decades, the basic tools involved in the study of singular stratified
spaces have branched out into a myriad of mathematical territories, and it
increasingly becomes important to provide an opportunity such as this conference
for experts in the various related specializations to interact.
