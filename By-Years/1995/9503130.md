9503130 Evans This project will analyze magnetometric resistivity data collected
on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, in order to determine the best algorithms for
processing such data and to assess its potential as a remote-sensing technique
for 3D mapping of the thickness and structure of oceanic crust. ***
