The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Engineering Logistics
and Distribution (CELDi) site at Lehigh University will be closely affiliated
with a joint interdisciplinary center, the Center for Value Chain Research. The
research site brings together faculty from Industrial and Systems Engineering
and the College of Business and Economics with common interests in supply chain
management, management information systems, operations research, optimization,
game theory, computing, management, and marketing. A particular emphasis of the
research site is Value Chain Planning and Development in high value
manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. This new research site will adhere
to the existing policies and procedures established by CELDi.
