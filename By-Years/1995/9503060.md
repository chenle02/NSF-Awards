This is a one-year dissertation enhancement grant to Mr. Mark Erdmann, a
graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, to conduct
research for his Ph.D. study to develop a method for monitoring the health of
coral reefs in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. Coral reef ecosystems
throughout the world, particularly the fringe reefs of southeast Asia, are
rapidly deteriorating under the influence of marine pollution. There is a need
for efficient, inexpensive means of monitoring the health of reefs that can be
easily used by local participants. A bioindicator is an inexpensive means to
monitor the health of coral reef communities. This research can potentially
yield major benefits for the conservation of coral reef communities in this
region. Mr. Erdmann has conducted research in the Western Pacific area and
stands to gain a good deal more international experience and field expertise in
the course of carrying out this study.
