The principal investigator will continue his investigation of problems in
integral geometry and related areas of geometric analysis. He will attempt to
extend his earlier work on the maximal flat transform on a symmetric space of
compact type to construct all symmetric coverings of such spaces. He will also
study integrals attached to the distinguished class of maximally curved spheres
and look for higher homotopy group information. This award will support research
in the general area of integral geometry. The geometry of a set may often be
analyzed and described by a decomposition of the set into slices. The geometry
of the slices is often fairly simple and easy to describe. The main difficulty
in the analysis is usually the reconstruction of the underlying geometric
features of the entire set from the geometry of the slices. One well know
application of this area of mathematics is the CAT scan.
