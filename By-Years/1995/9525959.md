9525959 Habibian The workshop participants will assess the state-of-the-art and
develop a list of needed research topics on all aspects of pipelines. Such a
list can best be developed through a workshop in which researchers, planners,
designers, operators, and regulators of pipelines can get together and discuss
research needs. It is also important that a forum be available for researchers
in the water and sewer industry to communicate with the researchers in the oil
and gas industry. The findings of the workshop will be documented in a report
which will be made available to the public as an ASCE publication.
