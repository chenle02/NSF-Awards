Guidelines for the design of information presentation formats in computer-based
decision support systems (DSS) are developed. The contingent relationship
between decision strategies and the structure of the decision environment
provides a framework for analyzing the impact of DSS design alternatives on
different decision strategies. The cognitive costs and benefits of different
display formats are evaluated, particularly with respect to the cognitive effort
required to implement various decision strategies and the accuracy of the
resulting decision. Simulation techniques are used to provide specific
predictions of how changes in DSS design will influence behavior. Experimental
observations of decision behavior are used to validate the analysis. The
significance of this line of research is two-fold: First, the results can
provide guidance to researchers and practitioners interested in the design and
implementation of computer- based decision aids, ultimately improving the
effectiveness of those aids. Second, this research provides an extension of an
area of basic research on the psychology of decision making into an important
applied domain.
