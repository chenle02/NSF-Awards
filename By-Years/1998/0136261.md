This proposal seeks support for carrying out two conferences to scope out and
define the scientific and out reach programs that will be done in the
anticipated National underground Science Laboratory at Lead, South Dakota.
Educators, geologists, biologists, and physicists will attend both of these
conferences.

The workshop will produce a white paper defining the nature and the timing of
the science and outreach activities for the underground laboratory. The white
paper will also serve as a guide to aid the baseline design of the laboratory.
