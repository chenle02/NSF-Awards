The Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Georgia Institute of
Technology is an eight week summer research program designed to attract
qualified minority students into the field of electrical engineering. Ten
students of at least junior level undergraduate standing will be recruited on a
nationwide basis and paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to
undertake research projects in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical
Engineering. The students are housed on campus, and in addition to lodging and a
travel allowance, are provided with a $1500/month stipend. At the conclusion of
the summer, the students are expected to prepare both oral and written summaries
of their research projects.
