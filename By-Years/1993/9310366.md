9310366 Entwisle This is a study of change in settlement patterns, road systems,
cropping patterns, and deforestation in Nang Rong, Thailand, integrating social
data collected on the ground with spatial data largely collected by orbiting
satellites. The project will capitalize on the analytic power of Geographic
Information System technology through an assessment of spatial and social co-
occurrences. It will merge satellite data with existing social data collected in
1984 and 1988, and begin descriptive analyses relating social and environmental
change. In addition, it will insure that valuable socio-geographic data are
obtained in fieldwork to be conducted in 1993-1994. This award from the National
Science Foundation greatly enhances the social-scientific payoff from a project
already partially funded by other government agencies. This will be the first
time sociologists have made serious use of data collected by orbiting satellite,
and thus it will provide important information about the potential of this novel
approach. ***
