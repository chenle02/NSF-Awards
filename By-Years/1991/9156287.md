To address the high attrition rate for women in introductory biology courses,
the biology department at this women's college is developing a theme-based,
investigative introductory biology curriculum, whose goals are: (1) to provide a
classroom climate that fosters collaboration and self-directed learning, (2) to
teach science in a manner that emphasizes method over content and stresses
connections to other disciplines and societal issues, and (3) to provide
laboratory experiences that model for students the way in which scientific
knowledge is acquired. Two theme-based introductory courses are being developed
for students interested in a biology major, the Biology of Women and
Environmental Interactions. The course format consists primarily of small group
discussion and computer-based self- tutorial. The laboratories consist of a
series of mini- projects in which student research teams formulate hypotheses,
design and execute experiments, and analyze and disseminate their results. The
proposed curriculum provides a model for educating women in science and
encouraging them to pursue scientific careers.
