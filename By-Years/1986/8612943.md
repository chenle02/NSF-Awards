A workshop will be conducted to determine the research needs in automated
machining of ceramics. A survy of the literature will be mde to serve as
background material for the workshop. Qualified professionals rom several
disciplines will be identified and invited to participate in the workshop to be
held at Clemson University. The participants will be from academia and industry.
Projections have been mde for potential increased use of ceramic materials
because research is leading to improved material properties. A barrier to
broader appliation is the high manufacturing cost for shaping and finishing
ceramic products. This workshop will attempt to identify research needs directed
at improving the efficiency of these manufacturing operations.
