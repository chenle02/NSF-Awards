9605122 Stahly A proven undergraduate summer research program that has been in
operation for several years will be continued and expanded. During the summers
of 1997 through 1999, respectively, 9, 10, and 10 undergraduates will be
supported. As in the past years, recruitment and selection will emphasize women,
minorities, and students from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions, where
opportunities for research are limited. The students selected will be integrated
into the research of participating faculty members and will be expected to
perform like beginning graduate students. The hands-on experience in the
laboratory will be supplemented by informal faculty-student discussions and
weekly seminars. The program will culminate with oral and written presentations
of the students' research. Weekly pizza lunches, two picnics, and a banquet will
facilitate social and scientific interaction. Based on past experience, the
program is expected to stimulate students to pursue careers in science.
