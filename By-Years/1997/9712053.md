Abstract L. Glicksman - CTS 9712053 The principal investigator proposes to study
the influence of fluidized bed hydrodynamics, particularly the characteristics
of the gas layer near the wall and the adjacent clusters of solids and their
contact time, on the heat transfer. The emphasis will be on rough walls and
tube-fin walls. An understanding of the statistical nature of the contact time
is necessary for the future development of models that incorporate radiative
transfer between surface adjacent to the dilute gas-solid mixture and the bed
core.
