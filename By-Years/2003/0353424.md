This research project on highly-excited atoms uses a sequence of half cycle
pulses to engineer targeted final states in high-n Rydberg atoms, initially
creating very-high-n atoms in quasi-1D and near-circular states. Measurements of
quantum beats and their damping will be used to examine collisional decoherence
due to quasi-elastic electron scattering. Ionization through rotational energy
transfer in collisions with polar targets will also be studied with emphasis on
the effect of resonances associated with dipole-supported real and virtual
states. In addition, Rydberg atom.surface interactions under carefully
controlled conditions will be used to explore how atoms evolve as they approach
a surface. The broader impacts involve the education of students and the
application to quantum computing and surface characterization.
