This research program addresses the mechanisms of deterioration of metals and
alloys subjected to erosion and corrosion at high temperatures. Both pure metals
and alloys are exposed to hard particle erosion under controlled atmospheric
conditions. Variables include metal alloy condition, impacting particle size,
particle velocity and impact angle, erosion temperature and gas atmosphere. The
behavior of chromia and alumina scales on the alloys is under examination, as
well as effects of sulfur dioxide present in the gas stream. The nature of the
eroding surfaces are examined to reveal changes in concentration profiles and
metallographic structure.
