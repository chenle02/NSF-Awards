A well-known shortcoming in the nation's scientific infrastructure is the
disparity of opportunity among scientists and researchers. This project provides
forums for researchers from institutions with different levels of resources to
create networks and collaborations and receive mentoring. The project builds
upon previous research on intersectionality and police-civilian interactions,
using an experimental design to advance the science concerning civilian
reactions to police officers. It contributes to our understanding of the
intersections of race, gender, and policing. It also advances the science of the
political dynamics of the relationship between a country and a territory,
furthering the prior (small body of) work on the preferences and views of
citizens residing in such territories. Finally, the research advances the
science of differences between perceptions of rural versus urban residents who
are beneficiaries of public spending, expanding knowledge about general
attitudes toward the recipients of government aid. The project supports networks
and collaborations, mentoring, and funding for pilot projects. These
opportunities can also help draw more undergraduates into the pipeline of
students entering social science and STEM graduate programs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
