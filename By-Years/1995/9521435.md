OCE-9521435 Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor were discovered nearly twenty
years ago, and this discovery led to a new understanding of the oceans. The rate
of flow of water from the vents has never been measured directly, it has only
been estimated, but the rate of flow is a fundamental character of these vents.
Once the flow rate is known, we will be able to answer major questions about
relationship of hydrothermal vents to the chemistry of sea water, and to the
heat released from the earth. This project will developed and test a sensor that
will measure the velocity of fluid flow from hydrothermal chimneys on the ocean
floor.
