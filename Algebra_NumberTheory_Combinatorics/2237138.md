In this project, the PI will study various topics in discrete mathematics and
probability, two areas which have grown significantly in both depth and breadth
in the 21st century, resulting in methods that apply to a number of scientific
disciplines. These include applications, and many significant breakthroughs, in
theoretical computer science and statistical physics, not to mention a number of
other areas of mathematics. The approaches and techniques resulting from this
project will have a significant impact on the development of these areas and
will also be applicable in other branches of mathematics and theoretical
computer science. This project also puts forward a comprehensive plan for
training undergraduate and graduate students.

The broad research goals of this project involve studying set-systems in the
Boolean hypercube from various points of view: combinatorial, probabilistic and
geometric. Up-sets and down-sets in particular appear as basic building blocks
in a number of different areas of mathematics: they encode many events of
interest in probability spaces arising in probabilistic combinatorics and
statistical physics, they arise in extremal set theory, with intersecting
families furnishing an important class of examples, they appear in convex
geometry as discrete analogues of half-spaces, and viewed as simplicial
complexes, they are central objects in simplicial topology. Given the prevalence
of these objects across multiple areas, a better understanding of their various
facets will spur developments across these fields. By targeting a careful
selection of basic problems about set-systems arising from combinatorics,
probability and geometry, the PI aims to develop new analytic, combinatorial,
probabilistic and geometric techniques to study these objects.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
