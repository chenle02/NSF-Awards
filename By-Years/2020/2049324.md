Public health innovations have greatly extended and improved life over the past
two centuries. However, the journey has not been without missteps, and these
mistakes have plausibly affected public confidence in scientific medicine and
support for the public health enterprise. We study the Cutter Incident, the
worst vaccine disaster in U.S. history, in which the initial release of a polio
vaccine in 1955 led over 100,000 children to be vaccinated with live, virulent
polio virus. As a result, several hundred children were paralyzed or died. We
will use archival data to understand how exposure to the Cutter Incident
influenced future vaccination and vaccine equity. We will also use historical
newspapers to study how the government and other key actors were held
accountable for this incident and how exposure conditioned the diffusion of
narratives about scientific medicine and public health through local media. Our
ultimate goal is to study the immediate impact of a public health crisis on
health and health seeking behavior and leverage our unique newspaper data to
show its wider impact on society and policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To estimate
the impact of exposure to the Cutter Incident we combine exogenous variation in
vaccine distribution with novel data. We will compare communities where children
were given contaminated vaccines to communities that only received safe
vaccines. We will also exploit variation in vaccine-associated (but not vaccine-
caused) polio cases. Our first set of outcomes includes health outcomes such as
polio vaccination and measles vaccination as well as vaccine equity. Our second
set of outcomes come from historical newspapers. We have made signiﬁcant
methodological investments to apply advances in deep learning to document layout
analysis to extract headlines, articles and images from over ten million
relevant pages from local newspapers. We will use natural language processing
(NLP) to measure whether the Cutter Incident conditioned how prominent
narratives voiced by public figures, syndicated columnists, and other cultural
icons diffused into communities. We are particularly interested in sentiments
about the trustworthiness and accountability of scientiﬁc medicine and public
health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
