9416614 Ammerman The principal objective of this study is to determine if
planktonic microbial growth in the Sargasso Sea is phosphorus limited. This
objective will be addressed by a combination of chemical, metabolic and biomass
measurements coupled with a series of nutrient-enrichment experiments. The
measurements will made over the course of three cruises aimed at capturing
contrasting spring bloom and summer periods. More frequent time series cruises
will supplement the results fro these three proposed study will measure the
cycling of phosphorus in the Sargasso Sea, which is a major but rarely studied
nutrient which may be limiting autotrophic and heterotrophic planktonic growth.
Phosphorus limitation in such environments could have significant impact on the
global phosphorus cycle and the oceanic component of the global carbon cycle.
The research will also serve to improve analytical methods for measuring
inorganic phosphorus in seawater.
