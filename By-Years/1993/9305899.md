Misiurewicz will investigate the conjecture that the only primary cycles for
disk homeomorphisms are those with entropy zero. He will also look for pseudo-
Anosov cycles of a given period with minimal entropy. A third problem will be to
investigate the pseudo-Anosov cycles of torus homeomorphisms isotopic to the
identity and try to analyze their rotation set. Combinatorial dynamics is a part
of the theory of dynamical systems dealing mainly with existence of periodic
orbits, or cycles, for various types of discrete dynamical systems. By a type of
a cycle one understands in the simplest case of interval maps the way the map
permutes its points. Very often existence of a cycle of a given type forces the
existence of many other types of cycles for the same map. This model situation
admits numerous generalizations.
