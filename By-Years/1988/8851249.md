This award provides funds for the purchase of equipment in the department of
Botany at the University of Maryland, College Park. A four week laboratory
sequence will be developed in General Biology for undergraduate Science Majors
which will challenge students with experimental design, hypothesis testing,
observation, measurement, and data analysis and interpretation. Further, this
unique experimental approach will provide students with an opportunity to work
with sophisticated instrumentation at the introductory level, including phase
contrast microscopes, spectrophotometers, centrifuges, and microcomputers. The
laboratory sequence will included the kinetic analysis of glucose transport in
yeast and an examination of yeast cell structure utilizing phase contrast,
darkfield, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The grantee
institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
