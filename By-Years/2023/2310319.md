This award will cover the travel expenses for a workshop on shared
infrastructure for development of Machine Learning (ML) tools for Electronic
Design Automation (EDA). Although machine learning techniques have demonstrated
their effectiveness in EDA applications and been adopted in industry, such
developments face the bottleneck of tremendous data preparation cost. In
addition, private infrastructures hinder the comparability and reproducibility
of related results of research. This workshop will bring together related
students, academic researchers, industrial experts and government officials to
discuss the needs, challenges and solutions regarding shared infrastructure for
Machine Learning for Electronic Design Automation and outline a roadmap for
future action items. The workshop participants will include attendees from a
diversity of population including women, and members of underrepresented groups.
The workshop summary report will be disseminated for public consumption.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
