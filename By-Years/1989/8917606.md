This investigation will use the variable type framework developed by Feferman
to formalize programming in-the-large and to study alternatives to existing type
systems, taking advantage of the rich type definition mechanisms provided by the
variable type systems. The logical system will be enriched to explore its
potential as a formal specification language and to accommodate even richer
programming language constructs, including imperative features. This research
will seek to provide new insights on the nature of types and specifications that
can be used in the design of programming and specification languages and to
develop tools for programming in- the-large. These insights will provide a basis
for more effective use of formal methods in software design, development, and
evolution.
