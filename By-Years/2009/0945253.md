This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prove the technical
and commercial feasibility of a parallel electron beam (e-beam) lithography
system utilizing an array of individually addressable carbon nanotube (CNT) cold
field emitters. In Phase I, a 3Ã—3 array of individually addressable CNT electron
guns will be built and a suitable array of microcolumns will be explored. A
higher throughput e-beam lithography system based on an array of electron
sources will be built and characterized and is anticipated to achieve better
than 10 nm patterning capability.

This novel nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) technology will enable a low cost
nanoscale lithography system for general laboratory usage, thus significantly
increasing the accessibility of nanoscale patterning. The work will be conducted
in an Industry, University, Government collaboration and thus facilitate the
transfer of knowledge amongst these entities.
