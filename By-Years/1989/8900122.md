Phase equilibrince will be determined for the polyethylene - propane system,
including both solid-liquid and liquid-gas phase boundaries, using a view cell
(isopleth method). This method was successful in earlier work with
unfractionated polyethylene at 100 to 130 degrees centigrade and 9,000 to 11,000
psi. Data will be collected on fractions of high density polyethylene. The
effect of agitation during crystallization on polymer morphology will also be
examined. The data will be used to design and test a semi-continuous process for
the fractionation of high density polyethylene by crystallization from a
supercritical fluid. Although polymers have been shown to be fractionable by
molecular weight from supercritical fluids, such processes have been based on
the coexistence of liquid and gas phases. The process attempted here will be
based on solid/supercritical gas coexistence. Advanced polymer technology plays
a central role in scenarios for development of advanced engineering materials.
One critical aspect of advanced polymer manufacturing is production of polymers
with a narrow molecular weight distribution. By economically separating polymer
molecules by molecular weight after polymerization this technology becomes
another tool for producing advanced materials.
