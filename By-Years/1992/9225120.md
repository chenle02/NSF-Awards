Investigations of nuclear structure will be carried out by gamma ray
spectroscopy with large detector arrays, conversion electron spectroscopy and by
transient field and tilted-foil Beta NMR techniques. These studies will be
conducted at several laboratories: LBL, Argonne, Yale, Florida State, Rochester,
and Daresbury. The onset of collective motion in neutron-deficient polonium
nuclei and the nature of the superdeformed excitations in mass A - 194 nuclei
will be investigated. Electromagnetic moments will be measured in a wide range
of light to heavy nuclei in order to study the interplay between single particle
and collective excitations, and to probe the structure of exotic nuclei far-
from-stability, or at high spin or excitation energy.
