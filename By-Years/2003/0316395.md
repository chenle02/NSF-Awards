The focus of this research is in the development of multi-functional polymers
that can alter and change recognition properties. This is accomplished by the
use of restricted rotation about C(aryl)-N(imide) bonds. The molecules can be
annealed in the presence of a guest to form complementary structures. These can
then be "saved" as stable conformers by cooling to room temperature. "Saved"
conformations can be "erased" by heating in the absence of guest or "rewritten"
by heating with a different guest. The proposed mechanism for this behavior
shares some similarities with dynamic biological processes such as protein
folding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this renewal award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
efforts of Dr. Ken Shimizu of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, S.C. Professor Shimizu will focus
his research on the development of "smart polymers" capable of recognizing
particular molecules. This research will contribute to the fundamental
understanding of the principles governing the behavior of polymeric materials.
Chemistry students at the graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral level will
be trained in Professor Shimizu's laboratory, and outreach activities to K-12
students will be extended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
