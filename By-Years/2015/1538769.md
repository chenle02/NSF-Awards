In 2012, over 160,000 master's degrees were awarded in science and engineering
fields by U.S. institutions; ten years earlier, it was less than 100,000. In
some fields, the master's degree is the desired (if not required) qualification
for initial employment and professional advancement. Accompanying the growth and
labor market need is an assessment by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that jobs
that require a master's degree at entry-level will grow by 18% in the next
decade. As the number of master's degree holders in the U.S. economy grows, it
is critically important to understand how these individuals have an impact on
the U.S. S&amp;E enterprise. The purpose of this project is to examine workforce
outcomes, career mobility and the value of a master's education in science and
engineering in the U.S. The project seeks to enrich discussions about continued
public support for and investment in master's education, and suggest a framework
for linking the production of master's degrees with workforce and economic goals
using national data collection efforts as the
centerpiece.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce original research
that employs data from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) to
broadly explore these domains of inquiry: migration, career mobility, and
individual monetary and non-monetary benefit-cost relations for master's
education. The project will include a stakeholder meeting to synthesize findings
of the research with insights from graduate deans, workforce and industry
leaders and federal data experts focused on three questions: (1) How can
existing data be used as metrics for labor market outcomes assessment of
master's education?; (2) How can existing data facilitate alignment between
master's education and workforce needs at the national and regional levels?; and
3) How can current national data collection efforts, including the NSCG, be
augmented to better capture other labor market outcomes' assessment metrics,
such as subsequent career mobility and satisfaction of master's degree holders?
