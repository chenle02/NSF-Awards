This project is to organize a joint US/Central Europe workshop on civil
infrastructure systems research. The workshop will be held in Poland, with
participation from US and other Central European countries. Because of
increasing interest in hazard mitigation and civil infrastructure systems in the
Central European countries, and also because of our own emphasis on research on
engineering renewal of infrastructure systems, the project is timely. The
workshop is intended to provide an excellent forum for exchange of scientific
information on civil infrastructure systems and an opportunity to explore future
cooperative research between the scientists from the US and highly trained
engineering researchers from the Central European countries participating in the
workshop.
