Average plate velocities for many of the large plates have been known for
sometime based on radiometric dates of magnetic strips on the seafloor.
Recently, work has indicated that plate velocities may vary in concert on
geologically brief time scales without violating plate circuit closure
requirements. This project will test this idea by combining available marine
data on seafloor topography, magnetic and geochronologic information for the
east Pacific basin. Results should indicate if short-interval plate velocity
changes are real, and if so should help to determine the causative factors.
