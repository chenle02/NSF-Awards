Delineation of crustal elements of different origins and histories found in
ancient orogenic belts is a prerequisite to meaningful tectonic analysis. In the
S. Appalachian orogen, a classic collisional system, it has proven difficult to
convincingly assign units to Laurentia or to the opposing continental mass,
Gondwana. Lack of clear-cut evidence has stymied full understanding of the
otherwise well-known belt that has been instrumental in the development of major
tectonic concepts. This project will investigate the hypothesis that the Smith
River Allochthon in the Piedmont Zone, previously thought to be of peri-
Laurentian or transitional affinity is, in fact, of exotic (Gondwana) origin.
Results are of considerable local importance, and because the Appalachians
provide an influential model for interpretation of other ancient tectonic belts,
has broad significance.
