This project is concerned with the allocation of network resources, specifically
buffer and bandwidth, to users and to virtual paths in an Asynchronous Transfer
Mode network. The research concentrates on developing a framework for analysis
of this resource allocation probelm. Users are assumed to receive benefit as a
function of their quality of service. measured by cell loss probability and
completion time for real-time services. Network usage is measured using
effective bandwidth and buffer occupancy. The paradigm of price and demand is
used to represent the minimal required information transfer between user and
network. These prices are considered purely as internal network indicators for
the purpose of resource allocation; what users are actually charged by their
service provider is a separate issue not considered here. The goal is to
allocate bandwidth and buffer so as to make as many users happy as possible, and
to do so efficiently. Furthermore, it is desirable that any such mechanism be
distributed both hierarchically and geographically. The P.I. proposes to develop
this framework to jointly allocate buffer and bandwidth, to study the use of
priorities to replace explicit reservation of resources, and to analyze the
resulting network dynamics.
