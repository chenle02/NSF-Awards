Partial travel support will be provided for thirteen key speakers to participate
in the 1988 International Conference on Physics of Shallow Estuaries and Bays.
This Conference will include sessions to address a series of major scientific
problem areas in shallow bays and estuaries - residual currents, mixing and
dispersion, salt and mass transport, sedi- ment transport, circulation and
fronts, the sediment-water interface, and interdisciplinary studies.
