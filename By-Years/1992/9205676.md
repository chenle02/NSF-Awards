This award provides funding for the development of a laser probe source to be
used in conjunction with an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer system
(ICP-MS) for applications in the earth sciences. A new ICP-MS unit, renovated
laboratory in which to house it, and technical support staff are being provided
by the University of Arizona. The laser probe will be developed in the
University of Arizona's Department of Geosciences. ICP-MS is currently utilized
in earth sciences research as a rapid and accurate method of quantitative bulk
analysis for rock and mineral samples which must first be put in solution phase
before being introduced into the plasma flow to the mass spectrometer unit. The
development of a small diameter laser beam source that would directly ablate
solid samples will provide an extremely powerful method of in situ microanalysis
with good spatial resolution of less than 100 microns.
