Autonomous systems have the potential to transform society by assisting people
in activities ranging from household elder care to space exploration. Such
agents need to be versatile enough to solve a range of tasks without prior task-
specific programming. However, it is difficult to compute the behavior that an
autonomous agent should execute in order to achieve a new objective (e.g., to
search for rocks with high moisture content). This project will develop a new
framework and algorithms that utilize the principle of abstraction to
efficiently compute task-specific behavior for autonomous agents in a domain-
independent fashion. Since abstraction blurs detail in general, this principle
has been difficult to employ in practice -- plans computed using abstract models
can miss details, and can be dangerous to use with real-world autonomous
systems. This project will develop new methods that keep track of imprecision
created by abstraction and effectively resolve it, to efficiently compute
reliable plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More precisely, this project will develop a
formal framework for analyzing and creating abstract models that are sound,
i.e., they permit only correct inferences (and possibly a subset of correct
inferences) with regard to the most accurate model available. In general, such
models distinguish model imprecision caused by abstraction from non-determinism
or stochasticity inherent in the domain. It will develop new paradigms for
efficient planning using sound abstract models while remaining provably correct
with regard to the most accurate model available. These planning paradigms
address settings with and without uncertainty; they will also allow AI systems
to compute complex plans by automatically composing planners that are
independently designed to be efficient for different types of abstract
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
