The future of wireless networking will be heterogeneous, making use of various
air interfaces with a wide variety of capabilities and constraints. It will
empower people through a digital environment that is aware of their presence and
context and sensitive to their needs. Unfortunately, today's air interfaces
merely co-exist, and very little has been achieved in making them co-operate to
provide robust, secure, and scalable networks. Two main issues hinder the
successful deployment of such networks: limitation of resources and
vulnerability of robustness and security of communications among heterogeneous
devices. The complexity and criticality of these issues increase with the size
of the network and the variety of the devices that compose it. This project
investigates the design and prototyping of cross-layer communication protocols
and resource-management strategies to accommodate variations in the environment
(traffic characteristics, channel quality, topology and mobility, energy, and
adversary attacks). The approach is based on theoretical concepts such as
generalized conflict-graphs, linear programming, coding and information theory,
but also heuristic techniques for cross-layer resources cost-metrics, adaptive
physical-layer, and contention-aware routing. The project considers a cross-
layer approach to robustness against adversaries. The outcomes of the project
are two fold: cross-layer algorithms and protocols for robust, scalable and
secure communication, and evaluation tools including simulators and prototypes.
The development of an innovative networking technology for "ambient
intelligence" will be a significant enabling factor in the development of a
vibrant, inclusive, safe, and productive society where access to services and
information is cheap, transparent, and, most importantly, secure. &lt;br/&gt;
