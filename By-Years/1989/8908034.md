The Princeton Biophysics group has had an ongoing program over the last 20 years
(1) to develop area x-ray detectors based on the principle of image-intensified
phosphor screens which are recorded by slow-scan TV cameras and (2) to apply
these detectors to research problems in the biological and materials sciences.
We propose to develop a new design of detector which would have quantum limited
sensitivity, a 75mm wide input area, high resolution, and low signal-induced
background. This new design builds on successful earlier detector designs but
utilizes newly available fiber-optic and CCD sensor technology to provide
unprecedented performance. The detector will be integrated into a small-angle
x-ray diffraction system to be applied to the study of the structure and
properties of biomembranes and biopolymers. The detector is especially suitable
for synchrontron radiation experiments and will be used for time-resolved and
Laue synchrotron radiation studies.
