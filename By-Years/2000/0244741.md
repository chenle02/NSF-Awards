Abstract for the award DMS-0244741 of
Kable&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prehomogeneous vector spaces are linked to
arithmetic by a series of remarkable parameterizations of arithmetical objects
(number Fields of various degrees and ideal classes in such Fields) by the
semistable orbit spaces of certain prehomogeneous vectorspaces. It is proposed
to develop the properties of the correspondence between the orbit space of
quadruples of quinary alternating forms and the set of isomorphism classes of
quintic rings and to use this correspondence to study the distribution of the
discriminants of quintic number Fields and other aspects of the arithmetic of
these Fields. It is further proposed to link the zeta distributions of
prehomogeneous vector spaces to the L-functions of modular forms, at first in
specific examples and then in general, and to investigate the arithmetic
consequences of this connection. It is proposed to develop the Rankin-Selberg
theory of the Asai L-function on the general linear group, both locally and
globally, and to apply this theory to conjectures, such as those of Jacquet and
Prasad, concerning the properties of distinguished representations of this
group. It is further proposed to establish the compatibility of theRankin-
Selberg and Langlands-Shahidi approaches to this L-function and to extend the
results to twisted L-functions on other groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
proposal represents work in the general area of number theory. Number theory is
the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of
mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a
driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the
discipline. The Langlands program is a general philosophy that connects number
theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole
numbers. &lt;br/&gt;
