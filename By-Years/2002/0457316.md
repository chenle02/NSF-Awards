This experimental research program focuses on the study of phase matching of
high-order harmonics generated by intense laser pulses in gas cells. In
particular, the group will investigate laser propagation relating to harmonic
production in a semi-infinite cell geometry, filled with either neon or helium
in the neighborhood of 100 torr. This regime has been found to produce bright
directional harmonics up to 100 orders. The emission is dramatically enhanced
when an iris is partially closed on the laser beam at the focusing lens.
Specially prepared counter-propagating pulses will be used to probe regions of
harmonic production within the cell both longitudinally and radially. The
broader impact of the program involves student education and applications to
polarimetry.
