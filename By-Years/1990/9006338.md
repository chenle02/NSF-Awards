Low-Temperature experiments will probe the manifestation of quantum mechanics on
a macroscopic scale: tunneling of the magnetization of ferrite particles down to
1mK; NMR studies on a heavy-fermion superconductor to look for the existence of
multiple sc phases; examination by acoustic techniques of the fundamental
properties of superfluid 3He and its modified behavior in a thin-film
configuration.
