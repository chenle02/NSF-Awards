As the baby boomers enter retirement, medical cost becomes significant. In 2014,
health care accounted for more than 20% of US spending. The wearable medical
device provides a solution to alleviate this problem since it can sense,
process, and transmit biomedical signals and identify abnormal signals using
predefined algorithms and signal processing hardware, and call for help when
necessary. It is also a critical component for the future unmanned medical
nursing system. However, current wearable medical devices cannot perform real-
time signal processing and transmission due to the limited battery power supply.

In this I-Corps project, the team plans to explore market opportunities of its
proposed non-weighted and asynchronous digital circuits in wearable medical
devices. The team's proposed technology is based on pulse-based digital
neuromorphic circuits and asynchronous radio systems, which replace the
conventional multi-bit binary adders and multipliers in linear signal processing
and the synchronization process in wireless communication, respectively. The
proposed methods provide a low-power and low-complexity solution for digital and
radio circuit design. These methods don't require modification of the current
digital signal processing algorithm or integrated circuit fabrication
technology. This allows the proposed technology to be easily adopted in current
designs, extending the battery lifetime of the system, providing more processing
capability and enhancing the power efficiency of the radio devices. In addition,
the proposed wearable medical device can be extended to entertainment and sports
training products, which are also important and promising markets.
