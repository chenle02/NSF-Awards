A study conducted by Peter Rossi and his associates at the University of
Massachusetts has resulted in a rich data base on the attitudes and actions of a
sample of key local and state officials with regards to hazard mitigation and
preparedness policies. This study will subject that data base to additional
analysis. A technique known as block clustering analysis will be used to better
understand those who champion natural hazard mitigation and preparedness
policies, those who are indifferent or neutral, and those who oppose them. The
original data will be coded to meet the requirements of the block clustering
program; the data will be clustered using the program; the results of the
clustering will be analyzed to yield profiles of the various types of decision
makers; and the results will be presented in a research report.
