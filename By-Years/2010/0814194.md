&lt;br/&gt; The Kentucky (KY) EPSCoR RII-7 proposal unites eight institutions,
University of Kentucky, Berea College, Centre College of Kentucky, Kentucky
State University, Morehead State University, Northern Kentucky University,
University of Louisville, and Eastern Kentucky University, to continue the
strategy of investing in infrastructure to develop Kentucky?s ?New Economy? by
supporting research in Innovative Materials and Devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
pursue two major research initiatives. Initiative in Innovative Materials and
Devices is focused on studies of bulk single-crystal transition metal oxides and
epitaxial thin films with complementary functionalities, and applications of
multilayered thin films for molecular electrodes as well as for single-molecule
magnets. The other part of the project will focus on engineering new platforms
to enhance our understanding of a single cell or multiple cell types,
interactions between individual cells and cell types, and sensing at the
molecular, intracellular and intercellular levels. A statewide Micro/Nano
Network will advance micro/nanotechnology and the many fields that utilize this
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky
EPSCoR has developed a comprehensive plan for increasing diversity and
evaluating progress in that area. Programs such as seed-funding that supports
research at regional institutions and a program to involve diverse populations
of Kentucky students in research will be supported through EPSCoR. A special
program for computer science graduate students at Kentucky State University will
be introduced. Kentucky EPSCoR also proposes the cyberinfrastructure plans for
the state, and augments them with support for increasing the expertise and
developing new sources of talent. The project is consistent with the state?s
science and technology plan, and the associated higher education plan. The
project will develop new facilities and establish new faculty and staff
positions in the bio-, nano-, &amp; cyber-technology areas. Kentucky EPSCoR has
developed a review process intended to identify infrastructure that should
support the most promising research. A system of evaluation metrics has been
developed to determine whether a strategy is working, and if it is improving
Kentucky?s competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;
