Dr. Joseph Patterson will lead a world-wide collaboration of professionals and
amateurs to obtain continuing observations of cataclysmic variable stars. These
objects consist of a white dwarf star with a close companion which is
transferring mass onto the white dwarf via an accretion disk. These objects can
exhibit large, irregular, and rapid changes in brightness (hence the term
"cataclysmic"). Depending on the type of the companion and its proximity to the
white dwarf, the system can have complicated changes in the amount of and
spectrum of the emitted light, from which much can be learned about the nature
of the accretion disk and the rate of mass transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over
the last ten years, Dr. Patterson has assembled a worldwide network of small
photometric telescopes, called the Center for Backyard Astrophysics. Through
this network, astronomers are able to study periodic phenomena in unprecedented
detail. This network of (mostly) amateur astronomers is now a major element in
the research interface of amateur and professional astronomers. During this
project, new efforts will expand the observations beyond the realm of
cataclysmic variables. This program represents a symbiosis of the amateur's
traditional interest in discovery with the physicist's traditional interest in
experiments leading to confrontation with theory. With the widespread closing of
small telescopes at professional observatories, this type of collaboration is
necessary for the continuing study of periodic and aperiodic phenomena in
cataclysmic variables.
