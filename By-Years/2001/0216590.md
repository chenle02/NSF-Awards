This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technology that uses state-of-the-art
techniques for modeling finite rate chemistry in chemically reacting turbulent
flows with recently developed numerical methods for solving systems of non-
linear equations. In Phase I an improved CFD solver was developed that used
reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms to model finite rate chemistry effect and
solved the resulting stiff system of partial differential equations with a
matrix-free Newton-Krylov method. In Phase II two Newton-Krylov based CFD tools
will be developed, one to model combustion from turbulent, diffusion flames and
the second to model turbulent, pre-mixed flames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
commercial potential for this work is the electric power industry, designers and
builders of commercial chemical plants, and designers of chemical process
heaters and other industrial furnace applications.
