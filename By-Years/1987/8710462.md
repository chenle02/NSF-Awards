The goal of this proposal is to obtain basic information on the mechanisms by
which the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones are regulated in
ectothermal vertebrates The initial focus will be on hypothalamic factors that
control thyrotropin (TSH) and gonadotropin (FSH and LDH secretion and on
peripheral factors that modulate pituitary sensitivity to these factors in
reptiles and amphibians. The young turtle will serve as a model reptilian system
and the bullfrog will serve as an amphibian model, with limited comparisons with
other orders. A. TSH Secretion: TSH regulation will focus on the role of the
hypothalamic tripeptide, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), whose role in
amphibians and rrptiles is poorly understood. We will also examine actions of
potential stimulators and inhibitors from the brain and periphery, especially
thyroid hormones, that may modulate pituitary responsiveness to TRH. Acute and
chronic thermal effects on pituitary responsiveness will be examined in the
context of exogeous control. Attempts will be made to analyze pituitary growth
hormone and prolactin responses concomitantly in all studies, and in vitro
thyroidal TSH sensitivity will be measured in parallel. B. Gonadotropin
Secretion: Studies on the regulation of gonadotropin will have two foci:1) The
role of steroids in modulating pituitary sensitivity to gonadotropin releasing
hormone will be studied in relation to the ontogeny and maintenance of sexual
dimorphism in responsiveness to this hyhpothalamic peptide. 2) Attention will be
directed for the first time to the role of nonsteroidal gonadal secretions
(based on mammalian inhibin) in differentially modulating pituitary FSH and LH
secretion. These studies should provide a foundation for understanding the
evolution of hypothalamo-pituitary regulation and its integration with
peripheral endocrine targets in ectothermal tetrapods.
