Newly developed nucleic acid probes will be used to study nitrogen cycling
between dissolved substrate pools and bacteriain estuarine, coastal and open
ocean waters. It is anticipatedthat the implementation of these techniques will
provide and approach to examine the relative importance of bacterial nitrogen
sources where multiple sources with varying nutritional values are available.
The focus of this research will be: 1) to complete the adaptation of a nucleic
acid isolation/isotope measurement technique, which was used to trace bacterial
carbon sources in estuarine waters, to one that will trace bacterial nitrogen
sources in eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, 2) to continue development and
field testing of a method to measure stable nitrogen isotopes in dissolved
organic matter, and 3) to compare the isotopic discrimination between bacteria
(isolated as nucleic acids) and nitrogen sources in eutrophic and oligotrophic
waters. Field work will be conducted on a transect from the Trinity River, Texas
to the mouth of Galveston Bay out additional stations along the standard
transect from Galveston Bay out to the 2000 m isobath in the Gulf of Mexico.
