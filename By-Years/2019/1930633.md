The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) workshop is an annual event with the goal of
encouraging participation of junior researchers in integer programming and
related areas. A primary focus of this workshop is to showcase young
researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early
stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to
network with the world's top researchers. This award will provide funds for 6
graduate students to attend the 16th MIP workshop, each of whom will be
presenting his or her poster at the workshop. MIP student poster sessions
provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network
with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student
posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are
recognized. This award provides travel support for 6 student poster presenters.

The 2019 MIP workshop will be held from July 15 to July 18, 2019 in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. The solicitation for the poster presentations will be sent to a
variety of mailing lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by
attracting students from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing
travel funds for graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of
attendance to encourage participation of students and will support the
engagement of STEM students in emerging research in the field of MIP.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
