9360530 Owen This research program involves an autonomous and adaptive subsea
sensor that measures very-near seafloor fluid flows, suspended particulates, and
momentum exchanges in the coastal environment. We use computer-aided speckle
interferometry to deduce a two- dimensional flow field from particulate speckle
patterns. Particulates are sampled through long-distance microscopy. The sensor
has a temporal resolution greater than 33 ms over sub- millimeter to meter
scales. The system includes a laser, microprocessor, video cameras, optics, and
a recorder. Power requirements are low--the sensor operates autonomously for
months. We conserve power with neural networks--the sensor monitors
environmental changes and samples accordingly.
