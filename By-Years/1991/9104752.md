This award provides two-thirds of the funds required to upgrade the equipment
in the paleomagnetics laboratory of the Department of Geology and Planetary
Science at the University of Pittsburgh. The University is committed to
providing the remaining funds needed for the equipment acquisition. A
cryogenically superconducting magnetometer, thermal demagnetizer, and sample
transport system will be installed. The paleomagnetics lab will use the upgraded
equipment in research projects that include paleostratigraphic analysis of
samples from northeastern USSR, magnetite formation in prokaryotes and the role
of bacteria in the magnetization of sediments, cave sediment magnetostratigraphy
(dating) in classic hominid fossil sites of Africa.
