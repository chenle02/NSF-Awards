The objective of the proposed research is to determine whether faithful organ-
specific patterns of tomato gene expression can be reproduced in a transient
assay system. If so, the functional analysis of promoter elements believed to
control transcription during development and differentiation will be tested. A
number of conserved DNA-sequence motifs have been identified in the promoters of
the five gene encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5- bisphosphate
carboxylase in tomato. Many of these motifs interact with proteins, and patterns
of protein binding to the promoters change in correlation with organ specific
and developmentally regulated changes in transcription. %%% The fidelity of
organ-specific and developmentally regulated expression will be tested in the
transient system using several promoters whose expression patterns are known. A
carefully characterized transient assay system such as this would be extremely
useful for analysis of gene expression in tomato.
