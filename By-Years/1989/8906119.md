The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Edwin
Vedejs of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
He will explore the development of new phosphorus based reagents for carbon-
carbon double bond synthesis, continue his studies of rearrangements and develop
a new method for detecting reactive intermediates. These studies will provide
new methods for synthesizing the complex molecules needed by modern agriculture
and medicine. The investigation will focus on topics at the inferface of
synthetic and mechanistic organic chemistry. New organophosphorus ylides will be
explored to develop practical reagents for preparation of di- and trisubstituted
alkenes with strict control of stereochemistry. Emphasis will be placed on
E-selective reagents. The mechanism of the important phosphorus-based olefin
synthesis will be explored in detail to settle the controversy regarding ionic
intermediates. A new pulse NMR method for monitoring transient intermediates
will be evaluated. If the method succeeds in the organophosphorus problem, it
will be extended to study other reactions involving short-lived intermediates.
Unusual routes to synthetically useful transient species will also be explored.
Other topics with an emphasis on mechanism and stereocontrol will include the
study of osmium tetroxide hydroxylation of alkenes under the influence of near
by heteroatoms in medium sized rings and analogous structures. Stereocontrol
based on related local conformer effects will be featured in a total synthesis
of 14-membered macrolide antibiotics. New techniques for synthesis of medium and
large ring structures will be probed, including sulfoxide cartwheel and allene-
driven sigmatropic rearrangements.
