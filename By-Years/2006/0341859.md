The International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis is
&lt;br/&gt;held in conjunction with the 19th Shanks Lecture Series, featuring
&lt;br/&gt;Steve Smale as the Shanks speaker. This conference plays a crucial
&lt;br/&gt;role in impacting developments of science and technology based on
&lt;br/&gt;computational harmonic analysis, identifying new trends, and
&lt;br/&gt;providing an important common link to other scientific and
&lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines at large. The emphasis of the conference is
&lt;br/&gt;on the state-of-the-art developments on such topics as learning
&lt;br/&gt;theory, computational mathematics, and applications to signal/image
&lt;br/&gt;processing, information technology, and life sciences. It is intended
&lt;br/&gt;to highlight computational mathematics and its connections with
&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research areas, and brings researchers and graduate
&lt;br/&gt;students together for in-depth discussions on all aspects of
&lt;br/&gt;computational harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of
computational harmonic analysis is a recently &lt;br/&gt;established and still
fast growing area of mathematical analysis. It &lt;br/&gt;has been providing
common links and tools to other areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematical sciences,
natural and life sciences, and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;New developments with a
very broad spectrum of applications, such as&lt;br/&gt;wavelets, frames, radial
basis functions, spline functions, curve and &lt;br/&gt;surface subdivisions,
sampling, and learning theory, have found their &lt;br/&gt;mathematical home in
computational harmonic analysis. This forum for &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary
research is expected to continue for the &lt;br/&gt;foreseeable future.
