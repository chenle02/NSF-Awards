This award is to conduct the annual grantees conference of the Division of
Design and Manufacturing Systems. By encouraging interaction between the
grantees of this Division, the Engineering Research Centers Division and some of
the grantees of the Computer Information Science and Engineering Directorate,
this conference ensures that the individual researchers are informed about the
ongoing activities of their colleagues. An elimination of duplication of their
efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result from this
activity. An overall improvement of efficiency of the research activity could be
expected. In addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time
to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective research
community at the meeting, with feedback and input from the National Science
Foundation. Finally, personal contacts with the grantees and program officers in
the Divisions should contribute to clarifying many current problems in their
work. Principal investigators attending the conference usually gain a one to two
year lead on the information disseminated; this is the usual time frame for
materials presented at the conference to be published in journals and other
literature.
