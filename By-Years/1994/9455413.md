9455413 Mushinsky A new, integrated course in natural sciences will be developed
for non-science majors. This course will be the cornerstone for a two-tier,
interdisciplinary curriculum in the natural sciences. The proposed course,
"Fundamentals of Natural Science" (FNS), differs from traditional science
offerings in both content and delivery. FNS will be designed to build a
foundation for scientific literacy, develop habits of mind consonant with
critical thinking, and give students the sense of discovery and accomplishment
that comes from "doing science." Because contemporary students have a keen
interest in their environment, examples from the natural environment will be
selected to illustrate the basic concepts of science under consideration. The
examples will be explored in a set of learning exercises designed specifically
to promote active inquiry and cooperative learning. These exercises will be
developed by faculty and teaching assistants with guidance from the USF Center
for Teaching Enhancement. A textbook and exercise manual will be developed. The
faculty in the project are a biologist, chemist, geologist, physicist, and an
educational psychologist.
