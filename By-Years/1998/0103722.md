University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;System and Compiler Support for Component-Based
Construction of Scalable Internet Services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal
investigators propose to investigate system and compiler support for an emerging
class of Scalable Internet Service (SIS) applications. This proposed work will
be motivated by the emergence of the Internet as the global, ubiquitous
networking infrastructure, and its accompanying computing model where much of
the computing takes place on servers rather than local machines. SIS
applications provide a rich set of services such as on-line auctions, stock
exchanges, and instant messaging to diverse clients
worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
