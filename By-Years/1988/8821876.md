The contractor will carry out Cycle III of the National Survey of Academic
Research Instruments and Instrumentation Needs, a sample survey of higher
education institutions that collects data on science and engineering research
equipment. A Baseline Survey was conducted in 1982/83 followed three years later
by an update Cycle II study. Tasks involved in Cycle III include conduct of data
collection activities, tabulation of data results, provision of technical
support as required for the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) own analytical
uses of the data, and production of a final analytical report summarizing the
results of the study. Section 7 of Public Law 96-44 directs NSF to "...develop
indices, correlates, or other suitable measures or indicators of the status of
scientific instrumentation in the United States and of the current and projected
need for scientific and technologic- al instrumentation." This project,
initiated in response to the above mandate, provides measures of equipment
status in the academic sector.
