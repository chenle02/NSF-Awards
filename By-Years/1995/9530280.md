9530280 Heinrichs This research will test a new model which explains sedimentary
organic matter preservation in terms of strong adsorption to mineral particles
in sediments. In the model, preservation depends on the concentration and
solubilization rate of labile organic matter, the adsorption coefficient of
dissolved organic substances, the sediment accumulation and bioturbation rates,
and the decomposition rates of adsorbed and dissolved organic matter. The model
not only explains global patterns of organic matter preservation, but also the
general lack of preservation of terrigenous organic matter and kerogen in the
marine environment. The test of the model will involve: (1) measurement of
adsorption and desorption of proteins, polyamino acids, and melanoidins by clay
minerals and iron oxide, (2) studies of the decomposition of these adsorbed
substances in coastal sediments, and (3) measurements of the adsorption of
natural sediment hydrolyzable amino acids and organic matter. If supported by
results of this research, the proposed model would explain the large differences
in organic matter preservation in different sedimentary environments, a key
process in the long-term global carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycles. This
would aid interpretation of the sedimentary record of organic matter
accumulation in both recent and ancient sediments. The model could improve
predictions of the effects of changes in ocean productivity and sedimentation,
due to human activities or natural phenomena, on sedimentary carbon accumulation
in continental margins.
