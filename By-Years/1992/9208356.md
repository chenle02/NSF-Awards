Partial funding for a microprocessor-controlled, variable- temperature,
recording circular dichroism spectrometer is requested. The instrument will be
supervised on a daily basis by the Principal Investigator (Michael Y. Ogawa) who
will use it to determine the conformational behavior of synthetic polypepties
derivatized for electron-transfer studies. The instrument will also be used
extensively by the co-Principal Investigator (N. B. Leontis) to monitor the
conformational behavior of novel nucleic acid structures such as three-way DNA
and RNA junctions and their interactions with intercalating ligands. In
addition, the instrument will be used by George Bullerjahn in the Department of
Biological Sciences at BGSU to monitor structural transitions in photosynthetic
membranes. Minor projects from other users in the Department of Chemistry at
both BGSU and the University of Toledo are also described. There is no
comparable instrumentation available in Northwest Ohio.
