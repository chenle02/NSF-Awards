A system of planets with masses and orbital periods similar to Venus, Earth and
Mars should be detectable in the nearby alpha Centauri star system using the
current Doppler precision of 2 m/s and extreme cadence: hundreds of observations
per night, every possible night. This observing cadence could achieve an
effective (phase-binned) precision of a few centimeters per second, which would
be sufficient to detect the reflex motion caused by such planets.

This award will fund an initial 12-month program in which Dr. Fischer and
collaborators will use the recently decommissioned Blanco spectrometer, fiber-
coupled to the 1.5-m Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System
(SMARTS) consortium telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory
(CTIO). Preliminary observations made in August 2007 provided a promising set of
radial velocities for the Sun, suggesting that this spectrometer should be
capable of producing high precision radial velocities. This program has the
potential to catalyze dramatic changes in the strategy for ground-based Doppler
surveys that will help inform future allocation of science funding and
resources.

This program is a critical step for assessing whether the Doppler technique can
be extended to the search for potentially habitable, terrestrial planets. The
results could impact funding and programmatic decisions about space missions and
could contribute to informing the next Decadal Review about planet detection
strategies. This program will also re-invigorate use of a currently
undersubscribed 1.5-m telescope at CTIO, providing an important new capability
to SMARTS and the user community in general. The observations will also provide
unprecedented information about stellar structure and convective zones,
differentially comparing the GO star, alpha Centauri A, and the KO star, alpha
Centauri B.
