This award will support the DAGS 1993 summer school (June 24- 30, 1993) on
parallel programming. The school will teach the data parallel language NESL, as
well as give tutorials in the languages C* and High Performance Fortran(HPF).
Attendees for the school are expected from both industry and academia and will
consist of graduate students, junior faculty, a select number of undergraduates,
theoreticians interested in parallel programming, and scientists from
application areas. The school follows the DAGS summer symposium on parallel I/O
and databases, two often-neglected, but critically important, topics. The school
on parallel programming will treat, within a practical context, issues raised
during the symposium. Students will program and produce homework solutions with
supervision from school faculty. Students will also have the benefit of
interacting with various experts during the symposium.
