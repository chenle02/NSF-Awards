A broad program of research in atomic and molecular physics and chemistry will
continue in seven inter-related areas: (1) Fundamental and precision
measurements, using the latest advances in atomic metrology coupled with new
developments in lasers. (2) Atom-single photon interactions, using trapped
localized atoms and a variety of electromagnetic fields. (3) Dynamics of atoms
and their interaction with static fields, including both theoretical and
experimental studies of atomic structure. (4) Atom-electron, atom-atom, and
atom-atom-photon interactions, studying the properties of atomic collisions and
energy transfer over a broad range of temperature. (5) Simple molecular systems,
including studies of excitation and breakup of such systems. (6) More complex
molecules and clusters, including studies of various bonding mechanisms and the
properties of unusual aggregates of atoms. (7) Technology development,
principally the development of more precise control over electromagnetic
radiation and of more precisely localized ultra-low temperature atomic traps.
Each research topic contains both theoretical and experimental elements.
