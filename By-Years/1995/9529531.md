9529531 Jones This is an award to provide support for conduct of a symposium and
workshop on advanced oxidation technologies as applied to the treatment of
water, wastewater, exhaust gases and remediation of soil. The purpose of this
symposium is to critically review the current status of advanced oxidation
processes being used and considered for use in environmental engineering
practice as a step toward defining further research needs. Session topics will
include ozonation, photolysis and photocatalysis, non-thermal plasmas, electron
beam radiation, electrohydraulic cavitation and sonolysis, supercritical
oxidation, and combined processes. This symposium is cosponsored by the Electric
Power Research Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy. Results are expected
to provide guidance for current use of advanced oxidation technologies in
environmental engineering practice and to identify further research needed to
provide the basis for engineering design of systems utilizing these processes
for abatement of pollution and in remediation of contaminated environmental
resources.
