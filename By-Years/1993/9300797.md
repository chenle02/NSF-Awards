This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. It is a study of Jewish Christianity, a religious movement that
presents a challenge to conventional Jewish communities, and of how they respond
to it. As a contribution to the sociology of religion, this will offer a rare
examination of the tension involving both sides after a schism. For sociology
more generally, it will extend research on socio- cultural boundary maintenance
and the responses of cohesive groups to identity challenges. Religion is a topic
of renewed interest to sociologists, and this study will be part of the fresh
wave of research that is currently revitalizing this important field. In
addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will
materially assist a highly promising student in completing research for the
Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower and the
thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.
