0118213&lt;br/&gt;Kardar&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports research and education
aimed at understanding static and dynamic fluctuation phenomena in polymers,
gels, flux lines, surfaces, complex fluids, and social networks. Field theory
and numerical methods, e.g. Monte Carlo simulation, will be used to extract
universal features of these interacting systems. New theoretical methods may be
developed in the course of the work. Research will focus on several specific
questions: Are knots and entanglements in polymers such as DNA localized by
energy or entropy effects on shorter segments? How are fluctuations modified in
the vicinity of a deformed surface, and can they be used to provide indirect
information about deformations? Can we describe the emergence of patterns in
biological systems (cortical maps, cell motility, and structural constructs from
molecular motors and microtubules) by continuum field equations, and what do we
learn from such modeling? What is the interplay of order and fluctuations in the
non-equilibrium contexts of growing films and drifting lattices? Can simple
biological systems be mimicked by imprinting desired information in seemingly
random gels at the molecular level?&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports
fundamental theoretical research and education in an area of statistical physics
dealing with static and dynamic fluctuation phenomena in polymers, gels, flux
lines, surfaces, complex fluids, biological systems, and social networks. The PI
will use advanced theoretical techniques to address specific questions involving
equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in polymer physics, film and crystal
growth, cortical maps, and molecular biology. Students will be trained in
advanced theoretical methods for statistical physics and their applications to a
wide range of systems including biological systems.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
