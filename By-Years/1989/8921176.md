Individuals' decision to save depends not only on calculations of the expected
return from investment, but on implicit or explicit calculations that they will
be able to receive the return. Expectations of the probability of nuclear war
are a relevant, though usually neglected, element of those calculations: if
individuals think a war likely, they should be less likely to save either for
retirement or to leave a bequest. As compared with virtually all other nations
where survey research has occurred, Americans have long had exceptionally high
expectations of nuclear war. They also have a personal savings rate among the
lowest of industrialized countries. Previous research - - systematically
comparing across countries, countries over time, and examination of individual
responses to survey questions - - supports, but not conclusively, the hypothesis
that the rate of individual savings is in fact depressed by fear of war, as a
model of rational decision- making would suggest. To date, no survey instrument
has been designed specifically to test the hypothesis rigorously. In this
investigation the researchers design and administer such a survey, to analyze
the results in conjunction with cross-national and cross- temporal data, and to
discuss the economic and political implications.
