This project will manage the research planning coordination, development
activities and science management for the Russian-American Initiative for Land-
Shelf Environments (RAISE) and a related new initiative on Land-Shelf
Interactions (LSI) of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program over the next
three years. These activities will provide overall coordination of RAISE-LSI
research to maximize its scientific impact and productivity. To achieve its
goals, the science project office will support: (1) development of a science
plan and operational management system, (2) workshops and Working Group meetings
to coordinate specific projects and integration of data sets to address research
priorities, (3) communicate and coordinate with existing and developing
international research programs, and (4) outreach efforts to disseminate
information on current activities and the results of research efforts through
web-site based discussion forums, presentations and planning reports.
