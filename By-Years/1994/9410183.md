9410183 Olejniczak This project investigates new frequency-domain analysis
methods for electric power quality assessment. The Hartley transform is studied
as an alternative methodology for the periodic steady- state solution of
electric power systems modelled by their sinusoidal steady-state equivalents.
Since the fast Hartley transform (FHT) is the most computationally-efficient
frequency- domain algorithm for performing linear or time-domain convolution,
the power system response to nonsinusoidal excitations may be calculated
efficiently and accurately. It is expected that the results of this research may
lead to new real- valued component models and structured matrices which may be
amenable to sparsity and parallel-processing techniques. ***
