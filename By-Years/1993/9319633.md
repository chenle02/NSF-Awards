9319633 Moore This research project focuses on the mechanisms by which steroid
hormones interact with peptides in the brain. We know that peptides in the
vasopressin/oxytocin peptide family are potent modulators of reproductive
behaviors and that the behavioral actions of these peptides frequently are
dependent on prior exposure to androgen. But exactly how and where androgens and
these peptides interact remains largely unknown. The proposed research will use
an amphibian model system to identify which neurons in the brain contain
androgen receptors (can respond directly to this type of steroid hormone) and
which neurons synthesize these peptides and, also to investigate site-specific
and gender-specific effects of steroid hormones on the genes for these peptides.
Information gained from these studies will help to develop generalized models
about the molecular control of brain functions and behaviors. ***
