This project is concerned with research in number theory. A central focus in
this area of mathematics is understanding the mechanism whereby local
information can be packaged to get access to the global information of interest,
such as the solutions to polynomial equations. Certain analytic objects, the so-
called L-functions, are expected to encode such mechanism. The celebrated
conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (one of the millenium prize problems)
revolves around this theme, as does Dirichlet's class number formula from the
nineteenth century. This project aims to enhance our understanding of the Birch
and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and of closely related problems. Progress in
these directions may have an impact on areas, such as cryptography, exploiting
the complexity of the arithmetic of elliptic curves.

Euler systems build a bridge between certain arithmetic objects and their
analytic counterparts (L-functions), hence providing very powerful tools for
tackling problems on the passage from local to global. The project aims to
exploit the Euler systems for tensor products and triple products of modular
forms, and especially their variation in p-adic families, to obtain new results
on fundamental open problems in number theory, such as Greenberg's conjecture on
the generic order of vanishing of L-functions in Hida families, the p-part of
the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer formula in ranks 0 and 1, and the construction of
explicit classes in Selmer groups of elliptic curves of rank 2, curves that lie
just beyond our current understanding of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture.
