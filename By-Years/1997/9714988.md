9714988 Cooper This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential
use of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized electrons from an
electron accelerator to control and possibly eliminate production of nuisance
odors from conduct of sludge management processes at wastewater treatment
plants. The investigator will conduct the research using an electron beam
research unit at the Miami Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia Key. The
exploratory work will involve subjecting water solutions of several of classes
of chemical compounds identified as responsible for nuisance odors produced
during treatment of sludges to radiation produced by a 1.5 Million Electron Volt
accelerator. Compounds to be investigated include organic and inorganic
sulfides, mercaptans and terpenes. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted and under Special Guidelines for Small Grants for Exploratory Research
(SGER) in NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide. This research was suggested at the
Key West workshop in February of 1997 conducted under NSF 95-25059 that
addressed potential additional uses of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of
energized electrons as a step toward full utilization of this environmental
technology in treatment of wastewater and process residues. This project also
relates to research under NSF Award No. 95-08728 on physical and chemical
factors that influence production and emission of gaseous air pollutants from
wastewater treatment processing of treatment-derived sludges ***
