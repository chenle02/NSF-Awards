This PYI research project in theoretical nuclear physics is aimed generally at
understanding nuclear phenomena in terms of the underlying QCD field theory. The
large number of color limit of QCD will be used to investigate nuclear models,
in particular, the spin content of the nucleon. Other areas of research will
study the consequences of chiral symmetry in nuclear physics, the role of field
theoretical anomalies and the ideas of the color dielectric model.
