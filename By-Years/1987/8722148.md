Dr. Abir-Am is continuing her exploration and comparison of the processes and
products of interaction among members of four research schools in molecular
biology in the US, UK, and France between 1935 and 1970. The project traces the
evolution of each research school as a distinct social and intellectual unit
from earlier origins in diverse combinations of disciplines. The project further
traces the confluence of these once isolated schools into the new discipline of
molecular biology as distinct from both classical biology and biochemistry. The
project seeks to compare the research programs of the four research schools,
their categories of social membership, their institutional ecology and their
opportunities in science policy, both national and international. Dr. Abir-Am
combines both historical and sociological methods to explore the interaction
among members of a school as well as inter-school contacts. Thus, archival
research on the personal and institutional papers of the founders/leaders of
each school are supplemented by oral history interviews with members and
affiliates. This project will help to clarify the actual operations of research
schools as informal arenas for transactions in "currencies" such as creativity,
experimental dexterity, credibility, and loyalty. It will also evaluate how
schools relate to scientific progress, change and stratification and explain how
scientific authority is delegated and legitimized within research schools, by
schools within the wider disciplinary domain, and why schools both enable and
constrain innovations and careers.
