9405720 Lohmann This award provides partial funding to support a technician
assigned to the operations of the stable isotope laboratory in the Department of
Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The laboratory
instrumentation includes four operating mass spectrometers, extraction lines for
analysis of the stable isotope ratios of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and
sulfur in inorganic and organic samples, and a laser fluorination system for
oxygen extraction from small sample volumes. A large number of graduate
students, faculty researchers and postdoctoral fellows in the Department of
Geological Sciences employ stable isotope measurements as the main analytical
tool in their research. In addition, the laboratory hosts an unusually large
number of visiting scientists from the U.S. and abroad. The large research
productivity of the lab now requires the assistance of a full-time technician
who will assist with operation and maintenance, training of users, and with the
development of new techniques. Much of the research applications of the
analytical data from this laboratory are in the area of global change and
environmental geochemistry. ***
