This I-Corps team has determined that it is feasible to attach metals together
as well as plastics and glass and any one to any other type. Being able to
attach things together with metal at low temperature allows for safe attachment
of components that cannot survive high temperatures, such as delicate electronic
components or plastic. The technology this I-Corps team intends to commercialize
is a metal bond ("glue"), or weld, between two surfaces, that can be produced at
room temperature, in air, and under low pressure. The proposed product can be
used in computers to make them run faster and last longer or to attach
components to circuit boards without soldering. Additionally, no welding skill
is needed, so the average person can make metal repairs at home, safely.

This team's goal is to produce a product that changes the landscape of how
certain things are attached together. The team envisions a bonding solution that
will replace solder, by being safer for components and simpler, and thermal
interface materials, such as those used to thermally connect CPUs to heat sinks
in computers, by eliminating many of the problems like drying out, pumping out,
and low thermal conductivity. While metal glue will apply to many diverse
applications, the team plans to single out these one or two fields where the
proposed technology will be most easily adopted, and target companies who would
be interested in using this product to produce goods with superior qualities.
The proposed metal glue would give the significant market share advantage of
CPUs that last significantly longer or are able to operate faster without any
change to the silicon processing itself. This team's contribution to the
marketplace will help computing overcome the current bottleneck of heat
dissipation for high power components.
