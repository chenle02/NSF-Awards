This project develops a soils science and technology course and incorporates
soils testing equipment in the materials testing laboratory for its laboratory
component. The course is part of the Construction Management Technology program
of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, and introduces students to the
nature of soils and illustrates how soil materials may influence certain
construction operations. The course is divided into two parts. Part I is an
introduction to soil materials in conjunction with the testing methods, and
seven experiments are performed. The tests follow closely the ASTM or AASHTO
standard test procedures. Part II deals with earthwork in the construction
contract and reviews construction items that involve soils operation.
