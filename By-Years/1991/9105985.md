This award provides partial support for the operation and maintenance of Pynion
Flat Observatory (PFO) in southern California. PFO is operated by staff at the
University of California at San Diego for the purpose of developing, testing,
and calibrating instruments for measuring long-term crustal deformation and
seismic activity. The facility is used by numerous researchers from various U.S.
and international academic research institutions as well as by investigators
from several U.S. federal agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey, the
National Aeronautics and Space Agency, and the National Geodetic Survey (NOAA).
