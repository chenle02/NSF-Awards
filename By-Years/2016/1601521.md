Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) will develop new competency-based, open-
entry, open-exit program for their biotechnology credentials, complemented by an
open lab during extended evening and weekend hours. This will allow SLCC to
offer students and incumbent workers opportunities for flexible scheduling and
accelerated program completion. The benefits to students will be reduced costs
and enhanced well-being, especially for students who have families and jobs.
Complementing the project is a targeted effort to recruit underserved
populations. Working with the local biotechnology industry through an advisory
board, the curriculum will be tailored to the needs of local employers to ensure
it provides well-educated technicians for a growing industry.

As a result of this project, SLCC will develop new practices in competency-
based, open-entry, open-exit instruction and delivery that increases student
access to biotechnology education and helps them earn a credential. This
flexibility will save students money and support family life. This project
leverages an existing Title III grant from the Department of Education. The new
curriculum will be informed by a DACUM process that involves input from local
industry. This will ensure that it meets the evolving needs of Utah
biotechnology companies, articulates with local baccalaureate degree program,
and develops the student skills needed by industry. Through proactive mentoring
and advising, use of student analytics, and project evaluation, this project
will identify effective practices and potential pitfalls of competency-based
education programs in technician education. Through dissemination via the ATE
community, this project will become a model for other programs serving students
with similar needs.
