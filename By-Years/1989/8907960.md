Parallel computer systems are easier to build than to use effectively. One goal
of this research is to implement, measure, and analyze the performance of a wide
variety of algorithms on current generation parallel computers. The PIs wish to
gain experience with, and insight into, the practical problems arising in the
efficient use of such machines to solve realistic computational problems using a
wide variety of algorithm design techniques. A second goal is to use experience
gained from this implementation effort to develop refined theoretical models of
such computers. The models that are most popular in the theoretical community
are felt to be oversimplified. It is hope that new models can be formulated that
remain simple, yet better focus attention on the key performance issues relevant
to these parallel machines.
