9615760 PIERCE The Miletinae, a subfamily of butterflies (Lepidoptera),
currently contains many species that are predatory or parasitic. Most of these
species prey on aphids, ants or scale insects, and several are used as
biological control agents in different parts of the world. If the subfamily is
monophyletic, then it represents the largest group of closely-related predatory
and parasitic species within the Lepidoptera. In this research, Naomi Pierce
will use molecular characters from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes to
recontruct the phylogenetic relationships among the four tribes and thirteen
genera of the Miletinae. The results should determine whether the subfamily is
monophyletic, provide insight into how unusual feeding habits such as carnivory
appeared among insects that, for the most part, eat plants, and why species with
such unusual feeding habits have succeeded in this group of butterflies but not
in others. The work will also contribute to our understanding of diversification
within the butterfly family Lycaenidae, to which the Miletinae belongs.
