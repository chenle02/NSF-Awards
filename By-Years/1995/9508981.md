9508981 STRAYER Response and compensation to a bivalve invasion by an aquatic
ecosystem Thousands of species of plants and animals from around the world have
become established in North America. In some cases, these exotic species seem to
have had little or no effect on native ecosystems, whereas in other cases native
species and ecosystems have been deeply and irreversibly affected. We are
studying the effects of the zebra mussel, a European pest, on the Hudson River
ecosystem. The zebra mussel arrived in the Hudson in about 1990, and is now by
far the most abundant animal in the river. It has dramatically reduced densities
of phytoplankton and small zooplankton (the small plants and animals at the base
of the food chain) over a 150-km reach of the river, but other components of the
ecosystem have been affected much less severely. We will use long-term field
studies, computer models, and small-scale experiments to examine how the various
parts of the Hudson River ecosystem respond to the zebra mussel population. By
studying the details of the zebra mussel invasion in the Hudson, we hope to
identify the general features that control the sensitivity of native ecosystems
to invasions of exotic species. ??
