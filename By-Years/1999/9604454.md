Cameron 9604454 In this project, Dr. Cameron examines the development of
indirect developing sea urchin larvae, a life stage that arises from the embryo
after the onset of feeding and bears little morphological resemblance to the
adult into which it will eventually metamorphose. He focuses particularly though
not exclusively on those larval developmental processes that lead to the
formation of adult primordial structures. He will employ modern techniques of
confocal microscopy, blastomere injection, lineage tracing, in situ
hybridization and genetic chimeras to illustrate the developmental mechanism
that lead to the formation of larval structures. The studies that he proposes
fall into the following categories: 1) The mapping of set aside cell populations
through the use of vital dyes, DNA stains and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation.
2) Experiments to alter larval division patterns and to test the cell number
regulation in structures stemming from set aside cells. 3) The contribution of
isolated animal-half embryos, vegetal-half embryos and the skeletogenic cells to
adult structures and the larval primordia from which they arise using genetic
chimeras detected by genomic microsatellite markers. 4) The examination of
expression in larvae of genes likely to be involved in the formation of adult
structures. 5) Observations on the adult rudiment to determine the earliest
incidence of pentameral symmetry and the manner in which it is established.
