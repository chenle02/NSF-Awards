9458055 Teraoka Enhanced partitioning fractionation of polydisperse polymers
using porous materials recently proposed by the nominee is expected to have a
high preparative capability. He will study solution thermodynamics in the
fractionation as well as statics and dynamics of polymer chains in a confining
porous medium. %%% ***
