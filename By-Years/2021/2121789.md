Social scientists are encouraged to share their data so that their work can be
evaluated, replicated, and extended. Open science movements and public funding
for science, especially, have increased the number and breadth of datasets that
scientists share for reuse and inspection. However, sharing data does not
guarantee that it will be found and reused. Search technologies have been
enhanced by recommender systems, but they have not been widely applied to
research data. A better understanding of how researchers search for existing
data is needed in order to design systems to recommend relevant data to
researchers. This study will determine if redesigning data search systems to
include recommended results can help social scientists discover datasets to
reuse effectively. The results of this project will help data archives ensure
returns on our national investments in scientific data by increasing data reuse
and will promote scientific progress by connecting researchers with relevant
data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will a) develop a model of human
information behavior that explains how social scientists currently search for
data, b) design a prototype data recommender system, and c) evaluate the model
and system through field experiments. How data search compares to other
information behaviors such as general search is not clear, and this project will
explain how data search unfolds. The project also determines whether
recommendation systems, popular in fields such as book and movie
recommendations, can also work for data and increase their
reuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
