Evidence is accumulating to suggest that small inputs of magnetic gas could be
an important, unrecognized parameter that might be used to classify and
understand systems that are otherwise similar. Coupled analyses of gas
abundances and isotopic compositions will be made of fluid inclusions from
several deposits that might have received inputs of magnetic gas, including
Comstock, Nevada and Hishikari, Japan. Analyses will also be made of vapor-rich
inclusions from porphyry copper and acid-sulfate deposits. The study will be
guided by results of gas and isotopic analyses of materials from active
geothermal systems. This should impact our understanding of both active and
fossil hydrothermal systems.
