9706412 Bowring The assembly and breakup of the Late Proterozoic super continent
of Rodinia is a fundamental question of late Precambrian tectonics. Because the
rock record of this time interval is so limited, studies of the well exposed
rocks that do exist become all the more compelling. In a broad attack of this
problem, the University of New Mexico, Harvard, and MIT will work
collaboratively on late Proterozoic rocks of the southwestern edge of North
America. These investigators will study the geological, paleontological, and
tectonic evolution of a sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks of Late
Proterozoic age in the southwestern US. The structural, sedimentological,
geochronological, paleontological, and paleomagnetic data to be collected will
bear directly on the ages and sedimentary and tectonic environments of
deposition of these rocks, and at the same time examine the Late Proterozoic
evolution of life prior to the Cambrian diversification of animal life.
