This project examines problems in circuit complexity, using classical analytic
methods. The project is centered around three basic questions, the first and
last of which are specifically geared towards basic, long-unresolved issues that
have hindered progress in the area. (1) Do simple operations (such as shifts, or
products) on hard functions preserve hardness? (3) In what ways can hardness be
used for learning functions in a complexity class? (2) What are the analytic
properties that are common to constant depth circuits with various sets of
symmetric gates? Already partial answers have yielded the following: (a) a non-
trivial, complexity bounds involving constant depth circuits and more
significantly, the analytic patterns underlying such bounds; (b) general methods
for using hard functions to obtain large classes of pseudorandom generators and
training sets for learning; and (c) conversion of lower bounds on circuit
complexity into upper bounds on the complexity of learning, and vice versa. The
analytic techniques used, are partly multivariate generalizations of univariate
approximation methods, partly from coding theory and partly from spectral
analysis. The techniques developed are of independent interest to approximation
theorists, and solve, in particular, a number of problems involving general
Boolean functions, and combinatorics over the multidimensional unit-cube.
