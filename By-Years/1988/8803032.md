Trypanosomes, like many protozoan parasites, are unable to synthesize purines
and must rely on the host to provide those compounds. The demand placed on the
host's pool of free purines by a rapidly-growing population of extracellular,
bloodstream trypanosomes (such as the rodent or African trypanosomes) may have
one of two effects, either: (a) marked mobilizaton of purines from tissue sites
into the bloodstream, or (b) serious depletion of the normal, circulating
concentrations of purines. In either case, the available evidence suggests that
significant alterations of the normal properties and functions of host cells
that display surface adenosine receptors would result (especially lymphocytes,
neutrophils, macrophages and platelets). The goals of this research are to
investigate changes in bloodstream purine concentrations and changes in the
properties and functions of selected host cells during the course of murine
infections with Trypanosoma musculi. The concentrations of 16 purines in the
plasma will be determined (by high performance liquid chromatography) at
intervals during the course of infection, and subsequent recovery, of two
strains of mice (one, C3H, that is particularly susceptible to T. musculi and
another, C57Bl/6, that is considerably less susceptible). The marked (3-5 fold)
rise in splenocyte activity of the enzymes, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine
nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), which recently has been discovered in
trypanosome-infected mice will be studied in detail. Specifically it will be
determined: (a) whether or not the stimulation of these enzymes results from an
excess or a paucity of purines in the bloodstream, (b) which types of splenic
cells display the elevated enzyme activities, (c) whether or not the stimulus
comes from direct action of the parasites (or parasite-derived substances) on
cells in which the enzyme activity increases or is mediated indirectly through
another type of host cell, and (d) whether or not the elevated enzyme levels are
associated with depressed capability of infected hosts to generate immune
responses. Finally, once it is known how the bloodstream concentrations of
purines change during infection, the effects of similar changes in the
properties and functions of selected cells (B-lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,
neutrophils, Kupffer cells and platelets) maintained in vitro will be explored.
These studies will provide insight concerning the mechanisms through which
trypanosome-mediated alterations in host purine concentrations result in altered
cellular activities, and may help to explain the success of trypanosomes in
resisting the immune responses of their hosts.
