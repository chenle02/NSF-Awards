For this Phase II research project, the Spodoptera active B.t. strain EG 2058
will be used as a model to delineate the role of P1 and P2 proteins in the
production of overall insecticidal activity. Specific objectives include the
indentification and characterization of a P1-type Spodoptera- active structural
and regulatory toxin gene sequence in B.t. strain EG 2058 as well as a
determination of the role of the P2 type gene in encoding the Spodoptera
activity. Characterization of the Spodoptera-active P1 and P2 type gene
expression will be performed by Western blot analysis of toxin proteins
synthesized in B.t. strains constructed by microbial genetic or recombinant DNA
technology. The effect of the presence of additional P1-encoding toxin plasmids
on the expression of cloned Spodoptera-active genes, will be examined using
similar Western blot analysis. Data obtained in this research will permit the
assessment of regulatory interaction occurring between both similar and
dissimilar genes at the gene-product level, and the effects of these
interactions on the ultimate insecticidal activities of strain containing
multiple genes. An understanding of these interactions will greatly facilitate
the development of novel strains of B.t. having increased efficay against a
variety of economically important target insects such as the army worm,
Spodoptera exigna.
