This proposal will fund the purchase of computer and acquisition systems for two
JEOL FX90Q nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers for use in
undergraduate laboratories in analytical, physical, and polymer chemistry. In
analytical chemistry, the labs will focus on a basic familiarity with modern NMR
instrumentation. The students will also learn how to acquire and manipulate data
using computerized equipment. In physical chemistry, the experiments focus on
basic NMR phenomena and second order and exchange effects. In polymers, NMR will
be used to determine the stereochemistry, identification, and verification of
polymerization through the use of carbon-13 and proton NMR. Students will also
determine the distribution of monomer segments in copolymers. The experiments
for the understanding of the basic Fourier transform NMR phenomena, as well as
those for polymer chemistry, are not generally available for faculty members in
these areas. These will be developed and shared with other educators in these
fields.
