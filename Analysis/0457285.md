Dechao Zheng will conduct research on problems arising from the interaction
between function theory and operator theory. Primary emphasis will rest on the
study of Hankel operators and Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space and the
Hardy space. The topics to be considered include compact perturbation of Hankel
operators, function algebras and Toeplitz algebras on the disk, and reducing
subspaces for multiplication operators on the Bergman space. This project
focuses on the central problem of establishing relationship between the
fundamental properties of those operators and analytic and geometric properties
of their symbols.

Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the infinite
dimensional generalizations of matrices. In particular, when restricted to
finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has the usual linear properties, and
thus can be represented by a matrix. The central problems in operator theory is
to classify operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of
associated operators or in terms of the underlying space. Operator theory
underlies much of mathematics, and many of the applications of mathematics to
other sciences.
