How the brain codes, stores and retrieves memories is one of the most important
questions in neuroscience today. The answer lies in the application of
techniques contributed by many disciplines, from animal behavior to
neurochemistry, anatomy and physiology. Most learning theorists agree that
memory occurs in several sequentially-linked "stages" or time periods,
frequently referred to as short-, intermediate- and long-term memory. The
importance of this distinction is that each stage has a relatively discrete
duration, and, as Drs. Rosenzweig and Bennett have reported, each appears to be
influenced primarily by a different neurochemical transmitter system. They are
now pursuing a subcellular neurochemical analysis of these different memory
stages. These outstanding investigators (Dr. Rosenzweig is a member of the
National Academy of Sciences) are examining the temporal and neurochemical bases
of single trial taste discrimination in the chick. In this paradigm, young
cockerels are presented with a bitter tasting bead to peck: After a single taste
they will avoid pecking at similar beads. One of several drugs is then
administered, each capable of interfering with the normal processes of memory.
At different times following different drug treatment, the chicks will "forget"
the bitter taste, and will again peck at the bead. Since many of the mechanisms
of action of these drugs are currently known, these studies will provide
valuable information regarding which neurotransmitters, and which subcellular
events, influence each stage of memory. Drs. Rosenzweig and Bennett are now
proceeding with an even more molecular analysis of events leading to memory,
examining the roles of calcium influx, protein synthesis and phosphorylation,
and glucose utilization. Answers to these questions could reorient much research
on the neuroscience of memory, and will be relevant to several applied fields
such as age-related memory deficits, mental retardation, and rehabilitation from
brain injuries and disease.
