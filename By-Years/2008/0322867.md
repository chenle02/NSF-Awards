0322867&lt;br/&gt;Simon&lt;br/&gt;Some of the most intransigent, yet intriguing
biological questions occur at cellular membranes. At the membrane the cell has
to take up select substrates while maintaining a permeability barrier that keeps
nutrients in and toxins out. The membrane is the site where cells secrete their
own signals and detect those of their neighbors. The membrane is not only the
site of a dynamic physiology but pathology as well. Many diseases of the nervous
system affect either the ability of cells to secrete or detect signals at the
cell membrane. For many pathogens our cells are a tempting home. They need to
compromise the membranes to enter. However, they also need to maintain membrane
integrity so our cells can survive as a hospitable environment. The cell
membrane is 4 nm thick. Thus, the wavelength of light constrains our ability to
detect changes occurring in the immediate environment of the membrane in the
background of signals from the interior of the cell. Total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopy (TIF-FM) is a technique that limits the excitation to a
plane of 50-70 nm above a coverslip and has been successfully used to image
events occurring within this space adjacent to the plasma membrane. This
proposal will extend the capabilities of TIR-FM in three ways: 1) Allow multiple
fluorophores to be followed simultaneously; 2) Allow simultaneous study of cell
surface events by TIF-FM and internal changes by epi-fluorescence; 3) Allow
localized photoactivation of signaling by UV while using TIR-FM.
