The principal investigator pursues several directions of research in mathematics
that are of both analytical and geometrical nature and could have applications
in nonlinear elasticity and materials science. The questions under study lie at
the interface of differential geometry and analysis. This project aims to
establish new connections between these disciplines that will be of interest to
mathematicians as well as members of the solid mechanics and materials science
community. The work aims to advance materials science, particularly regarding
the behavior of pre-strained elastic bodies or growing tissues. It is
anticipated that the results will have many potential applications, from
constructing shape-forming gels to detecting cancerous tumors.

This research project further explores the flexibility vs. rigidity dichotomy,
particularly in the context of isometric immersions and solutions to Monge-
Ampere equations of low regularity. The rigidity and flexibility of solutions to
various classes of partial differential equations in geometry and continuum
physics has been a longstanding mathematical problem. Recent developments in
fluid dynamics have interested mathematicians and materials scientists in
analytical and geometrical aspects of these problems. Meanwhile, a rigorous
understanding of nonlinear elastic phenomena (including elastic rigidity and
flexibility) requires a deep engagement with mathematical disciplines such as
differential geometry and nonlinear analysis. The principal investigator plans
to use techniques including convex integration, the theory of nonlinear partial
differential equations, geometric function theory, and geometric measure theory
to tackle these questions.
