This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
feasibility of creating a cross-platform authoring environment for consumer
multimedia. The rapid expansion of the multimedia installed base and the
increasing number of hardware configurations have produced a strong need for
methods of efficient and flexible cross-platform multimedia programming. The
proposed environment will consist of both a script level and a higher level
graphical interface, and will allow efficient and flexible control using
buffering, caching, advance interfaces, and other features not available in
other authoring environments. Furthermore, the development of a detailed design
methodology will allow for efficient and effective portability across multiple
platforms with a variety of hardware configurations. This Phase I project will
begin with the analysis, design and specification of such a system. The project
will include the development of a prototype system under Microsoft Windows,
which will serve as a tool for benchmarking and studying issues of time-slicing
and multi-tasking. Finally, the proposed project will research several target
consumer multimedia platforms and study portability and design methodology
issues. Upon completion of the Phase I project, a full implementation of the
cross-platform authoring environment can begin.
