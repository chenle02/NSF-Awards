In recent years, advances have been made in methodologies for the design of VLSI
computer circuits. Whether these methodologies are limited to two-dimensional
circuit design or can be generalized to three-dimensional design problems has
remained an open question. The Investigator will explore the use of logical
circuits in the design of mechanical parts. He will determine the feasibility of
expressing the design requirements of mechanical parts, such as clavis joints,
in logical circuits. If the research is successful, a better understanding of
the relationship between mechanical and electrical design will result.
