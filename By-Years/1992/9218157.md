At the end of their active lives, most stars become large, very cool but bright
red giants. As they finish this stage, many begin to lose their outer layers
through outflows known as winds. It is thought that an important factor driving
these winds is the formation of small solid particles commonly referred to as
dust. The role played by this dust in driving the outflow and the dynamics of
such outflows will be investigated. An investigation will also be conducted of
the effects on the wind of the presence of a binary companion to the star in
question. Submillimeter observations will be undertaken to verify some of the
predictions of the theory. Since the strong winds from red giants completely
alter the evolution of the stars and provide enriched material to the
interstellar medium, this work has broad ramifications to several areas of
astronomy.
