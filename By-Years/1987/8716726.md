The severe 1982-83 ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event caused
historically unprecedented and catastrophic disturbances to the Eastern Pacific
coral reefs. In the aftermath of this event, disturbances to the reefs have
continued and may have accelerated. Coupled with low coral recruitment, reef
recovery could well take many years. The ecological effects and cause(s) of this
regional disturbance have been investigated by a team of Latin and North
American colleagues and students in Costa Rica, Panama, and Ecuador (Galapagos
Islands) from 1983 to 1984 (Smithsonian Institution support) and from 1985 to
1987 (NSF support). This proposal focuses on coral reef recovery, disturbance
processes per se, and retrospective analyses to be studied by a
multidisciplinary, international team. Secondary or delayed disturbance effects
that will be studied are (a) the disruption of biotic barriers allowing predator
(Acanthaster planci) entry to coral prey refugia, (b) predator (corallivore)
concentration on surviving coral prey, (c) post-El Nino sea urchin bioerosion of
damaged reef frames, (d) damselfish colonization of damaged massive corals, and
(e) damselfish/sea urchin/corallivore interactions vis-a-vis massive coral
survival. Recovery processes will be studied chiefly with respect to the
recruitment of calcifying organisms (corals and coralline algae) onto formerly
occupied reef surfaces including examiniation of patch size, character of
colonists (asexual or sexual propagules), and relative abundances of surrounding
species. Retrospective studies (sclerochronology, oxygen and carbon stable
isotope analyses, cadmium analysis, and fluorescent banding patterns) will also
be performed on coral cores dating back at least to 1601 to provide a long-term
record of ENSO disturbances. Since it is likely that major El Nino disturbances
are recurring events, such information should provide a firm basis for
understanding the processes controlling coral reef development and distribution
in the tropical eastern Pacific.
