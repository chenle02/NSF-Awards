Learned motor acts generally adjust to their context. The orchestration of the
pattern of contraction of various muscles depends in a subtle and complex way on
the circumstances in which the motor act occurs. Eye movements, however, seem
more stereotyped. When a person chooses to look at something, they make an eye
movement to it (a "saccade"). Because saccades are so brief, they cannot be
guided by vision during the movement but must rely on feedback after each
saccade to adjust the amplitude of subsequent saccades, a phenomenon known as
saccade adaptation. Experiments in the laboratory induce saccade adaptation by
surreptitiously moving the target during each saccade, while vision is poor. The
eye movement system compensates as though its saccades had been in error. It is
generally assumed that it is only the location of the target that is relevant
for saccadic control, not the type of target. Recent findings contradict this
view, showing that two different types of target moved identically during the
saccade result in two different types of compensatory eye movements. In other
words, saccade adaptation depends on the visual context.

The present work aims to clarify whether contextual learning of saccadic eye
movements is a highly restricted machine-like "learning" by the part of the
brain that generates eye movements or is a manifestation of a general learning
mechanism that makes use of whatever informative cues are available. The nature
of the contextual information that guides saccadic adaptation is explored in
detail in order to determine what function contextual learning of saccadic eye
movements serves. Because these experiments lie at the interface of biology,
engineering, and psychology, they have the potential to attract students from
both disciplines and to foster interdisciplinary collaborations.
