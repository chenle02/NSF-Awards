The density matrix will be measured for excited hydrogen atoms formed in 5-35
keV electron transfer collisions. This will provide detailed tests of theories
of electron transfer. The experiment measures the Stokes parameters which
completely characterize the emitted Lyman alpha radiation as a function of axial
and transverse electric fields applied in the collision cell. The fields cause
the atom to evolve between the points of creation and decay, inducing
characteristic variations in the Stokes parameters. The density matrix is
determined by fitting the observed signals.
