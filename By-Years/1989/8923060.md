Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will operate the R/V BLUE FIN during 1990 as
a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The
ship is a 72' general research vessel built in 1972 and owned by the University
System of Georgia. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science
Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most oceanographic
research projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support
from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research projects require
equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship
must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires highly trained crew
members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the same
manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the
operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic
research. These vessels are operated by universities and research institutions
around the country. The R/V BLUE FIN operates primarily in the coastal waters
along the southeastern U.S. It is a capable platform for these operations, and
Skidaway has maintained an excellent program with relatively low costs.
