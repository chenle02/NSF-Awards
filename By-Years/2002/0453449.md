The Department of Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics at Texas A&amp;M University is
sponsoring an NSF-funded international REU program at three sites in Taiwan:
Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University in Taipei, and National Cheng
Kung University in Tainan. The major goals of the program are to prepare
undergraduates to pursue graduate training and careers in research, and instill
a global awareness of research opportunities. Students will perform cutting-edge
research in biochemistry and molecular biology. At the conclusion of the program
they will present their research in both written and oral reports. Students will
gain confidence in their ability to become integrated into unique lab settings
conducting original research of importance to Taiwan, an appreciation for the
similarities and differences in the conduct of research between the US and
Taiwan, and a global perspective through social and cultural immersion in
international science. Up to eight students will be selected to participate in a
10-week summer program that will run approximately from the end of May through
early August. Typically, applicants should have completed their junior year,
have domestic research experience, expressed a desire and willingness to gain
experience in a foreign lab, and show the flexibility and openness needed to
adapt in a foreign environment. Applications from underrepresented minority
groups are encouraged. The ability to speak a Chinese dialect or mandarin is not
required. Selection will be based on the application, letters of recommendation
and a telephone interview. More information is available at
