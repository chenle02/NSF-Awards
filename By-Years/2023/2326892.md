The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) Workshop is an annual event with the goal of
encouraging participation of graduate students and junior researchers in integer
programming and related areas. The primary goals of the Workshop are to showcase
young researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an
early stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students
to network with the world's top researchers. MIP student poster sessions provide
students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network with
other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student
posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are
recognized. In addition, the workshop features a computational competition that
will allow students to test their skills on a challenging optimization problem.
This award provides travel support for 10 student poster presenters for each
three workshops held between 2023 and 2025. The event has been a fertile ground
for students' professional development, with a number of previous participants
supported by NSF now holding faculty positions across the US.

The MIP Workshops are held annually at locations across the United States. The
2023 MIP Workshop will be held in Los Angeles, California, from May 22-25. The
solicitation for travel support will be sent to a variety of mailing lists, with
particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students from
underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for graduate
students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage
participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in
emerging research in the field of MIP.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
