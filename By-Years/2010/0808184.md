AST-0808184&lt;br/&gt;Norman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enzo is a three-dimensional
parallel adaptive mesh refinement hybrid (fluid plus particle) open-source
community code for astrophysical and cosmological simulations developed at the
Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (LCA) at the University of California-
San Diego. Enzo underpins the research of many astronomers in areas as diverse
as primordial star formation, galaxy formation, the intergalactic medium, galaxy
clusters, interstellar turbulence, and Galactic star formation. The arrival of
petascale computing platforms will take these and other researches into a new
realm of physical realism, but not without appropriate parallel application
software, whose development requires effort by an interdisciplinary team of
domain scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists, such as has
been assembled at the LCA. The present project will add radiation
magnetohydrodynamics capabilities to Enzo within a new parallel framework
designed for petascale platforms, and will include three annual software
releases and two user workshops. These capabilities will enable larger-scale and
higher dynamic range simulations in cosmological structure formation,
interstellar turbulence, and star formation, as well as open up new
possibilities wherever complex physics and high spatial dynamic range are
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to direct research impacts, this work
will serve as a springboard for inter-departmental collaborations, bringing
together graduate students from mathematics, physics and computer science into a
coordinated program. The community-code nature of Enzo, distributed under UCSD
policies for wide access under copyright, and with the user-friendly packaging
and support which are part of this project, will enable a wide range of
multiscale applications throughout astrophysics and other disciplines to harness
petascale computing.
