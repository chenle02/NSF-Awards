The goal of this project is to use the results, methods, and techniques that
originate in combinatorics to address problems in logic, ergodic theory, and
topological dynamics. Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerning
discrete structures, such as graphs, which can be viewed as mathematical objects
representing networks consisting of nodes with links between them. This area has
experienced immense growth in the past several decades, owing in part to its
close connection to computer science. Recently, it has become apparent that
combinatorial insights can shed new light on problems in other, seemingly
unrelated, areas, such as ergodic theory - the study of the evolution of
dynamical systems, encompassing a range of applications from epidemic models to
planetary motion. It turns out that one can often associate a graph or another
discrete structure to a dynamical system and then use combinatorial methods to
elucidate its properties. The goals of this project are to extend the range of
applications of this approach and develop new powerful combinatorial tools for
the needs of other areas. The PI will work with graduate and undergraduate
students through problem solving workshops and other collaborations.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project revolves around
transferring ideas from graph coloring theory and probabilistic combinatorics to
the setting where it is necessary to fulfill additional regularity constraints
(measure-theoretic, topological, etc.). Particular avenues of investigation that
will be covered in this project include: (a) studying the extent to which
classical probabilistic tools, especially the Lov√°sz Local Lemma, can be
extended to the measurable framework; (b) finding new methods for building
measurable colorings, matchings, and other useful structures in graphs; (c)
applying combinatorial techniques to attack major open problems in dynamical
systems, such as the entropy problem and the Ellis problem; and (d) studying the
interplay between descriptive set theory and computer
science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
