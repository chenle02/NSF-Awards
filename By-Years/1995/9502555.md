9502555 Mullen This CAREER grant contains two parts: research and teaching. The
research component concerns three theoretical projects investigating helium 4:
the properties of films at submonolayer coverages; the hydrodynamics and phase
transitions in a novel, low temperature state; and the description of devices
using lithographic technology to pattern helium films. Also planned is
theoretical support for ongoing experiments on two dimensional electron gasses
at the institution of the Principal Investigator. The teaching component is the
revision of the Introductory Physics course for majors, including the
integration of computers into the curriculum. %%% This CAREER grant contains two
