The PowerCyber project aims to address the underutilization of advanced
Cyberinfrastructure (CI) in the domain of power and energy engineering. Despite
the significant advancements in CI, its adoption in power engineering has been
limited due to a lack of quality training materials and the historical reliance
on limited tools. This project seeks to fill the gap by creating an online,
modular, and open-access training workshop tailored for researchers in power
engineering. The project will democratize access to high-quality research
training, benefit a diverse population, and foster collaborations between the
power and CI communities. Also, the project is expected to equip the research
workforce with an understanding of advanced CI software and hardware and help
accelerate interdisciplinary research for the clean energy transition.

In this project, the investigators will develop an online, modular, and openly
available PowerCyber training to prepare power engineering researchers with a
comprehensive understanding of advanced CI software, hardware, and emerging CI
technologies. The tasks include a) developing high-quality, interactive, and on-
demand training modules to cover advanced CI in software, hardware, and emerging
techniques and demonstrating, by research examples, their potential to transform
power engineering research; b) offering virtual PowerCyber training workshops;
and c) incorporating the training materials into the curricula at the home
institution of the investigator. Upon the completion of this project, we expect
to have demonstrated a pilot training workshop that provides researchers with
advanced CI capabilities for solving power-domain problems.

This project is jointly funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure and
the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).
