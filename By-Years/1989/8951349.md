This project is based on the premise that laboratory instruction should include
practical experience in computerized data acquisition and analysis. Computer
interfacing, using personal computers, will be introduced to laboratory courses
in general chemistry, physical chemistry and analytical chemistry. This
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement award from the Chemical
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Drexel
University to acquire computer equipment necessary for enhancing undergraduate
laboratory instruction.
