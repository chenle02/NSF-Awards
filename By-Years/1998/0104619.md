This is a proposal for some of the critical R&D needed to bring the muon storage
ring/neutrino source to the point where it can be evaluated as a potential
physics project for the field. In addition, it may pave the way for a future
muon storage ring to explore physics at an energy scale beyond what is foreseen
for the coming decade.

This is of great interest as it can lead to advances in neutrino physics and
possibly eventually to a new method to make a lepton collider. More
specifically, this project can have significant impact on the enabling of well
characterized, narrow band, variable energy beams of neutrinos for the
determination of neutrino mass and mixing parameters and possibly for seeing CP
violation in the neutrino sector. Students will be given diverse opportunities
to work on unique problems.
