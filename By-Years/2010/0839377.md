This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
development of a novel flexible thin film encapsulation technology to exceed
commercial barrier and cost requirements for both existing and emerging
commercial products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research if successfully
commercialized will enable a sizeable market for large area, flexible electronic
products for displays, solid state lighting, photovoltaics, thin film batteries,
image sensors, and medical and security devices. Without the required, and
currently unavailable at low enough cost, thin film permeation barrier to
prevent the degradation of organic devices, these markets will not be realized.
