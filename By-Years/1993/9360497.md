9360497 Westermo This project will examine the design of peak strain and
deflection-based instrumentation systems for the post- earthquake health
monitoring of buildings and other civil infrastructures. The instrumentation
systems are intended to evaluate the local material damage at specific points
within a structure and be used to estimate, among other things, the level of
damage a structure has suffered and the condition of the structure. The work
will entail designing several types of sensors, performing full static and
dynamic tests, and investigating approaches to designing a site-specific system
and interpretation of the sensor output. The general distribution of high
strains (or damage) incurred during an earthquake event to optimize the location
of the sensors and the accuracy with which the system predicts the damage will
be evaluated. The new technology made available through this study can provide
for an economical and reliable means for structural safety assessment. There is
a potential that prototype instrumentation systems could be developed and
applied. This is an SBIR Phase I project. ***
