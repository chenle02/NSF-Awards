Dr. Heidemann proposes to gather preliminary information about two areas related
to microtubule organization and neuronal growth. He proposes investigations of a
working hypothesis for control of microtubule assembly by the advancing growth
cone. In this model, tension of the neurite is the result of tension within the
actin-based cytoskeleton of the neuron. This tension is supported by internal
microtubules and by the culture substratum, placing both under compression.
Structurally, this arrangement is similar to the architectural principle of
tensegrity developed some years ago by Buckminster Fuller. Of particular
importance, thermodynamic considerations lead to the result that compression on
MTs may regulate MT elongation and thus provide an economical method for
integrating MT assembly with growth cone movement. Three of the specific goals
are an investigation of the role of microtubules in the unusually clear
regionalization of cultured neurons into cell body, neurite and growth cone
compartments. These compartments differ in their cytoskeleton and in their cell
surface/cell cortex activity. Results in this and other laboratories suggest
microtubules may regulate the activity of the cell cortex.
