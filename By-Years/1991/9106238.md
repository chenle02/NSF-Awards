This experimental program will employ Positron annihilation induced Auger
Electron Spectroscopy (PAES) for the study of surfaces and the Auger process
itself. The exising UTA magnetically guided PAES system will be used to identify
directly the elemental content of the top-most atomic layer and to obtain Auger
spectra with extremely low energy dose rates. Systems to be studied include (1)
the growth and interdiffusion of ultrathin metal films composed of iron,
neodymium and palladium on copper, (2) adsorbates on metal surfaces, (3) suface
segregation in alloys, and (4) fragile adsorbed layers and chemically unstable
systems including organic molecules on catalytic surfaces and conducting
polymers. Future modifications of the positron beam will make possible a new
form of polarized Auger spectroscopy for use in the study of magnetic systems in
which the polarization of the initial hole rather than the outgoing electron is
selected.
