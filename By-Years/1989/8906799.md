The central problem addressed by this project is the synthesis of randomization
with geometry. We propose to study the theoretical as well as the practical
implications of such a synthesis. A tradition study of randomization in the
context of geometry-as in stochastic geometry - studies the expected value of
various quantities of interest, when the geometric elements in question are
chosen randomly from a nice distribution. Unfortunately, this approach has only
a limited algorithmic applicability, because the distributions actually found in
practice are not always well behaved. On the other hand, the approach in this
project assumes nothing about the input, and only the order, in which the
elements are chosen, is supposed to be random. More precisely, this project
studies the random evolution of the configuration as the geometric elements in
the given input set are chosen, and put at their already specified locations, in
a random order. It turns out that, this approach helps one design algorithms for
geometric problems, which are very efficient, and robust. A distinguishing
characteristic of these algorithms is that they are randomized, and incremental:
they proceed by considering the geometric elements, one at a time, but in a
random order. This project further develop the underlying theory, and uses it to
design efficient algorithms for various geometric problems in computational
geometry, graphics, and robot motion planning. JUSTIFICATION
