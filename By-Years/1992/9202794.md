A major field effort took place in 1988-89 to study the details of two Gulf
Stream meanders using a combination of rapid ship survey and satellite imagery.
The analysis of the data will continue with special emphasis on calculating the
dynamical balance of the meanders and relating microstructure activity to
intrusive interleavings and/or shear instabilities.
