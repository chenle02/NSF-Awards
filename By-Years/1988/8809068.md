This conference is the well-known "West Coast Number Theory Conference", an
annual event since 1967. It will be held at the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas from December 16 to December 21, 1988. The format of the conference will
be as in the past for these conferences - informal, designed for maximum
exchange of ideas and results, and for making new mathematical contacts. The
organizers of the conference are Professors Paul Aizley and Peter Shiue of the
Mathematics Department at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Some
participant support is available, with preference being given to younger number
theorists and to graduate students.
