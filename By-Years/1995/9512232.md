In this project in the PhysicalChemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Greg O. Sitz of the Chemistry Department of the University of Texas at
Austin will perform a series of gas-surface scattering experiments. A
combination of molecular beam and laser based state preparation and detection
techniques will be used to performm fully quantum state resolved studies of gas-
surface interaction dynamics. The scattering and dissociation of molecular
hydrogen and deuterium from single crystal copper surfaces will be studied to
determine the relative importance of translational, rotational, vibrational and
molecular alignment in dermining the outcome of the scattering event. Stimulated
Raman scattering will be used to prepare hydrogen molecules incident on the
copper surface in a selected rotational state of the first excited vibrational
state. Scattered molecules will be detected in a quantum state specific manner
by multiphoton ionization. The initial encounter of a molecule with a solid
surface can lead to several possible results depending on the molecule , the
surface, and the energy partitioning amongst the many available degrees of
freedom. These possibilities include inelastic scattering, trapping, sticking
and bond breaking. In the last case, a bond in the molecule can be broken,
paying the energy price by forming one or more chemical bonds to the surface.
This is the essence of the ability of many surfaces to promote or participate in
chemical reactions. In many cases of interest, however, even though the reaction
is energetically favorable, the reaction probability is low because of the
presence of a barrier: the reaction is said to be activated. Of central concern
is the nature of this activation barrier and the dynamical mechanism for
crossing it. This research focuses on gas-surface interactions in systems where
dissociative adsorption is an activated process. By performing this research
with fully state resolved measurements new insight into surface dynamics will be
gained and existing theories will be stringently tested.
