Magma Fractionation Processes and Timescales: Fogo, Furnas and Fuji
Volcanoes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR- 0207529 &lt;br/&gt;PI:
Widom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a combined volcanological,
geochemical, isotopic and geochronologic study of recent, highly evolved and
chemically zoned eruptive products of Fogo and Furnas volcanoes in the Azores
(Portugal), and Fuji volcano in Japan. The project will involve petrographic and
microprobe analysis, major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope analysis, and
U-series disequilibria studies of whole rock pumices and mineral and glass
separates, as well as high precision Ar-Ar dating of feldspar separates.
Specific questions that will be addressed include the role of open vs. closed
system processes during magmatic differentiation, the timescales over which
magma differentiation and chemical zonation occur, and the relationship between
magma residence timescales and eruptive volumes. The combined studies of
eruptions from the Azores and Fuji will allow comparisons of the processes and
timescales operating in magmatic systems in distinct tectonic settings
(intraplate vs. subduction zone), and in magmatic systems that are
compositionally distinct (alkaline vs. calc-alkaline).&lt;br/&gt;
