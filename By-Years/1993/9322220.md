9322220 Netzly This award provides an additional five years of continuing
support to the Department of Biology at Hope College to carry on with the
Research Experience for Undergraduates Site that was established in 1987. Each
summer, under the direction of eleven Ph.D. faculty, the program will provide
ten undergraduate students with an in- depth summer experience focusing on
environmental biology. Objectives of the program are to: 1) continue the active
recruitment of under-represented groups into the program, 2) provide an
effective, learning community of junior and senior researchers focusing on
environmental biology at the community, organismal, and cellular levels; and 3)
train undergraduate students to become proficient in learning, doing and
communicating their research. This research program will have an impact on the
student participants' understanding of science; impact the sciences as the
students present and publish their results to the scientific community; and have
an impact beyond the sciences: students will have a working knowledge of science
and will impact society whatever their eventual occupational choice. ***
