This research proposes to develop an innovative methodology for estimating the
stability regions of large-scale nonlinear dynamical systems. The significance
of the proposed methodology include: (1) its computational efficiency, (2) its
ability to significantly reduce the conservativeness in estimating the stability
regions, (3) its adaptability (this methodology is very general; it can stand by
itself or it can be synthesized with existing methods in the way that they serve
the input of the proposed methodology) and (4) its sound theoretical basis. At
present, there does not exist any method that is computationally practical, yet
does not yield undesirably conservative result in estimating the stability
regions for large- scale nonlinear dynamical systems. The existence of such a
practical method is very important for many engineering and scientific
applications, as well as for many emerging research areas. The proposed research
is to meet this pressing need. Also, the proposed methodology opens new areas
for research, both in the area of methodology development and in the area of new
applications.
