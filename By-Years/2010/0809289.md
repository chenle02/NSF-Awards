This project will focus on the synthesis and characterization of an extended
family of repeating sequence copolymers that include a blue-light emitting
oligofluorene component. Although Nature has established the power of sequence
in creating a high diversity in properties with a limited monomer pool, sequence
remains underexploited in synthetic copolymers. A novel diversity oriented
synthesis strategy will make possible the efficient creation of a set of
polymers appropriate for systematic studies. By correlating the properties of
these repeating sequence copolymers prepared with sequence and block dispersity
in this system, a more general understanding of the relationship of properties
to sequence will be derived. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic
and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor
Tara Y. Meyer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.
Professor Meyer's research efforts revolve around the development of synthetic
approaches to highly sequenced polymers and the correlation of properties with
sequence. In addition to the positive impact on the materials industry, the
unique light-emitting properties of the proposed polymers should contribute to
the design of new optoelectronic technology.
