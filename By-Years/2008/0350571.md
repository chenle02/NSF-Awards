Reactive scattering of small molecules from metal phthalocyanine surfaces is
used to probe chemisorption dynamics on model organic surfaces. The distinct
roles of organic and metal center on the adsorption dynamics is examined in this
research project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.
Professor Kummel and his coworkers at the University of California-San Diego use
a combination of molecular beam scattering tools and scanning tunneling
microscopy to examine the dynamics of small molecule adsorption on these model
organic surfaces. Bonding sites are examined using STM and STS, chemisorption
mechanism is probed using reactive scattering molecular beam methods, and
density functional calculations are carried out to model the experimental
results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how small molecules adsorb and
react on organic and organometallic surfaces is the goal of this research
project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Using a
combination of experimental probes, particularly molecular beam scattering and
scanning probe microscopy, the detailed dynamics of small molecules interacting
with phthalocyanine surfaces are examined. This fundamental information may have
applicability in the design of molecule specific sensors and organic molecule
electronics. &lt;br/&gt;
