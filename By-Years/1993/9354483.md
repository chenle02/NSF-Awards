9354483 Riggs This project improves the preparation of undergraduate engineering
students to effectively contribute to achieving sustainable development in the
U.S. and elsewhere. This is accomplished by developing and implementing a
carefully planned and designed sequence of three introductory courses in
sustainable development and technology. The courses, developed by faculty from
Civil Engineering, Computing, Public Policy, and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences,
feature a multi- and inter- disciplinary learning environment incorporating the
latest advances in cognitive science and computer-aided instruction and
learning. All educational materials are developed and packaged in a self-
contained way to enable other schools to use the results of this investigation,
and to easily incorporate the instructional materials within their own
curricula. The sequence not only introduces curricular changes in the way each
course is designed and developed, but also in how students learn and are taught
within a problem-based, case-based and collaborative learning and reasoning
environment.
