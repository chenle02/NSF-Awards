Human biologists have studied the adaptations of high altitude populations for
decades, and have established the existence of physiological differences between
high altitude Andean and Himalayan groups (and low altitude groups). However, no
progress has been made in determining the mode of inheritance of critical
components in the oxygen transport systems of either Himalayan or Andean high
altitude populations, so that currently it is not possible to deduce that the
differences are hereditary, environomental, or a product of gene-environment
interactions. Employing a novel statistical genetic analytic technique on family
data from these areas, this project will address this important issue. A pilot
study suggests the chances for success are excellent.
