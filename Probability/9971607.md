Proposal: DMS-9971607

Principal Investigator: Karen Vogtmann

Abstract: This is a group proposal which covers a wide range of topics in
topology and geometric group theory, with connections to combinatorics, algebra,
probability, and biology. Specifically, the principal investigators propose to
study: diffeomorphism groups of manifolds; spaces of knots and links; the
automorphism group and outer automorphism group of a free group; Whitehead
algorithms for groups; the space of phylogenetic trees; Markov chains associated
to hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings; the topology at
infinity of Artin groups; and graphs of generating sets of finite groups.

A unifying theme of this research is that of trying to understand abstract,
algebraic constructions by relating them to concrete, geometric objects,
somewhat as a sequence of abstract operations may be realized as a set of
elementary manipulations of a Rubik's cube. The geometric objects in question
are often very simple and natural, and can sometimes serve as mathematical
models for phenomena in other scientific fields. For example, geometry and
algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are used for
simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics. In addition,
geometric insights often lead to the discovery of new relations between a priori
unrelated concepts.
