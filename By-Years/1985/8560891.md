Advantages of ultrasonic sensors are low cost and high precision of short range
measurements. Effective use of ultrasonic sensor systems will allow robots to
handle imprecisely positioned parts, weld, inspect, and perform factory assembly
tasks. Research is underway to build an array of ultrasonic transducers, mount
it on the wrist of a robot, and integrate it with the manipulator. The acoustic
beams will be electronically steered and focused. The electronic beam focusing
will improve parallel processing architecture is proposed to process the three-
dimensional images. Computer integration between the sensor acquired data and
the manipulator joints control includes a motion-patch planning block and a
coordinate transformation block. This technical approach allows the sensor and
the manipulator to carry out extremely dexterous work which demands precise
position and motion path control of the robot hand and/or robot hand-held tools
with respect to work piece.
