This Presidential Young Investigator award will enable the investigator to
pursue an integrated program of research on the production and perception of
speech, including the development of these capacities in children acquiring
their native language. The investigator has developed a model of speech
production which has become extremely influential in the field. He has
identified a number of shortcoming in the model, particularly with respect to
questions of the timing of speech. He is now exploring a new family of algorithm
which show promise for a better treatment of the timing issues, and which also
appear to relate interestingly to phenomena of speech perception. During the
ensuing grant period, he will pursue this theoretical development in depth, with
particular reference to the problem of modeling inter-work phenomena. The
research plans also include further theoretical and empirical work on the
problem of speech acquisition. There is a fundamental question of acquisition
related to the problem of how it is an infant can learn to perform the complex
motor activities of speech based on the acoustic data the child receives as a
model. The investigator has developed a hypothesis that speech acquisition is
based on the development of an internal model of the vocal tract during
babbling, and will be exploring its implications, including implications for the
perceptual correlates of coarticulation. The hypothesis makes certain
predictions about the order of acquisition of various speech sounds, and another
research direction is to test the empirical validity of these predictions.
