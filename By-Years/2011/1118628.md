The investigators will collect data on a broad range of informal science
education activities of an existing sample of approximately 3,500 adults across
the U.S. It will relate these activities to prior forms of science involvement
and to various indicators of lifelong STEM learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed work is an extension of the Longitudinal Study of American Youth
(LSAY), a study funded by NSF since 1986 and still ongoing. Prior work has
tracked two national cohorts of students who were originally representative of
public middle and high schools, focusing on their science and mathematics course
enrollment, content, achievement, and career choices, and informed by data from
their parents and teachers. The project team has maintained very high levels of
continued participation by the approximately 5,000 students, now aged 34-38,
many of whom have families of their own. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will
extend the planned surveys for 2009 and 2010 to examine how these adults use
informal science education resources such as museums, libraries, books,
magazines, newspapers, television, and the Internet. The project will provide
baseline data on informal science education resource use in the Internet era for
a large and diverse sample. It will allow investigation of the relationships of
current informal science learning behaviors, both individual and
intergenerational, to prior learning variables such as school science
achievement, parental involvement, college experience, career choice, and prior
use of informal learning resources while respondents were school-aged.
