This proposal relates the design of an experiment, i.e., its particular choices
of experimental conditions, and the implications for the statistical analysis of
the resulting data. "Optimal" designs will be constructed for discrete settings,
and research will be continued on asymmetrical orthogonal arrays. In addition,
the relationships between the design and dimension reduction procedures used in
the analysis will be explored; and a theory will be developed for determining
for which designs these analytic techniques work, and perhaps leading to the
development of new designs with optimality properties for such analyses.
