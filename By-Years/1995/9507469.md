This proposal seeks supplemental funding to conduct a survey of Black Americans
during the 1996 Presidential election. This survey will build on earlier 1984
and 1988 surveys of the Black electorate and help answer questions about the
impact of political environment and legislative representation (areas omitted in
the earlier studies) on Black voting behavior. The following issues will be
addressed: the impact of Black congressional representation and electoral
arrangements on Black voting behavior and public opinion, the impact of
political context on Black turnout, the impact of respondent's subjective
evaluation of political culture on their behaviors and attitudes, the
determinants of Black vote, the salience and weight of racial identification,
the level of Black satisfaction with political gains in the post-civil rights
era. The data will also permit intergroup comparisons with the 1996 National
Election Study respondents.
