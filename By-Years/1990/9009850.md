A broad program of research in theoretical physics will be carried out. It will
include study of the observable consequences of expanded versions of the
Standard Model that include multiple Higgs doublets, technicolor and/or
supersymmetry, such as, for example, the large contributions to the neutron
electric dipole moment that arise in these models. Continued study of the
phenomenology of superstrings, focussing on model-independent predictions and on
the search for a stable vacuum with broken supersymmetry, will be undertaken, as
will continued study of quantum gravity, and of the ground states of string
theory. This program of research addresses a number of very important questions
regarding the behavior and properties of the elementary particles, and the
unification of the forces of nature.
