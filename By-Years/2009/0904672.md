Research under this award addresses a core problem in the development of
intelligent systems: the generation of effective, deliberate activity over
substantial time scales in complex state spaces. Whereas current methods for
plan generation are limited either to very short plans or to very repetitive
behavior in highly structured and simplified environments, the investigators are
developing a new mathematical framework for hierarchical decision making. The
framework, based on so-called "angelic" nondeterministic semantics for high-
level actions, underpins new algorithms capable of generating provably optimal
high-level plans without expanding those plans into primitive actions. The
algorithms therefore satisfy the "downward refinement property," resolving a
problem that has been open for over 30 years at the heart of AI planning
research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By combining hierarchical deliberation, both
offline and online, with hierarchical reinforcement learning and apprenticeship
learning for low-level physical skill acquisition, the research seeks to enable
dexterous human-scale robots to operate in unstructured environments such as
kitchens, offices, and environments of still greater complexity. The research
promises to yield a deeper understanding of, and better tools for, large-scale
decision making in general, with implications in the social, governmental,
corporate, and military spheres. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded
