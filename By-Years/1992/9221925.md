Virtually all animals are both predators (in some sense) and potential prey for
other animals. Understanding the behavioral implications of this simple truism
has been a major focus of ecologically-based behavioral research over the past
10 to 15 years. This research has led to considerable insight into the nature of
animal decision-making, and has enhanced the ability of biologists to predict
animal behavior under natural conditions. Research on anti-predatory behavior
has also yielded much insight into both the evolution of behavior and the nature
of large-scale ecological systems. Dr. Lima's research follows in this tradition
and focuses specifically on a prominent area in anti-predatory behavior: the
detection of predators by socially-feeding animals. A great deal of work in this
area indicates that animals somehow coordinate their anti-predatory vigilance
(that is, alert behavior), and, in essence, detect predatory attack as a
socially-integrated unit. This work has many ecological and evolutionary
implications, particularly for the evolution of cooperative behavior in animals.
However, Dr. Lima's recent NSF-funded research reveals that dark-eyed juncos do
not coordinate their vigilance, nor do they detect attack as an integrated unit.
These discoveries raise several interesting questions, which Dr. Lima will now
pursue. He will see if his anomalous findings hold across several bird species.
Dr. Lima also will investigate how flock members find out that a predator has
been detected by other individuals; previous work indicates that there is very
little direct transfer of information within the flock. This research will
indicate whether or not a major reassessment is needed in this important and
long-standing area in the study of anti- predatory behavior.
