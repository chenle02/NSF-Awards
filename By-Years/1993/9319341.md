9319341 Hung This research project is aimed at a comprehensive investigation on
the dynamic interaction between a concrete gravity dam and the reservoir during
earthquakes when the depth and capacity of the reservoir are seriously altered
and reduced by reservoir sediment. The dam/reservoir system will be further
studied when the effect of foundation rock is included in the analysis. The
sediment will be modeled as a poroelastic medium. The momentum equations for the
solid phase in the porous medium and those for the fluid phase will be solved
simultaneously with the pressure wave equations for sediment and the impounded
water, the vibration of the dam, and the response of the foundation rock. The
effects of sediment thickness, material properties, and the bulk modulus of
water will be investigated. Since the inertial force and the Stokes drag in the
sediment have been identified to increase hydrodynamics forces over 50 or 100%,
a special computational procedure will be developed and used for dam safety
analysis and design. ***
