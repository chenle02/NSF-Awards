This award will support a long-term research stay in Japan for Thomas M.
Cronin, U.S. Geological Survey, to conduct collaborative research with Noriyuki
Ikeya at the Institute of Geosciences, Shizuoka University, Japan. The objective
of this project is to develop a quantitative method for the paleoclimatic study
of Neogene and Quaternary marine deposits of Japan and the western North Pacific
Ocean. Building upon a previous Cronin-Ikeya paleoclimatic study which applied a
qualitative analysis of Ostracoda, a small, bivalved Crustacea which is easily
fossilized, this project will utilize the extensive ostracode collection and
water temperature data which are available at Shizuoka University. After a
quantitative analysis of the ostracode samples at different water temperatures,
the team will employ Dr. Cronin's methodology to develop a transfer function for
the osctracodes and to derive equations for computing summer and winter
paleotemperatures from Pliocene and Quaternary fossil ostracode assemblages from
the western North Pacific. The research results will be applied to measure the
climatic change during the middle Pliocene period.
