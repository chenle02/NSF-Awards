The proposed funding will be used to offset costs for students to travel to the
37th International Symposium on Combustion, Ireland, July 29 to August 3, 2018.
The supported students are expected to have authored or co-authored accepted
papers and to present them in person at the Symposium. It is anticipated that
the funds will support 45 students, with $1,000 for each person. The
International Symposium on Combustion is the most prestigious technical
conference in the combustion community. By attending this meeting, students will
be exposed to the state-of-the-art combustion research and have a chance to
network with other researchers and practicing engineers. This experience will
greatly enhance their scientific knowledge as well as professional
careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
