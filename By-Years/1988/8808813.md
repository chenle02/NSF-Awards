This research is a combined experimental and theoretical study of the
deposition of flame generated silica particles onto a thin circular disk or
circular cylinder. The theory will include effects of particle inertia,
diffusion, thermophoresis, and coagulation on the variation of particle size
distributions with position and its influence on the deposition rate.
Experiments will measure local aerosol concentration and size distribution and
the overall deposition rate will be determined by weight changes of the
collectors. The research should provide improved understanding of the vapor
axial deposition (VAD) process and the outside vapor deposition (OVD) process
for manufacturing optical waveguide preforms and other cases, desired or
otherwise, of particle deposition onto surfaces from high temperature gases.
