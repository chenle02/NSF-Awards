***&lt;br/&gt;9733554&lt;br/&gt;Thomas&lt;br/&gt;This award is made as a part of
the FY98 CAREER competition. The scientific component of the research focuses on
the study of dust-particle transport in plasmas. The techniques of particle
image velocimetry will be used to follow the motion of the particles. This marks
the first time that this technique, which to date has been used on fluid
systems, will be used to study dusty plasmas. The final years of the work will
concentrate on the analysis of "crystals" in the plasma. The educational
component of the activity involves the development of a competitive program that
brings a high school student/teacher pair to work on a project in the PI's
laboratory during each summer. This project would then be taken back to the high
school during the subsequent academic year. At the same time the PI will serve
as "science mentor" for the teacher's class during the school
year.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
