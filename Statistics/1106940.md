The investigator will study the relation between inconstant penalization and
local adaptivity. The goal is to achieve location adaptive functional estimation
when the underlying model (of the relation between a response and input
variables) has inhomogeneous roughness. The investigator will (1) quantify the
connection between a variable penalty function and the resulting local
adaptivity, (2) generalize the methods for high-dimensional input variables, (3)
study the selection of algorithmic parameters, (4) derive theoretical properties
of the resulting estimators, and (5) design fast computational strategies.

Functional estimation under inhomogeneous roughness is a fundamental problem in
many statistical applications. This study will contribute to the fundamental
understanding to these problems, as well as providing deployable tools.
Especially for large size datasets, better performance than the current state-
of-the-art methodology is anticipated.
