Composition & Role of Organizing Committee: Three organizing committees have
been selected to participate in the planning of this event. These include an
international, national, and local committee. The primary goal of each of the
organizing committees is to nominate speakers and panelists to participate in
the Congress, to serve on panels and as moderators, and finally, to help craft
the roadmap document. The international committee members serve to represent
their country of origin throughout the globe to ensure international inclusion
to the Congress speakers and participants. The national committee members
include members from key institutions in the United States that have educational
programs and researchers in biophotonics. The local committee is comprised on
members of the Center for Biophotonics at UC Davis.
