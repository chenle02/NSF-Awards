The aim of this project is to equip student work stations that provide
supervised hands-on participation in laboratory exercises to replace the
demonstration practices previously followed. Four Grass polygraph systems, ten
microscopes, and an Apple IIe-based instrumental control and data collection
system are being installed in the undergraduate Animal Anatomy and Physiology
laboratories to potentiate a basic and far-reaching curricular change. Six
laboratory courses are affected. Majors in Animal Science now will graduate from
this program much better prepared to meet the demands of graduate school or
employment in this rapidly growing aspect of applied biology. The project serves
students of mainly urban origin and of diverse backgrounds, ethnicities and
socio-economic levels. Approximately 70% of the students served are women.
