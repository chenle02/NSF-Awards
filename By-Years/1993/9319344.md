9319344 Rollag Exposure of cultured Xenopus tailfin melanophores to light causes
intracellular pigment granules to migrate from a homogeneous cytoplasmic
distribution to a perinuclear aggregate. This direct photic response, which is
independent of the visual system, provides a convenient model system for study
of the mechanisms by which light directly modifies cellular function. The
proposed research will identify molecular components of the phototransduction
pathway in cultured melanophores, compare the molecular cascades elicited by
light and melatonin (a hormone which causes similar morphological changes), and
define experimental paradigms that induce the photosensitive phenotype.
Immunocytochemical, molecular biological, radioimmunochemical, and
videomicroscopic techniques will be employed. It is expected that this research
will 1) provide an important precedent for understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying extra-retinal photoreception in vertebrate cells (a
biological response that is not only used during camouflage, but also for
regulation of seasonal reproductive phenomena in a variety of vertebrate
species), 2) expand upon the use of the amphibian melanophore as a model system
for study of the molecular mechanism of both melatonin and light signal
transduction, and 3) provide a method for reliably inducing the photosensitive
phenotype in nonphotosensitive melanophores (a necessary preliminary to studies
that seek to determine the chemical identity of photosensitizing inductive
factors and their mechanisms of action). ***
