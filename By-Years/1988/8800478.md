This proposal deals with a cost effective means for handling the massive
amounts of data produced by supercomputer users. It aims to produce the
necessary software and hardware interfaces required for the use of inexpensive
personal computer workstations for data visualization. In addition, interactive
visualization software will be developed suitable for the analysis of general
Cartesion data; new visual formats and algorithms will be developed for the
analysis of multidimensional, multivariate data; and new hardware architectures
will be explored that will accelerate the production of graphical expressions of
data representing continuous fields.
