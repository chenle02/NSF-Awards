ABSTRACT OPP-9711609 RAM, MICHAEL SUNY at Buffalo This research project will
utilize the Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two (GISP2) ice core to look for
evidence of an eleven-year sunspot cycle. Preliminary results indicate that some
of the GISP2 ice core contains dust that has been transported by global
atmospheric circulation to the summit of Greenland and incorporated into the ice
sheet. Those results show that a sunspot cycle exists in an older section of the
core and the investigator will determine if the same cycle can be identified in
the past few hundred years when there is a historical, observational record of
fluctuating sunspot activity. The investigator will examine the relationship of
increased aridity in China (the likely source of the dust) with the sunspot
cycle to determine if fluctuations in solar activity may be responsible for
changes either in desert size or wind speed/direction. Therefore, this project
has important implications for the impact of solar activity on continental
environments.
