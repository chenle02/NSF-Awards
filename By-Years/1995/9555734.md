9555734 Frierson The Valencia BRIDGES program (Building and Replicating an
Innovative Demonstration Model to Facilitate Gender Equity in Science) will
focus on activities that increase students, faculty, and counselors
understanding of the relationships between gender and the study of science. The
project will increase the academic, retention, and completion success rates of
female community college students enrolled in science courses, develop a new
instructional approach to better prepare females for upper division study and
careers involving scientific research, and increase the percentage of female
students enrolled in science courses by helping female students make informed
career choices and better course selection decisions. Curricular changes include
a new lower division research methods course, enriched lower division biological
and physical science courses with strategies and content that are free of gender
bias, mentoring opportunities for students, hands-on internships in research
laboratories at the University of Florida, scientific and equity workshops
targeted at the female student population, new recruitment and promotion
materials to targeted students, and specialized counseling and mentoring
interactions which focus on personal, transfer, career, and financial aid
issues. Community college students are less likely to have research and
mentoring experiences that lead to research-based scientific careers. This
project will reform lower level science courses to be more accessible for all
students and will partner with the state land grant institution to prepare
community college students for university-level science courses. Mentorships
will act as an informal network to increase student success. ***
