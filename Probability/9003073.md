The principal investigator will continue his work on applications of
probabilistic techniques in local times and classical function theory,
especially Bloch functions, gamma star functions, and lacunary series. The
principal investigator will work at the interface between probability theory and
classical function theory of classical analysis, i.e. the study of boundary
behavior of analytic functions.
