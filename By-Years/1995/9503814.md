9503814 Fertig The PI will investigate theoretically two-dimensional electron
systems, specifically the Wigner crystal and layered systems in the quantum Hall
regime. The effects of a disorder potential on the static and dynamic properties
of classical crystals, as well as crystals in very strong magnetic fields, will
be studied, including correlation functions in the ground state, noise spectra,
and AC conductivity. He will also theoretically study photoluminescence (an
experimental probe), quantum effects, double layer quantum Hall systems, excited
states, and impurity effects. %%% The PI will conduct theoretical research on
two-dimensional electron systems, as found on the surface of helium and in
semiconducting systems in strong magnetic fields. Such systems are of special
interest because they cannot be completely explained by traditional theoretical
methods. This PI plays an important part in contributing to the new methods that
must be developed to understand such systems. He is known for the breadth of his
research and the variety of methods he uses. Parts of his work will be
especially helpful in interpreting several recent experiments on these systems.
