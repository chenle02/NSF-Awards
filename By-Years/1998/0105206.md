The goal of this research is to examine the climatology and seasonal circulation
patterns in West and Central Africa and investigate the relationship of biomass
fires and tropospheric ozone levels of the Tropical Atlantic. High ozone levels
in the tropical Atlantic have major implications for global atmospheric
chemistry and potential environmental effects throughout the tropics. The
principal investigator is utilizing visible and infrared satellite imagery and
numerical modeling of selected case studies to isolate key transport mechanisms
for ozone and ozone precursors. The project involves significant collaboration
with African scientists.
