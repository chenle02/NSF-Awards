Multi-scale Galerkin methods will be developed for the study of
structural/building systems in which the response is characterized by multiple-
spatial and multiple-time scales. For this type of structural problems, the
response is often dominated by the middle part of the frequency spectrum, which
in this proposal is referred ta as medium frequency dynamic analysis. New
temporal and spatial discretization methods will be developed for the multi-time
scale structural dynamic problems. The concept of fast and slow time scales will
be introduced for the temporal discretization. The required time step is shown
to be dependent only on the slow time scale, and therefore, large time step can
be used for the high frequency problems. To meet the spatial counterpart of the
requirement on time step requirement, finite-spectral elements and finite wave
elements will also be developed. These developed methods will be applied to
building systems, and nonlinear dynamic buckling of fluid-filled shell
structures.
