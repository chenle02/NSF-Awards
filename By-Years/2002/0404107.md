Integrated biochips are promising devices for the rapid and accurate detection
of biological entities such as cells, bacteria, spores, and viruses. These
integrated biochips need to concentrate, trap, lyse, and perform genetic
identification, all on the same device. Figure 1 shows an overall integrated
biochip device that is being developed in our group. The accurate identification
of these cells and microorganisms require the lysing of the cells to extract the
DNA and proteins for molecular identification. DNA extraction using electrical
means that are low power and integrated on to a microchip format can be very
useful for realizing fully integrated bioanalytical devices. The objective of
this project is to design and develop a method of extracting the genetic
material from viruses within a handheld device which are low power, simple to
use and compact. We will work with the Western Reserve Strain of Vaccinia Virus
as the model virus as the main goal. As a stretch goal, we will perform the
experiments with the Human Coronavirus
