A Symposium on "Advances in Computational Methods for Transport Phenomena" will
be held at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, January 7- 9, 1991. The
objective of this symposium is to bring together the leading numerical modelers
working in the area of transport phenomena to share fundamentals of the new
algorithms being used with the current enhanced high-performance computational
power and to discuss potential applications. The program will consist of four
two- hour plenary lectures with twelve thirty-minute application lectures. The
following four topics will be discussed: 1. New developments of the adaptive
finite elements method, with application to reacting flows and turbomachinery.
2. Upwind techniques for water quality and two phase flow applications. 3.
Finite element and finite difference methods for turbulent flows, non-Newtonian
flows, coating flows, and crystal growth. 4. Finite element methods with back
diffusion with application to geophysical flows. 5. Application of massively
parallel algorithms to transport phenomena modeling.
