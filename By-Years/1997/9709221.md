This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at University of
California@Irvine acquire a CCD-based area detector system for single X-ray
structure analysis. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) preparation of oligomeric and polymeric ligand-
bridged transition metal compounds, (2) synthetic organolanthanide chemistry,
(3) synthesis and reactivity of silsesquioxanes, (4) luminescent and redox-
active supramolecular systems, (5) design, synthesis, and study of artificial
beta-sheets, and (6) synthetic organic chemistry The X-ray diffractometer is
used to make accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional
structure of a molecule. The information obtained gives the precise values of
all the bond distances and bond angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate
information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
neighboring molecules
