This college has requested funds to support a new group of CSEM scholars. Their
first CSEM award created two-year scholarships for 42 students, 30 in the fall
of 2000 and 12 in the fall of 2001. The program was open to enrolled students
who completed their first year of study, and to transfer students all of whom
had to meet eligibility requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their current project
has been designed to provide funds for 40 talented and needy students in the
areas of STEM with annual scholarships and programmatic support services to
graduate in a timely manner. Eligible students will consist primarily of those
who have completed their first year of study and have demonstrated financial
need and academic potential. Up to $4000 per year will be awarded to each
scholar ($3125 from NSF funds, and $875 from institutional funds). Twenty 3-
year scholarships will be awarded in the spring of years 2003 and 2004.
