This project incorporates data acquisition systems (DAS) into this
institution's mechanical engineering laboratory. The DAS systems, consisting of
four individual workstations, are interfaced to already existing laboratory
equipment. Each workstation consists of a personal computer, data acquisition
interface, printer, plotter and related software. This equipment assists
students with data acquisition, computational analysis, and presentation of
results for a variety of laboratory experiments. Students are freed from tedious
manual data collection and analysis and focus their energies on the
interpretation of results and parameter variations and responses. Students are
actively involved in the setup of experiments, the interfacing of transducers,
the use of off-the-shelf software, and the development of software for data
presentation and analysis. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the
grantee.
