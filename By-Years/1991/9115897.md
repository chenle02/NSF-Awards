This award provides funds for the further development and construction of
devices that reflect, focus and filter neutrons used for structural studies of
biomolecules and biomolecular assemblies. The devices will be used at the High
Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory, one of only a few such
facilities in the world with sufficient flux for the analysis of biological
materials. The development and use of these devices will increase the neutron
flux available at each of three spectrometers used for protein crystallography,
membrane analysis and small angle scattering. Increased flux is particularly
important to analysis of biological samples because it serves to decrease the
long exposure times typically required, thus reducing the chance of sample
denaturation during analysis and increasing the throughput of the spectrometers.
