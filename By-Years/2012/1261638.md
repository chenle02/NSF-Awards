The objective of this research is to develop and to apply advances in circuit
integration and Compressive Sensing theory to the design of next generation of
energy-harvesting image sensors. Compressive Sensing is a new theoretical
framework for signal acquisition. In the proposed project, Compressive Sensing
provides a solution for the trade-off between image quality and harvested
energy. Specifically, these image sensors will have reconfigurable pixels that
can work as light sensors or as tiny solar cells. Depending on the environmental
conditions more or less pixels can be reconfigured to either modality.

The proposed research introduces a new sensing paradigm especially suited to
sensor networks and energy-constrained sensing applications. It also introduces
a new approach based on fractal geometry to increase the efficiency of on-chip
solar cells. The project will advance the field of Compressive Sensing by
providing hardware solutions and practical encoding techniques. Analog-to-
digital converters that can jointly perform the tasks of quantization and
entropy encoding are also included in this project.

The proposed research will result in low-cost image sensors suitable for
surveillance, space exploration, and monitoring applications. These sensors can
harvest ambient energy and, thus, can operate unattended for extended periods of
time. Moreover, the proposed fractal photodiodes can be employed to improve
solar cell design. The proposed educational activities will enhance the
curricula of courses taught at University of Missouri-Kansas City. A design
competition and a workshop will be implemented to increase the participation of
underrepresented students in research activities and to enrich outreach efforts.
