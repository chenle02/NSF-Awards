This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will capitalize on
evolving concepts for sensor optimization that will facilitate homeland security
by detecting and tracking human targets through foliage, building walls, fog,
and other opaque materials. This work will explore repeatable methods to extract
target anomalies from ground sensor data and employ statistical methods to
mitigate false alarms and track these anomalies. This work capitalizes on
target-induced amplitude and phase distortions in the reflected signal to
generate an observation set comprised of isolated and potentially classifiable
anomalies. The combined approach facilitates extraction of challenging targets
such as dismounted terrorist forces in the presence of clutter and neighboring
targets. Statistical methods to track these targets also facilitate data fusion
from numerous sensors, which simultaneously increases target discrimination and
sensor coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This technology will have broad
application in airport security, hostile police action, high school and other
hostage events, and for search and rescue. &lt;br/&gt;
