The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this award to
Connecticut College to develop non-aqueous routes for the synthesis of
microporous manganese oxides with layered and tunneled structures using sol-gel
and colloid precursors. With this award, Professor Ching will prepare manganese
oxide thin films and aerogels using non-aqueous sol-gel reactions between
tetraalkylammonium permanganates and methanol. High surface area aerogels will
be prepared without the solvent exchange steps needed with aqueous gels. In
addition, these layered and tunneled materials will accommodate a wide range of
interstitial cations. The growth of manganese oxide particles in colloidal and
sol-gel environments will be studied in terms of their size distribution using
dynamic light scattering under a number of reaction conditions such as time,
temperature, concentration, reactant ratio, and mechanical agitation. These
studies in concert with other proposed characterization techniques will be used
to establish procedures to prepare manganese oxides with predetermined
properties such as crystallinity, particle size, and morphology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manganese oxide thin films and aerogels that will be
prepared in this study are expected to have high surface area, and will
accommodate a wide range of interstitial cations for potential applications in
catalysis and lithium ion rechargeable batteries. The proposed studies, in
addition, will provide undergraduate students with comprehensive hands-on
experience in research, and the project has the potential to attract more
students to careers in science.
