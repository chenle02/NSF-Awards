Models of extragalactic radio jets will be constructed using a variety of
numerical approaches. An essentially three-dimensional boundary-following code
will be used to continue to investigate the formation and evolution of radio
jets. In particular, the bending of jets by ram pressure as the central galactic
source moves through an external medium, the growth of non-axisymmetric
instabilities, and the effects of a precessing source of jet fluid, will all be
studied. Recently developed analytic models of jet propagation from a galactic
halo across a pressure-matched interface into an extremely hot intergalactic
medium will be developed further. Preliminary calculations using this idea seem
to provide good explanations for both the current average size of strong radio
sources and the fact the such sources were significantly samller at earlier
cosmological epochs. Numerical models of this situation will be developed using
both the three-dimensional boundary following code and a full two-dimensional
hydrodynamics code and more detailed comparisons with statistical data will be
made. Analytic models for jet instabilities will be applied to Very Large Array
(VLA) radio maps of a particularly interesting radio source with a single,
oscillatory jet feeding into a diffuse lobe. A general model for the continuum
electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei, based on coherent plasma
processes, will be further developed and compared with observations.
