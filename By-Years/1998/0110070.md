0110070&lt;br/&gt;Simon&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this proposal is to
develop techniques to image two colors simultaneously at video rates (&gt;30
frames/sec) so that either two different probes, or a single probe with two
different emissions, can be imaged synchronously. Further, to develop the
techniques for using multiple lasers for excitation. This goal will allow two
different kinds of studies: First, it would allow multiple proteins to be
studied in a single cell. This is important for addressing questions of protein-
protein interactions. Second, it will allow many physiological studies using
dual-emission dyes that can be used to quantify important cell signaling
molecules such as calcium or pH. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these
molecules are key for understanding many aspects of cellular
signaling.&lt;br/&gt;
