This grant provides support for two University of Michigan scientists, Profs.
F. Becchetti and J. J>necke, and their students, to carry out experiments using
NSF-funded accelerator facilities at Michigan State University, the University
of Indiana, and Notre Dame University. Their research will focus on unusual
properties of atomic nuclei using short-lived radioactive nuclei as particle
beams. Studies of unusual .- and >-decay modes of nuclei will also be
undertaken. Many of these experiments bear upon the understanding of the
creation of nuclei in supernova and stellar nuclear reaction processes.
