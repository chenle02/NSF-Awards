AST-9714275 Lin A key issue associated with emergence and survival of life under
extreme environments is the delineation of habitable zones. Conventional
investigations have focused on the existence of water on the surface of planets
as a consequence of radiative heating provided by their host stars. Dr. Douglas
Lin and coworkers will examine the persistent existence of a sub-surface liquid
water layer as a consequence of tidal heating in satellites around planets.
Through a case study of the tidal interaction between Pluto and Charon, these
researchers will examine this process as an effective mechanism for heating
satellite interiors. A systematic analysis will be carried out to test the
hypothesis that the persistent energy dissipation within Charon is adequate to
preserve liquid water below its ice crust. A similar analysis is planned for the
tidal interaction between Uranus and its satellites. This award is made through
the NSF's special competition on Life in Extreme Environments, with
participation by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
Sciences.
