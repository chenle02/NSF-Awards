Parallel and distributed programming is intrinsically more difficult then
sequential programming, yet few effective tools or methodologies have been
developed to help programmers understand the behavior of their parallel
programs. Browsing source code and tracing program output are tedious and
ineffective approaches for parallel program understanding. Program
visualization, which relates a program's behavior to the programmer's model of
the system's components and interactions, has been shown to be a novel and
highly effective approach to program and algorithm comprehension. Extending and
adapting program visualization to parallel programming can aid comprehension of
the complex concurrent events and transitions that occur in parallel programs.
This project will define a model for the capture and display of parallel program
events and transitions, based upon the path- transition paradigm for animation,
and partial ordering of events. The model will be used to develop a prototype
for visualizing parallel programs. The model and its prototype will be tested
upon a suite of scientific parallel programs.
