A central issue in brain function is how patterns of sequential neural activity
are created to produce sophisticated motor patterns in activities such as
communication behavior, ranging from mating calls to language. In well-studied
songbirds, singing-related activity occurs in a region known as RA (robust
nucleus of the archistriatum), where individual neurons generate highly
reproducible patterns of high-frequency bursts. Onsets and endings of these
bursts show temporal correlations across large populations of neurons in this
region, suggesting that RA undergoes synchronized transitions from one state of
active neurons to another. The goal of this project is to develop models of how
such sequence generation can occur, and test these models experimentally. A
unique approach is used with a novel technology for stable cellular recordings
from a sleeping bird, in which such structured bursts occur with patterns
apparently 'replaying' the patterns produced during actual singing.&lt;br/&gt;
Results will be important for understanding mechanisms of sequence generation
and of motor learning in the vertebrate brain, and could have an impact
extending to mechanisms of human speech production. This combined computational
and experimental work also provides a young PI with a cross-disciplinary
experience that includes university-industry collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
