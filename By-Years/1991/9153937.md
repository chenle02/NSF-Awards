The Davis County Private Industry Council proposes a four (4) year project to
improve science and mathematics instruction and learning through: (a) involving
80 low income at-risk youth in personally meaningful math/science experiences
which will help them overcome their basic skill deficiencies; (b) providing
private sector employment opportunities for 80 math and science school teachers;
(c) increasing process skills of 54,000 students in the Davis School District;
(d) involving 250 K-9 math and science teachers in curriculum development and
instructional material usage. Included in the project plan is participation by
private sector scientists who will teach technical topics in local schools,
demonstrate real world science applications to students and teachers, and
provide information on career opportunities. The Foundation's commitment is
approximately 32% of the total project cost.
