9412260 Furlong This grant is to support a workshop of the Coordinating
Organization for Northern California Earthquake Research and Technology
(CONCERT) which is composed of the principal government, university and industry
researchers in the fields of seismology, tectonophysics, geodynamics, structural
geology, and geomorphology in northern California. The subject of the workshop
is an integrative model of the present tectonic setting and an assessment of the
implications for earthquake genesis and hazards in the region. A paper outlining
the results of the workshop will be published. Approximately 100 professionals
and regional press representatives are expected to attend the workshop scheduled
for Menlo Park, California, on April 18-20, 1994. This research is a component
of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***
