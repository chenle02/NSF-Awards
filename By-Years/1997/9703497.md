9703497 Chen This proposed work is a further investigation of certain "gradient-
like" flows. In particular, the focus is on the study of the partial regularity,
the uniqueness and the behavior of the singularities for the weak flow of
harmonic maps, and the partial regularity for the weak flow of H-system from a
surface with a Dirichlet boundary condition or with a free boundary condition.
Due to the geometric nature, these flows satisfy nonlinear partial differential
equations, which rarely can be attacked by standard PDE methods or direct
variational method. The aim of this proposed work is to find new results for
these problems and to develop new methods for the study of a whole class of
geometric evolution problems with a similar structure. The belief is that the
nonlinear analysis method developed here can also be applied to material
science, such as the evolution of spin fields in continuum ferromagnets, and to
other areas.
