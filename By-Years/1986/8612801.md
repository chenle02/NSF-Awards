This project pursues a novel form of ceramic fiber synthesis using polymeric
precursors, melt processing them into 'green' fibers, followed by pyrolysis into
ceramic products. In particular, the strudy will explore avenues in the
synthesis of preceramic polymers containing B, Si, C, N, Ti, Zr, Cr. W and Mo.
