The research deals with protein separations by a new phenomenon, "ligand-induced
transport." The protein diffusion across a porous membrane is enhanced by the
concentration gradient of a ligand to which the protein binds. The high but
different fluxes of different proteins provide the basis for an efficient
separation process. In this research six enzymes will be studied, each with two-
three ligands. The fluxes will be measured by a new fluorescence spectroscopy
technique. The expected results of the research are twofold: (a) to provide a
fundamental understanding of protein/ligand interactions; and (b) possibly leads
to a new, efficient technique for separation and purification of proteins.
