This award will allow the PI to identify, conserve and curate the type
specimens (604+) in the Mycological Herbarium of Pennsylvania State University
(67,500 specimens, including 565 types). The conservation procedure involves
placing the specimens in air-tight plastic bags and storing in acid-free packets
and genus-folders. Curation will involve capturing all of the relevant data
attendant to the type material on a computerized database, so that it can be
shared over networks with scientists at other institutions who are involved in
mycological research. This project will contribute to scientific research and
education (graduate students) on fungi.
