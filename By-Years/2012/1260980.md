This project explores whether or not we can empirically test the assumption that
people make decisions in economically rational ways. The project combines the
well-known microeconomic concept of revealed preference with recent results on
nonparametric demand estimation. The research team combines new research in
economic theory, the development of new computational tools, and new statistical
testing methods that include new test statistics, ways to estimate the
distribution of these statistics, and ways to construct confidence intervals.
The methods are all intended for application to large data
sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project breaks new ground by building ideas and
methods that bring together two very different areas of economics. The results
will allow for the empirical testing of key economic hypotheses using very large
data sets in ways that are only now possible because of increased computing
power. The methods developed in this project will be useful for many other
purposes; for example, businesses and governments will be able to use these
methods to infer demand for new products from observed purchase decisions about
existing products.
