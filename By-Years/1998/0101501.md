This project focuses on the study of the transverse dynamics of a nearly-
confocal nonlinear Fabry-Perot ring resonator, using a rubidium vapor cell
placed in the resonator as a Kerr medium. Coupling by four-wave mixing of the
transverse modes is predicted to produce a transverse cavity mode spectrum
consisting of a central spike corresponding to the lowest on-axis TEM-00 mode,
on top of a low pedestal of higher modes. The similarity of this transverse mode
spectrum to the central spike formed by bosons in the momentum space
distribution when they undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) suggests that
these phenomena can also be understood by an analogy to BEC. Extending this
analogy, the group will attempt to observe a BEC-like phase transition in which
the well-collimated output beam corresponding to the central-spike momentum
spectrum suddenly becomes uncollimated as a random modulation of the input laser
light by crossed AOMs is increased beyond a certain critical amplitude.
