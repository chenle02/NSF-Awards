The use of InAs as a substrate for MBE- grown heterojunction with better than
10-3 lattice-matching should make available a range of electronic and photonic
heterojuction devices of high mobilities and lower bandgaps than those available
on GaAs substrates. Little is known about either the barriers ( Ec, Ev) expected
for such heterojunctions or the transport properties of such structures and
these will be studied. This is of primary importance to future electrooptical
and photonic devices (detectors, lasers and modulators). The bandgaps of
materials available which lattice-match to InAs range from 0.35 to 1.2 eV and
therefore cover the atmospheric transmission windows out to 2.6 um. Multiple
heterojunction layers on InAs substrates may also be of interest for FET and
bipolar transistor applications. Schottky barrier and heterojunction behavior
(np, pn, nn and pp) will be investigated. The grown layers will be characterized
for optical interaction, structural imperfections and for generation-
recombination in the bulk and at the interfaces at temperatures down to 80K.
