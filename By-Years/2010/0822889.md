This SBIR Phase II project will develop a new methodology for data interchange
in the agricultural industry. GreenLeaf Market is developing application program
interfaces to enable the automated transfer of data to enterprise resource
planning systems through a representational state transfer interface
interchangeable with a webservice. This platform automatically identifies and
aggregates agricultural market information while enabling this information to be
integrated into the purchaser's business systems.

If successfully commercialized, the application stands to significantly reduce
post-harvest spoilage costs, now in the tens of billions of dollars for the
United States. It will increase productivity for purchasers, assist the producer
in identifying emerging markets, reduce the distance agricultural products must
travel, boost the local economy, improve the food security of the US, and lower
the overall cost of food by reducing the gap between supply and demand.
