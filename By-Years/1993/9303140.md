9303140 Ross This project will support undergraduate participants in the
advanced component of a Young Scholars Program in mathematics at the Ohio State
University during the summer of 1993. These students will participate in
mathematics seminars designed to enhance their mathematical development and will
serve as counselors to more junior students in the program. The seminars will
focus on independent explorations in mathematics, with the goal of furthering
the intellectual development and communication skills of the students. The
counseling component will provide them with experience in serving as mentors to
other students and thus enhance the development of those considering careers in
teaching.
