The WSSSPE 2 workshop is part of a community driven effort to address the many
new challenges facing development, deployment and maintenance of reusable
software for academic research and education. These challenges include the
software development process, the support and maintenance of software,
governance and business models particularly for sustainability, the role of
software in building science communities, the need for software to lead to
science which is verifiable and reproducible, policy issues such as how to
measure software impact, choose licensing, or assign software credit, and the
education and nurturing of early stage researchers in scientific software.
&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is building upon a successful WSSSPE 1 meeting at SC13
in Denver in November 2013; the organizers expect over 60 submitted papers and
around 150 attendees at the WSSSPE 2 meeting that is anticipated to be held at
SC14 in New Orleans in November 2014. As with WSSSPE 1, WSSSPE 2 will provide an
open and dynamic forum for the community to discuss experiences and approaches
in the areas listed above. This proposal requests funds to support attendance at
WSSSPE 2 for US based researchers, particularly targeted at encouraging
attendance by early stage researchers with attention to diversity.
