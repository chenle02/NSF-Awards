Graduate student John Oswald proposes a systematic and biogeographic study of a
diverse family of lacewing Neuroptera, the Hemerobiidae. The project will entail
comparative study of new collections and museum holdings at the British Museum
and Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. The research will result in a
clearer understanding of the classification of the 49 genera in the family, and
their evolutionary relationships among themselves and with other members of the
Order Neuroptera. The project has important implications beyond the specialized
area of lacewing systematics. The group may have utility as a natural pest
control agent. The biogeographic component of the project will test the most
recent method for reconstructing historical patterns of distribution. The
resulting evolutionary classification and biogeographic synthesis will be of
interest to other entomologists and biogeographers in general.
