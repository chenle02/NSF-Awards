This project is supported Under NSF Announcement No. 90-23, "Repair and
Rehabilitation Research for Seismic Resistance of Structures." Coordination is
needed to: 1) develop a comprehensive technical document which can be used to
develop design requirements and details acceptable for engineering practice 2)
facilitate exchange of information between U.S. and foreign researchers and
designers 3) provide a mechanism for rapid transfer of technology from research
to practice This principal investigator will be responsible for coordinating
program activities between all PI's funded to undertake research study of
seismic repair and rehabilitation of structures during the first year of work.
