This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses proton
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for the Partnership for a Next Generation of
Vehicles (PNGV) program. Automobiles capable of 80 miles per gallon (or the
energy equivalent) and a range of 300 miles are sought at a cost that would be
acceptable to typical American automobile buyers. PEM fuel cells may provide the
power source if a practical method can be found for on-board conversion of
liquid hydrocarbon fuels to a hydrogen fuel which these fuel cells can use.
Presently available technology for converting hydrocarbon fuels to hydrogen is
steam reforming. This process is unsuited to use on board a vehicle for two
reasons. First, the steam reforming reaction is endothermic, meaning that heat
must be generated and transferred to the steam reforming reactor, which is
complex and cumbersome for on-board use. Second, the hydrogen produced by steam
reforming contains large amounts of CO and carbon dioxide and cannot be used in
fuel cells without extensive purification. Such purification is also complex and
cumbersome for on-board use. The technology under study in this SBIR project
produces hydrogen via a modified steam reforming reaction. This modified
reaction is mildly exothermic, obviating the need to supply heat to the reactor,
and it produces hydrogen with high purity. Thus, many of the problems of
conventional steam reforming may be avoided. Phase I will include a series of
experiments which will provide bench scale proof of concept for the application
of the concept to on-board hydrogen generation.
