Specific objectives of this research are: to define solubility rules for
proteins and nucleic acids in the presence of polyelectrolytes; to determine the
mecanism of precipitation and contrast that with the operative mechanism for low
molecular weight precipitants; to measure and mathematically model the kinetics
of precipitate formation and growth; to characterize the particulate phase
composition, retention of native form and recoverability during solid-liquid
separation steps; and to assess the potential for recovering the polyelectrolyte
if required by product specification or for reuse.
