The Division of Engineering at Brown University will purchase femtosecond laser
equipment under this NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant which will be
dedicated to support research in engineering. The laser equipment will be used
to support several research projects, including in particular time-resolved
optical spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures. The work includes wide-
bandgap semiconductor materials which are being developed for optoelectronic
applications at short visible wavelengths as well as heterostructures in which
two- dimensional and lower dimensional electrons are of high mobility. The
ultrafast optical techniques made possible by this laser instrumentation will
enable the tracking of electronic excitations in small semiconductor structures
on a scale of a few nm in real time.
