The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment for a laboratory course in
polymer chemistry. The equipment is allowing students to more fully characterize
polymers by the determination of molecular weights, thermal properties, and
mechanical properties. An unusual feature of the course is the emphasis on the
influence of various additives on the thermal and mechanical properties of
polymers.
