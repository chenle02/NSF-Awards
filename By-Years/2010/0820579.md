The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
of Colorado at Boulder supports innovative research and education in liquid
crystals, ranging from cutting-edge, basic liquid crystal and soft materials
science to the development of enhanced capabilities for photonic, chemical, and
biotech applications of liquid crystals. A multi-disciplinary team of
physicists, chemists, biochemists, molecular biologists, chemical engineers and
materials scientists work collaboratively on research and education projects.
The Center offers a broad program of activities directed towards education and
enhancement of science literacy. These include summer Research Experiences for
Undergraduates and Research Experiences for Teachers. Its K-12 outreach program,
Materials Science from Colorado University, brings Center personnel into
classrooms and uses the understanding of materials to teach physical science
concepts. Outreach activities to the public include the Liquid Crystal Wizards
family science show. The MRSEC will participate in a University-wide program
(Red Shirt Program) designed to offer a pre-freshman year of preparatory STEM
instruction, communication skills development, and clustered housing to help
prepare underserved high school students for success as science and engineering
undergraduates. The Center pursues collaborative research with a variety of
companies and international collaborators and offers its excellent experimental
and computational shared facilities for outside users.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research at the MRSEC is organized as a single
Interdisciplinary Research Group, Liquid Crystal Frontiers, with three research
thrusts. The Liquid Crystal Macro/Nano/Molecular thrust focuses on the science
and technology of bulk and composite liquid crystal systems, pursuing the design
and synthesis of new materials, and the discovery and exploration of novel
themes of self assembly and ordering. The Active Liquid Crystal Interfaces
thrust pursues the science and applications of soft interface structures,
emphasizing those that respond to external stimuli, such as light, fields, or
chemical composition, and in doing so affect the surrounding bulk media. The
Functional Liquid Crystal Assemblies thrust advances the science and technology
of hierarchically-structured soft condensed phases, emphasizing nanophase
segregation as a path to novel functional materials.&lt;br/&gt;
