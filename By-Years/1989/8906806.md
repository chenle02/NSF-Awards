The two investigators will study a variety of geometric structures which have
their origins in mathematical physics as well as complex geometry. These include
projective algebraic manifolds, complex manifolds, quaternionic Kahler
manifolds, and supermanifolds. The investigation will include a study of the
momentum mapping in connection with quaternionic Kahler reduction, self-dual
manifolds, and the twistor representation of quaternionic Kahler structures. The
dynamics of the static self- dual solutions of the two-dimensional Yang-Mills-
Higgs equations will be studied with the use of a computer. The two
investigators will continue their studies of the new "supergeometry" which was
created as part of gauge theory to understand the relationship between cosmology
and subatomic physics. One will continue his work on the twistor geometries in
Nigel Hitchin's framework. The second will use "quaternionic quotients" to
derive further knowledge of complete noncompact manifolds with unusual spin
holonomy. This last is a property of foliations and measures their shearing
tendencies.
