The mathematical theory of discontinuous solutions to hyperbolic systems is
developing intensively motivated by problems from continuum physics which model
reactive flows, multiphase flows, and elastoplastic flows, for example. The
principal investigator will focus on methods of approximation for these problems
and their convergence to physical discontinuous solutions. A better
understanding of the methods of numerical approximation for some fundamental
hyperbolic problems arising in continuum physics has profound real world
implications. These ideas carry over to such initiatives as materials
processing.
