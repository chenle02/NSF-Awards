This awards supports research to undertake a multi-proxy study of finely
laminated lake sediments in the north central region of Washington. The
researchers will investigate the complex relationships between large-scale
climatic forcing, regional climatic change, and vegetation and lake responses
over the past 13,000 years, at the watershed scale, in the northeast Pacific
region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the study is to examine shifts
in the regional precipitation-evaporation balance and its connection with the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To
achieve this goal, the researchers will use a combination of historical records
and modern calibration studies across the region to constrain the down-core
interpretations of the proxy data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help
produce a high-resolution climate history for the Pacific Northwest that will
increase knowledge of how regional climate is influenced by changes in the PDO
and other climate events. The research will provide graduate and undergraduate
students with a unique experience for professional development.
