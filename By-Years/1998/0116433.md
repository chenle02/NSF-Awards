MEMS gyroscopes are typically designed to measure angular rate of rotation. A
measurement of the angle itself is useful in many applications but cannot be
obtained by integrating the angular rate due to the presence of bias errors
which cause a drift. This project develops an innovative design for a vibrating
gyroscope that can directly measure both angle and angular rate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed design is based on the principle of measuring
the angle of free vibration of a suspended mass with respect to the casing of
the gyroscope. The design incorporates a nonlinear feedback control system in
order to address two critical challenges. First, the control system compensates
for dissipative forces and keeps the mass vibrating at a constant level of
energy. Second, the control system compensates for the rotary cross-coupling
that occurs due to the non-ideal nature of the suspending springs. The control
system is carefully designed so that it does not affect the free vibration
nature of the mass and does not alter the Coriolis forces which play an
important role in the measurement of angular rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project includes a three-phase work plan for design and in-house fabrication of
the vibratory gyroscope in the University of Minnesota's Microtechnology
Laboratory (MTL). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance of the project is that
it breaks new ground by introducing sophisticated control systems into the MEMS
domain. The use of advanced control techniques leads to a new sensor making the
measurement of a new variable (absolute angle) possible. On a lesser note,
several techniques developed in the project have wide applicability to vibratory
sensor design in general and would lead to technical improvements in
accelerometers, rate gyroscopes and microbalances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
educational objectives of the project include curriculum development, promotion
of cross-disciplinary skills, and development of benchmark models for web-based
education.&lt;br/&gt;
