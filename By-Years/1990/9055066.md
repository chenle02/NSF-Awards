Boston University's PROMYS program is an intensive six-week, residential Young
Scholars project in Mathematics for an ambitious group of 60 students entering
grades 10-12. PROMYS serves 45 first-year students and 15 returning students.
The heart of the program is the experience gained by students through their
individual and collective efforts to solve an assortment of challenging problems
in Number Theory. In 1991, students will also study Abstract Algebra, Algebraic
Curves and Combinatorics. Diverse weekly guest lectures introduce participants
to related scientific fields, philosophical and ethical questions and career
options in mathematics and science.
