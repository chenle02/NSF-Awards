This project provides two state-of-the-art microcomputer systems to replace
obsolete PDP-11 minicomputers and associated first generation microprocessor
trainers. These systems are networked to a basic and an advanced microprocessor
training laboratory. Each laboratory incorporates 12 workstations; consisting of
a terminal, an Educational Computer Board and a solderless breadboard for
experiments. The basic laboratory uses an 8-bit microprocessor and is used to
instruct electronic engineering technology majors and non-majors; including
future technology education teachers. The advanced laboratory is used to provide
instruction in microprocessor systems to the four-year graduates of the
Electronic Engineering Technology and the Industrial Electronics Programs. This
laboratory upgrade significantly improves the quality of education offered by
the Department of Industrial and Engineering Technology by proving common
equipment throughout the laboratory program and increased laboratory
productivity through better hardware and software reliability. This award is
being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
