Microscopy equipment is being utilized within the manufacturing processes and
materials laboratory, and laboratory projects are being developed for student
use. The microscopy equipment that was used in the Materials Laboratory was
limited to the extent that only one person could view the image at any given
time. The instructor's ability to provide a meaningful answer to any questions
the student asked about the structure was dependent upon the student's ability
to describe what was seen. The new use of a video camera and console allows for
a more positive identification of and discussion of the observed microstructure,
since both student and instructor view the structure simultaneously. Other
students benefit from the discussion of the microstructure in question, and all
can see that structure. The imaging equipment is giving the student greater
flexibility in obtaining photographic images for inclusion in laboratory
reports. Using the video camera and digital printer allows making a hard copy
without moving the specimen from one instrument to another. Since the digital
images are less expensive as compared with the photographic methods currently
used, time and money saved allow the individual student to make increased use of
the microscopy equipment.
