The PI will approach several questions in moduli theory. A first direction
concerns the the moduli space of stable quotients, in particular the calculation
of invariants for hypersurface and local geometries. Variations of stable
quotient constructions will also be studied. Secondly, the PI will approach the
Verlinde formula and the strange duality conjecture for moduli spaces of sheaves
over surfaces. Strange duality concerns the spaces of generalized theta
functions over moduli spaces of sheaves, and has applications to the study of
the associated theta linear series. While the case of curves has been understood
a few years ago, the case of surfaces is still largely open. Other projects
concern topological invariants of the moduli spaces of genus 0 stable maps and
stable quotients, and higher rank DT invariants for toric geometries.

The PI works in algebraic geometry, which, roughly speaking, is the study of
solutions of polynomial equations. The current proposal outlines several
research directions all of which touching on aspects of moduli spaces e.g.
spaces which classify algebro-geometric objects with similar properties. Moduli
theory has traditionally been closely related to other fields such as
combinatorics, symplectic geometry, number theory, representation theory,
theoretical physics. The PI aims to better understand three kinds of moduli
spaces all of which emerged in recent decades. In particular, the proposal will
combine a quantitative side e.g. calculation of naturally constructed
invariants, and qualitative aspects e.g. the geometric study of the moduli
spaces.
