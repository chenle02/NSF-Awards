This project is a component of a coordinated study called the Tropical
Instability Waves Experiment (TIWE). The P.I. will deploy an array of four
current measurement moorings, at the equator near longitude 140 deg W,
instrumented with upward- looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP),
capable of profiling the near-surface currents with a high degree of vertical
and temporal resolution. One thermistor chain mooring is also proposed. In
collaboration with other TIWE components, and existing NOAA current and
temperature moorings, the P.I. will attempt to calculate balances of momentum
flux, Reynolds heat flux convergence, energy production by barotropic
instability, and background current upwelling. Information on background mean
currents will also be analyzed in terms of annual variability.
