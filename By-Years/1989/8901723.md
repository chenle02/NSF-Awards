They have developed a theory for the universal onset of global superconductivity
in granular superconductors which is in good agreement with recent measurements.
Quantitative predictions have also been made for the critical current and the
kinetic inductance in the broken symmetry state. Theoretical investigations of
single junctions have ranged from the examination of such fundamental issues as
the requirements imposed by causality and by Anderson`s theorem to the
development of a variational scheme as a practical computational aid. They will
continue their work on Josephson phase fluctuations by studying the full quantum
mechanical implications of the phase- dependent quasi-particle capacitance and
the influence of thermal fluctuations, magnetic fields, and disorder on global
two- dimensional coherence. Proposed investigations of critical phenomena in
restricted geometries include that of the Kapitza resistance of liquid helium.
