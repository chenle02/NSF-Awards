The principal investigator will analyze conformal metrics on compact Riemannian
manifolds which either have or do not have boundaries. The existence of positive
solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with non-linear boundary conditions
will also be investigated. Additionally, topological obstructions to the
existence of metrics with positive curvature on compact manifolds with boundary
will be studied in detail. The sphere is the only two-dimensional compact
surface which can have positive curvature everywhere; that is, at each point
there are two distinct directions in which the surface bends "down." Points on a
saddle have negative curvature for the saddle bends down in one direction, but
up in other directions. Tori, or surfaces of donuts, cannot have positive
curvature everywhere, regardless of how they are deformed. The principal
investigator will study the analogous question for higher- dimensional compact
hypersurfaces.
