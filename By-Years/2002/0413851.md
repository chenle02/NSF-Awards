The proposed research addresses the problem of determining the purpose and
functional capacities of facilities whose functions are deliberately obfuscated
by their operators. As it is very difficult to obtain information that is
directly related to the function of such facilities, the focus is on augmenting
this traditional, direct approach to analysis with information extracted from
data that are only indirectly related to facility function. More specifically,
the PI proposes to use a rigorous, systematic methodology for identifying
facility function in situations where observation opportunities are limited. The
feasibility of this approach is based upon a newly-discovered, and rather
surprising, property possessed by a broad class of complex systems: despite
their complexity, it is possible to extract deep, quantitative information about
these systems using only limited observations of their behavior. This property
will be exploited for facility function identification by formulating the
problem as one of identifying the dynamical process required to realize the
facility, and by developing a multiple models strategy for efficiently
extracting information from the available data sets and performing the requisite
(dynamical system) identification. The feasibility of the proposed
identification strategy has been demonstrated in a preliminary proof of process
study involving a real world facility.
