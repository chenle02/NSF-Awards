In this project the principal investigators will work on a number of problems
in function theory, partial differential equations and quasiconformal mappings.
In particular, Professor Eremenko will continue his work on problems in
holomorphic dynamics, specifically complex iteration theory. He will also work
on the theory of entire, meromorphic and subharmonic functions. Professor Lewis
will continue his work on parabolic partial differential equations and symmetry
theorems. There is finally joint work planned on a conjecture of Littlewood
involving entire functions. The classical fields of partial differential
equations and complex function theory have a great deal of material in common,
and very often the insights gained from viewing a problem from both viewpoints
can be especially illuminating. In this project the principal investigators will
work individually and jointly on various interrelated problems in complex
mappings, parabolic partial differential equations and holomorphic dynamics.
