Reliability and Quality are closely related concepts dealing with improvement
of product quality. In this age of high-tech industry, the development of
technology to ensure consistent performance, quality and reliability of
materials are of considerable interest. Because of the magnitude of the
expenditures involved and the pressure to make early decisions correctly, it has
been necessary to devise suitable statistical techniques that would enable the
experimenter to make valid statistical decisions even before the experiment is
terminated. Thus reliability and quality have proven to be areas of research
related to national need. This grant will partially support a conference on
Reliability at the University of Missouri in June, 1991. Participants will
include representatives from the academic, the industrial and the governmental
spheres. The interaction of these engineers and statisticians should prove to be
beneficial for future development of much needed process improvements
methodology.
