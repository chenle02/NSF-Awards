ABSTRACT DMS - 0204651. PI: David Auckly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project is centered around a list of problems on the border
of&lt;br/&gt;topology, geometry and analysis. The least speculative problem is
part&lt;br/&gt;of a collaboration with V. Kapovitch to prove that there are
compact&lt;br/&gt;topological 4-manifolds that do not admit Alexandrov metrics.
The result&lt;br/&gt;should follow by a suitable modification of previous work
of S. Donaldson&lt;br/&gt;and D. Sullivan. The most speculative problem in the
list is to study the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between Gromov-Witten invariants and
finite type invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many different ideas are used in
geometric analysis, and developments&lt;br/&gt;in this field will effect a broad
range of other disciplines. For example&lt;br/&gt;symplectic geometry and gauge
theory were developed to describe mechanics&lt;br/&gt;and electrodynamics. These
ideas were developed into subtle invariants&lt;br/&gt;of smooth manifolds
defined via the solution to systems of partial differential equations.
&lt;br/&gt;Various gluing formulae developed to compute these
invariants&lt;br/&gt;resulted in relationships with other invariants that arise
from a combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;point of view. Properties of the combinatorial
invariants lead to conjectures&lt;br/&gt;about the smooth invariants, and vice
versa. It is exactly this interplay&lt;br/&gt;that makes geometric analysis such
an important field.
