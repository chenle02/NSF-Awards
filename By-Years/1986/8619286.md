This project is an analysis of arctic sea water for the concentration of
dissolved helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. Since the formation of sea
ice involves the scavenging of helium and the rejection of the other noble
gases, the helium/neon ratio, for example, may be used to infer the
freezing/melting/refreezing cycles of sea ice. The addition of the tritium data
allows the determinationof the age of a deep water sample, in the sense of
giving a time sincethe dissolved gases in the sample had last been in
equilibrium with the atmosphere. This technique will be applied to the
downwelling of water in mesoscale eddies. The field work will be carried out
during MIZEX 87, an internationallycooperative oceanographic program in the
Norwegian and Greeland Seas. The M/S HAAKON MOSBY, a Norwegian ship, will be
used. Hydrographic data to support this project will be taken by other
investigators on board the ship.
