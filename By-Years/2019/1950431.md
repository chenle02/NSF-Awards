This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) site in experimental high energy physics and astrophysics at Nevis Labs,
Columbia University. The site will support ten undergraduate students per year
in original, cutting-edge physics research, working with a faculty mentor. Two
students per year will spend the summer conducting research at the European
Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland at the Large Hadron Collider.
The REU program provides the opportunity for undergraduates to join in the
excitement of cutting-edge research, as well as to participate in the
development of the technological and computational tools required for the
projects. Through an extensive series of lectures and lab visits, the students
are also exposed to the most exciting problems in many other fields of
physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students spend ten weeks during the summer
participating in the broad Nevis high energy physics, nuclear physics, and
particle astrophysics research program, which seeks to address the most pressing
issues of these fields, including the origin of mass, the question of neutrino
oscillations, and the search for Dark Matter. Answers to these questions will
have profound implications for our understanding of the fundamental structure
and evolution of the universe. The strength of the Nevis research program,
coupled with the Nevis infrastructure of world class electronics design and
mechanical construction, forms a unique environment with opportunities for
training of students. As the variety of experiments are at different stages in
their development, Nevis provides the opportunity for students to gain
experience in all aspects of the experiments, from initial detector design,
hardware development and construction, to software development and data
analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
