The proposed research investigates the neural mechanisms of female preferences
for elaborate male traits. In all major taxa of animals and operating through
all sensory modalities, males have evolved elaborate signals that function in
attracting females to mate. Typically, females demonstrate a strong preference
for males of their own species and they demonstrate preferences for some males
over others. Both types of preferences are typically mediated by a female's
response to social signals produced by males. The proposed experiments will
investigate the neural mechanisms that mediate female preferences for elaborate
male traits using the tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) model system. The
research will test the hypothesis that female preferences are mediated by a
neural bias in the sensory system processing the signals produced by males. The
tungara frog model system allows testing of this hypothesis by addressing the
following questions: (1) Is the female preference for the mating calls of
conspecific males over heterospecific males mediated by a bias in the auditory
system? (2) Is the female preference for some types of mating calls over others
mediated by a bias in the auditory system? (3) Finally, are these biases in the
auditory system general features that are shared by other species that have
similar preferences? A strength of the tungara frog model system is that it
allows one to approach neurobiological studies with an evolutionary perspective.
Thus, the research will greatly enhance the understanding of the neural
substrate on which selection acts to shape the behavior of organisms. In
addition, the project is expected to contribute substantially to the
understanding of how complex biological sounds are represented by the auditory
system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to advancing
scientific knowledge, the proposed research will have broader impacts in
education and scientific training at multiple levels, including undergraduate,
graduate, and postdoctoral levels. The principal investigators have a commitment
to extending scientific learning to young students in the K-12 grades through
guest lectures at local schools. In addition, the proposed research supports
under-represented groups in science by supporting women in science and by the
inclusion of Latin American scientists-in-training at the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Panama. Furthermore, the publications and lectures
resulting from the proposed research will serve to foster an exchange between
the fields of behavioral ecology and neuroscience, which, in turn, will increase
interdisciplinary perspectives in undergraduate biology
courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
