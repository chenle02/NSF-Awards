The project proposes a workshop led by researchers at SRI's Center for
Technology in Learning, in collaboration with the University of Michigan, to
bring together researchers who are working to understand the implementation of
innovations that support systemic STEM education reform. The workshop
participants include researchers both within and outside education who have
developed theoretical perspectives that can inform frameworks of STEM education
implementation in the context of systemic change. Products of the workshop will
include: (1) a long-term research agenda with prioritized grand challenges
related to the implementation of STEM innovations; (2) a research network for
sharing instruments, methods, and data; (3) an edited volume on improving
implementation of STEM innovations in education systems.
