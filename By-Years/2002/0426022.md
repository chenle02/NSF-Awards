ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0426022&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proxy records are
extremely useful for reconstructing paleoceanographic/ paleoclimate conditions
and hence understanding oceanographic and climate change, although these data
must be well-calibrated. However, proxy tools to evaluate annual-to-centennial
timescale variability of the stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic
carbon and oxygen in seawater over the past several centuries in the Pacific or
to evaluate these variables and seawater temperature across depth have not been
fully developed. The western Pacific plays a large role in tropical and global
climate and is therefore an ideal location to pursue this research.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A scientist at the University of Pennsylvania will
quantitatively calibrate the sclerosponge, Acanthocheatetes wellsi, skeletal
d13C, d18O, and strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) to evaluate calibrated proxy records
on annual-to-interdecadal timescales. The calibrations will then be applied to
two high-resolution 50-year stable isotope and Sr/Ca records and the
interannual-to-interdecadal timescale variability in the longer records will be
evaluated by comparing them to available instrumental, satellite, and model
output data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will be a valuable tool for
constraining existing carbon uptake models, initializing and testing ENSO
models, and generally increasing our knowledge of the natural spatial and
temporal variability in d13CDIC, d18Osw, and seawater temperature at the surface
and across depth in the tropics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
