This study builds on new developments in the analysis of very small amounts of
Rb/Sr isotopes in garnets. The new technique will be applied to two field areas
where substantial geological and petrological information is available, in order
to determine high- precision pressure-temperature-time paths for the rocks. The
study constitutes the first field-tests for this technique and is essential for
verification of its applicability to tectonic problems. The results will have
profound implications for tectonic and metamorphic rate calculations from a wide
variety of tectonic environments.
