Efficient spectrum sharing among disparate wireless systems without inter-system
communication is the central problem in expanding existing and developing future
wireless technologies. This proposal explores an integrated physical and network
layer approach for spectrum sharing by developing algorithms and protocols that
will allow heterogeneous networks to co-exist and maintain required interference
constraints. The proposed framework is based on the novel idea of incorporating
detailed real-time measurements and prediction of spectrum usage, including
traffic parameters and network topology, into the design of cognitive protocols
that respond to the actual spectrum occupancy in time, frequency, and space. The
following critical enabling technologies of this framework are being developed:
(i) identification of non-cooperative spectrally-overlapped transmitters based
on location and modulation parameters; (ii) analysis and tracking of spectrum
usage based on traffic estimation and prediction; (iii) cognitive co-existence
protocols for spectrum sharing with combined traffic and location awareness. The
objective of this research is to comprehensively analyze performance gains
achieved by exploiting traffic and location awareness while taking into account
estimation and prediction errors, physical limitations, and protocol overhead.
The research approach is based on a closed loop between theoretical analysis,
implementation, and experimental verification on the reconfigurable wireless
testbed and network simulation tools. The algorithms, protocols and tools
developed by this research will have practical impact on a broad range of
wireless systems that share same spectrum resources including: current and
future unlicensed bands, vehicular and safety networks, cellular infrastructure
and femto cells, emergency and defense networks.
