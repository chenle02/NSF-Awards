Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: New Sorbents for
Ultrapurification of Transportation Fuels&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
CTS-0455176&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Ralph Yang&lt;br/&gt;Institution:
University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adsorbents with
p-complexation have been found to have superior selectivities and capacities for
adsorbing sulfur- and nitrogen-containing molecules from transportation fuels
(gasoline, diesel and jet fuels) at ambient temperature and pressure. The
equilibrium amounts of the sorbents that the PI has developed are nearly
proportional to the total sulfur concentration in the feed. In future work a
significant challenge will be to develop high-capacity p-complexation sorbents
for low-sulfur fuels. Two approaches, based on nanoscale considerations, will be
followed in this project (1) to use a cation (or atom) that forms strong
p-complexation bonds with thiophene and thiophenic molecules; and (2) to
increase the exposed cation site density. Palladium-based sorbents will be
studied because they are known to form the strongest p-complexation bonds.
Monolayers of various salts supported on high-surface-area substrates will be
studied. A research plan for denitrogenation in parallel with desulfurization
will be carrier out. Ab initio molecular orbital theory calculations will be
used as a guide for selecting the proper cations and anions. Molecular orbital
calculations also provide a basic understanding of the bonding for adsorption.
In terms of the broader impacts, the PI has had a long-standing record of
involving minority and female students in his research programs as well as
having active participation of undergraduate students. The proposed research may
lead to a new technology for desulfurization and denitrogenation of liquid fuels
that is fundamentally different from the traditional technology of
hydrotreating. It may also solve the crucial problem for using liquid fuels as
the power source for future hydrogen fuel cells.&lt;br/&gt;
