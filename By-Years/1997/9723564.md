9723564 Blair In recent years a great deal of information has been accumulated
concerning patterning of growing appendages in Drosophila. The variety of
genetic and molecular manipulations possible in Drosophila are unmatched.
Interestingly, many of the signalling pathways used in Drosophila are conserved
in vertebrates, often in very similar patterning situations. However, there are
still huge gaps in our understanding of these patterning events, and this
project outlines three ongoing projects seeking to fill some of those gaps. The
wing of Drosophila develops from the wing imaginal disc, a small epthelial sac.
During the extensive proliferative phase of disc development cell lineages are
for the most part unfixed and cells utilized cell-cell interactions to determine
their positions and take on appropriate fates. The compartment boundaries,
however, are exceptions to this rule; these act as lineage restrictions,
preventing intermixing between adjacent cells in the disc epithelium. The first
aim of this proposal is to examine the basis of compartmentalization, exploiting
some exciting new data which indicates a role for intercompartmental, Hedgehog
based signalling in maintaining the A/P boundary. Because there is much not
understood about the pathway by which Hedgehog signals from the posterior to the
anterior compartment, the second aim of this proposal is to continue
investigating the role of shifted, a putative member of the Hh signalling
pathway. Finally, local patterning also depends on more local interactions to
define particular tissue types, such as the specialized epithelial cells that
secrete the thickened cuticle of the veins. The last aim of this proposal is to
examine the vein-intervein subdivision, and in particular the role of
crossveinless genes is specifying the anterior and posterior cross veins.
