The idea of treating a structural system in a statistical manner has been
developed in order to understand the global response of the structure when many
modes are excited. The statistical energy analysis (SEA) approach has been
widely used for determining the dynamic response to broad band excitation of
linear one and two dimensional structures and three dimensional internal
acoustic fields. This project extends the method to (1) three dimensional
solids, (2) external (unbounded) acoustic fields, (3) small scale, local
structural nonlinearities and (4) SEA for coupled systems. In the first phase,
the SEA result will initially be derived within the framework of a three
dimensional, linear viscoelastic solid and then extended to a viscoelastic solid
combined with a metallic structural foundation. In phase two, the Principal
Investigator will use his previously developed SEA method for ascertaining the
acoustic far field when a two dimensional structure is responding in many modes.
The intent here is to compare this concept with the full classical modal result
to determine the SEA method's range of applicability. In phase three, the
classical component mode synthesis method is combined with SEA concepts to
ascertain the global effects of nonlinearities on a structure when many modes
have been excited. In phase four, the intent is to refine the methods currently
available for determining loss factors between coupled systems. The impact of
this work will be to permit a better description of the dynamics of complex
dynamical systems which are responding in many degrees of freedom.
