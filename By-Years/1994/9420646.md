NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY PI: J. E. R. Staddon, IBN 94-20646, Reinforcement
Mechanisms One of the most basic, enduring goals of behavioral science is to
understand how reward and punishment affect behavior and what these effects tell
us about the basic mechanisms of learning. In this research project, Dr. Staddon
will investigate three aspects of this problem: the effects of reward on choice,
the processes by which patterns of reward affect behavior, and the processes
that produce novel or creative behavior. The studies of choice will address the
fact that choices are affected by both recent and remote events as well as by
correlations between responses and rewards. Experiments will be carried out to
disentangle these three variables and their effects on choice responses.
Organisms also react immediately and proportionately to sudden changes in the
time interval between rewards. These fast-acting processes allow organisms to
track the intervals between successive rewards and react immediately to changes
in the temporal patterning of rewards. A series of experiments will examine the
dynamics of these timing effects. An act must occur before it can be modified by
reward or punishment. This raises the question, How do novel behaviors occur? A
third series of experiments will use the vocal behavior of budgerigars to study
is process. Previous research has shown that budgerigars can easily learn to
emit specific vocal names in the presence of different visual stimuli and will
then spontaneously emit the name of a to-be-chosen stimulus during a choice task
even if this is not required by the experimental procedures. By selectively
rewarding rare vocalizations, it has been possible to expand this repertoire. A
series of experiments will be carried out to explore the role of this novel
vocal behavior in the learning of complex tasks. This research should help us
understand the processes that produce new behaviors and may further our un
derstanding of the role of speech in cognition and learning.
