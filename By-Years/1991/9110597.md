For years, neurobiologists have speculated that the physical basis of learning
and memory involves specific structural changes in the brain, and, particularly,
the growth of new neural connections. But only within the last decade or so have
the techniques of modern neurobiology been brought to bear on the problem of the
morphological substrates of learning and memory. Now, it is possible to directly
visualize structural changes in the intact, living nervous system while an
animal is engaged in a learning task. Dr. David Glanzman is using optical
recording and video microscopy to gain a deeper understanding of the cellular
mechanisms of learning and memory. He is utilizing an invertebrate preparation
while studying sensorimotor synapses reconstituted in dissociated cell culture.
The dynamic cellular changes observed in these studies may provide mechanistic
roles for specific biochemical and molecular events associated with learning.
