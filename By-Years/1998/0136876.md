The goal of this project is to identify component members of the microbial
community responsible for the oxidation of CO in coastal marine environments
through a combination of recent microbiological and molecular approaches, and to
estimate their contributions to total in situ CO bio-oxidation. The researchers
will utilize a simple method that does not rely on liquid batch?cultures, for
screening and isolating microorganisms with a particular phenotype. Replicate
filters will allow for the isolation and purification of active CO-metabolizing
colonies. Since this method spatially separates otherwise competing populations,
simultaneous recovery of organisms with different growth rates and nutritional
requirements is possible, and large numbers of bacteria can be screened rapidly
at one time. Cell-specific CO-oxidation activity will be determined for selected
strains with time-series 14 CO-oxidation methods. Molecular phylogeny based on
16S-rRNA sequence information within the context of the large and growing 16S
database will determine the phylogenetic relatedness and identity of marine
CO?oxidizing bacteria that result from our cultivation program. A collective CO-
oxidation rate calculated from physiological measurements and abundance
estimates of CO-oxidizing organisms will be balanced with biogeochemical CO-
oxidation measurements to verify that activity and abundance of CO-oxidizing
bacteria can account for the total CO-oxidation that is observed in natural
waters.
