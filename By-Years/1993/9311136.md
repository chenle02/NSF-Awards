Atomic nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, which were previously thought
to be elementary particles, but are now known to be themselves made up of
quarks. This fundamental difference requires a new understanding of how the
neutrons and protons bind to each other to make up nuclei. The effects of the
extended size of nuclear particles have not yet been taken into account. The
project will apply new equations in relativistic field theory, taking account of
the particles' size, to analyze data on the processes which bind nuclei
together.
