Dan Neuhauser of UCLA is supported by the Chemistry Division through the
Information Technology Program to combine cross-correlation filter
diagonalization and Monte Carlo methods to investigate low-lying excitation
dynamics of helium clusters confined within aromatic structures or fullerene
molecules. Three Monte Carlo approaches will be employed: trajectory dependent
cellularization, imaginary-time diffusion Monte Carlo, and auxiliary-field Monte
Carlo. The rise in computational power and the reduced cost of high-speed Linux
computer clusters motivate this development of new approaches for quantum
dynamics based on parallel computations.

The development of new methods to study spectra of large chemical systems on
clusters of inexpensive, parallel computers demonstrates that formerly
intractable quantum mechanical problems can benefit from the next generation of
computing. Novel technical solutions such as those developed here will be useful
in the more general context of signal processing and information extraction.
Further, the investigations of fullerene-based encapsulation of molecules are of
import to hydrogen storage applications.
