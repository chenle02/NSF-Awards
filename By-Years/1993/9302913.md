Technical Abstract: Microwave spectroscopy techniques are being applied to
several areas of condensed matter physics. The project includes investigations
of spin relaxation and transport at interfaces, high-Tc superconductivity,
strong localization in both random and periodic structures. A new project
undertaken in collaboration with a noted theorist from AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories will address the area of two- dimensional electron gas and coupled
quantum wells. The primary theme of the research is the study of transport of
electrons and electromagnetic waves through solid state structures. The
principal investigator has been unusually successful in carrying these
fundamental studies further to technological areas (funded by other sources)
leading to patent production and stimulation of small business activity. %%%
Non-Technical Abstract: This project uses microwave radiation to probe the
properties of a wide range of materials, which include metals, high-Tc
superconductors, and semiconductors. The research focuses on the electrical
conductivity and response of these materials to microwaves. This fundamental
research complements and enables technological projects in which the principal
investigator is involved and which have lead to patents and techniques
stimulating small businesses .
