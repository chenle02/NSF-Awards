9408455 Hoffmann Cornell University In this research, supported by the NSF
Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, extended Huckel theory is
applied to treat: (1) transition metal carbides, borides, and silicides, (2)
activation of CH and HH bonds by Rhodium porphyrin complexes, (3) tetrahedral
and square-planar networks of main group and transition metal elements, (4)
enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of methane to methanol, and (5) novel, super-hard
materials consisting of interpenetrating diamond-like nets. Some speculative new
bonding concepts based on generalized orbital populations will be explored.
Huckel theory has its origin in the fundamentally correct laws of molecular
quantum mechanics, but drastic approximations are made to simplify the
computations so that it becomes feasible to apply these methods to molecular
systems much too large to be treated by the more rigorous ab initio theories.
When judiciously applied, extended Huckel theory has proved to provide reliable
predictions of chemical structures and insight into the principles of chemical
bonding. In this research project Huckel theory is applied to a broad range of
chemical problems directed toward the discovery of new materials with unusual
physical and chemical properties and a deeper understanding of the chemical
principles which govern these properties.
