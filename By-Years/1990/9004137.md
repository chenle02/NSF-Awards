While considerable progress has been made in the past three years on the static
typechecking of object-oriented languages, object- oriented databases pose
additional problems. In particular we need to clarify the relationship between
type and extent. The relationship EMPLOYEE < PERSON as a relationship between
classes or types says something about the inheritance of methods, while in a
database context it also means set inclusion. There is an apparent
contradiction: how can a set of one type be a subset of a set of some other
type? The use of "partially dynamic" types is investigated in order to resolve
this issue, which will allow us to deal with heterogeneous collections in a
statically typed system. The rules for type checking for heterogeneous
collections appear to be closely related to those already developed for
manipulating relational databases. If this is the case, then type inference
should also be possible. Research plan includes development of a prototype
language that demonstrates the feasibility of these ideas.
