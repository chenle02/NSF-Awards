The proposed research involves various aspects of noncommutative physics as well
as exactly solvable particle systems and nonperturbative aspects of field theory
and gravity. Noncommutative geometry leads to a correspondence between string-
membrane quantum theory and fluid dynamical systems. The physical implications
of this correspondence will be studied in this research project. The possibility
that the quantum Hall system can be described by a non-commutative matrix model
will also be investigated. Integrable systems with spin 1 will be investigated
in the hope that the anti-ferromagnetic chain continuum limit can be found. The
broader implications are the reestablishment of a research environment for
undergraduates at Yeshiva University.
