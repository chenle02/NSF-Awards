This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to
develop a novel microfabricated reactor for catalyst testing applications. The
novel reactor will enable substantial intensification in the catalyst discovery
process, will improve the quality of the kinetic data obtained during the
catalyst characterization phase of the process, and will reduce operating costs
associated with the testing. The technology to be developed relies heavily on
two micro reactor designs developed at MIT. The proposed project will focus on
designing, fabricating and testing a catalyst test reactor that builds on the
MIT technology. The resulting highly idealized isobaric, isothermal,
differential catalyst test reactor also will be capable of rapid and controlled
temperature changes and calorimetric reaction rate monitoring.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it provides
enabling technology for the process of discovery and characterization of
heterogeneous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysis represents one of the most
critical industrial technologies, with extensive applications across the
chemical, pharmaceutical, and energy fields. In pure market terms, annual
catalyst sales exceed $10 B/year, and leads to trillions of dollars of economic
value generation. This new reactor technology will replace the dated
conventional tube reactor technology and advances technology in the area of
catalyst development, which hasn't seen much progress over the last several
decades.
