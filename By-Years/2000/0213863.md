This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project objective is to
research and develop the next generation of ultrasound real-time volumetric
imagers, with enhanced spatial resolution and picture definition. The innovation
is based on LEEOAT Company's patented micromachining technology and its
expertise in parallel high-density electronic interconnections to innovate the
Ultrasound-on-a-Chip (UOC) device. In phase I of the SBIR program, LEEOAT
Company will design the device and demonstrate the fabrication feasibility of
the crucial components, thus demonstrating the proof-of-concept of the UOC
imaging system. Additionally, LEEOAT Company will theoretically simulate the UOC
device and the support electronics for performance optimization and to predict
the anticipated final performance of the imager. Finally, the cost/effort will
be estimated for the final development, fabrication and testing of the UOC
imaging system prototype for medical applications.

The major commercial application involves ultrasonic noninvasive medical
imaging. Industrial applications include non-destructive evaluations such as
defect identification in integrated circuits.
