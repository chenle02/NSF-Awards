A tectono-stratigraphic study of a sequence of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous
continental sediments in the Cordilleran Foreland Basin in Wyoming and Montana
is proposed. The objective of the study is to determine the local and regional
sedimentary responses within the foreland both to external structural events and
internal basin partitioning by ancestral Laramide basement uplifts. Fission-
track and magnetostratigraphic dating techniques will be used to temporarily
relate sedimentary responses to specific tectonic events. Results of the study
will form the basis for an integrative sedimentary-tectonic model for the early
phase of evolution of the Cordilleran Foreland Basin. The model likely will
provide important new constraints on theoretical attempts to predict foreland
lithosphere response to external tectonic events.
