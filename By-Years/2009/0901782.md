This project will focus on some outstanding problems of geometric group theory
such as the Andrews-Curtis conjecture on balanced presentations of the trivial
group, the Burnside problem for periodic groups, the Hanna Neumann conjecture on
the rank of the intersection of subgroups in free groups. The notorious Andrews-
Curtis conjecture claims that a balanced presentation of the trivial group can
be transformed into the standard presentation by a finite sequence of extended
Nielsen operations, also called elementary AC-moves. Andrews and Curtis
speculated that one type of their elementary AC-moves, which is conjugation,
could be replaced by a much more restrictive operation of cyclic permutation,
thus making a hypothesis that their conjecture is equivalent to its presumably
stronger "cyclic" version. The Principal Investigator (PI) will attempt to
establish this equivalence. The PI will work on other questions related to
balanced presentations of the trivial group, such as the stabilized version of a
conjecture of Magnus and asymptotic functions associated with the presentations.
Another goal of the project is to find new applications of the geometric
machinery of graded diagrams created by the PI to solve one of the most
influential algebraic problems of the 20th century, the Burnside problem on
periodic groups for large even exponents. In addition, the PI will work on
questions related to the Hanna Neumann conjecture on the intersection of
subgroups in free groups, on algorithmic and computational complexity issues in
group theory and 3-dimensional topology.

This research project is in the area of the theory of groups that investigates
groups, defined by means of generators and defining relations, and lies at the
intersection of the theory of groups with low-dimensional topology, geometry and
mathematical logic. The theory of groups is a mathematical theory of symmetries
of spaces which interacts with many other disciplines, for example, physics and
chemistry outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory, topology and
geometry inside mathematics.
