More and more objects used in daily life have Internet connectivity, creating an
"Internet of Things" (IoT). Computer security and privacy for an IoT ecosystem
are fundamentally important because security breaches can cause real and
significant harm to people, their homes, and their community. These security
issues also are very challenging not only because of the properties of IoT
devices themselves but also because the users are diverse, vary in their
technical knowledge and access to technical support, and include vulnerable
populations such as children and those using in-home care technologies.
Moreover, additional risks emerge when users combine technologies in unexpected
ways.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Meeting the challenges of IoT security and privacy
requires a large, interdisciplinary effort. An effective approach to IoT
security and privacy is holistic, integrating human-computer interaction,
network security, cryptography, and pervasive computing. Enforcing cryptographic
requirements requires not only building systems that can function on low-
capacity IoT devices, but also using threat models that incorporate human
requirements. Translating security and privacy requirements and preferences
requires understanding what people want, presenting the technologies in a manner
people can understand, and knowing what is technologically realistic. This
requires behavioral and organizational research, with discussions involving
public and private sector stakeholders. The project is developing a foundation
for IoT security and privacy that is intuitive, natural to the human experience,
provides the necessary technical guarantees, and facilitates adoption by the
larger IoT community of users and manufacturers.
