This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the
feasibility of developing a successful state estimation based system for fault
detection, fault isolation, and service restoration in power distribution
networks. Electric utilities will use the products to reduce M&O costs due to
faster and more efficient responses to system outages, increase revenues and
equipment utilization due to faster service restoration, and defer of capital
investment due to improved reliability. The major component of the system is the
three-phase Distribution System State Estimator (DSSE) which will use real-time
telemetered data, forecasted data, and off-line planning data to estimate
distribution system voltage magnitudes and angles, feeder flows, transformer
loadings, and service load injections. The results from DSSE will provide the
best estimate for the purposes of fault detection, fault isolation, and also
service restoration. State-of-the-art technologies in the power system computer
applications and statistics will be used in the deviation of the DSSE. The three
end-use functions, fault detection, fault isolation and service restoration,
will also be developed using analytical and rule-based algorithms. A special
purpose measurement placement algorithm will also be developed to ensure the
quality of the real-time DSSE solutions.
