The PI's request funding to develop a portable platform to collect Global
Positioning System - Acoustic (GPS-A) measurements to measuring seafloor
deformation. The proposed system will be internally powered and autonomous,
capable of collecting GPS-A data for a minimum of 24 hours while unattended. It
will have two thrusters guided by GPS to automatically maintain its lateral
position above an array of acoustic transponders on the sea floor. It will be
portable, self-contained and deployable from a variety of vessels to open access
to regions wherever there are ships-of-opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Sumatra, Chile and Japan earthquakes
the need for more knowledge and tools in this area/discipline is even more
apparent. To further enable research in this area, new tools are required to
engender new science. If successful, GEOSPAR will bring new knowledge on earth's
active process both in research and education, as well as a view of disaster
prevention against large earthquakes and resultant tsunami. Has direct impact
upon science goals of four major NSF supported efforts: GeoPRISMS, the Cascadia
Initiative, Earthscope, and the OOI cabled observatory (along the Cascadia
Subduction Zone).
