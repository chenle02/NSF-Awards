This award is for a postdoctoral fellowship. The investigator will study the
effects of the supply of iron in the Southern Ocean on the size, composition,
and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon from Phaeocystis antarctica, a
widely distributed species of colonial phytoplankton. P. antarctica is quite
efficient in drawing down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, because its
biomass is not recycled by grazers back to carbon dioxide, and its biomass is
observed to sink rapidly. These characteristics make P. antarctica blooms an
interesting natural mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
for long term burial and preservation. In the Ross Sea, iron has been identified
as the limiting nutrient for P. antarctica production, but the mechanisms
phytoplankton employ to collect and utilize iron remain unknown. This
investigation will attempt to determine if P. antarctica release organic matter
that complexes iron to catalyze the cellular transfer of iron to either
themselves or heterotrophic bacteria, that is, the processes that help
phytoplankton and bacterioplankton overcome their growth limiting factors -
respectively iron and dissolved organic carbon. This will be accomplished
through a collaborative approach by characterizing dissolved organic matter
produced by the phytoplankters in the laboratory and in the field using combined
metals and organic mass spectral techniques.
