CTS-0210718 Denis Wirtz, Johns Hopkins University Title: NIRT: Nanoscale Sensing
of Single Cell Surface Receptor Affinity for Individual Ligands

This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.

The PI's are planning to use novel techniques based on the modification of an
AFM tip to measure the affinity of a single cell surface receptor to its ligand.
The approach is quite innovative and would result in significant new
developments in this area.
