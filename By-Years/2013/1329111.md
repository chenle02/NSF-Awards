This is a study of radioactive contamination of food. Using semi-structured
interviews, surveys, GIS mapping and participant observation, the PI will
determine what kind of information was available in the aftermath of a nuclear
disaster and will document the coping strategies citizens employed including
engaging in their own monitoring and research and collaboration with scientists
and groups abroad.

This research will help identify strengths and weaknesses of food safety
assurance systems and nuclear disaster preparedness.
