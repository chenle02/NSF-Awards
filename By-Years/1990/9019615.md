Emanuel proposes a three-part study of tropical cyclone dynamics: a) A field
experiment, to test a simple hypothesis that tropical cloud clusters are
"triggered" to "ignition" (cyclogen- esis) only if the mid-tropospheric source
air for small-scale convective downdrafts in the vicinity of the disturbance's
center becomes warm/moist enough to set up a downdraft-surface layer-cloud
updraft cycle that results in a continually warmer and/or moister downdraft
source layer. The field experiment is required because neither conventional past
observations nor numerical models resolve the spatial or temporal detail needed
to test the hypothesis. b) A set of analyses of past hurricanes to see whether
cyclone initiation is also accompanied by the approach of an upper-level flow
system with a locally high measure of combined cyclonic rotation and thermal
instability, so that it lines up over a similar low-level area generated by
clusters of tropical rain showers c) Generalization of the current barotropic
(one-layer) theory of steering of mature hurricanes by the ambient large scale
flow, by constructing a simple two-layer (baroclinic) model. Although it has
consistently been observed that the vertical shear of the ambient flow of
tropical cyclones is weak at best, Emanuel argues that the cyclones themselves
have pronounced vertical structure, with the lower tropospheric cyclone overlain
by a more anticyclonic vorti- city center. The third study will improve our
understanding of the factors governing hurricane movement. The first two should
provide more information on the perennial question as to why so few tropical
oceanic rain systems eventually develop into mature tropical cyclones.
