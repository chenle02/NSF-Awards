9402296 Carey The Pis will investigate the record of the catastrophic floods,
known as joekulhlaups, generated by subglacial eruptions or drainage of ice-
dammed lakes on Iceland that cause the introduction of volcaniclastic material
into the ocean where it is deposited as turbidites on submarine fan. Samples of
land-based joekulhlaup events as well from deep sea cores will be examined.
Oxygen isotopic stratigraphy will provide chronology. The findings will help
resolve the history of flood events and contribute to the modeling of
sedimentation around a volcanic hotspot such as Iceland that is strongly
influenced by glacial cycles. ***
