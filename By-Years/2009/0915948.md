The project aims to measure the computational difficulty of determining various
aspects of physical systems--?quantum mechanical systems in particular. One such
computational task, of interest to physical chemists, is to distinguish the
minimum-energy configuration of a system of nuclear spins. No efficient
algorithm running on a traditional computer is known to solve this or similar
problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers are devices that directly
harness the laws of quantum mechanics to do computation. Although not yet
implemented at a large scale, they hold great promise in speeding up certain
computations, including efficiently simulating actual physical systems. Yet
several interesting questions about physical systems appear beyond the reach of
even quantum computers. The project will investigate problems of this sort,
using techniques from theoretical computer science to help determine their
intrinsic quantum computational difficulty. Showing that some of these questions
are difficult for a quantum computer will help guide scientists and engineers
toward more practical, less ambitious approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
broadly, the project will build on previous work of the Principal Investigator
and colleagues to better understand the power of quantum information processing
in general and how it relates to traditional information processing.&lt;br/&gt;
