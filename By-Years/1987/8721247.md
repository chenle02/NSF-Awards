Continuing our previous findings that ultrashort pulses applied to Josephson
junctions have excitation characteristics significantly different from the
static limit, this work will investigate how different values of pulse duration
actually change the excitation thresholds. The practical use of these results in
the design of GHz superconducting electronics will be investigated. The electro-
optic sampling technique will be applied to the transmission line structures to
study their characteristics in the femtosecond (terahertz) regime. The algorithm
previously developed by us for use in structures will be extended to allow
inclusion of either BCS-type of dispersion or the two-fluid model results in
computing transient dispersions. Since the loss of a superconducting
transmission line is directly related to the quasiparticle distributions and, in
the case of a gap-less superconductor, it is significantly different from the
BCS result, our transmission experiments are then well suited to test the
validity of this theory.
