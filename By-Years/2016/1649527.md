Title: Student Travel Support for the PPoPP 2017, CGO 2017, and HPCA 2017
Symposia Colocated in Austin, Texas

This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the ACM
SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP
2017), the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO
2017), and the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture
(HPCA 2017). The conferences are being held in Austin, Texas during February
4?8, 2017. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of parallel
programming, compilers, and computer architecture. Supporting student travel to
attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the
NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in
these research areas, as well as providing international experiences to build a
globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to
learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and to
interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The student
selection process takes into account both merit and financial need, and requires
support letters written by academic advisors. A strong emphasis is put on
supporting women and underrepresented groups.
