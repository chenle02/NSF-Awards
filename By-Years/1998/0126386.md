Chemistry (12)

With the acquisition of an Agilent UV/VIS spectrophotometer equipped with
LabVIEW software, we are introducing chemical kinetics and computer data
analysis in our introductory chemistry course and in environmental management
technology program. Most of our students in this associate degree program enter
the workforce upon graduation and become involved in environmental testing and
chemical analyses in a laboratory setting. Our goal is to better prepare
students to meet these challenges by adapting and implementing computer-aided
laboratory experiments into our curriculum. These experiments allow students to
integrate and reinforce chemical concepts learned in the classroom with real-
life experiences. Kinetics is a difficult concept for students to grasp and
often requires exploring the topic through various modalities. We are using our
UV/VIS to do kinetics experiments in which the students visually track changes
in chemical reactions in real time.
