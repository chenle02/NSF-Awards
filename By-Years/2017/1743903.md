This proposal is request for "NSF Student Travel Grant for 2017 IEEE/ACM
International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC) and Co-located
IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and
Technologies (BDCAT)".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference experience is critical
for training undergraduate and graduate students to be well-prepared computing
force in the future. This proposal aims to help develop the strong future
workforce in computer and computational sciences by enabling students who would
otherwise could not attend to participate in the UCC/BDCAT 2017 conference,
stimulating students' enthusiasms in conducting cutting-edge research, and
broadening their visions and interactions with top research scientists and
professors in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A successful engagement can have
an impact in stimulating students' enthusiasm about utility computing, Cloud
computing services, advanced distributed computing, and big data computing and
applications (in contrast to Java and Web developments students are normally
interested) and training future computing workforce for the nation.
