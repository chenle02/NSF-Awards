Copper ZSM-5 is the most active catalyst known for reduction and decomposition
of nitric oxide, but has limitations that limit it use in practical situations.
This effort tests the theory that the active site consists of cuprous ions
stabilized by the zeolite matrix. Other oxides such as copper molybdenum oxide
and copper zinc oxide are tested for nitric-oxide decomposition. In addition,
the role of lattice oxygen on the reduction of nitric oxide by hydrocarbons in
an oxidizing atmosphere is examined. Abatement of nitric oxide is an urgent
environmental priority. Catalysts for converting nitric oxide to nitrogen in an
environmentally benign manner are of great interest for pollution control from
motor vehicles, power plants, and other sources.
