This award provides funds to supplement support from the University of
Minnesota for developing a laboratory facility for lake-bottom cores at the
Limnological Research Center (LRC), University of Minnesota. About half of this
award will cover salaries of LRC personnel. The other half will be used to
acquire equipment for documenting, storing, and analyzing lake sediment cores.
The LRC facility addresses a need for a coordinated approach to lacustrine core
samples which are critical to the interpretation of paleoclimatic variations
during the immediate geological past.
