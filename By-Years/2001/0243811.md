The College of Wooster continues operating a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Physics
Department at Wooster; its research theme is condensed matter physics and
nonlinear dynamics. Eight students are recruited every year for a ten-week
summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
predominantly undergraduate institutions. Students participate in research that
includes projects on critical phenomena in liquid mixtures, pattern formation,
liquid crystals, cellular automata and chaos in celestial mechanics. Students
also attend local research seminars, regional and/or national research
conferences, and organized social activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
