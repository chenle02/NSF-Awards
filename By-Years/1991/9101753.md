This award supports the research of Professors E. Schmutz and W. Goh to work in
combinatorics. They intend to investigate asymptotic properties of several
families of random combinatorial structures. They intend to determine whether or
not asymptotic value distributions exist, and in the situation where they do, to
find them. The research is in the general area of combinatorics. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects
can be organized. And, so it is extremely important to modern communications,
for example the design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design
of algorithms in computer science.
