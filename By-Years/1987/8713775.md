There has been a growing research interest in range image understanding in the
computer vision community. Range images offer several advantages over
conventional intensity images in the recognition of 3-dimensional objects. This
project provides partical support for a workshop brings together active
researchers in range image understanding to discuss emerging themes in this
field. The workshop will identify major research area that should be addressed
for making range image understanding systems useful in industrial and other
application. Guidelines for establishing a common range image data base will
also be discussed. Findings of the workshop will be widely disseminated in the
computer vision community.
