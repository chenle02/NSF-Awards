Dr. Aoki has been selected to receive one of 30 prestigious NSF Presidential
Faculty Fellowship awards based upon her outstanding research accomplishments.
During the period of this award, Dr. Aoki will be using electron microscopic
immunocytochemistry to identify chemically specified axons or growth cones in
relation to transmitter receptors within intact cortical tissue. At birth, the
density of synapses in the cerebral cortex is no more than 10% of the adult
level, and nothing is presently known about the development of chemically
specified synapses within cortex. The maturation of noradrenergic and excitatory
synapses during early life is particularly important for understanding the
mechanisms that underlie cortical plasticity. The importance of noradrenaline in
cortical plasticity is reflected in a new working hypothesis supported by
results that cortical plasticity is dictated by the dual modulation of
excitatory synapses utilizing both catecholamines and acetylcholine.
