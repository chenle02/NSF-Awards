This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a fully
functional color "transparent display screen" prototype, based on a set of
outdoor stable nano-phosphors with very high fluorescent quantum efficiency and
well-controlled nano-particle sizes. With these advanced nano-phosphors, a color
display windshield prototype will be developed.

This novel "transparent display screen" technology will enable an entire vehicle
windshield or building glass windows to act as an electronic display screen,
without affecting the optical clarity. This innovative display technology will
leverage and create a broad spectrum of commercial applications and
fundamentally change the way that people use "glass" in many designs.
