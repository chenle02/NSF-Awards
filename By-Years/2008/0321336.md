With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Reed College will acquire an isothermal titration
calorimeter. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including
a) the determination of the affinity of metal ion-dependent regulatory proteins
for cognate and non-cognate metal ions and the stoichiometry of combination; b)
studies on enzyme mechanisms; and c) investigations into biologically active
analogs of the polypeptide antibiotic bacitracin.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calorimetry is an extremely useful tool in modern
analytical chemistry. Calorimetric analysis is used to measure the thermal
energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular interactions and reactions.
Thus it can provide a very reliable and sensitive method for determining the
thermodynamic properties of materials such as changes in heat capacity of liquid
and solid samples. Reed College is an undergraduate institution, and the
availability of these instruments will have a strong impact on undergraduate
research. &lt;br/&gt;
