This project is aimed at developing characterization tools to be used to design
self-assembling peptides that fold into defined a-helices or b-strands at
polymeric biomaterial surfaces. The goal is to define peptide sequences that
direct the assembly of functional peptides/proteins onto polymeric surfaces when
the adaptors are fused to them. The project will develop an atomic level picture
of the secondary structure and dynamics of peptides/proteins on biomaterial and
nanoparticle surfaces and a high-resolution structural map of peptide-surface
interactions. Recent studies of statherin peptides on hydroxyapatite crystals
have demonstrated that there is sufficient sensitivity to perform similar solid
state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) characterization of peptides on a wider
variety of surfaces. At the same time, NMR studies of peptide/protein
conformation and dynamics on surfaces will be integrated with other
spectroscopic-based surface characterization studies such as Near Edge X-ray
Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) and Time of Flight - Secondary Ion Mass
Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to tie together new capabilities for the
characterization of peptide conformation, orientation, and long-range order on
biomaterial surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of strategies for
immobilizing functionally active proteins and peptides on polymeric surfaces is
a central aspect of the biomaterials, tissue engineering, drug delivery,
affinity separations, and diagnostic fields. These details are crucial to
understanding why particular materials work well or don't work well, and the new
molecular insights will provide important design criteria based on knowledge of
peptide/protein structure, dynamics, and assembly at polymeric biomaterial
surfaces. Students trained in this area of biomaterials science and applications
will compete very well for both academic and industrial jobs. This project is
jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Chemistry
Division.&lt;br/&gt;
