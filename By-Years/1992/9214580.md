This grant will cover a portion of the cost of a laser system and electronic
instrumentation, and the necessary renovation of laboratory spaces. This new
research unit will make possible a new set of experiments in atom
interferometry, including the development of extremely sensitive inertial
sensors. This requires dedicated instruments in a low vibration environment. The
costs will be shared jointly by Stanford University.
