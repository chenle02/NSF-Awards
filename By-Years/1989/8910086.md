This project will attempt to relate the rate or extent of surface- induced
conformational changes in adsorbed proteins to their equilibrium adsorbed mass
by in situ ellipsometry. Equilibrium isotherms of alpha-lactalbumin, beta-
lactoglobulin, and kappa-casein on germanium will be evaluated. Then, the
influence of time on conformational changes experienced by these proteins will
be quantified by continuously monitoring the film thickness by ellipsometry. It
is now well known that high-molecular weight proteins can be damaged by their
interactions with surfaces. The extent of damage seems to be time-dependent. It
is hypothesized that this damage occurs as the protein unfolds to bring more of
its surface into contact with regions of the surface to which they are
attracted. This phenomenon is important to both biomedical technology and
downstream processing in biotechnology. If the protein unfolds as it interacts
progressively strongly with the surface, it seems reasonable to expect the
apparent thickness of a film of adsorbed protein to decrease with time and for
the amount of damage to correlate with the film thickness. This project will
test that hypothesis and lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon and
its dynamics.
