This project is an ethnographic study of new modes of reform being tested in the
New Orleans criminal justice system. As the city government faces growing
challenges -- financial, moral, legal, and infrastructural -- to its current
practices of incarceration, this research asks what different understandings of
justice and forms of change can be discussed and acted upon locally, and how
these are being taken up in the national conversation on criminal justice
reform. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be based on 12 months of
participant-observation, mapping exercises, and interviews with participants in
two new collaborative projects. The first is a group of nonprofit and activist
organizations advocating for criminal justice reform in the city. The second is
a regular meeting of representatives from criminal justice agencies in "working
groups" to discuss and evaluate current reforms. These two sites have the
potential to provide new insight into the project of criminal justice reform, as
they provide a regular space in which organizations and individuals accustomed
to operating independently attempt to coordinate efforts, and in so doing
articulate their own institutional, political, and ethical stakes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing ethnographic insight into the everyday work
of criminal justice reform as it is carried out by government officials, reform
advocates, and state employees, this project will situate criminal justice
reform within local and national political economies of justice, and provide a
robust understanding of the challenges and possibilities presented by
collaboration between government (local, state, and federal) and civil society
around criminal justice reform in the United States. This project aims to
contribute to scholarly conversations on crime, law, and governance; the
anthropology of race; and Americanist anthropology, as well as to the growing
national conversation on criminal justice reform.
