Reilinger 9418680 This is a project to measure, analyze, and interpret crustal
deformatin in the transition zone form ocean spreading in the Gulf of California
to continental strike-slip transform faulting along the greater San Andreas
fault system. The research will build upon GPS observations intitiated in 1989
by Oregon State/JPL/CICESE and subsequent observations in 1990, 1991, and 1993
by U.T. Dallas/MIT/CICESE. As has been the case with 1990, 1991, and 1993
surveys, the N. Baja-Mexicali Valley (NBMV) network to the extensive GPS network
in southern California through simultaneous observations, and will continue to
share common sites with the Miami U/CICESE GPS network established in 1993
across the Agua Blanca fault. The research will be accomplished in collaboration
with CICESE which will provide the majority of field expenses, and will
participate in data reduction, analysis and interpretation. ****
