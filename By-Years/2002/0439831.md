This project is collaboration between North Carolina Agricultural &amp;
Technical State University and the Center for Precision Metrology at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte. The project is divided into seven
tasks that include testing an Articulated Arm Measuring Machine (AACMM)
according to B89.4.22 Standards, development of machine models, development of
rotary axis measurement techniques, measurement and correction of an AACMM,
testing of the corrected AACMM according to B89.4.22 standards and the reporting
of the results from this research project.
