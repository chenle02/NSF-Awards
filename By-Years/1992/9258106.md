Under an NYI award the tribological behavior of thin films will be studied with
emphasis on the effects of processing, topography of the substrate surface, and
relative coating/substrate properties. The possibility of enhancing coating
adhesion by engineering the surface topography of the substrate and by closely
controlling the coating thickness will be evaluated. Initial emphasis will be on
the diamond-like and cubic boron nitride films deposited on stainless steel and
carbon steel substrates. At a later stage, attempts will be made to develop low
friction films by co- deposition of a hard coating material with a softer solid
lubricant material.
