This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project proposes to
develop innovative compositionally tuned nanomaterials based oxide phosphor
bright UV light emitting devices that have tunable optical UV light emission.
This innovation is based on optical processes emerged in nanomaterials by
absorption and emission through band gap engineered meta-stable but high quantum
efficiency nanocrystalline, highly directed wires and nanocrystalline epitaxial
films. This effort will demonstrate the optimization of nanostructural optical
materials with high UV light emission efficiencies and proto-type device
integrated with UV lamps. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful the outcome of
this effort will facilitate applications including invisible UV ink for security
applications, medical devices, biological analysis tools, ultraviolet-based
secure communications, space sensors, mineral identification, UV curing, UV
fluorescent inspection, UV disinfection/sterilization of water, and UV
measurement which have market potentials over $500M by 2010. The next generation
of UV light sources will enhance UV applications by, 1) Providing additional
energy savings, and thus a lower cost of ownership, 2) Enhancing optical
spectroscopy, and 3) Enhancing national security applications. &lt;br/&gt;
