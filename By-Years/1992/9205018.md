This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program provides
support for research by Dr. M. David Curtis of the Chemistry Department,
University of Michigan, on the reactivity of model complexes for
dehydrosulfurization (HDS) catalysts. Curtis will synthesize small cluster
molecules consisting of two or three atoms of molybdenum, one to three atoms of
a second metal, such as iron, cobalt, or nickel, and two to four atoms of
sulfur. Their structural features will be examined and compared to their
behavior in oxidation-reduction reactions. Of particular interest are reactions
involving abstraction of sulfur from organic molecules, particularly allyl
sulfides. Another reaction of interest involves olefins and hydrogen, since
hydrogen is known to be involved in the desulfurization sequence.
Electrochemical studies, synthesis of organic molecules by desulfurization, and
surface characterization of clusters when supported on alumina will also be
included. %%% Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is an commercial process that is
promoted by catalysts prepared from molybdenum, cobalt, and sulfur. It is used
to remove sulfur from organic materials and is therefore important to enhancing
air quality in industrial areas. In this project, compounds which are models of
the industrial catalyst will be prepared in an effort to understand the
reactions which occur and perhaps improve the effectivess of the catalyst.
