In this project jointly funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the
Chemistry Division and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive
Research (EPSCoR), Professor Jason Chen of Iowa State University is developing
methods to prepare complex polyoxygenated molecules. Educational modules in
development by Professor Chen introduce local high school students to the
importance of organic chemistry in modern medicine. The broader impacts of this
work include potential advances in synthetic organic chemistry from the
discovery of new methods to install dense arrays of oxygen-containing
stereocenters and the encouragement of high school students to pursue STEM
careers.

The methods emphasize tunable control over the placement of the oxygen atoms and
the ability to introduce multiple oxygen atoms at the same time. This project
focuses on setting multiple contiguous alcohol chiral centers with flexible
stereochemistry. The key reactions are enantioselective, organocatalytic,
polyoxygenation of enals and nucleophilic addition to alpha-oxygenated
aldehydes. These reactions complement each other and can potentially deliver up
to five contiguous stereocenters in two steps. The polyoxygenated structures
prepared by these methods are commonly found in molecules with useful biological
properties.
