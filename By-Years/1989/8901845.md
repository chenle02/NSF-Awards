This research seeks to establish the fundamental science of polymer liquid
crystals (PLCs) and their properties via a collaborative effort involving
synthesis, characterization and theory. The approach is to devise theoretical
models of PLC behavior, simulate their properties using computer techniques,
prepare chemical systems emulating the theoretical models, characterize their
structures and properties, correlate the experimental results with the theory
and iterate the process to optimize properties and bring theory and experiment
into agreement. The PLCs have potential applications as electromagnetic or
optical storage devices, as well as high performance polymers. The polymers to
be synthesized are designed to be biphasic, with independent motion of the side
groups and the polymer backbone. The materials will be characterized by NMR,
x-ray, dielectric and other measurements. A new high magnetic field system field
system will be used to orient samples for structural characterization.
