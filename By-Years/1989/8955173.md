This is a two-year program to serve 90 middle school mathematics teachers in
the Baton Rouge area. In a six week summer session, participants will each take
three courses: number sense, probability and quantitative literacy, and methods
of teaching mathematics. The methods course will be structured around the NCTM
Standards. Sixty teachers will participate in year one, and thirty will
participate in year two. Academic year followup will include visits by project
staff to individual classrooms and 8 full-day workshops for participants.
Workshops for principals are included. School districts will provide released
time for teachers. Cost sharing is provided at 35% of the NSF award.
