This proposal has two distinct parts. The first part concerns the evaluation of
item and temperature dependent correlation functions in the one-dimensional
Heisenberg model. The second is a study of SO (4) symmetry in the Hubbard model,
its implications for spectral properties, correlation functions, and
thermodynamical and transport properties. ***
