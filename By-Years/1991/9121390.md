The PIs wish to determine the vertical transport of ice in clouds and the
clouds' mechanism in controlling the concentration of water vapor in the upper
troposphere. They will use a stable isotope method, and propose to
simultaneously collect ice and vapor samples, as well as to gather supporting in
situ thermodynamic, cloud physics, and satellite data. The project goal is to
determine the formation altitude of ice in the tops of winter frontal and summer
convective clouds and the relative role of cloud ice and vapor as a supplier of
water vapor in the upper troposphere.
