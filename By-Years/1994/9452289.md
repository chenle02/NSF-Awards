9452289 McClain This project will strengthen the instructional quality of one
biology and three microbiology classes and laboratories by incorporating current
innovations and technology. The goal of this curricular enhancement project is
to improve the scientific literacy of students. Cooperative group-learning
activities will be incorporated into the lab and classroom assignments. This
collegial approach will be facilitated by the use of computer workstations that
will be utilized by groups of 5-7 students. A microscope/video system will be
used to provide more effective instruction concerning the proper usage of
microscopes. This system will enable faculty to illustrate, for the class as a
whole, important techniques for understanding and mastering skills necessary for
proper and effective microscope usage. A laser disk player/TV monitor system
will also be utilized to fully integrate a system of study and reference during
lecture and group time. This pedagogy incorporates the three elements of an
exemplary biology program: an investigative laboratory; use of biological
techniques; and use of computers. It also accommodates a variety of learning and
teaching strategies, fosters critical thinking and problem solving, includes
collaborative learning and fosters active student participation.
