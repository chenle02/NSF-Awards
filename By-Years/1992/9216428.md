This award, in the NSF/EPRI Initiative on Intelligent Control, supports
research on the integration of machine learning and sensor-based control in
intelligent robotic systems. The research is interdisciplinary in nature and
combines techniques of explanation-based control with robust and adaptive
nonlinear control, computer vision, and motion planning. The goal is to go
beyond the strict hierarchical control architectures typically found in robotic
systems by integrating modeling, dynamics, and control at all levels of
intelligence. Ultimately, techniques of nonlinear dynamics and control will be
combined with artificial intelligence into a single new paradigm in which
symbolic reasoning holds an equal place with differential equation based
modeling and control. Both theoretical and experimental investigations will be
conducted.
