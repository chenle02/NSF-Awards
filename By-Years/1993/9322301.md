9322301 Garg This REU Site award provides an opportunity for eight undergraduate
students to work with four faculty members in the Physics Department during a
ten week summer period in theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics.
Research projects to be undertaken include: Chaos in polymer dispersed liquid
crystals; critical phenomena in binary fluid mixtures; spatiotemporal chaos; and
thermodynamic studies of monolayer phase diagrams. %%% The goals of this program
are to guide students in the process and methodology of research, and to train
the novice research student into becoming an independent thinker. At the start
of the summer, students will be assigned a research project, and will work in
close collaboration on a daily basis with an individual faculty member. They
will learn research techniques, report progress during weekly seminars, and be
given an opportunity of attending a regional and/or national meeting of the
American Physical Society and Conferences on Undergraduate Research. Some
students will present research findings in the same sessions as leading
scientists. Students will be recruited from the College of Wooster and other
institutions in the geographical area. Emphasis will be place on increasing the
participation of historically underrepresented groups in the sciences. ***
