This project aims at developing efficient algorithms for multicast communication
within the optical networks based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). The
following research activities will be particularly pursued. First, the research
team will work on the WDM simulators particularly suitable for multicast
applications based on WDM. Effi-cient specific multicast tree construction
problems will be formulated and their computa-tional complexity will be
analyzed. Second, this project will include more general multi-cast problems and
seek the appropriate solutions, such as when the set of senders and re-ceivers
in the multicast group vary. Finally, a part of the research will be devoted to
the problem of constructing multicast trees in heterogeneous networks with
different optical node architectures as well as the fault-tolerance and Quality-
of-Service (QoS) problems related to optical multicast built in existing
Internet environment and with application-level requirements. This project will
include undergraduate students in research and will thus have substantial impact
on their preparation for graduate education as well as it will be conducted as
means of creating awareness and interest among undergraduate students on the
issues surrounding optical networks.
