This project deals with the development of an improved method for producing high
purity, fine grained silicon nitride powder. Various transition metal catalysts
will be evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis for their effect on reaction
kinetics. The reacted silicon powders will be evaluated for composition,
particle size and morphology. The extent of catalyst removal from the silicon
nitride by chemical techniques will be determined. Principle advantages of the
process will be decreased energy requirements and production of a finer, more
sinterable powder. Fine silicon nitride will be more easily consolidated into
dense, flaw free ceramics.
