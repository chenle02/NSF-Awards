Computer-based molecular dynamics simulations will be made of thin boundary
lubrication films in an attempt to determine which atomic and molecular scale
processes control the tribological performance of these films, in particular,
their dynamic, rheological and thermodynamic properties. The various materials-
dependent parameters which influence these properties will be identified.
Materials parameters of interest include molecular size, structural complexity,
bonding characteristics, adhesive energies and solid surface morphology,
structure and mechanical properties.
