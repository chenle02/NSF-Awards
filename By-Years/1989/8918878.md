A ground-based telescope can produce images that are nearly diffraction limited
if the telescope is equipped with an adaptive optics system. Groups of
astronomers around the world--in the U.S., in Europe and in China--are building
and testing adaptive optics systems. However, if this technology is to be used
productively by astronomers working at optical wavelengths, artificial guide
stars must be created to provide the reference signal for the adaptive optics
system because there are simply too few natural guide stars bright enough to
provide the reference signal to drive the adaptive mirror. Under this award a
method of producing artificial guide stars by Ragleigh scattering of a dye laser
signal will be investigated.
