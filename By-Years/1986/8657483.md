This research will study problems related with diffusion processes. These
special Gaussian processes, with Markov property, arise mainly as limits of
models used in many areas such as microscopic biological phenomena or various
computer communications and manufacturing systems. Professor Williams will study
diffusion processes in three or more dimensions. The first problem will study
reflected Brownian motion in a polyhedral domain. Professor Williams has shown
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a two dimensional
diffusion with given geometric data. She will now explore these problems in
three or more dimensions. Professor Williams plans to obtain characterizations
of the stationary distributions and numerical measures of performance for the
reflected Brownian motions arising as diffusion approximations to closed
queueing networks and to networks with heterogeneous customer populations.
Proposed study of the excursions of diffusions in Lipschitz domains will provide
important insight to the sample path properties of diffusions. Diffusions with
discontinuous/degenerate diffusion coefficients are called singular diffusions.
Study of these processes is of great importance to areas such as optimal
stopping, filtering and stochastic control.
