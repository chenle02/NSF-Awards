This award funds several research projects in economic theory. Each project
examines a specific question about the implications of self-interested behavior.
The first project will help us understand how reciprocal altruism leads to
cooperation in communities. The second project focuses on how to best structure
apprenticeships and traineeships. The third project examines two different
models of how individuals make decisions between choices. Taken as a whole, this
research will help us understand how societies build cooperation; how to best
train individuals for jobs in fields such as law, medicine, academia, and
skilled trades; and will improve foundational models used in macroeconomics,
finance, neuroscience, and psychology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project
focuses on self-interested cooperation and introduces a new class of models of
anonymous interaction. The project contributes both to the theory of repeated
games and to the design of reputation systems. The project on apprenticeship
employs contract theory and optimal control theory to understand key empirical
features of apprenticeships as well as the implications of possible government
regulations that would reduce apprenticesâ€™ hours and increase their pay. The
project on choice under uncertainty will apply machine learning methods to
experimental data to develop better models of choice under uncertainty. The
second part of this final project will develop identification, estimation, and
testing results for the drift diffusion model which is used to explain the
observed correlation between probability of choice and time to
decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
