AST-0215916&lt;br/&gt;Wilson, Grant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, two ground-
breaking sets of observations -discoveries of continuum radiation from
protogalaxies in the millimeter and submillimeter wavelength range, and the
development of the largest catalog to date of galaxy clusters exhibiting the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -have set the stage for advanced studies of galaxy and
cluster evolution by a suite of continuum cameras on the US/Mexico Large
Millimeter Telescope (LMT), currently under construction. To ensure immediate
scientific payoff from the LMT, this award will contribute to funding the
construction of a copy of BOLOCAM -an existing, wide format (144 pixel)
bolometer camera developed for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. This
camera, called BOLOCAM II, will be the flagship continuum array receiver in the
early years of the LMT, and will be essential for telescope commissioning as
well as early science results. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
