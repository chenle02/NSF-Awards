This project will study partial differential equations on singular spaces, with
an emphasis on spectral and scattering theory. The propagation of waves on
smoothly varying spaces is well understood in many respects, but the interaction
with singularities--which might range from boundaries, to corners, to structures
"at infinity"--presents many open problems. One of the project's components is
related to the understanding of wave propagation on Kerr spacetimes (i.e., near
rotating black holes). The principal investigator will study the distribution of
quasi-normal modes, the ways that the black hole may "ring" with damped
oscillations. The initial goal of this project is to obtain a rigorous
description of the exponential decay rate of high frequency modes. The project
also includes work on problems of local energy decay on Riemannian manifolds,
for which the geometry of the infinite ends turns out to have a profound effect
on the low frequency phenomena that may dominate energy decay. Another aspect of
wave propagation of interest to the principal investigator is the infinite-speed
propagation occurring in solutions to the Schrodinger equation. In settings in
which geometric rays are trapped in a bounded region, little is known about the
regularity of solutions. The principal investigator is intent on studying the
effects of these trapped rays, as well as the effects of geometric singularities
such as cone points on the propagation.

Geometry influences the behavior of solutions to wave equations in many
interesting and subtle ways. Following Newton, we know that light behaves in
many regimes as if made of tiny particles. On the other hand, we also know that
light can turn corners ("diffract") and that it tends to disperse. The effect of
changes in geometry to changes in propagation of waves (be they light or sound
or water or gravity waves, or the wave-functions describing quantum particles)
is the central focus of this project's research. In particular, the principal
investigator's work on quasi-normal modes for Kerr spacetimes is closely related
to problems of intense interest in the physics community, as these modes are
part of the signature of gravitational waves. The principal investigator's study
of the linear Schrodinger equation is related to applications not just to the
physics of nonrelativistic quantum particles, but also to the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, which models such disparate phenomena as laser pulses and
superconductivity.
