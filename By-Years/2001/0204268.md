This proposal concerns the question of whether some solutions of the equations
of incompressible, inviscid fluid flow develop spontaneous singularities in
finite time. The objective is to uncover the mathematical structure of possible
blowup flows suggested by the PI previous investigations. Two projects are
planned. The first will be to use advanced computational techniques to reveal
the asymptotic behavior associated with collapse and blowup. Previous work
indicates that there exists an inner Leray-type self-similar solution which
exhibits a finite-time singularity, a regular outer solution and a matching
region of poloidal vorticity. The other project expands upon the observation
that all candidate blowup flows found by all investigators have one or more
discrete symmetries and can be associated with the finite number of point and
space groups. All fluid field variables can be associated with irreducible
representations. How the characteristics of the discrete point groups, such as
degeneracy, commutivity, associated lattices and space groups effect flow
solutions will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equations that govern the
motion of an incompressible fluid, such as water, are routinely used by
engineers and scientists for design and research. The most fundamental question
about these equations, however, has been open for more than 250 years and
reflects directly on the validity of using these equations as a model of fluid
flow: whether solutions remain smooth or blowup in finite time. Finding an
answer to this question for frictionless flow is addressed in this work. It is a
very challenging problem computationally and will be a severe test on modern
numerical techniques. Because of its importance, the related viscous problem has
been selected as one of seven Clay Millennium prize problems regarded as the
Hilbert problems for this century. &lt;br/&gt;
