1) During the course of this grant we plan to : examine the expression of cloned
flagellar genes in strains containing various fla mutations as a means of
determining regulatory interactions among the flagellar genes. 2) Complete the
characterization of strains containing mutations in newly identified flagellar
genes and to determining how these new genes fit into the flagellar genes
regulatory hierarchy. 3) Complete the construction of a physical map of the C.
crescentus chromosome using pulsed field gel eletrophoresis (PFGE) and to
determine the location of additional nutritional genes so that new mutations can
be mapped rapidly and precisely using PEGE rather than the more tedious methods
of classical genetics. 4) Confirm that f1bT encodes a repressor protein which
regulates flagellin gene expression by examining the expression of reporter
genes fused to flagellin gene promoters in strains containing various levels of
f1bT expression, by gel retardation assays, and by the isolation of operator
mutants which are insensitive to the f1bT repressor. 5) Examine the role of the
gene involved in flagellin processing by isolating and characterizing unlinked
suppressor mutations.//
