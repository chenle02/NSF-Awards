The Center for Green Materials Chemistry will develop a fundamentally new
chemistry-based platform for synthesizing environmentally benign, functional
inorganic films. Three key research areas include (1) develop new nanocluster
chemistries using abundant, environmentally benign metals;(2) use these
chemistries to produce previously unrealized nanostructured laminates and
composites; (3) apply these chemistries to the fabrication of vertical transport
transistors.

Aqueous-based processing of functional inorganic films can reduce the costs of
electronics manufacturing and enable the use of large-area substrates while
simultaneously reducing chemical hazards and waste. The Center has strong
industry partnerships. The Center Education Plan will promote early entry and
short time to degree, broadened perspectives, and collaborative mentorships. The
Outreach Plan includes the production of captivating imagery and videos to
illustrate technically demanding material and the human element of science.

The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers that
can address major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges that have
a high probability of both producing transformative research and leading to
innovation. These Centers will attract broad scientific and public interest.
