This project will capitalize on the availability of an organized data set
consisting of thousands of video clips from the WGBH and PBS digital library.
This resource is a searchable, Web-based repository of contextualized multimedia
materials teachers can access easily and productively for their own professional
development. With this award WGBH will produce a set of supporting resources to
amplify the relevance and impact of this digital library for both students and
teachers. These supporting resources include multimedia presentation features
for curriculum units that feature self-contained video and interactive modules;
descriptive annotations and background essays to accompany each asset in the
collection; and detailed lesson plans and discussion questions for using these
resources to support deep learning of the content. It is anticipated that five
curriculum units will be produced, with each unit consisting of two or more
modules. The curriculum units will be developed for the high school level and
the five units will include genetics, ecology, evolution, cells and
biochemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
