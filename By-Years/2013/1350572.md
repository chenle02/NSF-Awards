The overarching goal of the project is to understand the power and limitations
of algebraic computation, and the main foci are the problems of showing lower
bounds for arithmetic circuits and polynomial identity testing. These problems
have played a central role in various areas of Theoretical Computer Science, and
they form the algebraic analog of the P vs NP question. This project will
develop several new approaches and techniques for advancing our understanding of
both questions. Algebraic techniques have also seen several unexpected
connections in pseudorandomness and coding theory. The potential of these
methods is still far from understood. In this project the PI will develop these
methods, in particular the method of multiplicities and partial derivatives, to
give more powerful lower bounds, and new strengthened constructions of
pseudorandom objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research direction proposed in
this project brings together ideas and tools from a broad array of disciplines
and witnesses a lot of fruitful interaction between mathematics, computational
complexity, as well as practical applications to information storage and
retrieval. The PI will disseminate research findings by giving lectures, talks
and developing new courses and making the material available online. The PI will
be actively involved in mentoring young researchers, including high school
students and minorities, who want to pursue research in Theoretical Computer
Science. The PI will also organize a specialized workshop for women in
Theoretical Computer Science, which will bring together women researchers from
all over the world.
