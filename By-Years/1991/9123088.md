This award is for support of a two year study to test a preliminary
magnetostratigraphic correlation which was developed for Strand Fjord, Axel
Heiberg Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. In addition to extending the
section to younger (Eocene) and older (Campanian-Maastrichtian) sediments, an
in-depth lithostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic study will be made of a
laminated lagoonal sequence at Strand Fiord. This sequence affords a nearly
unique opportunity to obtain a Late Cretaceous polar paleoclimate record of
annual variability that also extends into the Milankovitch frequency band.
