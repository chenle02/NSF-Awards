On the Homogenization of some Free Boundary Problems Abstract of proposed
research Antoine Mellet

The principal investigator proposes to analyze some properties of certain free
boundary problems. This proposal is to study the homogenization of these
problems. The aim of homogenization is to describe the influence of small
variations in the local properties of the medium on the global behavior of the
solutions. There has been extensive development in the theory of homogenization
over the last thirty years but very little of the work has treated free boundary
problems.

Free boundary problems arise naturally in the modeling of biological and
physical phenomena involving an interface. The work proposed here will use
homogenization to study the shapes of interfaces. Part of the proposal treats
the problem of the motion of a drop of liquid on an inclined plane - such as
water on a window. This is known to be a difficult mathematical problem and has
applications in many areas including the spreading of paint and the retention of
pesticide sprays on plant leaves. The PI has studied problems of this type in
the analysis of flame propagation and his work has led to an understanding of
various issues observed there including the propagation of flame fronts.
