ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Yasaki, Dan Proposal Number: DMS - 0921700 Institution:
University of North Carolina Greensboro Title: Southeast Regional Meeting on
Numbers (SERMON) 2009

The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG) will host the 21st annual
South East Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON 2009) on April 18-19, 2009.
SERMON is a two-day combinatorics and number theory meeting held annually each
spring semester at rotating institutions; it is attended by faculty and students
from various colleges and universities in the southeast. SERMON originates from
UNCG where the first conference was held in 1988. Since then it has taken place
every year at various universities in the southeast including University of
Georgia, University of South Carolina, Citadel, College of Charleston, Wake
Forest, Virginia Tech, Furman, and Clemson University. This yearly conference
features 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks by
one or more noted mathematicians. This year, SERMON will host Professor Paul
Gunnells from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Professor David Ford
from Concordia University, Montreal.

One goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among number theorists and
combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly, informal setting
where they can come together and hear about recent research in number theory and
combinatorics. In addition to plenary and contributed talks, there will be a
session devoted to discussion of open problems in the area. It is also an
opportunity for graduate students in the region to meet, interact, and speak
about their work with senior researchers. SERMON has a unique familiar
atmosphere. The social gathering in the evening traditionally takes place at the
home of one of the faculty members. These activities help strengthen bonds
between graduate students and senior researchers to facilitate future joint
projects.
