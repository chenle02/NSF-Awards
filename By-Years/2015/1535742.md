Driven by discoveries, and enabled by leaps in technology and imagination, our
understanding of the Universe has changed dramatically over the course of the
last few decades. The fields of astronomy and astrophysics continue to create
new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Realizing
these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening
the foundations of the research enterprise. Based on the decadal survey of
astronomy and astrophysics, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and
Astrophysics, the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) identifies
issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provides
guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research
programs in order to encourage the field?s scientific progress. The CAA is under
the auspices of the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board
of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences at the National Academy of
Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the Committee on Astronomy and
Astrophysics serve to disseminate information from the supporting agencies into
the broader community, as well as provide the agency officials with community-
based input. The CAA routinely gathers input from the astronomy, astrophysics,
and physics communities. Additionally, members of the committee converse with
agency officials, congressional staff, and members of the astronomy and
astrophysics community. Staff and committee members also participate in annual
meetings of the American Astronomical Society and, occasionally, the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and American Physical Society. The
CAA is supported by NASA and NSF.
