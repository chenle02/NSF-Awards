The thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of molecularly complex fluid
mixtures are being studied using computer simulation and theoretical methods.
The research is part of a comprehensive program that combines the methods of
theory, simulation, and experiment. The study focuses on three types of fluids:
those composed of nonspherical and polar molecules, hydrogen-bonded and
associated molecules, and electrolytes. Increasingly sophisticated molecular
dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are being developed to study such
mixtures. These simulations are used to test both the statistical mechanical
theories (perturbation and resummed cluster expansions) that are being
developed, and also the intermolecular force models for these fluids. If
successful, these methods will eventually replace the highly simplified and ad
hoc methods used by engineers for complex mixtures.
