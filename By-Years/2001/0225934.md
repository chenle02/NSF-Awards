Prop #: 0225934&lt;br/&gt;PI: David Powell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
supply shipboard scientific support equipment for the research vessel Walton
Smith operated by the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and
Atmospheric Sciences and dedicated to use in support of marine research. The
Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment
deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The
Program provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch
systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational
equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point
the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project Director, David Powell
is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment. This project
will allow the institution to acquire EM conductor winch with block upgrades,
hydro cable winch with block upgrades and winch control modification.
