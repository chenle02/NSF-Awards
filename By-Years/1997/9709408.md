The project is focused on the development of a PC-based thermal stress modeling
program that can be used to estimate materials behavior for the heat treatment
of large forging process. The knowledge of stress profile in large forging
process could prevent the reproduced forging from cracks during the heat
treatment process. The project has a balance between theory and practices.
Students will gain great technical insights from the validation of the developed
thermal model in the research activities.
