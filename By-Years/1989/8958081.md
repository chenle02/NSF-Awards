It is proposed to exploit some of the new information on hadronic structure
which is becoming available as a result of recent experiments on polarized
targets. There are interesting form factors which provide information on the
structure of the proton, measurable in elastic neutrino-proton scattering. New
structure functions can be measured in deep inelastic scattering from higher
spin targets. Electrodynamics in the presence of anomalous vortices will also be
studied. The vortices exhibit birefringence and optical activity; there is
antiscreaning of charge. This leads to relations, which will be investigated,
among quantization of charge, anomalies and the periodicity of the theta
parameter. Efforts will also be made to put limits on the mass of the Higgs
boson and to develop a model for fermion masses based on flavor democracy.
