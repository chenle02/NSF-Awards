Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;Problem solving is the primary intellectual
activity of engineers and enhancing problem-solving is essential for preparing
engineering students for their future workplace. In addition, new pedagogies
such as problem-based learning (PBL) have been shown to be highly effective in
improving overall student learning. Through this project, PBL activities are
being developed for a material science course and are being implemented in an
undergraduate course for mechanical engineering students. Learning outcomes from
the PBL-based course are being compared to those obtained in a traditional
topics-based course. Engineering curricula typically include PBL-like activities
in the capstone design course; however, in this project, PBL is being introduced
at the sophomore level to motivate learning and improve students' ability to
solve ill-structured problems. The results from this project are being
rigorously evaluated by both qualitative and quantitative means. Project results
are being disseminated through a website, journal articles, and workshops for
engineering faculty who may be interested in implementing PBL techniques in
their undergraduate courses.
