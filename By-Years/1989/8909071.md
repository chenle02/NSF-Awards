This project is concerned with isomorphism problems for complete sets in
complexity classes. For example, one of the most important open questions in
structural complexity theory is whether the NP-complete sets are all isomorphic
under polynomial time computable and polynomial time invertible bijections. The
study focuses on conditions under which such isomorphisms do or do not exist for
complete problems in natural complexity classes, such NP and exponential time,
and on the implications of these conditions. In addition to polynomial time
isomorphism, weaker forms of polynomial time equivalence are also being
investigated for complete problems.
