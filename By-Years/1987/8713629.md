The work looks at the national vulnerability to flash floods by 1) examining the
geographic distribution of this hazard; 2) determining how effective flash flood
warning systems have been and can be expected to be; and 3) preparing and
analyzing illustrative case studies and determining their effectiveness in short
and long range comprehensive flood reduction programs. Mitigation techniques
will be developed that will benefit local and regional mitigation efforts.
