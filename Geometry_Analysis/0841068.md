This proposal seeks funding for the conference Nonlinear Geometric Analysis, to
be held at Princeton University from Thursday, October 30 to Sunday, November 2,
2008. The goal is to bring together speakers from a broad cross-section of the
discipline, and to disseminate recent advances in a forum which includes
established and junior researchers. The speakers of the conference represent
several important areas of development in the field, for example conformal
geometry, fully nonlinear and higher order elliptic equations, and nonlinear
evolution equations. This conference is timed to coincide with a year long
program titled Geometric Partial Differential Equations at the Institute for
Advanced Study, and the conference will both complement and benefit from that
program. It aims to present young researchers with an accessible and detailed
picture of the field, including the historical context, recent highlights,
connections to other areas, important current results and open problems. Fully
63% of the proposed budget will be devoted to the support of graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers.
