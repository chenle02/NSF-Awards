1230166&lt;br/&gt;Dillen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this symposium is to
discuss materials, engineering, chemistry and physics aspects related to the
synthesis, fabrication, and assembly of functional particles and capsules and
their use in energy and biomedical applications. There is no better opportunity
to achieve this than at the MRS meeting. This symposium will bring together
researchers, students, and industrial scientists from multiple disciplines to
share their results and insight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that being able
to partially support travel and to cover the costs of attending the meeting will
allow a wider, more representative population to attend and participate in the
symposium and to strengthen representation in the area of materials fabrication
via the syn-thesis and assembly of functional particles and capsules. We have
encouraged research groups across the country to support participation of
graduate and undergraduate students in the poster sessions, as a means of
exposing students to a high level of research at an early age, and through these
means, enhancing accessibility to research.
