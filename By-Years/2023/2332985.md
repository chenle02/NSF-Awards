Gentrification and Displacement: What Can We Do About It? is the first
international conference on gentrification studies in over 20 years. The
conference program advances understandings of how to predict gentrification and
how to measure and mitigate displacement. It provides a rare opportunity for
scholars to engage with activists and practitioners who face gentrification on
the ground in their day-to-day work. Invited speakers, panelists, and session
organizers represent a diversity of career stages, disciplines, methodological
and theoretical orientations, and demographic groups. The conference charts a
path forward for the next decade of gentrification scholarship and provides
recommendations to decision-makers facing housing crises around the globe.

Gentrification and Displacement: What Can We Do About It? is a dynamic two-and-
a-half-day event, that includes three keynote speakers, two plenary panel
discussions, 18 topical sessions, mentorship opportunities, poster displays, a
book display, a documentary film screening, and a morning of site visits/field
trips to community-based organizations focused on gentrification. The program
interrogates questions about how to identify, measure, and predict
gentrification, and about how best to assess and mitigate the consequences of
gentrification-induced displacement. Intellectual outputs include a white paper;
a special journal issue; an edited volume published with a university press; and
a community practices report on avoiding and mitigating gentrification. The
conference shapes and advances the research of the individual scholars who
attend, and takes the field in an inclusive, equitable direction that includes
perspectives from across disciplines, career stages, methodological and
theoretical traditions, and from around the globe.
