The primary emphasis of this project is on the use of artificial neural networks
(ANNs) for identification and control of unknown nonlinear dynamic systems.
However, generally much is known about the plant. This research involves the use
of a "gray layer" which facilitates the integration of known characteristics of
the otherwise unknown plant into an ANN. The convergence characteristics using
this novel technique are of several orders of magnitude better than the
conventional schemes. Both state of the art intelligent control and adaptive
control technologies are used, and their application is demonstrated in the
context of electrically commutated machines.*** //
