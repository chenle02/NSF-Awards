9406624 Carr Objectives are to complete the geochemical stratigraphy of DSDP 495
and to collaborate in the analysis of JOIDES cores planned for the future along
the coast of Central America; to determine the variation with time of the
elemental fluxes at the volcanic front; to ascertain in the extent of subduction
components in the back arc region; to characterize the pre-metasomatized mantle
wedge. To accomplish these goals, PIs plan to acquire extensive trace element
and isotopic data on sample spanning the last 2-4 my in the Moyuta-Tecuamburro
segment of Guatemala; to determine B, Be and 10Be on lavas in the back arc; and
to extend the regional Pb isotopic study of volcanic front and back arc lavas
begun in the previous proposal.
