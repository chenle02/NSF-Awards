A computerized data acquisition system is proposed for use at the LEGS
polarized photon facility at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The system will
be used to study photonuclear reactions at intermediate energies. It is
comprised of NIM and CAMAC modules interfaced to a DEC Microvax II computer via
a Microprogrammed Branch Driver.
