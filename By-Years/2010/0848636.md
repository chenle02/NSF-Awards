The project aims to explore the impacts of project-based service learning (PBSL)
on engineering education. Central to this study is a summit on the measurement
of these impacts with twenty leaders in engineering PBSL and assessment
attending. Equally important to the study is the creation of a pre-summit report
on the state of PBSL in engineering education with an emphasis on evaluation.
This document, a synthesis of evidence in the literature and information from
summit participants, provides a broad review of existing PBSL programs, their
impacts, and the assessment methods used in studying them. The summit agenda is
designed to identify desired outcome metrics, quality assessment methods, and
key next steps needed in understanding the impacts of PBSL on engineering
education. The pre-summit and summit findings are being combined into a
nationally disseminated final report and presented in several conference
presentations.
