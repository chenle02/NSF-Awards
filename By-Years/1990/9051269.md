The focus of this project is the development of a laboratory for instruction in
artificial intelligence. The use of a standard hardware base and the development
of educational versions of AI's foundational programs are key aspects of the
work. The goal is to fill the widening gap between introductory undergraduate
courses and the more advanced material typically handled in graduate seminars.
This project is significant because it specifically addresses the gap between
introductory AI courses and higher level courses. This gap is widening and it
must be addressed through enhanced laboratory instruction at the undergraduate
level.
