The China loess sequences provide one of the most important records of past
climate on the continents. The sediments deposited there can be used to
determine many aspects of past atmospheric circulation including wind intensity
and direction, precipitation and evaporation in central China, and the
relationship between climate in the continental interior and the south Asian
monsoons. The most difficult problem associated with studying loess sequences is
developing an accurate chronology of loess deposition. This proposal requests
support to continue analyzing the amino acid, thermoluminescence, and
radiocarbon ages of sediments deposited in these sequences. During an initial
two-year grant, the PIs noted a number of contradictory results between the
dating methods. This project is important because it will resolve these
discrepancies and develop an accurate chronology which will be useful to many
other investigators.
