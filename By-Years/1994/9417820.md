9417820 Devlin This is a request for renewed support for a group of 6 faculty at
Rutgers University to do research in two of the most important experiments at
the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. It is a combination of two groups
both of which have had NSF support. Devlin, Watts and Conway are members of the
CDF collaboration exploring high PT physics adn heavy quark production in
antiproton-proton collisions at 1.8Gev. This a mature experiment and the Rutgers
group developed, provided and has maintained the level 3 trigger system - a
cluster of high speed workstations which processes the output of the experiment
in real time and makes the final event selection. Schnetzer, Thompson and
Somalwar are key members of the KTEV collaboration which is setting up the next
generation of experiments to explore CP violation in Kaon decays. This fixed
target experiment is in the preparation phase and is expected to run in early
1996. The Rutgers group is especially interested in rare kaon decays which are a
by product of CP experiment and whose observation may provide clues about
physics beyond the Standard Model. ***
