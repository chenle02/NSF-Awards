Although the shape representations offered by contemporary Computer Aided
Design Systems are adequate to do routine calculations, they are deficient in
having reliable sectioning and offsetting capabilities. The P.I. is seeking a
way to mathematically represent the surface so that the computer realization can
serve not only visualization but important manufacturing issues such as the
computation of the offset surface. The principal investigator proposes to use an
algebraic representation of the surface. However, the two problems with such an
implicit representation are that it does not allow for representing finite
segments and the coefficients do not have geometric meaning. The P.I. proposes a
novel approach to overcoming these problems. The first is his use of a windowing
method for bounding the algebraic surface. The second is his approach to
determining the characteristic points of the solution through a guided
subdivision algorithm. The research will test the feasibility and robustness of
this novel approach. The principal investigator is a new investigator who shows
excellent promise. Funding is recommended under the program for Expedited Awards
