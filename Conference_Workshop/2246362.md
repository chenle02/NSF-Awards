This award provides funding for US researchers to attend a conference entitled
"Complex Analysis and Geometry" in Budapest, Hungary. The conference will take
place in June 23-30,2023, and will be hosted by the Alfréd Rényi Institute of
Mathematics. The topics of the conference emphasize the rich interactions
between complex analysis and complex geometry. The conference will bring
together well-known experts and junior researchers with the aim of communicating
recent progress in the field and fostering research interaction and
collaboration. Funds from the NSF will be used to support US participation in
the conference. Applications from early career mathematicians and
underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged.

Key topics in this conference will include potential theoretic methods for the
PDE's of complex geometry, potential theoretic methods in complex algebraic
geometry and the Bergman kernel, complex dynamics in several variables, Oka
manifolds and more. A conference focusing on these topics is timely considering
the many recent exciting developments in these areas. The conference website is

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
