9508616 Leger The Department of Mineral Sciences at the American Museum of
Natural History (AMNH) and Department of Geological Sciences (LDEO) of Columbia
University will establish a joint electron microprobe laboratory. This
development builds upon numerous pre- existing links between these departments
such as a joint program of Graduate Studies, research collaboration, and shared
use of experimental petrology, x-ray, and FTIR laboratories. AMNH will acquire
of a new electron microprobe to replace the 18-year old ARL SEMQ in current
operation and to provide LDEO researchers with added capabilities in the
analysis of light elements and in image analysis processing not currently
possible with their 10- year old Cameca MBX. This grant supports half of the
$800,000 capital cost of a new Cameca electron microprobe and half will be
supported equally by AMNH and Columbia University. In addition, AMNH supports a
full-time Ph.D.-level research position (the PI) to manage the facility.
Replacing the two aging microprobes with a single state-of-the-art instrument
has advantages for efficiency of operation, full utilization of the analytical
facility, cost efficiency of internal operation, and maximizing the use of
scarce instrumentation dollars. The new instrument will lead to increased
productivity and analytical capability for multiple investigators at both
institutions and in the New York metropolitan area including students from the
City University of New York (CUNY) system. A single laboratory has the
additional advantage that it will bring scientists from AMNH and LDEO closer
together and encourage new intellectual links. ***
