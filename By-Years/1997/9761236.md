*** 971236 Hartsough This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will demonstrate the feasibility of direct electrochemical reduction of nitrate
in drinking water. Current commercial treatment technologies produce large
volumes of waste streams or add unwanted chemicals to the water and are not
amenable to use in small scale, point of use systems. Direct electrochemical
reduction of nitrate as proposed offers a potentially selective and cost
effective treatment method. No chemicals are added to the water and no waste
streams are produced. Electrochemical cells will be designed to directly reduce
nitrate to nitrogen, ammonia, or nitrous oxide. The cells will be safe, simple
and inexpensive to operate, compact, and maintenance free, making them ideal for
use in home and other point of use systems. Four million people drink from
private water supply wells contaminated with nitrate exceeding the US limits
established for public health concerns. One to two percent of public water
supplies also contains levels of nitrate exceeding these limits. The proposed
technology would be readily scaleable for point of use systems to remedy this
potential health risk. ***
