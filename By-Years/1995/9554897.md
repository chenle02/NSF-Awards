We will be constructing a CD-ROM entitled A Multimedia Companion to
Developmental Biology. This CD-ROM is planned to include those things that
cannot be contained in a textbook: moving images of animal development (along
with animations, voice-overs, and labeled photographs to assist the learner),
research papers that enable each learner access to primary literature,
interactive animations that enable one to understand complex experimental
protocols, interactive programs that enable one to model development by changing
the parameters of cell adhesion, migration, etc., interviews with researchers
whose work helped frame the discipline, papers in the history of embryology, and
position papers debating issues of ethical concern to contemporary developmental
biologists (sex selection, gene therapy, etc.) These presentations will be
connected to one another through three hierarchical indices and through
hypertext. We plan to create different levels of complexity, from entry level
(middle-school) through graduate levels, in several areas. While less advanced
students can gain much from watching the videos and animations, more advanced
students can now plan their own paths through the various presentations. We hope
to develop Version 1.0 of this project over the sabbatical leave of the
Principal Investigator and to sell the resulting disc "at cost." It will be
multiplatform and could be used with any textbook in developmental biology or
embryology (not necessarily the one authored by the P.I.) Version 1.0 would
contain sections on fertilization, embryonic cleavage, gastrulation, cell
specification, induction, developmental neurobiology, sex determination,
metamorphosis, gametogenesis, and differential gene expression.
