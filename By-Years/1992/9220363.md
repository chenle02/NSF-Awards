The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the roles of
microtubule-based components of the cytoskeleton in plant development.
Morphogenesis in plants is controlled primarily by processes that establish the
planes of cell divisions and the axes of cell elongations, and three microtubule
arrays unique to plant cells play central roles in these morphogenetic
processes. Furthermore, the absence of centrioles in plant cells makes the
potential role of gamma-tubulin in the nucleation of microtubules of particular
interest in plants. These investigations focus on the genetic control of
microtubule-based processes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which
contains 15 characterized alpha and beta-tubulin genes and at least one gamma-
tubulin gene. The specific objectives of the proposed investigations are (1) to
use immunofluorescence or immunogold microscopy and gamma-tubulin- specific
antibodies to localize gamma tubulin within cells throughout the cell cycle, (2)
to characterize spatial and temporal patterns of expression of the gamma tubulin
gene(s) and selected beta-tubulin genes, and (3) to investigate the utilization
and function of the pollen-localized alpha 1-isoform by means of
immunolocalization with our alpha 1-tubulin-specific antibody and by analysis of
transgenic plants harboring "antisense RNA" chimeric genes.
