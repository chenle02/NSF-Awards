9413165 Olson In this project, the PI will serve as co-chief scientist on two
Hydrographic lines in the Indian Ocean, designated as lines I7N and I9N by the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment. Line I7N crosses the Arabian Sea in a more
or less meridional section, coordinating with the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study
(JGOFS), another Global Change Research Program in the Arabian Sea. Line I9N
crosses the Bay of Bengal from the Ganges delta to near the equator. Focus of
this research will be on the meridional distributions of properties in the major
basins, and a number of boundary flows along the Broken Ridge (SE Indian Ocean),
the northern Bay of Bengal, through Arminate Passage, along the Carlesberg
Ridge, and off the coast of Oman. The data will also apply to studies of along-
equator flow in the Somali and Cocos basins.
