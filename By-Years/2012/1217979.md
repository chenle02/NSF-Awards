Modern data centers hosting popular Internet services face significant and
multi-facet challenges in performance and power control. The challenges are
mainly due to complex interaction of highly dynamic and heterogeneous workloads
in complex virtualized computing systems. In this research project, the
investigators take an organized approach to autonomic performance and power
control on virtualized servers. The project designs and develops automated,
agile and scalable techniques for server parameter tuning, virtual machine
capacity planning, non-invasive energy-efficient performance isolation, and
elastic power-aware resource provisioning. The deliverables are innovative and
practical approaches and mechanisms that provide performance assurance of
applications, maximize effective system throughput of data centers with
resources and power budget, mitigate performance interference among
heterogeneous applications, and achieve performance and power targets with
flexible tradeoffs while assuring control accuracy and system stability. The
research methodology integrates strengths of reinforcement learning, fast online
learning neural networks, fuzzy logic control, model predictive controls and
distributed and coordinated control. The project broadens impact by developing a
testbed in a university prototype data center to demonstrate the orchestration
of developed approaches and mechanisms for autonomous management of virtualized
computing systems, middleware, and services. The project engages women, US
citizens, full-time and part-time graduate and undergraduate students in
computer system research. The success will guide autonomous resource management
for sustainable computing in next-generation data centers. The research data is
deposited at a dedicated website at the host institution and research results
are disseminated to the public as published technical reports.
