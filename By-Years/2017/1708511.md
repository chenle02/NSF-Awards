The principal investigator will study mathematical problems in the subject of
particle-wave duality. This duality has been successfully investigated for a
long time, especially in the setting of closed systems, but many of its
important manifestations are poorly understood, especially in the settings of
open and mixed systems which are the principal investigator's focus. In open
systems the method of complex scaling studied by the principal investigator
appears in numerical analysis as the method of perfectly matched layers, where
it has been useful in the engineering of nanostructures and
microelectromechanical systems. Mixed systems like the ones studied by the
principal investigator are important in electromagnetics, communications,
optics, quantum waveguides, and semiconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main
dynamical object studied by the principal investigator is the trapped set; this
is the set of particle trajectories which remain in a bounded set for all time.
The geometry of this set is of central importance in determining salient
features of wave evolution, such as regularity, decay, and asymptotics. The
principal investigator will study these features in the important but still
comparatively mysterious situations of heavy trapping, rough coefficients, and
noncompact trapped sets.
