The objectives of this proposal are (1) to improve the total internal-reflection
microscopy (TIMR) to measure absolute distances between a submicron particle and
a solid wall, and (2) to study the dynamics of Brownian motion of particles in
the vicinity of a solid wall. TIMR technique was initially developed by Dr.
Prieve. It measures the interaction potential between a particle and a wall.
Interaction forces as small as a few picograms have been experimentally
determined with this technique. In this project, TIMR will be applied to study
the dynamics of hindered Brownian motion of a sphere and diffusion coefficients
near a wall. The results can be related to the rates of flocculation and
deposition of particles from moving fluids.
