Quantum Information Processing (QIP) is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary
research field that studies the principles and the applications of quantum
mechanics for computation, communication, cryptography, and other information
processing tasks. QIP has the potential to revolutionize information processing
technologies by enabling ultra-fast computation, efficient simulation of quantum
physics, and unbreakable secure communication. Thus the field is not only of
fundamental importance intellectually, but also for a prosperous society as well
as for national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The QIP Workshop is the premier
annual conference in the theoretical aspects of the field. It brings together
hundreds of participants, from leading researchers to aspiring students, of
diverse nationality and disciplinary backgrounds. This conference has played a
formative role in the field and has become one of the most important venues for
the groundbreaking research in the theory of quantum information
processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial financial support
for US-based students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 16th Workshop on
Quantum Information Processing (QIP 2013), to be held in Beijing, China, on
January 21--25, 2013, at Tsinghua University. Availability of travel support
will be widely advertised and the recipients will be selected through an open
and objective process, based on both merit and need. This support will permit
broader participation by US-based students and postdocs, in particular by
members of under-represented groups, contributing to their education and career
development. It will facilitate the dissemination of research, and enhance the
conference as an international institution for research collaboration and
education.
