This award supports participation in the Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics
(http://www.math.ncsu.edu/TLC). These are one-day (Saturday) conferences, held
once a semester. Each conference brings four outstanding mathematicians from
around the country to give talks about significant and exciting developments in
combinatorics. The Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics workshops play numerous
roles: they enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by
creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers;
facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results
among researchers in the Southeastern United States; promote the teaching and
training of graduate students by exposing them to the perspectives of leading
researchers; increase awareness and understanding of combinatorics, on the part
of faculty and students in the Southeast; support the development of young
faculty at various schools and help them build local support and research
networks; broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women;
and foster research interactions among participants, leading to new research
results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is a growing and important area of
mathematics. The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed
to continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of
mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering
applications. The states of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia,
Kentucky, and Tennessee have significant research strength in combinatorics and
adjacent areas. In particular, there are remarkably many tenure-track
researchers, senior researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students in
combinatorics and related fields at various colleges and universities within
driving distance of the Research Triangle region of North Carolina (Raleigh,
Durham, and Chapel Hill). A relatively large proportion of these researchers are
from underrepresented groups. The lecture series provides valuable opportunities
for interactions among these researchers.
