This research will continue and complete the innovative experimental fracture
mechanics research in concrete. The investigations to date have shown that
consistent non-linear fracture mechanics concepts can be developed for concrete
for differents modes of loading, (under Mode I and II loadings). The major
objective of this continuation research is to verify these predictive
methodologies for discrete crack growth in concrete. This research will have
analytical and experimental components. The experimental component will involve
both fracture process zone control studies using Mode I and Mode II type
loadings, and concrete beam studies for flexural and diagonal tension test on
crack propagation. Numerical analyses studies will be carried out to verify the
experimental results. The Kr values obtained using the formula contained in ASTM
561-81 will be re-evaluated using a process zone model. The final numerical
model will include the effects of aggregate interlock and normal and shear
stress interactions.
