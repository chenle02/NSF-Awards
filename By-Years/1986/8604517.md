A better method is needed to achieve the recovery of noble metals from catalyst
supports. The failure of routine methods to accomplish this separation suggest a
major basic research effort to improve the key operation for the desired
process. Research proposed to use a fluidized system to accomplish metal
dissolution could be the key step to supplement the developmental chemistry
needed to arrive at a workable system. The fact that a fluidized bed is more
conductive to continuous processing than the packed tower systems used in the
past offers strong promise. Solids preparation, reagent concentrations and fluid
bed conditions must all be evaluated to determine reaction kinetics for this
novel system. The experimental data which will be gained from the research will
be useful relative to the fixed bed data for the same system and also for future
extension to other fluidized systems. The use of fluid beds is relatively new in
metals winning and could awaken a wave of exploratory research for several of
the high value metals.
