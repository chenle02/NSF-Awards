&lt;br/&gt;https://www.stolaf.edu/analysis/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This annual
conference, which began in 1978 and of which the 2017 meeting will be the forty-
first installment, is considered to be the premier conference of its type by the
members of the real analysis community. The featured speakers in the 2017 event
include Bruce Hanson, Mikhail Korobkov, Assaf Naor, and Artur Nicolau. They will
address topics ranging from differentiability properties of functions to the
geometry of Banach spaces. The program allows ample time for junior
mathematicians to present their work.
