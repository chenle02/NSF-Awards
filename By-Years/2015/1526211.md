Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are hardware circuits that can be
reconfigured by a system user after being deployed. FPGAs are a compelling
alternative architecture that may allow hardware performance to continue to
improve at a dramatic rate. Unfortunately, systems that incorporate an FPGA may
allow a potentially untrusted user to reprogram hardware after it has been
deployed. Such a scenario enables novel security attacks that can leak a user's
private information or corrupt critical information stored on a system, but are
performed entirely in hardware. This project develops an approach for ensuring
that FPGAs satisfy strong security policies even when programmed by an untrusted
user that will incur no overheard for runtime performance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates techniques that automatically
infer proofs of information-flow properties of circuits. This project designs
and implements policy languages, proof languages, checking-circuit synthesizers,
and proof generators, which in combination will dramatically improve the
security of FPGA-based systems. These techniques will enable devices and data-
centers to use FPGAs in novel circuit designs that satisfy strong, precise
security guarantees and can be updated dynamically.
