This project develops algebraic tools for applications in computational
complexity, coding theory and incidence geometry. These application domains
describe three areas within the fields of computer science, electrical and
mathematics driven by very distinct motivations. Computational complexity aims
to understand the fundamental limits of algorithms. Coding theory aims to study
methods that can protect digital information from errors that inevitably creep
in to every storage medium or communication channel. Incidence geometry studies
combinatorial properties, such as size of dimension, of points in space that
satisfy nice geometric properties. Despite the vast difference in scope, many
central results in the three areas have come about by an understanding of basic
algebraic properties of functions. This project aims to develop this basic
understanding further to enable many more of such applications, and to bring
these areas together. Some central algebraic properties that are being explored
in this project include (1) highly-efficient randomized methods to test if a
multivariate function is essentially a low-degree polynomial, (2) study of how
symmetries of algebraic properties enable highly-efficient tests, and (3) use of
higher-order derivatives in the study of incidence geometry.

The project involves the mentoring and education of junior researchers (Ph.D.
candidates) who intend to pursue their own careers in research, especially those
interested in interdisciplinary studies within mathematics, electrical
engineering and computer science. The education component of this project will
develop courses and material of use in this interdisciplinary research project,
and thus also help contribute to its broad impact.
