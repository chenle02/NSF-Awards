0115958&lt;br/&gt;Popp&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of Hawaii Manoa will provide support for acquisition of an isotope-
ratio monitoring gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer system and related
instrumentation for researchers at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and
Technology. It is expected that the new instrumentation will foster
interdisciplinary approaches to a broad range of problems in isotopic research
in marine chemistry, geology and biology, and related environmental sciences.
University of Hawaii will contribute cost-sharing of more than 33% of the cost
of this project from non-federal funds. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
