Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CHE-
0303708&lt;br/&gt;Rabalais/Houston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Rabalais and
his coworkers at the University of Houston, along with his theoretical colleague
Professor Bahrim at Lamar University, are developing ion-electron coincidence
spectroscopy to probe the chemical structure of solid surfaces. With the support
of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, they are combining detailed
experimental studies of ion-electron coincidence with trajectory calculations to
develop a fundamental understanding of ion-solid interactions. The goal of this
work is to develop tools for the real space structural and chemical analysis of
solid surfaces. Application of this information is critical in a number of
important technologies, including semiconductor processing, heterogeneous
catalysis, and plasma-wall interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a
combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, Professors Rabalais and
Bahrim are developing methods for the structural and compositional analysis of
solid surfaces. Ion-electron coincidence spectroscopy provides a charge transfer
mapping of the solid surface, and can be used to understand chemical reactivity
at the interface. Fundamental information from these studies is important in the
analysis of microelectronic devices and solid catalysts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
