This project establishes an I-Corps Site at Colorado State University (CSU). NSF
Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at
universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to
transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide
infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest
funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into
becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation
locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of
mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Site leverages CSU's innovation ecosystem to accelerate entrepreneurship across
the CSU system and along the Colorado Front Range. The overall CSU Site
objectives are to stimulate the translation of research, train faculty and
students to understand innovation and entrepreneurship, and contribute to the
National Innovation Network. Specific goals of the CSU Site are to dramatically
increase the number of students and faculty exposed to the Lean Launchpad
training methodology, engage a wide range of regional stakeholders, increase the
number of CSU-affiliated start-ups over ten years, and unite CSU and other
regional research universities around an entrepreneur recruitment and start-up
development process coupled to both industry and the investment community and
supportive of women and minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
