9503455 Eglinton The molecular-level characterization of particulate organic
matter (POM) in the marine environment has remained technically unfeasible until
recently. The investigator in this study will be taking advantage of recent
developments in the field of direct temperature resolved mass spectrometry (DT-
MS) to study compositional details of suspended POM collected from inshore will
involve the use of flow cytometry to separate suspended POM into sub-classes
defined on the particle size) followed by DT-MS analysis of the class separates.
The approach will make possible the determination of the composition and
relative importance of different classes of organic compounds (polysaccharides,
proteins, phenols, etc.) as well as establish chemical signatures for the
planktonic sources of the POM.
