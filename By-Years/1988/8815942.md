This project will characterize the molecular dynamics associated with the
formative and growth of interface bond of ice and pavement. The study will use
the laser micro-ramon spectrocopy and molecular dynamic simulations of transient
interface phenomena involving metal and asphalt materials. The project involves
experimental and analytical investigations.
