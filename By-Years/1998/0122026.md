ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visualization Learning Environments for Teaching
Inquiry and Earth Science Concepts: A Model for Improving Earth Science
Teaching&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a pilot model for improving
elementary teacher preparation in earth sciences, scalable for broader
systematic change. The model consists of a framework for implementing
visualization learning environments (simulations, modeling, and imagery of real
data sets) in undergraduate science courses for the purpose of constructing
inquiry-based learning. The pilot model is based on an eighteen-month
longitudinal study on the use of visualization learning environments in an
elementary teacher preparation science course taught at the University of
Northern Colorado, Principles of Scientific Inquiry.. The longitudinal study is
crucial in assessing the long-term impact of visualization learning environments
on content literacy and inquiry skill development. The project contributes
significantly to the evaluation section of the Digital Library for Earth System
Education (DLESE) as a beta test site for DLESE's Evaluator Tool-kit, an
instrument for methods and protocols for assessing activities and courses that
utilize inquiry-based activities. Faculty teaching general education science
courses could adapt the model created by this project for use in their
classes.&lt;br/&gt;
