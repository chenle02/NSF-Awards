9416340 Helmberger This research is to obtain aftershock source information from
the broad-band, high capability TERRAscope waveform data in conjunction with the
locations from the USGS-Caltech short-period array. With the sources fixed,
propagational effects will be examined to develop better velocity models and
associated Green's functions for the San Fernando region. Thus, the larger
events and mainshock can be re-inverted for slip-distributions using these
Green's Functions. In the process, the 3-D velocity model of the region will
have greatly improved and can be used to assess hazards throughout the extended
Los Angeles region. This project is a contribution to the National Earthquake
Hazard Reduction Program and is supported by the Northridge Earthquake Emergency
Appropriation. ***
