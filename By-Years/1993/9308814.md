9308814 Roychowdhury Investigation of the computing characteristics of a simple
non-linear capacitively coupled network based on classical. Coulomb blockade
phenomena is proposed. Such a network could be implemented by fabricating an
array of conductive islands that interact with each other capacitively. In the
first phase, the feasibility of designing simple arrays to execute elementary
computations such as logic operations and simple applications involving
associative memory will be examined. This first step will be followed by an
investigation of the feasibility of implementing more complex computational
tasks using more elaborate arrays. The theoretical effort proposed is expected
to culminate in the formulation of novel device and circuit design concepts
applicable to nanoelectronics. ***
