This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A request is made to fund additional
and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Hugh M Sharp, a 146 foot Regional
research vessel operated by the University of Delaware as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The
request includes two items listed by priority:&lt;br/&gt; 1) Replacement CTD
Frame&lt;br/&gt; 2) Network Upgrades&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The
acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-
funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers. The addition of the water sampling
equipment that was damaged as well as the upgrading of the computer systems will
enhance the research effectiveness of the coastal vessel R/V Sharp.
