Through this project, four Lafayette Instrument Minigraph computer interfaces
and four P-60 Pentium IBM-compatible computer systems linked by a Pentium/66
network server are purchased in order to enhance the laboratory component of the
curriculum of the Psychology Department. The most important improvements are for
the laboratory course, Physiological Psychology, in which the equipment can be
used regularly during weekly laboratory sessions that are limited to 12 students
per session. These computers permit hands-on experience with state-of-the-art
technology for laboratory exercises and provide students with expertise in
computer-based research technology in psychophysiology. The computers also
enhance utilization of existing polygraphic equipment by permitting real-time
analysis and automated data processing of physiological measures recorded in
laboratory exercises. In addition, sophisticated data collection and analysis by
senior students completing independent study projects is made possible. These
improvements in the education of psychology majors better prepare them for
research in graduate school.
