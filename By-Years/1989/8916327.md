This project will develop new equipment capable of generating precise, high-
frequency (500 MHz) ultrasonic equation of state data at hydrostatic pressures
up to 40 kilobars and temperatures up to 1500K. The data are needed to interpret
seismic velocity data in terms of Earth models of density and mineral phase
distribution with depth. The apparatus will be designed to accommodate solid
samples of mantle materials up to 5 mm in diameter. The system will enable the
measurement of elastic constants and their pressure and temperature derivatives.
