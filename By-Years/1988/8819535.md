Direct numerical simulation is to be carried out for the turbulent flow in a
planar channel which is so arranged that the average velocity gradient
disappears on one of the walls (a moving wall). The purpose is to obtain
detailed turbulence data near this wall. This is then to be utilized in a search
for the separation of two effects of a wall on a turbulent flow: kinematic (due
to the supression of perpendicular fluctuations), and dynamic (due to the shear
induced by the wall). In this case, the latter effect is eliminated on the
moving wall. Means will be sought for incorporating this separation (into two
separate wall effects) into simplified turbulence closure models for more
complex and realistic flows. //
