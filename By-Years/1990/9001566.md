Dr. Vincent Rotello has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Rotello's doctoral degree was from Yale University under the
supervision of Professor Harry Wasserman. Dr. Rotello intends to continue
research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Professor Julius Rebek. Dr. Rotello's area of postdoctoral research and training
will be molecular recognition and macromolecular catalysis. He will design
molecular cleft hosts bound to flexible peptide fragments to maximize host-guest
binding. These systems will serve as models for enzyme-substrate and antibody-
hapten recognition. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of recent Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
