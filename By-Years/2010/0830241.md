This collaborative project builds and develops information assurance education
capacity. Critical to the success of this partnership is extensive classroom
teaching by the PI and the co-PIs at the partner university as well as a hands-
on personal mentoring of potential and awarded SFS students at both schools.
This project consists of four distinct objectives: (1) Increasing the number and
improve the skills of information assurance (IA) faculty at both schools through
professional development and team-taught courses at the partner university
campuses; (2) developing a multi-disciplinary information assurance educational
program with the ultimate goal of qualifying the non-CAEIAE university as a
National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance NSA (CAEIAE);
(3) providing quality IA education to Scholarship for Service students; and (4)
facilitating joint faculty development activities via joint workshops, joint
publication and conference attendance.

The key elements of this proposal are extensive personal contact between the
faculty and students at both schools, and team teaching and joint publication
efforts between the universities. This proposal is all about developing and
expanding information assurance capacity at both schools.
