The FAST proposal seeks to integrate developmental mappings of students
understanding of science topics with formative assessment. The basic idea is
that developmental maps can form the framework for assessing students' knowledge
of science concepts and for the design of follow-up student experiences. The
project extends the Minstrell Diagnoser concept down to the elementary
level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project would involve generating mappings of two
science concepts and then collecting data to validate student's classification.
Later phases of the work would lead teachers to use the results of the formative
assessment to improve student learning. To do this, they would employ hand-held
computers to record individual students' states within the facet map. This
diagnostic placement would then become the basis of teacher reflection. The
investigators are cognizant of the reality of limited time on the part of the
teacher. The hand-held computers will display information about possible
instructional strategies given the state of the learner's understanding. Data
collection devices will be teacher journals, classroom observation, and student
assessments&lt;br/&gt;
