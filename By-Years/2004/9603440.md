This award supports travel and living expenses of five U.S. participants in a
U.S.-France workshop to take place in Paris, France in 1997. The objective is to
coordinate efforts of the U.S. Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and a similar
European project called the Deep Near-Infrared Sky Survey (DENIS). The U.S.
coordinator is Michael Skrutskie of the University of Massachusetts. The
European consortium is led by Nicolas Epchtein at the Observatoire de Paris. The
2MASS project will construct two 1.3m telescopes and two infrared cameras to
survey the entire sky beginning in early 1997. DENIS aims to survey a
significant portion of the sky visible from the Southern Hemisphere. At this
workshop, they propose to initiate sharing of experiences and information that
will improve the development and operations of the survey and will maximize the
scientific output of the combined surveys.
