The project provides travel grants for 15 graduate students to present their
research and gain professional experience at the seventh biennial conference of
the International Gender and Language Association (IGALA), held in SÃ£o Leopoldo,
Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, June 20-22, 2012. The selection of grant recipients
is based on an application process reviewed by members of the IGALA Executive
Committee, Advisory Board, and Conference Committee.

IGALA is the major professional organization for scholars of language and
gender, a dynamic interdisciplinary field that uses the methods of social
science to address fundamental questions regarding the role of language in
issues of gender. IGALA's biennial conference is the primary scholarly venue for
this field, and participation in the conference is therefore an important
professional experience for graduate students conducting research in the area.
The 2012 conference is the first time that IGALA will meet in South America, and
it therefore presents a rare opportunity for U.S. scholars to exchange ideas and
forge collaborations with their South American colleagues. The conference
program's inclusion of two special forums on gender and public policy in Brazil
provides timely and relevant information about this key globalizing nation,
which can help U.S. researchers expand the international reach and utility of
their work. In addition, the conference's emphasis on emergent themes in
language and gender research will generate important new ideas that will shape
the field in coming years.

Given the high cost of travel between the United States and southern Brazil, the
travel grants will enable graduate students to attend the conference who would
otherwise be unable to participate, particularly those who are members of
underrepresented groups. In addition, the conference includes numerous
opportunities for graduate student participation, training and mentoring, and
professional development, such as workshops, roundtable discussions, and
networking activities.
