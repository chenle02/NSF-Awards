Dissolution of glassy polymers can be considered as a combination of solvent
penetration featuring Case II transport and polymer dissolution controlled by
polymer disentanglement. In the present work, an anomalous transport model is
developed for solvent penetration and is coupled with a disentanglement model
for polymer dissolution. Solvent penetration is controlled by the relaxation or
deformation of polymer and the diffusional Deborah number is shown to be a major
model parameter. In the disentanglement model, dissolution of polymer molecules
requires that solvent concentration be greater than a critical gel concentration
and that a polymer molecule be allowed a certain time to complete the
disentanglement of diffusion movement from the gel state to liquid state. This
time is assumed to be equivalent to the reputation time, which is a function of
molecular weight, solvent concentration and chain rigidity. A concept of
disentanglement clock is introduced as the material time clock controlling the
dissolution. The new model may explain many experimental observations, such as
effects of type of solvent and polymer on dissolution rate and the thickness of
the gel layer. Experimental studies are performed with well- characterized
samples of polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) in various solvents using
interferometry and critical angle illumination microscopy. The solvent
concentration profiles and dissolution rates are measured using ellipsometry.
The necessary self-diffusion coefficient of the polymer is measured by pulsed
gradient spin echo NMR spectroscopy. In addition, experimental studies are
performed using poly(acrylic acid) and poly(vinyl alcohol) in water to study the
influence of ionic conditions on dissolution.
