The goal of this research project is to better understand how to efficiently
use the present generation of parallel computers and to influence the design of
the next generation. The bulk of the research will be in the design of processor
efficient parallel algorithms for abstract machines that possess a message
passing architecture such as the Parallel Random Access Machine. The problems
under investigation include the breadth first search of an undirected graph.
Special attention will be given to architectures where the individual processors
contain a relatively large amount of local memory. Message passing schemes which
efficiently simulate the local memory model will be considered.
