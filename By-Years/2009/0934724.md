This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a variety of recruiting
techniques to attract high quality science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (STEM) career changers to the teaching profession, Oakland
University in partnership with the Avondale, Hazel Park, and Oak Park School
Districts is producing thirty new science and mathematics secondary teachers who
will teach in high needs school upon certification. In addition to their
scholarships, Noyce Scholars are receiving funds to attend a regional
professional meeting and, upon certification, an opportunity to apply for mini-
grants to provide resources to upgrade STEM programs at their new schools. The
scholars are being mentored by exemplary teachers from partnering schools both
during their preparatory year at the University and during their early years as
a teacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
