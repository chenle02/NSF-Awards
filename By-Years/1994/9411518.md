9411518 Weaver This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the
Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at the University of Illinois to
purchase ultrasonic immersion scanning equipment, consisting of a scanning
bridge and tank, an x-y motor controller and manual z-axis and orientation
manipulators. The equipment will be used in two research projects dealing with
the exploration of the feasibility of ultrasonic diffuse field imaging of solid
mechanics materials with random microstructures and developing a cure monitoring
technique which can be integrated into automated control schemes for economical
manufacturing of polymer matrix composites. The equipment will also be used for
more conventional ultrasonic imaging as an aid to other research projects within
the Departments of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Applied Mechanics and
Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. ***
