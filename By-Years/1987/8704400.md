Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction in the
U.S. and the world. Reinforced masonry construction use is increasing in
moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent features of economy,
fire safety, architectural flexibility and ease of construction. This research
project is to partially sponsor the Fourth North American Masonry Conference.
The objective of the conference is to provide for the exchange of concepts,
research, information, and experiences in masonry construction. It will provide
a forum for nationally and internationally known experts to exchange ideas and
research. A technical dissemination document in the form of Conference
proceedings will be published. The principal investigator is highly qualified to
conduct this research. The institution provides excellent support facilities for
this twelve- month complete project.
