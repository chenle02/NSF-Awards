Professor Robinson is studying a mainstream area of biological research in order
to describe better the course of biology's development and to analyze the issues
involved in the workings of experimental science. In order to carry out this
research, he has selected case studies that represent experimental approaches to
determining the mechanisms responsible (i) for creating the asymmetric
distribution of Na+ and K+ between cells and their environments and (ii) for
linking the oxidation of nutrients to the production of ATP by the cell
mitochondria. These inquires converged in formulations of active transport
across biological membranes, and led to the recognition of ATP-utilizing enzymes
that create ion gradients, ATP-synthesizing enzymes that consume ion gradients,
and the role of both ATP and ion gradients as potential energy reservoirs for
driving cellular function. The case studies also represent the variety of
experimental origins and outcomes: theory-driven and serendipitous discovery,
falsification and immunity to falsification, corroboration, controversy,
consensus formation, and the attainment of conceptual unity through the
reductionist program. The goals of this project include drawing to the attention
of historians and philosophers of science such ordinary practice, and
illustrating to working scientists some practical and theoretical aspects of
their toils--including causes and consequences of success and failure in rival
research programs.
