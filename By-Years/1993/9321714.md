9321714 MUSCATINE This Faculty Research Fellowship in Marine Biotechnology will
permit the PI, Dr. Leonard Muscatine, to spend a total of 9 months (6 month
sabbatical and 3 month fellowship) in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Levine to
investigate the molecular biology of thermal stress in the symbiotic anemone,
Aiptasia pulchella. Ongoing research in Dr. Muscatine's laboratory is focussed,
in part, on the mechanism by which thermal stress destabilizes the symbiosis of
cnidarians and symbiotic dinoflagellates. The PI will learn protein and nucleic
acid techniques while investigating the nature of the proteins synthesized as a
consequence of both low and high temperature stress. This fellowship will
provide Dr. Muscatine, a world renowned expert in marine symbioses, the
opportunity to acquire the rapidly developing molecular biology tools he needs
to keep his research at the cutting edge. ***
