The objectives of this project include (a) development, testing, and
application of demand and supply models to project academic S/E personnel (both
faculty and non-faculty) over a 10-15 year period; and (b) development of a data
base which will facilitate timely analyses of issues related to the academic
sector. The models are to serve as an analytic tool for use by NSF staff to
conduct studies of potential personnel shortages in the academic sector, as well
as to address factors (e.g., demography, institutional practices, Federal
programs and policies) which can potentially affect this labor market. This
project represents part of an ongoing NSF program which includes not only the
conduct of surveys and special analytical studies to monitor S/E resources in
the academic sector, but also modeling activities targeted on the total S/E
labor market and S/E doctorates.
