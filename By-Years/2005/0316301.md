This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
supports research by Professor Jay Groves of Princeton University to discover
the basic principles of oxidative catalysis and to use these insights for the
invention of the next generation of catalysts. The proposal has four focus
areas: 1) structure-reactivity correlations among oxo- and peroxo-metal
complexes; 2) kinetics and mechanism of aliphatic hydroxylation by
oxometalloporphyrins, 3) oxygen transfer to halide ions and the oxidation of
water, and 4) anti-Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of olefins mediated by
rhodium porphyrins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unusual reactivity of
oxomanganese(V) porphyrin systems will be investigated in order to: 1) Elucidate
the electronic effects in reactivity by looking at periodic relationships, 2)
Determine the strength of the forming M=O---H bond, or, equivalently, the bond
dissociation energy of M(IV)O-H, 3) Determine why manganese behaves so much
differently from iron with the same ligand system in the same catalytic regime,
4) Determine quantitative free energy relationships and deduce relationships
between structure and reactivity, and 5) Determine whether these complexes can
oxidize halide ions and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical catalysis is
central to the economic health of the nation and the world with about 30% of the
GNP of the United States and at least 80% of the chemical industry dependent
oncatalytic processes. This research aims to discover the fundamental basis of a
number of types of oxidative catalysis and to train the personnel that are
necessary for the nation to achieve the technological advances offered by these
discoveries and to train the teachers of science for the future.&lt;br/&gt;
