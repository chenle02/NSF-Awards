9452682 Kent The Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) will initiate
an eight week, commuter and residential, Young Scholars Program in marine
science for 16 students entering grades 11 and 12. The core of the program is
the one-to-one research laboratory experience each student will have with a
highly trained scientist mentor. The students will have a one week training
session prior to working in the laboratory. After this training, the students
will have a weekly schedule which will include scientific seminars, field trips,
career awareness activities, lectures in molecular biology geared for their
level, and peer discussions of individual research projects.
