The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Oklahoma will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 32
investigators in five research clusters. The research clusters include: (1)
Multidisciplinary Approach to Molecular Analysis of Plant Biotic Stress; (2)
Surface Hydrology; (3) Rock-Fluid Interactions in Crustal Rocks; (4) Advanced
Materials for Photonics, Lasers, and Electro-optics (AMPLE); and (5) Laboratory
for Electronic Properties of Materials. The participating research universities,
Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and University of Tulsa, will
strengthen their research infrastructure during the present EPSCoR grant through
(1) an increase in faculty, (2) establishment of an endowed chair program, (3)
an investment in research of over $65 million during 1985-90 through Oklahoma
Center for Advancement of Science and Technology, (4) assistance in the
relocation of technology-sensitive industry to Oklahoma, (5) establishment of
three Centers of Excellence and (6) special programs to increase research
competitiveness of faculty. The State and institutions will contribute over $2.6
million in support of the EPSCoR effort.
