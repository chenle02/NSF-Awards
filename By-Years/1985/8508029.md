Classical mechanism theory focused first on the analysis and synthesis of planar
(2-D) mechanisms, and more recently on the analysis and synthesis of spatial
(3-D) mechanisms. This research project seeks to extend 3-D analysis and
synthesis methods to higher-order joints (which may be viewed as combinations of
simple joints), and to embed the methods in CAD systems useable by mechanical
designers without advanced training in mechanism synthesis. The research is
focused on obtaining exact closed-form analytical solutions for the equations of
motion (rather than computed approximate solutions), and on dimensional rather
than form synthesis. (Dimensional synthesis seeks viable positions and lengths
for a prescribed collection of joints and links; form synthesis treats
alternative collections of joints and links).
