With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Paul Portner and Raffaella
Zanuttini will conduct two years of research on clause types in human language.
This research seeks to understand what gives a sentence a particular function,
for example that of asking a question, making a statement, or giving an order.
In particular, the project aims to answer two questions: (1) To what extent can
a sentence's function be read off of its grammatical form? (2) What range of
functions are mapped to particular grammatical forms in the languages of the
world? The study will focus on two languages, Korean and Badiotto (a Romance
variety spoken in northern Italy). The data for this project will come from
several sources: fieldwork, questionnaires, elicited production data, and
grammaticality judgments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significance for
several scientific fields that pertain to language (e.g. computational
linguistics, psycholinguistics, and language acquisition). The results of this
research will fill a major gap in our understanding of language, both in terms
of the grammars of particular languages and of language universals.
Additionally, there are benefits to documenting and studying Badiotto and
Korean: Badiotto is an endangered language variety. Korean is one of the world's
major languages, and yet its particles and clause types are not well studied.
Finally, this project will train young scholars in the analysis and description
of lesser-known languages, a skill of importance in educational institutions,
government agencies concerned with intelligence and defense, and the
computational linguistics industry.&lt;br/&gt;
