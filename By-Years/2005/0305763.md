The recognition of drawbacks of traditional cache hierarchies, especially for
irregular applications, has led to the emergence of a new breed of processors
that allow the cache hierarchy to be directly manipulated at the application
level. Based on the knowledge of the application's data access behavior,
"intelligent" programming can lead to dramatic performance improvements.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore a new approach towards
performance programming for advanced cache architectures, based on explicit
memory hierarchy management at the application level. Our research will focus
on: (i) Definition of a generalized model for split spatial/temporal caches and
explicit cache control. This model will abstract available architecture features
from a programmer's perspective. A high-level simulator based on this model will
be implemented. (ii) Develop cache cognizant algorithms for regular and
irregular application kernels. The kernels will be optimized to exploit spatial
and temporal cache structures, data prefetch, and other features abstracted in
the model. Performance improvements will be validated through low-level
simulations and experiments on real architecture platforms such as Intel IA-64
and Sun UltraSPARC III Cu. (iii) Create a mathematical foundation for compile-
time data placement in main memory to minimize cache misses at run time, using
on Perfect Latin Squares (PLS) to reduce cache conflicts. (iv) Use the above
techniques to optimize performance of algorithms used for database storage and
access (search), tree traversal, unstructured mesh computations, and graph
problems. We envision that our research will complement the ongoing advances in
cache architectures and lead to the creation of a new computation model for
programming the next generation of general-purpose
processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
