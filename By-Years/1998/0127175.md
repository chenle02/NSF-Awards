Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Our work is the adaptation of teaching
methods developed in "Development of an Interdisciplinary Curriculum in
Electronic Materials and Devices: Cooking Without Recipes" (NSF award # DUE -
9551520). Our curriculum has been developed to help undergraduate students who
are interested in careers as processing engineers in microelectronics and
related industries. This project helps students develop an in-depth
understanding of the underlying physical and chemical principles in unit
processes commonly used in microelectronics. These unit operations include
plasma etching, chemical vapor deposition, spin coating, and chemical mechanical
polishing. In addition we are introducing students to advance diagnostics tools
which has helped us design more advanced microelectronics
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have also developed a curriculum that
enables our students to acquire much needed "soft skills". These are necessary
if our students are to succeed in their professional careers. These soft skills
include technical writing, oral presentation, safety awareness, and
teambuilding. We have extended our audience to include high school students who
have participated in summer programs. Through these summer programs we are
hoping to recruit underrepresented students into science and engineering
careers.
