The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS) seeks "to understand the
processes governing the production and fate of biogenic material in the sea well
enough to predict their influences on, and responses to global scale
perturbations." The program proposes to do this by "identifying and quantifying
the physical, chemical and biological processes controlling biogeochemical
cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with the global atmosphere." The
implicit assumption of this strategy for achieving a predictive capability is
that the process and interactions quantified today respond linearly to global
scale perturbations and that knowledge of the present biogeochemical system
dynamics will, therefore, allow one to predict response to global perturbations
with accuracy. This is a fundamental assumption and is the keystone of the JGOFS
strategy for predictive capability. The scientific justification for this
assumption has never been stated and is the purpose of this research.
