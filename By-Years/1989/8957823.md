There is a critical need for computer aided design (CAD) methods for assisting
designers to apply human factors principles during the early stages of product
design. Attaining this objective requires progress in determining (1) how to
obtain and efficiently organize within a computer the diverse types of knowledge
relevant to design problems and; (2) how to best apply these diverse types of
knowledge early in the design cycle using computer aided methods. This research
will be concentrated over the next year on further development of a modeling
approach as a foundation for computer aided design. This will require
significant synthesis of principles from the fields of safety engineering,
artificial intelligence, decision analysis, and human factors. This research
effort will be a computer knowledge structure useful for organizing and applying
human factors knowledge to design problems.
