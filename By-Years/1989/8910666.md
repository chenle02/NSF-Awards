Studies of hearing often rely on measuring responses in single neurons to pure
tones, which are relatively simple stimuli. But naturally occurring sounds often
are very complex, both in their frequency spectrum and their temporal pattern.
This project, under the Research Opportunities for Women, will provide a
planning grant to use a novel stimulus technique to explore the central auditory
responses. Stimuli with rich spectra are used to elicit spiking activity in
neurons, and the probability of spiking is correlated with excitatory or
inhibitory inputs to that cell. This probing technique will be used on a major
center for auditory processing, the cochlear nucleus, during development.
Results will form the basis for research aimed at a more complete
characterization of neuron responses in the cochlear nucleus, including how
those responses develop from connections that become established.
