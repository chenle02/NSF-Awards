This research initiation grant in engineering education project seeks to answer
the question of how technology impacts learning in engineering classrooms. While
technology is often assumed to lead to increased learning, it can be expensive
for institutions and/or students and thus research is needed to help determine
when such investment is most valuable. The collaboration between engineering
faculty and psychology researchers this award supports will help to determine
whether it is the technology that impacts learning, or other factors that may be
replicable at lower cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and
importance of this project will be to investigate how technology impacts a
classroom culture, thus informing decisions by universities whether investments
in technology are wise for given learning outcomes. The project specifically
focuses on women and disabled students who are under-represented in engineering.
This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers
through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and
expertise. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by
creating results and research that are useful for society by informing
educational policy and practices.
