9413803 Chao Three research projects are supported by this research
infrastructure award: (1) ``A Multicast Output Buffered ATM Switch'', (2)
``Priority Queue Management for ATM Switches'', and (3) ``An Experimental ATM
LAN Testbed''. These projects involve VLSI chip design, switch fabric and
congestion control device prototyping, theoretical analysis, computer
simulations, and experiments on a high-speed ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
network testbed. In the first project, we plan to prototype a 32x32 ATM switch
fabric based on our proposed MOBAS (Multicast Output Buffered ATM Switch)
architecture in order to demonstrate the capability of growing the prototyped
switch to a large switch (e.g., with several hundred input and output ports). We
will design and fabricate two application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
chips using the advanced CMOS 0.8-micron technology (available from the NSF
funded MOSIS). In the second project, we will first investigate the performance
and implementation complexity of several different queue management control
schemes that combine the priority cell discarding and the priority cell
departing schemes. We will then implement one of the queue management schemes
and integrate with the ATM switch. In the third project, we plan to deploy an
experimental ATM local area network (LAN) in Polytechnic University. The ATM LAN
will be connected to a wide-area network, called NYNET, through a SONET OC-3
optical link (155.52 Mbit/s), for conducting various experiments such as B-ISDN
service applications, distributed processing, system performance measurement,
congestion/flow control, and network management. ***
