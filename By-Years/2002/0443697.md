Project Abstract SES 0443697 Annette Palmer, Morgan State University "Computer
Literacy, Technology, Society and Human Values

A faculty study project for five faculty at Morgan State University who will
work together during a one-week seminar in Summer 2004, and in weekly meetings
during the fall semester, in the study of the history of science and technology
and in the study of ethical limitations in the development and applications of
technology and science in modern society. In January, 2005, this group of
scholars will develop course designs to pioneer an interdisciplinary course,
Computer Literacy, Technology, Society, and Human Values. This course will
enable students to demonstrate integrated knowledge of problem-solving
techniques in the basic concepts and principles of ecological, personal, and
social issues related to modern inventions.
