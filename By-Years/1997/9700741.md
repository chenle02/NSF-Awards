EEC-9700741 Salam Abstract This award provides funding to Michigan State
University under the direction of Dr. Faithi Salam, for the support of a
Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Real-time Sensing
and Control Computing for Automotive Systems." This project proposes to bring
research results in the area of real time sensing and control systems into the
design of a two semester senior level capstone course which will integrate
electrical engineering and mechanical engineering curricula. This curricula
development effort will involve a collaborative effort of several universities
and industrial sponsors from the Big Three automotive producers and other major
automotive suppliers. The proposed class format will simulate a micro-industrial
research environment where industry partners and others would select the
automotive systems and theme for the year and faculty and industrial sponsors
would work with the students on projects which would give them a hands-on feel
of a high tech environment while generating new knowledge which feeds back into
research on real-time sensing and control.
