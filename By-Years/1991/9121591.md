This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will enable the participation of
U.S. chemists in the XII International Conference on Phosphorus Chemistry which
is being held in Toulouse, France, July 6-10, 1992. Phosphorus chemistry
includes a plethora of exciting areas of research. The organization of the
Conference will allow for discussion of a broad range of themes including the
synthesis of organic phosphorus compounds, the chemistry of phosphorus compounds
with unusual coordination and bonding characteristics, the chemistry of
coordination compounds involving directly bound phosphorus ligands, the
biochemistry of organophosphorus compounds, the chemistry of phosphates,
physical methods and theoretical chemistry as applied to phosphorus, and new
polymeric materials containing phosphorus. The Conference affords a unique
opportunity for U.S. Chemists, including young investigators, to interact with
their counterparts from around the world for an intense interchange of knowledge
and to prepare the foundation for long term international collaborations. %%%
