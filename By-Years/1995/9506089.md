9506089 Rothman This proposal will investigate the molecular processes required
for establishment of a complete organ, the intestine, during embryogenesis of
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This organ is clonally derived from a
single, exclusive progenitor called the E cell, in the seven cell embryo and
constitutes the entire endoderm. A genomic region required zygotically to
produce the intestine has been identified in a screen of genetic deficiencies
(deletions). The relevant locus, referred to as the end-1 gene, was localized to
a DNA fragment that rescues the gut differentiation defect of the deficiencies
and of a putative point mutant. The end-1 gene will be expressed ectopically to
assess whether it is sufficient to promote intestinal differentiation from non-
intestinal precursor cells. Gene fusion constructs and antibody to the end-1
product will be made to characterize when and where the gene is expressed during
embryogenesis and where its product is localized within cells. Interactions
between end-1 and maternal genes required for normal specification of the
intestine will be examined by characterizing double mutants and analyzing
expression of end-1 in maternal mutants. These studies will assist in
understanding the molecular function of the end-1 gene product in specifying an
entire organ, the intestine, thereby elucidating molecular processes that
specify the identity of a single organ and a single germ layer during animal
development. ***
