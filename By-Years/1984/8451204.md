This research investigates the physical processes involved in the quasistatic
and dynamic fracture of ductile solids, primarily structural steels.
Specifically, the effects of inertia, plasticity, and rate sensitivity will be
studied through experiments and analytical modeling. The strong effect of
plasticity and dynamic loading, and their interaction, makes such problems
particularly important in the establishment of the necessary design procedures
to be used to avoid failure by fracture. Analytical models will be developed for
crack initiation and growth in highly ductile solids, and predictions of these
models will be compared with experimental observations. The research also
involves the development of optical techniques to provide direct information
about the structure of the near-crack tip strain and displacement fields.
