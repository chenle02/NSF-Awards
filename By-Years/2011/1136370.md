This travel grant supports students who are near graduation, or have recently
graduated, to take part in a doctoral consortium at the 2011 IEEE Conference on
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). The doctoral consortium
highlights the work of these up and coming researchers, and pairs each student
with a senior member of the computer vision community who serves as their
mentor. The mentorship process provides each student with valuable feedback on
their research, as well as meaningful career advice as the students move on to
the next phase of their professional development. The doctoral consortium event
aims to have representation from a diverse group of participants (in terms of
gender, ethnic background, academic institution and geographic location). The
travel grant ensures participation from a broad range of institutions across the
country and gives visibility to a diverse population of students.
