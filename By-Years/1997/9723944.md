Harrison 9723944 The coordinated proliferation and differentiation of distinct
cell types is critical to the proper development and maintenance of any
multicellular organism. For this coordination to occur, cells must have a means
to communicate with one another. The broad long-term objectives of this research
are to elucidate mechanisms of cell-cell signaling and to understand how
different signals are interpreted to regulate developmental events. Toward these
goals, the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway will be studied in Drosophila
melanogaster. This system will be used because it is developmentally important,
relatively simple, and is conserved between flies and mammals. In mammals, the
pathway is know to be comprised of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and
the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). In flies, one
JAK (hopscotch) and one STAT (marelle) gene have been recently identified. The
genetic and developmental manipulations available in Drosophila make it an ideal
model system to further study JAK/STAT signaling. These approaches will
complement and extend the biochemical analyses of the pathway conducted in
mammalian cells. Mutational analysis has already uncovered a new component of
JAK/STAT signaling in Drosophila, unpaired (upd). An understanding of the
involvement of upd in JAK signaling is central to the research proposed here.
Other molecules integral to the JAK pathway, or that strongly interact with
components of the pathway, will be identified and characterized using the
genetic tools available in Drosophila. The specific goals of this research are
to: 1) Characterize the unpaired locus at the molecular level 2) Determine the
functions of the Upd product in JAK signaling 3) Characterize the roles of Upd
function in Drosophila development 4) Identify other components of and factors
interacting with the JAK pathway
