9723608 Hooper NH2OH is oxidized (NH2OH + H2O -&gt; HNO2 + 4e- + 4H+) by the
enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, "HAO", the most complex hemoprotein known,
which contains 7 c-hemes and 1 substrate-binding heme P460 per 63 kDa subunit.
The latter is a novel tyrosine-derivatized c-heme. At least two pairs of the
hemes interact electronically and one of the pairs forms the active site. A
second hydroxylamine-oxidizing enzyme, "cytochrome P460", has one metal center
which is a lysine-derivatized c-heme and it, together with a cytochrome P-460
from M.capsulatus, will be studied. A crystal structure for HAO has recently
appeared which allows one to propose and test distinct catalytic mechanisms
involving Fe-N or C-N intermediates, identify and probe important prosthetic
groups and amino acids in the active site, and investigate structural elements
responsible for the magnetic interactions previously observed between metal
centers. The focus of this project is on HAO and cytochromes P460. Approaches
include peptide analysis, DNA and protein sequencing, kinetics, suicide
substrates, potentiometry, Optical-, EPR-, Mossbauer-, resonance Raman-, and
ENDOR- spectroscopies and X-ray crystallographic analysis. In soils,
Nitrosomonas helps oxidize ammonia to the form of nitrogen needed by crops. In
flooded soils fertilizer nitrogen can also be lost by conversion by Nitrosomonas
to the gas, nitrous oxide (N20), a greenhouse gas and a catalyst of ozone
destruction. The process studied here is also the limiting step in the removal
of ammonia in waste water treatment. Finally, Nitrosomonas will also catalyze
degradation of many chlorinated pollutants. An understanding of the biochemistry
of the organism involved could lead to more efficient use of fertilizer-
nitrogen, decreased production of nitrous oxide, improvements in the waste water
treatment, and improved on-site bioremediation of contaminated soils.
