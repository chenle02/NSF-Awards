This award will support travel to the 12th International Conference on
Distributed Computing Systems to be held in Yokohama, Japan June 9-12, 1992.
Without this funding it is unlikely that there will be as significant a US
presence at the conference. This funding will enable 12 young researchers in
this field to attend the conference. A special subcommittee will decide who will
be funded to attend the conference. Also since only partial funding is
requested, the participants who are chosen will still have to provide
substantial funding of their own in order to attend the conference.
