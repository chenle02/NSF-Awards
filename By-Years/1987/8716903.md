This is a one year renewal of a large three year interdisciplinary field study
of the Chesapeake Bay and adjoining coastal area. During the initial funding
period, four scientific cruises in this study area collected a wealth of data on
the nutrient recycling and microbiology of this coupled estuarine - coastal
system. This work offers the most detailed picture yet of the role of marine
bacteria and phytoplankton in the assimilative capacity of coastal region
impacted by large population centers. This renewal will allow the collaborative
scientists to add additional results to their existing base, and produce
scientific publications integrating this novel collection of measurements in the
coastal environment.
