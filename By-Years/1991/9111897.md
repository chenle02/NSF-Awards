Funding is provided to: (1) Upgrade an existing molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
system by adding two new furnaces and an in-situ cleaver which will allow
regrowth on the cleaved edge of GaAs/A1GaAs heterostructure thin films. (2) Add
a pattern generator to an existing electron microscope so that we can do
electron-beam lithography. These upgrades will enhance our capability to
fabricate GaAs/A1GaAs structures and devices with novel electrical and optical
properties.
