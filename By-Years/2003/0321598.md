This SBIR Phase II project will develop a planetarium system based on a new
computerized digital projector. Learning Technologies Inc. will make use of
recent developments in new micro mirror devices and simulation software. The
proposed planetarium system will be capable of projecting an accurate, simulated
night sky with the capacity for a multitude of motions and displays and
dynamically changing information displays of the earth, including plate
tectonics, weather patterns, and biological distributions. The small size of the
projector with supporting laptop computer and inflatable dome will allow the
units to be shared within school systems and loaned out by museums and
educational cooperatives. Standardization will encourage adept teachers and
planetarium educators to distribute their programs and activities. Integrated
help screens and tutorials will aid in supporting teachers who wish to learn how
to master this equipment. The new system will build on the firm's portable
planetarium systems, which are now used by an estimated 5% of the school age
children in the U.S.

A small digital-projection planetarium system will expand the market for small
planetariums to teachers interested in earth science and multidisciplinary
topics, geology, volcanism, meteorology, oceanography, and biological population
studies. In addition, the connections between science and the humanities can be
illustrated by coupling the historical age of exploration with the science of
celestial navigation. For schools with limited resources, the system's
portability will facilitate shared use. Such a system will have a broad impact
on the teaching of astronomy and earth science. It will use the latest
astronomical and Geographic Information System (GIS) data, and it will aid in
teaching the content of the national standards, especially earth science at the
elementary and middle school level. Professionally produced interactive shows
can be a new venue for astronomers and earth scientists to inform large numbers
of students of their results and of the nature of the scientific enterprise.
