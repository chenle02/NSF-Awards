This research will investigate the usefulness of applying heuristic search
algorithms, an important class of artificial intelligence problem solving
techniques, to solve various types of Markov decision processes. The aim of the
research is to enhance the tractability of these models of sequential decision
making under uncertainty. It is anticipated that the research will produce
needed extensions of a wide class of heuristic search algorithms as well as
suggesting potential areas for integrating concepts in heuristic search with
concepts associated with stochastic control and the decision sciences.
