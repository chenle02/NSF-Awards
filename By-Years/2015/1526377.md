A key property of modern day network environments such as the Internet is the
possibility of multiple processes running simultaneously, concurrently and
unaware of each other. However, the same property also allows an attacker for a
coordinated attack in which an adversary controls many parties, interleaving the
executions of the various protocol instances and creating rogue interactions
between protocols. With changing network environments and new-emerging paradigms
such as cloud computing, we need to assess the threat model in order to capture
a broader class of attacks. This research project identifies strong notions of
security to capture previously unforeseen threats and the intrinsic
cryptographic complexity of constructing protocols that are secure against such
threats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on a strong form of
corruption model referred to as adaptive corruption, which considers an
adversary that can hijack a host anytime during the course of computation. This
models hacking attacks where an external attacker breaks into parties' machines
in the midst of a protocol execution, and captures additional threats. This
research identifies the minimal cryptographic assumptions to design protocols
that are secure against adaptive corruption in the concurrent setting with and
without setup. The research focuses on black-box construction wherever possible
and relies on non-black-box constructions as a stepping stone towards
establishing feasibility. The project bridges the gap between theory and
practice, by creating a wiki that will enable a web-based interaction to
retrieve relevant information regarding current techniques for cryptographic
constructions and security notions associated with these constructions.
