9408749 Latanision Many glassy and crystalline solids produced by rapid
solidification processing have remarkable mechanical, magnetic, and electrical
properties and, accordingly, great potential commercial utility. Without
chemical stability in the environments to which these alloys may be exposed
while in service, however, their unusual properties may be lost. Some metallic
glasses are more inert compared to conventionally processed alloys. The
objective of the current research is to examine the corrosion resistance of such
alloys and to develop a fundamental basis for understanding their behavior.
Corrosion behavior of the neodymium-iron-boron alloy system is explored in
alkaline environments. Its susceptibility to hydrogen damage is examined when
coupled to zinc in neutral sulfates and chlorides. Transmission electron
microscopy foils are employed to study preferential dissolution in this system.
Results of the research should provide information for improving the corrosion
resistance of these magnetically interesting rapidly-solidified alloys without
compromising their magnetic properties. %%% This corrosion research program will
provide information for the protection of rapidly solidified alloys which have
industrially useful magnetic properties, but lack chemical stability at service
environments. ***
