This engineering education research initiation grant will investigate the impact
of project and problem based learning techniques on student performance in
engineering statics, a course that serves as a "gateway" to engineering degree
programs at most universities. The study will rigorously investigate the effects
on learning and motivation using sample and control groups drawing on expertise
from both engineering and learning sciences.

The broader significance and importance of this project is that by understanding
the impact of these teaching methods on students in large, introductory
engineering courses it may be possible to improve student performance at the
large number of engineering schools that offer similar courses. The proposal
includes a plan to develop a strong research partnership. This project overlaps
with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of
an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by creating results and research that
are useful for society by informing educational policy and practices.
