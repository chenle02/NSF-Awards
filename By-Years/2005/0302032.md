The MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (MPS-DRF)
enables U.S. scientists to conduct research abroad. This allows the awardees the
opportunity for collaborative research benefiting from expertise, facilities and
interactions in a non-U.S. institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will
support a 12 month research fellowship for Dr. Collin D. Wick to work with Prof.
Doros Theodorou and his groups at the Laboratory of Computational Materials
Science and Engineering at the National Technical Laboratory of Athens, and the
Molecular Modeling of Materials Laboratory at the National Centre for Scientific
Research (NRCPS) "Demokritos".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will use
computational simulation techniques (so called Monte Carlo calculations) to
explore the design of low cost polymer surfactants in supercritical carbon
dioxide. The goal is to gain a microscopic understanding of solubility
mechanisms in more environmentally benign solvents, such as carbon
dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Doros Theodorou is a leading authority in
the field of modeling polymer systems. His lab has developed methodology which
will assist Dr. Wick to carry out the proposed work effectively.&lt;br/&gt;
