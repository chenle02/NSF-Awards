This project focuses on three problem areas in the theory of computational
complexity. The first part aims at showing that in the context of computations
which operate in limited work space, the use of randomness does not
significantly increase computational power, with the goal of increasing our
overall knowledge about the role of randomness as a tool in computation. The
second part aims at ascertaining the computational limitations of small boolean
circuits, with the goal of better understanding the aspects of computational
problems that require more computational resources. The last part aims at
improving the best known algorithms for exact solution of the fundamental graph
coloring problem, with the larger goal of developing tools that may be more
broadly applicable to speeding up wider classes of hard computational
problems.***
