This grant will fund studies of the performance of a proposed space telescope
which if built will study high energy gamma rays. The results of the studies
will help ensure that the telescope will be able to achieve its design goals.
The work will study specific types of events that the telescope could search for
and establish the feasibility of the proposed measurements. If built, the
telescope will search for such processes as gamma ray production from
evaporating black holes.
