Knowledge commons refer to the institutionalized community governance of
sharing, creating, and curating a wide range of intellectual and cultural
resources. This project will establish a Research Coordination Network (RCN)
designed to build a research community that will advance these scientific
principles. In doing so it will aid in the development of empirical and
theoretical insights into commons governance of shared knowledge, information,
and data resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RCN will assemble researchers from
law, the social and behavioral sciences, computer science, and engineering to
communicate, coordinate and integrate their research and educational activities
across disciplinary and organizational boundaries. Convergence is critical to
cross-disciplinary and cross-contextual learning and generalization across
disciplines, sectors, cultures, and contexts. The project will facilitate a
series of focused working conferences, each organized around a specific subject
matter, as well as a convergence conference. The RCN will include convergence of
field-building, support of research infrastructure, and dissemination of
research knowledge to the public through open access
formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
