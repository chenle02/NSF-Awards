An "Illinois-Indiana symplectic geometry conference" will take place in the
spring and then fall of 2008 and 2009 at IUPUI, Notre Dame, Purdue and UIUC
universities respectively. The conferences will be short, held over a weekend,
and typically include around six invited lectures. These lectures will generally
reflect the interests and research plans of symplectic topologists, and their
collaborators, in Illinois and Indiana. In particular, lecture topics will
include, but not be limited to, the following branches of symplectic topology:
the theory of holomorphic curves and Gromov-Witten theory; Floer homology and
Fukaya categories; the theory of Leftschetz fibrations; three-dimensional
contact topology; contact homology and symplectic field theory; dynamics of
Hamiltonian flows; applications to low dimensional topology via Seiberg-Witten
and Heegard-Floer theory. The meetings will become centers of discussion and
research communication in the region.

Over the past twenty years symplectic topology has evolved from an undoubtedly
fundamental yet prohibitively intractable field into one of the most popular and
exciting areas of mathematical research, producing a constant stream of deeply
original and inspiring results. Its origins lie in classical and quantum
mechanics but the subject is now closely tied to many areas of mathematics and
theoretical physics, not least complex analysis, smooth topology, partial
differential equations and mirror symmetry.This development has been recognized
by major math departments which have recruited symplectic topologists. Now even
relatively small geographical areas, such as the regions of Illinois and Indiana
to the south and east of Chicago, are home to several healthy groups of
researchers. This proposal exploits this circumstance with a regular conference.
The meetings will bring together active researchers, graduate students and
interested people from other disciplines for a weekend of discussion and
collaboration centered around lectures from invited leaders in the field. The
project will foster interaction amongst symplectic geometers in the region and
stimulate new ideas and research.
