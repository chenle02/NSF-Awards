Polymeric membranes are now used worldwide to perform energy-efficient, low-
cost separation of liquid and gas process streams. Design engineers routinely
conside membrane-based unit operations as viable alternatives to conventional
separation technologies. However, the inability of polymeric membranes to
withstand high-temperatures or chemically harsh environments deprives many
industries of the key advantages of membrane technology. Currently available
polymeric membranes are now used in some of these harsh settings, but their
characteristic cost- and energy-efficiencies are offset by the need for
expensive pretreatment of chemically destructive process streams or by the need
to drastically cool hot feed streams. For most processes, such pretreatment is
impractical or altogether impossible. Moreover, non-polymeric membranes (e.g.
ceramic) currently available are too expensive, difficult to modularize, and/or
prone to irreversible fouling. This project will investigate the feasibility of
using a group of robust polymers to prepare membranes capable of withstanding up
to 300 degrees centigrade in chemically challenging operations. In Phase I of
the project, appropriate polymers will be evaluated and screened for diffusion
properties to various gases and liquids. One or more will be selected for
further study in Phase II, where membranes based on these polymers will be
developed and optimized. Polymeric membranes are now used worldwide to perform
