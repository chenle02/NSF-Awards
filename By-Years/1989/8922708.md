This award provides funds for the improvement of techniques used in the
preparation of crystals of single proteins for subsequent analysis by X-ray
diffraction. The award will permit systematic studies of the growth of crystals
of several well defined and widely available proteins by one of the leaders in
this field. The data from these studies are expected to serve as an excellent
reference for other investigators who wish to standardize and perfect their own
technique. In recent years, X-ray crystallography has assumed a central role in
the structural and functional analysis of enzymes and other proteins. Much of
the progress in this area has been due to progress in the collection and
analysis of the diffraction data; although there has been some progress in
understanding the process of protein crystal growth, difficulty in growing
crystals of sufficient size and quality remains a significant stumbling block in
the analysis of most proteins. The kinds of studies to be undertaken by the
awardee should help to make this aspect of structural studies more routine and
thus to facilitate the analysis of many new proteins.
