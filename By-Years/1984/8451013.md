This research deals with the study of biopolymer structure, function, and
properties as they relate to biochemical engineering principles and operations.
Biopolymers include proteins, polynucleic acids, and polysaccharides. The first
two groups generally contain structural units with ionizable moieties and are
therefore polyelectrolytes. Some polysaccharides are also polyelectrolytes, but
most (cellulose, starch, and dextrans) are not charged near neutral pH. The
initial phases of the directed research plan of study involves examination of
these uncharged biopolymers after the "base cases" are established. Future
studies will examine polyelectrolytes.
