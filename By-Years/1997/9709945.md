This research proposal is an integral component of the international North
Water (NOW) polynya project, a Canadian led effort to characterize the open-
water ecosystem in the northern portion of ice-covered Baffin Bay. The region is
of significant geopolitical interest due to commercial fisheries, shipping
access to the Arctic, and to the native Inuit people who depend upon the
extraordinary biological production in the NOW for their livelihood. Of parallel
scientific interest is the fate of pelagic primary production exported from the
system: i.e., whether sinking particulate materials remain available to support
higher trophic levels or are recycled microbially at depth. This research is
designed to test the hypothesis that cold temperature limits midwater microbial
activities; it also examines specific enzymatic responses as predictive
indicators of the autotrophic versus heterotrophic nature of the overlying
ecosystem, within the context of the flow field. The PIs will test these and
other questions by deploying a combination of particle sensors and collectors
throughout NOW in the summers of 1997 and 19998. These will include long-term
sediment traps secured to current-meter moorings, transmissometry measurements,
in situ camera assessments of large-particles, and shipboard settling-column
collections.
