9302267 George This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award will support
US participation in an International Workshop on Hierarchical Modeling, to be
held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August 1993. The US organizer is Edward
George of the University of Texas at Austin, and the Brazilian organizer is Dani
Gamerman of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The Workshop aims to bring
together leading international researchers who are active in hierarchical
modeling research. The symposium's primary objectives are to facilitate the
exchange of recent research developments and to establish collaborative ties
that will channel efforts toward pending problems and open new directions for
investigation. The organizers also hope to further crystallize hierarchical
modeling as an established area for statistical research. Eleven senior and
seven junior US participants--including four women--will be supported through
this award. The proceedings will be disseminated via papers and a comprehensive
final report. All sides are expected to benefit from the exchange of information
and development of future research ties. ***
