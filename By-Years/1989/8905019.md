In aquatic crabs, maintenance of salt balance and excretion of waste in the
form of ammonia, are performed by the gills. For those crabs which have taken to
living on land, it was assumed that the gills could not serve these functions.
Previously it was shown that, although no longer swimming in fluids, land crabs
are able to provide sufficient salty water to the gill surface, in the form of
their own urine, to allow excellent regulation of salt concentration, a
prerequisite for life in a variable habitat. Besides salt balance, nitrogen
excretion presents a hurdle to successful colonization of land. Proposed
research examines whether urine recycling also promotes excretion of nitrogen
wastes by the gill. The amount and form of nitrogen excreted by the possible
routes--urine, feces, fluid in the gill chamber, stored internally as uric acid,
and air will be measured to locate the routes used by crabs to get rid of
nitrogenous wastes. The amount and salinity of the water available to the
animals will be varied, since this appears to affect the amount and form of the
wastes released. A backpack has been developed which allows the collection of
urine directly from its point of release and substitution for urine solutions of
known composition. The composition of urine under different conditions of salt
and water availability will be studied, and carbon dioxide and ammonia levels
measured in the natural habitat. The ability of the gills to reclaim salts and
excrete wastes under the changing environmental conditions will also be
examined. This research will contribute to a basic understanding of the
physiology of land crabs, and their ability to adapt an essentially aquatic body
plan and physiology to a terrestrial environment. In addition, land crabs are
economically important in the Caribbean. They grow slowly and are subject to
local extinction from overharvesting. Low nitrogen levels in the plant diet
limit growth rates. The current research will result in a better understanding
of the nitrogen budget of the crabs, information which is vital to the success
of proposed crab farming.
