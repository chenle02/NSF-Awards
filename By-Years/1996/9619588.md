Concurrency control and recovery are essential components of transaction
systems. Whereas much research has gone into concurrency, resulting in a wealth
of results integrated into a fairly mature theory, recovery has remained limited
to mostly implementation-specific knowledge. This is undesirable for technical
and economic reasons: lack of a model of recovery precludes meaningful
comparisons between alternatives, in terms of their cost and functionality, and
forces the reinvention of basic abstractions and the adoption of ad-hoc
approaches. Motivated by these inadequacies and by the need to support recovery
for applications such as information retrieval, workflows, and mobile computing
this project is developing means for specifying the recovery requirements of an
application, identifying the recovery abstractions and protocols needed to
realize complex recovery requirements, working toward the modular construction
of recovery based on standard abstractions and protocols, developing ways to
demonstrate the correctness of this construction, and enumerating the tradeoffs
involved in implementing given recovery requirements. All of these facilitate
the adjustment of recovery to changing infrastructure support and application
requirements. In sum, this project aims to enable the crafting of efficient and
correct recovery, in the conventional and advanced transaction realms, thereby
influencing the way emerging database applications can be supported.
