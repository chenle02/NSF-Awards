This award provides partial support for a week-long conference of U.S. Embassy
Environment Science and Technology Officers in Washington in late September or
early October this year. The Environment, Science and Technology
Counselors/Attaches are key parts of Embassy country teams. They work in support
of USG interests as the focal points in Embassies on topics including
environmental, space, health, energy, nuclear non-proliferation, economic
competitiveness, oceans, population and other issues. They advise Ambassadors
and report and make representations on these issues. These officers also conduct
and manage bilateral science and technology agreements. OES has held such
conferences not only in updating the Embassy representatives on current
developments, but in providing Washington officers an opportunity to debrief
them directly. The conferences have also enlisted much attention and
participation from the Congress and technical agencies. The conference presents
an important opportunity both for NSF staff to consult directly with many of the
officers with whom they deal and for the Science Officers to improve their
understanding of NSF concerns and priorities.
