With the support of the Physical Chemistry Program the Principal Investigator
will undertake a comprehensive theoretical study of main group organometallic
chemistry, with an emphasis on silicon and the other elements in its group in
the periodic table. A thorough understanding of the electronic structures and
chemical bonding of these elements is of both fundamental and practical
importance. These elements constitute the backbones of industrially important
polymers, such as the silicones, and are the basic substrates of electronic
chips. State-of-the-art electronic structure theory, interfaced with quantum and
semi-classical dynamics studies for the prediction of reaction dynamics and
mechanisms, will be used. Areas to be investigated include analysis of
fundamental reaction mechanisms, such as the hydrosilation, coupling and
rearrangement reactions. Other reaction types to be considered include those
between silicon-containing compounds and atomic and molecular oxygen, reactions
of importance in chemical vapor deposition, SN2 reactions at silicon centers,
and the role of pseudorotation in the pentacoordinated reactive intermediates,
unimolecular decompositions of silanes, reactions of divalent group IV species,
and reactions of small cations and anions. The molecular and electronic
structures, properties and reactivity of highly strained rings will be
investigated also, as will the nature of a variety of unusual bonding
arrangements. Initial investigations of structure and reactivity will be
undertaken for biologically active compounds which contain main group metals and
small clusters of main group metals. Theoretical investigations will include the
development of extended basis sets for fourth and fifth period elements,
continued explorations of techniques for interfacing electronic structure and
dynamics calculations, and the development of methods for interfacing ab initio
and semi- empirical calculations.
