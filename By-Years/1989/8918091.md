This is an award to support research on the interactions of chromium species in
water solution with reducing substances. Principal focus of this project is on
reducing effects of naturally occurring, organic compounds. The research will
also consider effects of hydrogen-ion concentration, dissolved oxygen, iron,
manganese and other naturally occurring reductive substances. The goal of this
project is to understand and predict changes in chromium speciation and mobility
in aquatic environments. Project objectives include determination of reaction
rates and mechanisms for reduction of chromates by low-molecular weight reducing
substances for guidance in subsequent work with natural organic compounds that
may be found in soils and in surface water sediments that have been contaminated
by chromium compounds. Chromium compounds are used industrially, for the tanning
of leather, metal finishing, pulp and wood processing. A better understanding
than now exists for the processes that affect transformations of chromium in the
environment and which affect its mobility in groundwater are likely to be
applied in engineering design of systems for management of chromium-containing
wastes and to deal with the contamination of groundwater from existing deposits
of chromium wastes.
