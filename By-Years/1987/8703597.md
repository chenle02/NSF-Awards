Polydimethylsiloxanes of narrow molecular-weight distribution and with primary
and secondary amine end groups will be prepared by initiating the anionic
polymerization of the cyclic trimer, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, with lithium
bases containing protected nitrogen. After polymerization, the protecting group
will be removed and the amino-ended silicones will be converted to block
copolymers. Such copolymers will be composed of rubbery silicone segments and
polar, rigid segments which should undergo microphase separation. Silicone-
polyurethane and silicone-polyurea block copolymers will be prepared. These will
be examined by small-angle x-ray scattering, thermal-mechanical analysis, and
dynamic-mechanical analysis. Fundamental relationships between molecular weight
of silicone or hard segment and separated domain size and thermal- mechanical
properties will be derived. This research project is part of the NSF effort to
enhance support for undergraduate research.
