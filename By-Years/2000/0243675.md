The University of Illinois Department of Physics Research Experiences for
Undergraduates program provides research opportunities in a variety of physics
sub-fields. About half of the participants are from colleges and universities
other than UIUC, and the other half are Illinois students participating in our
senior thesis course sequence, although all participants are involved in the
same activities. Activities outside the laboratory focus on communication skills
and expose participants to a wide variety of physics disciplines. During the
ten-week program, students are required to give oral presentations and write a
journal-style paper about their research project. Workshops are conducted on how
to give effective presentations, how to write a scientific paper, and ethical
conduct of research (new in Summer 2003). Participants attend weekly lunch
meetings with a faculty member, who discusses recent progress and open problems
in his or her research area. Optional social activities and field trips are also
arranged.
