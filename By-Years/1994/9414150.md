9414150 Wangemann This award supports the IEEE/LEOS Summer Topical Meeting on
Optical Networks and Their Enabling Technologies This is a forum to present and
examine recent developments in optical networks and in devices and subsystems
which will be required for their successful implementation. This meeting is
especially designed to bring together researchers in each of these research
areas. Topics will include optical networks based on switching or on time-,
wavelength-, or code-division multiple access techniques; architectures and
protocols for optical networks, end-user applications for optical networks,
experimental results from optical network testbeds or field trials, implications
of optical devices on network performance, optical switches and switching
fabrics, optical amplifiers and amplifier-based photonic circuits, tunable
transmitters and receivers, transmitter and receiver arrays; wavelength and
high-speed multiplexing devices and subsystems; and passive optical network
components including splitters and combiners. ***
