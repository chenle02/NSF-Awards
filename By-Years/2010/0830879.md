Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves the running
of the Information Assurance Capacity Building Program (IACBP), intended to
improve the capacity of Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), including both
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HCBUs) and Hispanic Serving
Institutions (HSIs), to offer high quality Information Assurance (IA) education
and a specialization in Computer Forensics Science. The IACBP aids MSIs to
develop IA curricula under advisement and with academic enrichment from
established leaders in the field, leading to the implementation of new IA
activities at the MSIs. The objectives are to build new capacity or expand
existing capacity to offer IA courses and programs at MSIs not currently
designated as Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) in IA Education; to expand
the research opportunities in IA; and to help build expertise in Cyber Forensics
Science. As a two-year workshop, the program gives a two-week session during the
first year that presents IA theory and practice, and then gives a three-day
follow-up session during the second year where participants present their
initial outcomes and results to their peers. This method integrates three main
components: technological knowledge, pedagogical support and an individual
curriculum development plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
