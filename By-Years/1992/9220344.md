This award provides 64% of the funds needed to acquire a noble gas mass
spectrometer system to be installed and operated in the Department of Geological
Sciences at the Ohio State University. The University is committed to providing
the necessary remaining funds. The principal use of the equipment will be for
geochemical research and teaching using the radioactive decay of potassium to
argon for dating geologic ages of minerals and rocks.
