Web-based and digital tools to support math and science learning have emerged as
a major trend over the past several decades. As of 2013, all 50 states and the
District of Columbia offer online learning experiences to Kâ€“12 students, ranging
from supplemental courses that accompany traditional in-person instruction to
full-time online schools. Understanding the promise and limitations of remote
learning is an urgent line of research now because of increased reliance on
remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and continued
disruptions to schooling have been associated with substantial setbacks in
learning. Studies examining academic progress between March 2020 and March 2021
reported significant lack of progress, which was particularly pronounced in math
and science relative to reading. Furthermore, lack of progress was greatest
among subgroups that already experience achievement disparities in math and
science, such as students of color, rural students, and those eligible for free
or reduced-price lunch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comprehensive systematic
review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence surrounding math and science
remote education programs from the past 15 years. The goal is to understand the
effectiveness of math and science remote education programs; how their
effectiveness varies by program characteristics (e.g., fully online vs. hybrid,
synchronous vs. asynchronous, and student-instructor ratio); and whether their
effects vary with student sample characteristics. To prioritize future research
needs, the researchers will create evidence gap maps to illuminate patterns in
the existing evidence base and identify areas in which evidence is lacking. This
analysis will build foundational knowledge and inform educators about which
programs and strategies in math and science remote education have been most
effective. In addition, the review will provide targeted guidance on which
programs and strategies have been most appropriate for vulnerable groups of
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12)
seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through
research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).
Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education
and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and
empirical justification for proposed projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
