0128053&lt;br/&gt;Willemann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides four years
of continued support for the operation of the International Seismological Centre
(ISC) affiliated with Oxford University. The ISC is supported by 50 member
organization around the world for the production of a global summary of
earthquake hypocenters, magnitudes, arrival times and other phase measurements.
ISC also compiles an annual Bulletin of these data after further analysis of the
data. The Bulletin provides a comprehensive database of refined earthquake
hypocenters with redundant and suspected erroneous data filtered. The Catalogue
and Bulletin are available via CD-ROM to researchers worldwide interested in
earthquake hazards, seismotectonics , global tomography and earthquake physics.
All ISC data are also now available via the
internet.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
