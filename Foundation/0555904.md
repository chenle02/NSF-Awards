The research to be done in this project involves a continuous extension of first
order logic that is suitable for structures based on metric spaces. The main
emphasis of the project is on the usefulness of this theory in relation to a
wide variety of structures from analysis and geometry. Previous work indicates
that the potential role of this logic in analysis and geometry is parallel to
the role played by ordinary first order logic in the more algebraic aspects of
mathematics. Settings in which the features of this logic will be further
developed include: highly homogeneous metric structures and their automorphism
groups, probability measure algebras and their expansions, operator algebras and
other structures based on Hilbert spaces, and the geometry of Banach spaces.

This project involves new and effective ways to use model theory (a branch of
mathematical logic) within analysis and geometry. During the past 40 years or
more, techniques from logic have not only clarified the foundations of
mathematics, but they have contributed new tools for solving mathematical
problems. These tools have been especially effective in areas of mathematics
close to algebra and number theory. In this project, C. Ward Henson aims to make
those tools from logic equally effective in the areas of mathematics that are
close to topology, geometry, and analysis.
