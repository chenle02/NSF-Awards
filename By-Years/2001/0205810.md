The theoretical effort to understand star formation and the role of magnetic
fields in the formation and evolution of interstellar clouds is extensive and
accelerating. However, in spite of significant progress in recent years, there
remain fundamental unanswered questions about the basic physics of star
formation. If dense molecular clouds have lifetimes significantly longer than
their free-fall collapse times, they must be supported against gravitational
collapse. One view is that magnetic fields provide this support. This hypothesis
can be tested by measurement of the mass to magnetic flux ratio in dense clouds.
The other extreme is that magnetic fields are weak and that molecular clouds are
intermittent phenomena, and that the problem of cloud support for long time
periods is irrelevant. This project will measure, directly or indirectly,
magnetic field strengths in a large, statistically meaningful sample of
molecular clouds in order to help answer the above questions. Because the
requisite measurements are of weakly polarized continuum and spectral-line
emission from molecular clouds, measurements of interstellar magnetic fields
remain among the most difficult of astronomical observations, and information
about magnetic fields remains very sparse. It is crucial to our understanding of
the fundamental physical process of star formation that measurements of
interstellar magnetic fields continue to progress. ***
