This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the
development of an optical alloy composition sensor based on laser induced plasma
spectroscopy. A key element of the sensor is the use of a microchip laser
excitation source. The technology has the capability to detect industrially
relevant compositions in steel alloys and possibly aluminum alloys. The Phase I
results indicated the efficacy of the technique for the analysis of iron alloys.
The Phase II project will focus on the development of a small, lightweight and
mobile field prototype, which will be able to analyze various alloy
samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key commercial application of this technology
is aluminum and iron scrap metal analysis, substantial market niches which are
not effectively covered by existing analysis&lt;br/&gt;technology. The major
market is for steel and aluminum alloys that have significant components of
light elements. These precision instrument currents have sales worldwide in
excess of $10 million per year. &lt;br/&gt;
