This project provides for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to be
placed in a pool of shared use equipment and made available to a variety of
users within the region. Funding is provided for the acquisition of components
to complete the fabrication and assembly of a Multiple Opening/Closing Net
Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). The system enables scientists to collect
a series micronekton samples on each deployment along with pertinent
environmental data such as temperature, salinity, flow rate, and depth. The net
system will be operated and maintained at the Florida Institue of Oceanography
and will be made available to users of the R/V SUNCOASTER or other regional
research vessels.
