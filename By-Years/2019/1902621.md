This award will provide partial support for participants to a research
conference in San Diego, California from June 17 to June 20, 2019 entitled
"Future Directions in Algebraic Combinatorics". This conference will bring
together leaders from related fields and a diverse group of younger researchers
in order to identify and prioritize goals for future work and to inspire new
collaborations for fulfilling these goals. To accomplish this, the conference
will be comprised of a dozen in depth talks by experts in various fields,
"lightning talks" to propose future work, discussions of priorities by all
participants, and a poster session for graduate students and early career
attendees.

The goal of this conference is to communicate future goals in symmetric function
theory and algebraic combinatorics. Algebraic combinatorics has been at the
center of new developments across several fields, including representation
theory, algebraic geometry, and topology. Confirmed speakers include leading
experts in all aspects of algebraic combinatorics: Franois Bergeron, Sara
Billey, Anders Bjorner, Persi Diaconis, Ron Graham, Mark Haiman, Jim Haglund,
Claudia Malvenuto, Anton Mellit, Jennifer Morse, Claudio Procesi, Richard
Stanley, Dennis Stanton, Michelle Wachs, Nolan Wallach, and Greg Warrington.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
