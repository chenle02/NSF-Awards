This award provides funds to the Rochester Center for Economic Reearch at the
University of Rochester the help purchase equipment which will be used to teach
quantitative social sciences, specifically economics and political science.
Students currently get little exposure to the quantitative aspects of economics
and political science because of the lack of a centralized facility for this
purpose. As a result, many do not have a very good idea of the nature of
quantitative research in the social sciences. The funds from this award will
allow the development of laboratory- based undergraduate education in this
setting. Innovative classroom applications such as market experiments and model
simulation, as well as the expansion of traditional applications in statistics
and econometrics will be developed. This facility should serve as a model for
similar facilities at other institutions. In addition, students will gain a
better understanding of the nature of quantitative research in the social
sciences, and will therefore be able to make more informed decisions about
choosing careers in research and/or teaching. The grantee is matching this award
with non-Federal sources.
