This research focuses on the development of high precision tracking devices.
These will be part of large scale particle physics detectors operating at the
highest machine energies available. These devices, which use silicon as the
detecting element, will help physicists reconstruct the details of how particles
decay. This, in turn, will lead to an increased understanding of the physics
processes involved. The ultimate goal of these experiments is to discover the
Higgs particle - the `missing link` of the Standard Model of particle physics.
The technology needed to make these devices work is at the cutting edge. Its
successful development will lead to applications in many other fields of science
and industry. The PI will directly involve undergraduates in this research,
preparing them for careers in many high-tech industries. This award will also
help fund her outreach program directed at women in high schools.
