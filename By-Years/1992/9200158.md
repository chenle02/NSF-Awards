The University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials
Science has run a successful and thriving undergraduate research program for
more than thirty years, and because of increasing recognition of the need to
encourage African American, American Indian, and Chicano/Latino students to
pursue graduate studies, this program will fund ten such students. These ten
students will be selected both from the U of MN and in a national search
developed and implemented by the U of MN Institute of Technology Minority
Affairs Director. The program affords the students the opportunity to perform
guided research in one of the top research departments.
