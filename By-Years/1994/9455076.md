Concurrent engineering is a new approach to product development in which all
phases of the design paradigm are considered simultaneously during the early
stages of the design process. The concurrent engineering paradigm is
characterized by a 3-D solid model data base that can be used directly for
engineering analysis, prototype manufacturing, and production of engineering
documentation. Engineering and technology curricula should be modified
accordingly to answer this modern need for concurrent engineering design
education. Of particular interest in this project is the infusion of a
meaningful concurrent engineering experience in the lower-division curriculum
where students need motivation and encouragement to continue their studies. The
format of the project consists of two one-week workshops held during the summer
of 1995 at the University of Texas at Austin. The workshops will be accessible
to lower-division faculty from both four-year schools and two-year colleges. A
total of 48 faculty participants will be accommodated and matched to one of the
workshops based on their background. Topics of the workshop will include: 1. 3-D
solid modeling techniques; 2. application of solid model data to design analysis
such as mass properties and finite elements; 3. application of the model data to
manufacturing simulation and rapid prototyping; 4. generation of engineering
documentation from the solid model; and 5. curriculum and laboratory development
issues. A highlight of the workshop will be a short team design project in which
a rapid physical prototype is derived from a solid model of a mechanical part
designed by the team. The project will prepare the participants to develop local
instructional material and modern CAD/CAM laboratories that will afford their
students a meaningful, early exposure to concurrent engineering design concepts.
In addition, the project will motivate the participants to become active in
making and publishing their own contributions to eng ineering education.
