Abstract

Award: DMS-9971045 Principal Investigator: Peter Petersen

The PI proposes to investigate the relationship between geometric and
topological invariants of Riemannian manifolds. The study can be divided up into
at least two parts. There are general finiteness results where one simply
obtains some bounds on topological invariants from certain bounds on the
geometry. The PI proposes to work on several finiteness phenomena for manifolds
with integral bounds for the curvature. The isospectral compactness problem for
3-manifolds will also be investigated. There are more specific situations where
one can compute very specific topological invariants from certain specific
geometric information. Under this heading one also studies various pinching
phenomena, where the goal is to understand the specific topological type of a
Riemannian manifold with restrictions on some of its geometric invariants. The
PI proposes to study Gauss-Bonnet type theorems for noncompact 4-manifolds and
their relationship with the study of Euclidean quantum gravity. This is well
studied in the setting of compact manifolds, but much less understood for
noncompact manifolds. It is also proposed to investigate various pinching
phenomena both for curvature and eigenvalues. Finally the PI will undertake a
study of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere and try to determine whether it admits metrics
with positive sectional curvature.

The main goal of the PI's research centers on understanding the relationship
between on one hand geometric quantities such as size, volume and bending and on
the other hand the complexity of the objects. Complexity is often measured by
how many holes the object has, a jungle gym is more complex than a doughnut
which in turn is more complex than a ball. Depending on how good ones geometric
information is one can obtain very general bounds on the complexity, but it is
also possible to sometimes completely determine what the object is. For
instance, only a ball has the property that it bends in the same manner
everywhere. There are also very interesting relationships between the geometric
quantities themselves. For instance, any object that bends in the same direction
everywhere is bounded in size and volume. Such results also have counterparts in
Einstein's theory of general relativity. There such results are related to the
study of the Big Bang, black holes, and the ultimate fate on the universe. One
technical item the PI studies is the possibility that ones measurement of
bending does not have to be very precise. In other words, slightly vision
impaired people's ideas of bending are as good as those of people with perfect
eye sight.
