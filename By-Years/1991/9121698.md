The objective of this research is the investigate of the natural shapes of
raindrops through laboratory, field and modeling studies. In the laboratory, a
28-meter shaft will be used to evaluate the role of aerodynamic feedback in the
persistent oscillation for 1.5 to 4.0 mm diameter drops. Additional experiments
are planned for larger drops using a 100-meter fall column. Also, field
measurements of drop oscillation spectra and amplitudes in various types of rain
will be conducted to examine the roles of eddy shedding, drop collisions and
turbulence in promoting raindrop oscillations. The project includes the analysis
of aircraft data of raindrop shape as measured by an optical-array probe during
the Convective and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment in Florida (Summer
1991). The causes of natural raindrop shapes will be evaluated using
measurements of rain rates, drop-size distributions, Doppler radar
reflectivities and polarization. Finally, models will be developed using these
observations to characterize the variety of drop shapes in rain. The semi-
empirical distributions of natural raindrop shapes will be applied to problems
in microwave scattering and polarization.
