Abstract

Award: DMS-0072197 Principal Investigator: Steven R. Bell

Prof. Bell has shown that the Bergman, Szego, and Poisson kernels associated to
a finitely connected region in the plane are elementary combinations of only
three, and sometimes even two, analytic functions of one complex variable
related to geometric constructions associated to the domain. Bell will study
deeper questions about complexity in potential theory posed by his recent
findings and he will extend these results to finite Riemann surfaces. Bell has
also formulated a unique continuation property for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-
Riemann equations that he has shown yields information about the behavior of
holomorphic mappings between domains in complex space. He will attempt to verify
the property on important classes of domains such as the strictly pseudoconvex
domains.

The mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal mapping are
ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering. They carry encoded within
them a vast amount of information about geometric properties of regions in the
plane. Although these objects are familiar and well studied, they continue to be
a source of interesting and applicable new mathematics. Professor Bell will
express the classical objects of potential theory associated to a two
dimensional region with holes in terms of much simpler analytic objects. These
results will give rise to new and practical methods for understanding the
solutions to many classical problems in differential equations, conformal
mapping, and potential theory that should be of interest to scientists and
engineers. Bell will explore applications of his ideas to more complicated
constructions in the subject and he and his students will test the efficacy of
the numerical methods stemming from the work. Because humans best perceive
higher dimensional objects by taking a series of two dimensional slices, the
tools developed by Bell could find many applications.
