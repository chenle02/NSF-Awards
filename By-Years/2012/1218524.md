The objective of this project is to design and develop a data management system
that supports query processing on continuous uncertain data by returning a full
probability distribution of query output and optimizes such processing for
performance. This project includes four thrusts: (1) supporting continuous
uncertain data processing using both the traditional relational model and the
array model; (2) addressing complex correlation that arises in continuous
uncertain data processing using new statistical graphical models; (3) supporting
arbitrary user-defined functions, besides standard query operations, by
exploring advanced techniques such as Gaussian processes and functional
interpolation; and (4) developing a prototype system and evaluating it using
real-world applications. Expected results include statistical models and
techniques, data storage schemes, query processing and optimization techniques,
and a publicly available prototype to fully support query processing on
continuous uncertain data.

The results of the project can benefit applications such as severe weather
monitoring and computational astrophysics, as well as the broader scientific
community. Since applications such as tornado detection may trigger actions
based on derived information, the ability to characterize uncertainty of output
may result in significant social impacts. This project also integrates research
and education with curriculum development and engaging women in research through
college outreach and CRA's distributed mentor program. The results of the
project are disseminated at the project web site: http://claro.cs.umass.edu.
