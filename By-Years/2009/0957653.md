The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Marcelo Carignano of Northwestern
University. Prof. Carignano and his students develop a polarizable water model
to be used in full atomistic simulations to study water/vapor, ice/vapor and
ice/water interfaces and their interaction with ions, trace atmospheric
components and pollutant molecules in a temperature range relevant to
atmospheric chemistry, which includes the water supercooled regime and ice. The
project will increase our molecular level understanding of the role of
water/vapor and ice/vapor interfaces in chemical reactions leading to cloud
electrification and of the functionality and reactivity of the ice/water
interface, which is a natural habitat for a diverse range of microbial
organisms. The project will provide excellent educational opportunities for
students, including some from under represented groups, desiring to work at the
forefront of environmental science.
