This project will investigate new eigenvalue algorithms based upon the idea of
homotopy continuation. These consist of deforming a simple matrix into the
matrix in question, while following the easily found eigenpairs of the simple
matrix to the eigenpairs being sought. The issues to be studied include: -
Further exploration of a recently developed continuation algorithm for
eigenvalue problems of symmetric triadiagonal matrices. - Continuation
algorithms for eigenvalue problems of large sparse matrices. - Parallelization
and vectorization of such algorithms for a variety of advanced architectures. -
Continuation algorithms for eigenvalue problems of nonsymmetric matrices. The
emphasis will be on the development of efficient computational algorithms and
their numerical implementation. Hopefully, the work will lead to software
packages that can be applied to practical eigenvalue problems, especially those
of large, sparse matrices.
