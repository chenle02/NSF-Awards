This S-STEM project awards 20 scholarships of up to $5,500 per student per year
for up to four years to full-time financially disadvantaged students who are
talented in mathematics and computer science. The proposal is essentially a
systematic plan to attract, nurture, and prepare masters students to do doctoral
studies in mathematics or computer science. Between 10-12 of the 20 of these
awards are for graduate students, and the remainder for the undergraduates who
form a feeder-pool for the graduate programs. Students are provided extensive
support, including faculty mentors. Additional educational opportunities include
internship and research experiences, and regularly scheduled forums and
colloquia that cover research findings and topics on mathematics and computer
science. The goals of this project are: (1) Increased retention of students to
degree achievement; (2) Improved student support programs; (3) Improved
educational opportunities for students; and (4) Increased numbers of well-
educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need. A major
outcome of the project is a significant increase in the pool of minority
students who will qualify for and enroll in mathematics and computer science
doctoral programs.
