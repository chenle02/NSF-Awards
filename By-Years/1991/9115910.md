Hermaphroditism is poorly understood in sessile marine Bryozoa that release of
sperm externally for fertilization and reproduction. This project is designed to
explore in a marine bryozoan how male reproductive success is related to male
reproductive effort, and ultimately to the evolution of hermaphroditism. The
hermaphroditic marine bryozoan Celleporella hyalina displays extensive variation
in the expression of male and female gender in populations studied along the
mid-coast of Maine. Individual colonies vary quantitatively in the allocation of
anatomical structures to male relative to female reproductive functions. This
investigation will use this polymorphism to test theoretical mechanisms for
evolutionary maintenance of hermaphroditism. The study will address three
specific objectives: (1) to develop genetic markers in the bryozoan that can be
used in paternity analysis, (2) to determine whether gender variation has any
measurable reproductive success, and (3) to use naturally-occurring "female"
variants of the bryozoan in independent assays for fertilization success. This
study will represent the first attempt to test sex allocation models for the
presence of simultaneous hermaphroditism in benthic marine animals. Although
this study will not isolate the mechanism of combined gender in bryozoans, it
will provide an evaluation of the validity of this mechanism, a poorly
understood aspect of benthic invertebrate reproductive ecology.
