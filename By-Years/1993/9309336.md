9309336 Shor The design of dynamical systems, modelling for control design, and
the design of effective controllers are inter-related. Yet generally system
design is completed before control modelling and controller design are begun.
Design choices upstream will affect both the achievability of desirable
controlled system properties and the simplicity of the final overall design. The
integration of these stages of design is necessary to remedy the current
situation. The research deals with control problems that assist in the
understanding of how dynamical system design affects the achievability of
certain control objectives. The solution of these problems may lead to the
development of CAD tools for design engineers to employ to evaluate the effects
of their design on the achievability of those objectives. ***
