Convergent plate boundaries are one of the earth's most tectonically active
regions and they have long been recognized as zones where continental margin or
ocean floor sediments can be subducted to great depths. However much less has
been learned about the processes responsible for uplift of these sediments in
accretionary prism and continental collision zones. This project will test two
end-member models concerning the mechanics of uplifting accretionary prisms: 1)
underplating, where the accretionary prism provides a rigid backstop for the
offscraped sediments or 2) penetrative deformation within the prism as sediments
are accreted at the toe. These models will be tested by using the post-accretion
strain and uplift history of the Kodiak accretionary complex, Kodiak Island,
Alaska. Results will help clarify how uplift is accomplished in accretionary
prisms.
