Convergence of Riemannian Manifolds

Over the past three decades mathematicians have gained deep new insight into
Riemannian manifolds by applying the methods of Gromov-Hausdorff, Lipschitz and
metric measure convergence. Such techniques have been particularly useful for
studying manifolds with bounds on sectional or Ricci curvature, but a new weaker
notion of convergence is needed to understand manifolds without such strong
conditions. Recently the PI and Dr. Wenger have applied work of Drs. Ambrosio
and Kirchheim to introduce a new distance between manifolds: the intrinsic flat
distance. While the convergence is weaker than previous forms of convergence,
the limit spaces, called Integral Current Spaces, are countably H^mrectifiable.
Applying work of Cheeger-Colding, Gromov and Perelman, the PI and Dr. Wenger
have shown that the Gromov-Hausdorff and intrinsic flat limits of manifolds with
nonnegative Ricci curvature agree. However, in general the limit spaces are
different and sequences which do not converge in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense may
still converge in the intrinsic flat sense. The PI will study the properties of
these limit spaces under a variety of conditions on the sequence of manifolds
and prove stability theorems under these weaker conditions. In particular the PI
proposes to improve her results on the stability of the Friedmann model.

The spacelike universe is described in Friedmann cosmology as an isotropic three
dimensional Riemannian manifold that expands in time starting from the initial
Big Bang. In reality the universe is not isotropic because it is bent by gravity
in a nonuniform way. Weak gravitational lensing (due to dust) and strong
gravitational lensing (due to massive objects) has been observed by the Hubble
to distort regions of space. The universe is thus, at best, close to the
Friedmann model in some sense. In prior work, under strong assumptions, the PI
has shown that a Riemannian manifold which is almost isotropic (in a way which
allows for weak gravitational lensing and localized strong gravitational
lensing) is close to the Friedmann model in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This is
proven by studying the Gromov-Hausdorff limits of increasingly isotropic
manifolds. Now the PI proposes to prove that under weaker assumptions, the
universe is close to the Friedmann model in the intrinsic flat sense by studying
the intrinsic flat limits of Riemannian manifolds. Using the intrinsic flat
distance will not only allow for weak and strong gravitational lensing but also
allow for the possible existence of wormholes.
