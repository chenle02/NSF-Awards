The Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan will purchase high-
end computing&lt;br/&gt;equipment which will be dedicated to the support of
research in statistical sciences. The equipment&lt;br/&gt;will be dedicated to
the support of research in the following projects: (1) Optimizing
interventions&lt;br/&gt;in the behavioral sciences; (2) Statistical methodology
for networks; (3)High dimensional&lt;br/&gt;and functional data analysis with
applications to bioinformatics and chemoinformatics; (4)
Modeling&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal network properties of the brain and (5)
Stochastic dynamical systems and&lt;br/&gt;their applications. Further, the
proposed equipment will greatly enhance the overall research
and&lt;br/&gt;education infrastructure of the Department of
Statistics.&lt;br/&gt;The research to be supported by the planned equipment
involves statistical methodology&lt;br/&gt;that covers a wide variety of
scientific disciplines, including medical and life sciences, health
care,&lt;br/&gt;information sciences and technology, brain science and
infectious diseases. Scientific discoveries&lt;br/&gt;would greatly benefit
society and the economy.
