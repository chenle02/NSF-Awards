This STTR Phase II project will result in the creation of an advanced network
capability to enable ad-hoc networks to operate in a low bandwidth undersea
environment. The specific application of the resultant capability will be to
support Autonomous Undersea Systems Networks (AUSNET), which are fleets of
unmanned robotic vehicles that can provide survey, search, and monitoring
functions for customer bases including the oil industry, environmental
monitoring, undersea communications infrastructure, search and rescue, and
military applications. The capability will build upon the emerging standard
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols to create a network that is entirely
self-configuring, bandwidth conserving, and tailored to the unique requirements
of cooperative undersea robotic operations. The two technical thrusts of the
effort include AUSNET low-level protocol development, and higher level
Application Programmer Interface specification and development. The cooperative
Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) market is emerging and substantial. There are
currently 17 companies selling undersea communications devices, each of which is
a candidate licensee for AUSNET technology. Near term application of Phase II
results is anticipated in Naval applications. Even greater application is to be
found in support of offshore undersea operations addressing requirements of the
oil industry, communications (undersea cable) installation and maintenance,
environmental survey and monitoring, search and rescue operations, and
exploration/scientific research.
