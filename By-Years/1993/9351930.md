The Departments of Computer &amp; Information Science and Mathematical Sciences
are joining in an effort to improve the programs offered by each department and
to create a new undergraduate concentration in scientific computing. The goals
are to: (1) keep current a computing science curriculum; (2) educate students
from other disciplines in the science of computing; and (3) strengthen the
applied mathematics curriculum with the inclusion of strong scientific computing
and modeling components. The laboratory will support the hands- on approach of
the new curricula.
