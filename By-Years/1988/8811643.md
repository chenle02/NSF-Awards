A relatively new method of optimizing the production of hydrocarbon wells is
Nodal System Analysis (NSA) which integrates the multiple pressure differentials
occurring in the transfer of hydrocarbon fluid from the reservoir to the
surface. The objective of the research is to expand NSA and to investigate the
design of a Expert System Production Organizer (ESPO) using a rule-based system.
This ESPO well consist of a package of interactive software employing NSA
technology. The programmed expert system will analyze the complexities of a
production well in a single package and can be accessed by engineers with little
or no knowledge of NSA. The ESPO will possess these features: (1) all flow
correlations and models are internal, (2) frequently-used data is available in
on-line databases accessed internally by software, (3) an economics package that
compares selected production schemes, (4) perform statistical analysis on
similar wells, (5) an inference engine for forward and backward chaining, (6)
analyze the production systems and identify possible solutions, and (7) be user
friendly.
