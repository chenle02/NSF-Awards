This award supports the research in combinatorics of Professors Dennis Stanton,
Paul Edelman, and Dennis White of the University of Minnesota. Their project is
to study partition statistics and orthogonal polynomials, the weak order of the
symmetric group, and partition congruences. This research falls in the broad
category of combinatorics, which is one of the most active fields in today's
mathematics. Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the
very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its modern development,
however, combinatorics has gone beyond just counting to make use of a wide
variety of advanced mathematical techniques, and although its roots go back
several centuries, the field has had an explosive development in the past few
decades because of its importance in communications and information technology.
