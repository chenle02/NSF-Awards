The development of integrated design and manufacturing systems is widely
recognized as a critical component in the effort to improve the competitive
posture of American industries. A key to the success of these computer
integrated manufacturing systems lies in the robustness of the information
integration supported by the systems. However, the individual methods available
to support the definition and design of current information systems are not
themselves sufficiently integrated with one another to permit the cost effective
development of complex real world systems. The goal of this research is to
provide the necessary theoretical and computational foundations for overcoming
this problem. Its practical upshot will be the development of automated support
for a seamless suite of methodologies to achieve integrated information systems
in design, engineering, and manufacturing.
