System designers have long assumed that memory cannot reliably store permanent
data because of memory's volatility and vulnerability to software corruption.
Memory's unreliability slows system performance by forcing some applications to
write data through to disk and hurts reliability for forcing applications that
care about performance to throw away 30 seconds of data on a crash. The primary
research goals of this CAREER plan are 1) to enable memory to reliably store
permanent data even in the presence of operating system or database errors; and
2) to measure how often software faults corrupt memory, both with and without
extra protection. The primary education technique of this CAREER plan is
relation instruction: spending time and effort relating with students
personally. This plan suggests several simple ways, such as group lunches, to do
this effectively with large, undergraduate classes; prior experience attests to
how caring for students in a personal manner motivates them to learn.
