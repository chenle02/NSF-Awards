ABSTRACT

Proposal DMS-0200888 PI Ian Dinwoodie Title "Computational algebraic methods for
high-dimensional statistical applications"

This project has the goal of research in algebraic methods for high-dimensional
parametric statistical problems where classical asymptotic methods are not
useful. Connected with the research goal is work with existing and future
graduate students. The research problems are: high-dimensional Gibbs-
distribution models for network reliability and traffic with incomplete data;
optimization for parameter estimation in high-dimensional models with incomplete
data and nonconvex log-likelihood functions; fast simulation methods including
fiber walks with Markov chains for integer data tables; and multivariate
exponential generating functions for computations on lattice points with the
hypergeometric distribution. A range of algebraic tools will be used, including
Groebner bases in commutative rings and D-modules, elimination theory,
polynomial homotopy methods, and Markov Monte Carlo methods.

This project will bring recent developments in computational algebra to new
statistical applications where classical methods do not work. Examples of such
new and challenging applications are large-scale network traffic and
reliability, and large databases of tabular data such as census information
where security and analysis are difficult. The algebraic tools can help to solve
problems of model formulation and model fitting and statistical analysis. Many
algebraic techniques have been recently developed to solve computational
problems in robotics and differential equations, and these methods are very
promising for statistics. The investigators will develop these algebraic methods
to solve statistical applications.
