Although there is evidence of periodic climatic changes in the geological record
extending back to the Cambrian era (more than 500 million year ago), the 100,000
year periodicities found in deep sea sediments are most prominent in the late
Pliestocene (recent several million years). It has been postulated that this
periodicity in the geological record reflects a nonlinear response of the
climate system to changing external forcing due to incoming solar radiation
variations induced by changing geometry of the earth's orbit. This project
focuses on numerical modeling of this phenomenon. With a multi-component model
consisting of an ice-bedrock model coupled to an atmosphere-ocean energy balance
model, several numerical experiments will be carrried out to delineate the
relative importance of interaction between continental ice sheet and underlying
bedrock (isostacy) in accounting for the observed spectral dominance at 100,000
years. Specific tasks include (1) test in the coupled model the importance of
rapid glacier termination (which occurs initially in the ice sheet-bedrock
portion of the model), (2) model the rapid growth stage of the last major
glaciation, and (3) with coupled model predicted ice volume changes and ocean
temperatures, simulate an oxygen isotope record to compare with the deep sea
fossil record. This research is important because it will enhance our
understanding of the physical basis for the dominant 100,000 year periodicity
during the late Pleistocene epoch.
