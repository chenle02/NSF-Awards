This project, holding a two-day workshop which will bring together experts from
a wide range of disciplines to articulate the challenges involved in Vertical
Farming, will invigorate the research community. Vertical Farming is an indoor,
urban farming concept that solves many energy problems associated with outdoor
farming. Recent implementations have shown very high yields in the production
vegetables, including green peppers and tomatoes, spinach and lettuce. In many
cases, water usage has been significantly reduced compared to traditional
outdoor farming, and the conditions in which the crops are grown naturally
shields them from unseasonal climate, and, from pests and diseases. In addition,
Vertical Farming has the potential to generate fresher and healthier produce at
reasonable cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research has direct impact on
the way the majority of the world's population lives. Agriculture impacts each
and every one of us. Transformational technology is needed to meet the needs of
simply feeding people in the coming decades. We need food to be safe such that
it doesn't harm people because of the methods of cultivation used. Finally,
agriculture has the potential to negatively impact the environment if not
managed carefully and intentionally. This workshop will impact the way that
crops are grown in the future, producing safe food, with a low environmental
footprint.
