The University of Missouri at Columbia is the recipient of ARI funds for the
renovation of chemical research facilities. The Chemistry Department is housed
in two buildings, Schlundt Hall and the Chemistry Building, erected in 1924 and
1972 respectively. As part of a comprehensive effort to improve the scientific
capabilities of the department, the University will construct new teaching
laboratories and renovate the Chemistry Building, the NSF project site. The
four-story structure includes a combination of research, teaching, and
laboratory support facilities. NSF funds will be used entirely for the
restoration of research and research training space within the building. Current
deficiencies that impede research consist of: inefficient laboratories and
support facilities that were not originally design to handle increased research
activity, inadequate ventilation and fume hood systems, obsolete mechanical
systems, and the absence of fire protection systems. Reconfiguration of
laboratories will provide safer conditions for all research faculty and
students. Not only will the renovation correct inadequacies and address ADA
compliance issues, but the project will allow for the consolidation of
departmental research activities, and the centralization of instrumentation to
be shared by all research teams in one location. Research programs impacted by
the renovation include: supramolecular chemistry, environmental chemistry,
radiochemistry and ultra fast laser spectroscopy. Approximately fourteen faculty
members, eight post-doctoral fellows, 90 graduate students and 105
undergraduates will benefit from the modernization.
