This award supports the participation of junior US researchers in the
international conference 'Symmetries in Mathematics and Physics II,' held at the
Instituto Nacional de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil during June 24-28, 2013. The conference features approximately twenty
plenary speakers who are world-class researchers, including three Fields medal
recipients. This is the second installment of an international conference on the
role played by symmetry in mathematics and theoretical physics. The first such
conference was held in Cortona, Italy in 2008. The talks involve many aspects of
representation theory and especially the geometric approaches and connections to
physics. In particular, the following subjects will be discussed: quantum
groups, Lie superalgebras, W-algebras, chiral algebras, invariant theory, Jordan
algebras, toroidal algebras, Poisson algebras, integrable systems, geometric
Langlands program, Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants,
Springer resolutions, Koszul duality, motivic integration, conformal nets,
quantum field theory, string theory, and more. The conference web page with the
latest updated information is located at

The notion of symmetry has long played a fundamental role in both mathematics
and physics. For example, the solvability of an algebraic equation in terms of
radicals depends on the symmetries of the set of roots. The existence of
symmetry in a physical system implies the conservation of energy, momentum or
other quantities. In modern mathematics, symmetries are investigated in the
branch of Algebra called Representation Theory. It is a thriving area with many
applications and connections to other parts of mathematics and theoretical
physics. This conference will gather leading mathematicians and physicists
working in the field.
