"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Total and dissolved organic carbon
(TOC/DOC) are central components of the global carbon cycle, as well as being
two important parameters in water and environmental quality analysis. Accurate
measurements of dissolved organic matter are important for defining the mass
balance of carbon in oceanic models and for estimating the sensitivity of the
global ocean carbon cycle to climate fluctuations. Current practices for taking
precise TOC and DOC measurements in seawater are insufficient for discerning the
small differences in concentrations caused by a number of biogeochemical
processes, for example, respiration, photochemical oxidation or mixing of water
masses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this issue, scientists from Old
Dominion University are developing a new type of total and dissolved organic
carbon analyzer that will have significant advantages over the existing
instruments or techniques, including higher sensitivity and precision. The
development of this instrument could enable ocean scientists to detect very
small changes in DOC concentrations in the open ocean. This data can then be
utilized in carbon cycling and flux models. Following successful development and
parameter optimization, this instrument could potentially permit near-
continuous, unattended acquisition of underway-shipboard data.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: In addition to the benefits this
instrumentation would provide for the ocean science community, it would also
potentially allow for the monitoring of organics in a variety of regulatory
monitoring operations, such as in the sterilization process for reclaimed water.
The professional development benefits of this research include funding for an
early career research scientist as well as the support for a postdoctoral fellow
at Old Dominion University.
