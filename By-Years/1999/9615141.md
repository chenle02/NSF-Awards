9615141 Scholz This grant provides $29,524 as partial support of the costs of
modernizing the seismic processing facility at RSMAS. Specifically, the bulk of
NSF support will pay for one-half of the cost of acquiring PROMAX 2-D seismic
processing software. This grant forms part of a much larger modernization plan
that is being financed by the University of Miami and will include support of a
system manger, 2 new workstations, cost-sharing for seismic processing software
and a major laboratory space renovation. These renovations and equipment will
replace their current and aging Solbourne server running ITA seismic processing
software, presently their primary processing system, and their DEC VAX
minicomputer running the DISCO seismic processing software as their backup
system. Enhancement of the computational power available to these Pi's will
support interesting and fundamental research projects in reflection seismology
including, multi-channel seismic investigations of the structures within
sediments deposited in active juvenile rift basins (i.e Lake Baikal in Russia
and the East African Rift Lakes; Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi, and Lake
Tanganyika), reflection profiling of the sequence stratigraphy of the Great
Bahama Bank and studies of the tectonic evolution of the Cariaco Basin,
Venezuela. Support of this grant has been provided by both the Division of Earth
Sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences. ***
