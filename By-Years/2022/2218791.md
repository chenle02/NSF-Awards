Cell phone location records, called mobility data (MD), are data about where
people go. These data are an essential resource to study how people move and
interact in society. However, these data are also very complex, so very few
scientists have the technical skills to work with them. There are also privacy
or data ownership issues that require scientists to have permission to access
them. For these reasons, policymakers, practitioners, and the people in the
communities that the data describe do not use them despite their importance.
This award supports the creation of Mobility Data for Communities (MD4C), an
infrastructure project that converts MD into a series of useful measures that
describe mobility across a region's neighborhoods and places within those
neighborhoods. These measures are accessible to everyone, including researchers,
policymakers, and practitioners. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;MD4Câ€™s tools are
designed to resolve biases in the measures that result from not having certain
people (for example, the elderly or unhoused who use cell phones less
frequently) or having too many other people (for example, younger professionals
who use cell phones all day) in the datasets. Bias is measured and corrected by
comparing MD to data from a survey of people who voluntarily share their
mobility information. Once corrected, deep learning techniques can extract
measurements of mobility patterns related to social equity: racial and
socioeconomic segregation, economic development, and climate resilience. The
MD4C platform makes these bias-adjusted mobility measurements accessible for
researchers and others and makes new research possible across the social
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
