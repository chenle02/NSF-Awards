9409824 Jagannathan A substantial part of the research effort in finance is
directed toward improving our understanding of how investors value risky cash
flows. It is generally agreed that investors demand a higher expected return for
investing in riskier projects, or securities. However, we still do not fully
understand how investors assess the risk of a project's cash flow and how they
determine what risk premium to demand. The contribution of this grant comes from
a reassessment of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the framework used
most often by financial managers to assess the risk of the cash flow from a
project and the preferred model for classroom use in MBA and other managerial
finance courses. The empirical evidence accumulated over the past two decades on
the CAPM is weak, but CAPM continues to be used because the empirical support
for other asset pricing models is also weak and the theoretical underpinnings of
CAPM are better than those for alternative models. The investigator builds on
his previous theoretical and empirical research on CAPM. Specifically, the
investigator shows that by relaxing unreasonable auxiliary assumptions usually
made in empirical studies of CAPM and by taking the return to human capital into
account in measuring the return to aggregate wealth, he is able to obtain
surprisingly strong empirical support for CAPM. In this research the
investigator will use standard tests of asset pricing models with time varying
parameters and develop some new statistical tests and examine their small sample
properties.
