A general purpose geotechnical materials test system is procured. The system
incorporates two hydraulically actuated loading devices for axial load and for
torsional loading. In addition, the system is equipped with three independent
presurizing sources and controls for the confining pressures on the inside and
outside of a hollow cylindrical soil specimen. This equipment will provide the
capability to perform research in modeling soil behavior.
