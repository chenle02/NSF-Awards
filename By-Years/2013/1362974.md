The notion of classification is fundamental to many branches of mathematical
research: one looks for the deep underlying structure common to many widely
varying topics, with particular attention to underlying symmetries. Techniques
of modern mathematical logic, in combination with more specialized tools from
other branches of mathematics, make it possible to analyze the scope and
limitations of such classifications and reveal a wealth of additional structure.
The techniques of mathematical logic also provide a broad perspective on
combinatorial problems. Here one must first separate the "chaotic" problems
which cannot be neatly categorized and identify the subclass of more tractable
problems, looking ultimately for an algorithm to carry out this part of the
analysis at a completely general level. This research project investigates such
classification problems. In particular, issues of computability are an essential
component of the program. The research is interdisciplinary, establishing new
relationships between mathematical logic and classical
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a group research project.
Using methods of topological dynamics, combinatorial group theory, model theory,
and algebra, the two investigators will investigate a variety of classification
problems in analysis, algebra, and combinatorics. Simon Thomas will combine
these methods with modern descriptive set theory to analyze classification
problems in algebra, particularly those associated with representation theory
and the subject of "invariant random subgroups" in the sense of Vershik, while
Gregory Cherlin will pursue joint work with visitor Saharon Shelah on the
existence of universal graphs with forbidden subgraphs and the associated
structural Ramsey theory, as well as the classification of all metrically
homogeneous graphs and analogous problems for finite permutation groups. A
further component of the project is an active visitor's program under the
direction of Shelah when he is in residence at Rutgers.
