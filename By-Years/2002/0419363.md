This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop high
performance polycarbonate nanocomposites. Polycarbonate possess poor abrasion
and chemical resistance and shows crazing and cracking upon stress.
Incorporation of clay particles in a polymer matrix can overcome above-mentioned
problems. However, the major obstacle to successful fabrication of
polycarbonate-clay nanocomposites is related to the thermal stability of
organoclay. Degradation of organoclay leads to decreased mechanical properties
and lowered transparency accompanying with bad color. Nanoparticles are also
good additives for improving mechanical properties and abrasion of polymers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed polycarbonate nanocomposites will be used in
a wide range of applications,&lt;br/&gt;such as automobiles, cell phone,
computers and other business equipment, sporting&lt;br/&gt;goods, consumer
electronics, household appliances, CDs, DVDs, food storage
containers&lt;br/&gt;and bottles, which require polycarbonate to be hard, stiff,
tough and color stable.&lt;br/&gt;
