This award allows the investigator to pursue her research spanning the areas of
interpersonal conflict, decision making, groups and social memory. She combines
central ideas from cognitive psychology and social cognition into the study of
interpersonal conflict to create a new perspective in conflict research. In her
work, Dr. Thompson addresses why negotiators often enter disputes assuming: (1)
the payoffs to different parties are zero-sum, and (2) that the other party's
interests are incompatible with their own. Wrongly assuming that the sum of all
the gains plus all the losses is zero, negotiators can end up with sub-optimal
outcomes. This award will support Dr.Thompson in carrying out laboratory studies
on negotiation behavior, and community-based research to establish the external
validity of laboratory research findings and to explore methods for producing
more effective conflict resolution in real social groups. Dr. Thompson's work
has been and will continue to be very effective in developing theory and
insights for the pervasive and important problem of improving interpersonal
conflict resolution.
