9729328 Sconiers The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) is
establishing four implementation centers - one National Center and three
Curriculum Centers - to provide resources for implementing the elementary school
instructional materials in mathematics developed with support from NSF (Everyday
Mathematics, Investigations in Number, Data, and Space, and Math Trailblazers).
The four centers will combine the experience of the developers of these
instructional materials and focus their efforts on the issues that schools and
teachers confront as they adopt and implement reform mathematics curricula. The
National Center will be housed at COMAP and will cooperate with similar centers
for secondary and middle school implementation at Ithaca College and the
University of Missouri, respectively, with the center for K-12 implementation at
the Education Development Center, and with the Curriculum Centers to assist
schools and districts with issues related to the successful adoption and
implementation of the three curricula. Each of the three Curriculum Centers is
associated with one of the instructional materials development projects at the
elementary school level and will work with schools and districts on issues
specific to the instructional materials associated with that Center.
