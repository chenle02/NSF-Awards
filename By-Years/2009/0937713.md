The mission of the Disasters Roundtable is to facilitate and enhance
communication and the exchange of ideas among scientists, practitioners, and
policy makers in order to identify emerging issues related to natural,
technological, and other types of disasters. To accomplish this objective, the
Roundtable convenes public workshops which provide a forum for discussion on
issues related to the understanding and mitigation of disasters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of intellectual merit, the Roundtable brings
together scientific and technical experts on hazards and disasters to identify,
discuss, and advance issues that require regional, national, and global
attention. Multidisciplinary scientific groups are involved in the discussions,
reflecting the nature of the risks posed by hazards and disasters to society and
the areas of knowledge that must be advanced to counter such risks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the standpoint of broader impacts, the Roundtable is
a neutral meeting ground for scientists, practitioners, and policy makers to
exchange information and ideas. It also provides a venue to increase the
public's understanding of critical issues related to hazard vulnerability and
the science and engineering associated with hazard mitigation, and disaster
preparedness, response and recovery.
