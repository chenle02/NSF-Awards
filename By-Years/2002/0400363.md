In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry and Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry Programs of the Chemistry Division and the Molecular
Biophysics Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Profs.
Charles M. Knobler and William M. Gelbart of University of California, Los
Angeles will conduct collaborative experimental and theoretical research on the
physics of encapsulation of charged polymers in virus-like capsid containers . A
variety of experimental techniques will be used, including traditional
biochemical methods, as well as atomic force microscopy and light-scattering
studies. The theoretical aspect of the work will involve bringing together a
variety of traditional theoretical tools to bear on this difficult problem.

The studies by Profs. Knobler and Gelbart should help to provide the kind of
basic information necessary to understand the mechanics of encapsidation of
viral RNA. In addition, the types of information obtained from this study should
also be useful in understanding a variety of other biophysical processes, such
as the formation of chromosomes, and the research should help to guide
biomimetic design of drug-delivery vehicles. The students and postdoctoral
fellows working with Profs. Knobler and Gelbart should benefit from
participating in a unique, interdisciplinary effort.
