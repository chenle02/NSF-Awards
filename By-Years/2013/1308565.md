Causes and consequences of early reproduction in mangroves invading salt marshes

Worldwide, tropical mangroves are expanding their ranges into temperate salt
marsh habitat. In some locations, mangrove seedlings reproduce much earlier than
usual, only one to two years after establishing. This precocious reproduction
may facilitate rapid invasion of mangroves into salt marshes by shortening
generation times of the invading plants. Shorter generation time allows the
leading edge of the mangrove invasion to move at an even faster pace than with
climate change alone. This research will investigate the causes of precocious
reproduction in invasive mangroves and the ecological consequences of precocious
reproduction on mangroves invading salt marshes. Research methods include field
and laboratory experiments and ecological modeling.

The study will contribute to understanding of floral induction, which is well
understood in Arabidopsis but is more complex in trees experiencing complex
interactions of light quality and quantity, photoperiod, temperature and water
stress. This system is ideal to test how rapid life history changes affect the
success of an invasive species. The fellowship will broaden participation in
biology by preparing a minority researcher for a scientific leadership position
in academia, attracting diverse undergraduates to participate in research, and
creating an educational exhibit from research findings. The fellow will receive
training in physiological methods and ecological modeling, and will mentor
undergraduate researchers, preparing her for a research and teaching career in
biology. Results from this study will be developed into an exhibit for public
display at the Smithsonian Marine Ecosystems Exhibit in Ft. Pierce, Florida.
