Paleozoic and Mesozoic silicic alkaline plutonism is developed on a batholith
scale in Transbaikalia, Russia, within belts 1000's of kilometers long and
spanning a time period of hundreds of millions of years. The petrogenesis of
these rocks will be investigated through a multi- disciplinary research project
involving field, isotopic and petrological studies. By combining detailed
studies of individual plutonic complexes spanning a wide range of age with
regional studies along the length of the magmatic belts, the chemical and
isotopic variations of the alkaline granitoid magmas in time and space will be
delineated. Integration of detailed outcrop-scale studies with regional
geochemical systematic and field relationships will help to explain why this
region produces such prodigious volumes of silicic alkaline magma during the
Paleozoic and Mesozoic, and may lead to considerable advances in our
understanding of continental anorogenic magmatism.
