This project provides the opportunity for up to 20 groups of undergraduate
students a year to visit the University of North Texas Accelerator Laboratory to
perform nuclear physics experiments. These groups would come primarily from
colleges and universities within a day's drive from the laboratory. A 2.7 MeV
Van de Graaf accelerator is being upgraded with a scattering chamber reserved
for student use. In addition, the accompanying faculty will have experience and
contacts that can strengthen nuclear physics programs at the home institutions.
Results and the description of experiments will be published in the appropriate
places.
