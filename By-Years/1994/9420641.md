9420641 This analysis of the dynamics of a stable atmospheric boundary layer is
based on a history of antarctic katabatic wind studies and the principal
investigator's work on boundary layer dynamics at South Pole Station. Several
hypotheses have been advanced to explain a number of consistently observed
features of katabatic winds. These include cold drainage flows driven by
radiative cooling, warm surface temperatures, and downward mixing of cold air
without depleting the negative buoyancy driving the flow. These hypotheses,
reasonable when considered individually, have not been proven quantitatively in
an integrated manner. This study will use high resolution models to simulate
these flows in realistic topography, using conditions derived from the fairly
extensive number of analytical studies that currently exist in the published
literature. A regional hydrostatic model containing a high resolution boundary
layer will be used to study relationships among the occurrence and strength of
these events, the synoptic setting, regional radiative cooling rates, and
regional geomorphological characteristics. A very high resolution compressible
model will be applied to a single valley to simulate details of the flow's
evolution, interaction with topography, and exchange of energy within the
atmosphere and with the underlying surface. ***
