Chemistry Departments engaged in front-line research use computers with graphics
terminals for the dual purposes of carrying out rapid calculations and for
studying and displaying important chemical structures. This award from the
Chemical Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of Duke
University to acquire a computer system with a graphics terminal. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the
following: 1) Ab initio calculations of the NMR chemical shift 2) Conformational
studies of carbohydrates 3) Computer simulations of the molecular structure and
dynamics of liquids and disordered solids 4) Chemometric analysis of retention
data 5) Free radical macrocyclization 6) Protonated base pairs and cross-strand
mutagenisis
