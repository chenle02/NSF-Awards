This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project covers the development
of an innovative tool called resonant holographic interferometric spectroscopy
(RHIS) to address the challenges presented in multi-phase combusting
environments. The innovation is the development of an instrument capable of
simultaneously and quantitatively measuring multi-phase components in combustion
based on revolutionary advances in spectroscopic holographic techniques and
applications. Implementation of real-time RHIS will allow researchers direct
access to quantitative imaging of parameters such as the species concentrations,
gas temperature, and particle distribution and size within combusting sprays.
Advances in novel photorefractive material enables the instantaneous writing and
reading of holographically stored spray and flow field data, thus eliminating
the conventional, tedious process of exposing and developing film plates. The
relevance is that researchers will have for the first time a user-friendly tool
that is capable of real-time, nonintrusive, quantitative, combusting spray
imaging.
