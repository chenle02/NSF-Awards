This proposal is to develop instrumentation to study the morphology and
organization of a cell during detachment of the cell from a surface. The
detachment will be caused by aspiration through a micropipette; observations of
the cell-substrate interface will be made using total internal reflection
fluorescence. Cell adhesion plays a crucial role in both biomedical and
bioprocessing problems such as bioreactor design, tumor cell metastasis and the
triggering of inflammatory responses. The proposed methodology should greatly
facilitate quantitative, engineering-oriented research in these important areas.
