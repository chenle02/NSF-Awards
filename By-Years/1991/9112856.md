Global environmental change is a prime example of what economists can al
externality. Each country may produce emissions which affect the welfare of all
other countries. In choosing an appropriate level of emissions, each country
will take into account the costs it imposes on itself, but may neglect or
minimize the importance of the costs it imposes on others. Even if the magnitude
of the potential cost are well-understood to the afflicted parties, it may be
difficult to design an appropriate regulatory mechanism, if the regulator
doesn't have access to such cost information. This project is concerned with the
theoretical and experimental investigation of compensation mechanisms, a new
class of mechanisms for internalizing externalities. The project investigates
several theoretical extensions of these mechanisms, paying particular attention
to different information structures. These mechanisms are also tested in the
laboratory to see how they work in practice.
