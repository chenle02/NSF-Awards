9409272 Fisher The long-range goal of this research program is to gain
understanding of the chemistry of low-temperature plasmas. For further progress
in plasma technology to occur, it is imperative to supplement empirical
knowledge with solid understanding of the basic chemical processes involved. We
will determine the reactivity of plasma radicals at the surface of depositing
films using the IRIS (Imaging of Radicals Interacting with Surfaces) technique
that combines spatially-resolved laser-induced fluorescence with plasma
molecular beams. We will examine plasma deposited thin films as well as plasma
environments that produce films with desired qualities. Several analytical
methods will be used to characterize plasma environments and deposited films.
These include optical emission spectroscopy (OES), laser-induced fluorescence,
and light-scattering in the plasmas. %%% Plasmas have many industrial
applications, including thin film deposition and etching, surface modification,
and polymer synthesis. Plasma deposition is particularly versatile for
production of thin films and also provides environmentally-clean routes to
materials. A primary aim of this work is to establish plasma environments
conducive to production of particular film qualities or plasma species. This
research will contribute to improving the general performance of advanced
devices and integrated circuits used in computing, information processing, and
telecommunications. ***
