This proposal requests funding to subsidize student-related travel expenses
incurred by US university students attending the 2016 edition of the annual
North American Power Symposium (NAPS). NAPS 2016 will be hosted by the
University of Denver in Denver, CO, from September 18 to September 20, 2016.
NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship from the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and is aimed primarily at a student
audience. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of papers in NAPS are
presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science
Foundation in the past, which has positively influenced student participation.
Based on the attendance trend from previous years, it is anticipated that the
subsidy provided through this grant can significantly increase the number of
students participating in NAPS in this year as well. In addition to providing
subsidized accommodation for students, the organizers' efforts to foster and
encourage student participation include a comprehensive student program, tours
of nearby attractions, and a student paper competition with awards. Moreover,
measures will be taken to encourage participation of women and underrepresented
minorities in NAPS.
