ITR/DDDAS Generalized Polynomial Chaos: Parallel Algorithms for Modeling and
Propagating Uncertainty in Physical and Biological Systems

The applications we target are prototype problems in bioengineering and in
nanotechnology. The coupled nature of such problems and the many parameters
involved provide a good testbed for evaluating the performance of the new
algorithms at resolutions from 0.1 to 1 billion degrees-of-freedom. The sources
of uncertainty may be caused by incomplete knowledge or fluctuations in boundary
or initial conditions, geometric domain, transport coefficients, mechanical
properties, and other external forcing or volumetric sources.

The proposed work will have significant and broad impact as it will establish a
composite error bar in large-scale simulations and will enable numerical
stochastic approaches to large-scale simulations of physical and biological
systems. It will also benefit many other fields including climate and
network/web traffic modeling, where current uncertainty modeling approaches are
inadequate. Stochastically simulated responses can serve as sensitivity analysis
that could potentially guide experimental work and dynamic instrumentation.
