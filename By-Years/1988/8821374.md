This proposal seeks a modest level of funding to update and expand an earlier,
highly influential study by this investigator. The previous study, completed
just over a decade ago, made a major contribution to the quantitative analysis
of risks and to the study of the regulation of risks by helping to place the
health risks of various activities in perspective. In particular, reviewers
commented on the ability of the earlier study to inform debates about the
willingness of society to spend money to save a life across a variety of
situations. However, this earlier study is both outdated (there have been
important changes in risk management regulations in the past 10 years) and
incomplete (there have been important changes in the nature of risky activities
in the past 10 years). Thus the proposed study will be able to lead to better
theory, because it will aid the study of risk comparisons, as well as better
policy, because the results of the new study should quickly be substituted by
decision makers for the less-relevant results of the older study. The project is
unusual for the DRMS program, but it is highly supported because it is
straightforward, important, and the policy-relevance is demonstrably high.
