9709717 Silverstein Columbia University proposes to design a major outcomes
study, heading a coalition of public and private institutions that provide
laboratory experiences for K-12 teachers. While enhancement of teachers through
laboratory experiences is widespread and enthusiastically backed by many
professionals, the evidence of impact of such experiences is primarily
subjective self-reports by those organizing the experiences or by teacher
participants. Whether strong, outcome-oriented evaluation research can be
carried out in this setting, with access to appropriate data, is a matter of
conjecture. This preliminary study will identify what information is available
and how other data might be collected from various types of teacher enhancement
providers.
