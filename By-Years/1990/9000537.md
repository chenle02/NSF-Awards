This application requests partial support for the 1990 FASEB Summer Research
Conference on Retinoids. This conference is scheduled to be held June 17-22,
1990 at the Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, VT. The field of retinoid
research has expanded in the last decade to include scientists from diverse
areas. The major goal of this conference is to provide a common forum to
scientists from different countries and backgrounds to learn about the latest
developments in retinoid research and share their ideas with colleagues. This is
particularly important for junior researchers who are finding productive and
stimulating environments for their future endeavors. The conference will provide
a poster discussion session to maximize active participation by junior
researchers. Research on retinoids is important for understanding cell
communication, development and differentiation, phototransduction in vision, and
regulation of gene expression. This conference will provide the opportunity for
researchers working in these diverse areas to discuss their common concerns and
develop new approaches that will increase basic knowledge of the function of
these important biological molecules.
