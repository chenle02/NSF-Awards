This one-year award provides travel support and living expenses to Roberto
Coronado, University of Wisconsin for his collaboration with Caroline Strube of
the Universite Claude Bernard in Lyon, France. The overall objective of this
project is to investigate the functional role of the beta-one subunit of the
muscle dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor. Dr. Coronado will visit Lyon to learn new
recording techniques for large cells. The project takes advantage of techniques
developed by the French group. It addresses questions about the possible
participation of the DHP receptor in neuromuscular disease.
