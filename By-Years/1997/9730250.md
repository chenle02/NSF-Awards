9730250 McGehee The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities plans to introduce
middle school students to the notion that there are many possible shapes for a
three-dimensional universe. The students learn by example, using paper and
scissors activities, Web-based computer games, and a computer-animated video to
explore a few of the simplest possible universes in an intuitive, hands-on way.
These materials are designed to spark the interest of students at risk of being
turned off to mathematics. The project team will develop a preliminary version
of the one-week unit in the spring of 1998. Piloting and field-testing by a
broader group of teachers and their students will follow the design phase. The
unit will be published and presented at NCTM.
