In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry
Division, Professor Michael Harmata of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Missouri-Columbia will explore the development of methods for the
generation of allylic cations under mild conditions and study their
[4+3]-cycloadditions with dienes. Silyloxyacroleins will be prepared and treated
with catalytic amounts of chiral Lewis acids in the presence of dienes. Such
studies will also be conducted with vinylogs of these species. Chloroketones and
various derivatives will be treated with chiral amine bases in the presence of
dienes in anticipation of the generation of oxyallylic cations bonded to chiral
counterions able to induce stereoselectivity in subsequent reactions. Silver
salts of chiral non-nucleophilic anions will be used similarly, as will chiral
thioureas with chloroketone derivatives. Finally, the photoionization of certain
derivatives of allylic alcohols and the gold-catalyzed generation of allylic
cations from selected esters of allylic alcohols will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The [4+3]-cycloaddition reaction results directly in the synthesis of
seven-membered rings, a substructure of a vast number of compounds that are
biologically important. Further, studies from the Harmata group and others have
demonstrated that this reaction can lead to a variety of ring sizes, increasing
molecular complexity of simple starting materials in short order to produced
value-added structures economically. The successful results of this work could
positively impact the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and specialty chemical
industries. In addition, this project will provide excellent training of
students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in the
sciences.
