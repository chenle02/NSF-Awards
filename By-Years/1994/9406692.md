The long term goal of this work is to understand how the hormonal and
developmental signals which control the process of seed maturation in plants are
integrated into the larger program of plant embryogenesis. This investigator
proposes to continue his analysis of a key regulatory gene in this pathway
identified by the vp1 mutant of maize and its apparent homolog, ABI3, in
Arabidopsis. The functional complexity of VP1 suggests that interactions with
other protein factors play a central role in its function. The P.I. will use
both biochemical and genetic approaches that will identify and allow him to
clone genes which may interact with VP1 and ABI3. Though VP1 and ABI3 share
significant homology, the proteins are highly divergent in regions known to be
functionally important in VP1. The P.I. will also determine the extent to which
VP1 and ABI3 sequences are functionally interchangeable in maize cells and in
transgenic Arabidopsis. This will also provide a functional map of ABI3,
comparable to that in hand for VP1; it will also aid in bringing the genetics
available in Arabidopsis to bear on the maturation pathway and ABI3 function.
The P.I. also plans to analyze new mutants in the maturation pathway identified
in both maize and Arabidopsis. He is specifically interested in identifying new
mutations that affect VP1 or ABI3 expression or function.
