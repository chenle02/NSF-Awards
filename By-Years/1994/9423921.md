9423921 Eastwood Northern Arizona University (NAU), in collaboration with the
Lowell Observatory and the National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO),
will operate an Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in astronomy.
Each summer, eight undergraduate students will be selected, in a national
competition, to carry out research in Flagstaff, Arizona with an astronomer from
NAU, Lowell Observatory, or a visitor from another NURO institution. The
students' research activities will be supplemented by their attending a lecture
series on current astronomical topics. The lecture series will start with talks
by the REU site director on astronomical techniques and then talks will be
presented by various astronomers in the Flagstaff area about their research.
Students will receive university credit for this lecture series. Each student
will have the opportunity to observe at Lowell's 31 inch telescope equipped with
NURO's instrumentation. In addition to the lecture series, the students will
write a scientific paper. At the end of the summer session, the students will
present their work orally to astronomers and to the other students. The students
will be housed in one of the NAU dormitories.
