Driven by the continuing demands of higher throughput and
better&lt;br/&gt;quality in the electronics industry, motion requirement of
mechanical&lt;br/&gt;components is becoming increasingly stringent in terms of
speed and&lt;br/&gt;precision. At such performance regimes, mechanical
vibration,&lt;br/&gt;electrical saturation, and system nonlinearity become the
main&lt;br/&gt;bottlenecks. Based on the academic/industry collaboration
initiated&lt;br/&gt;by the PI's, a promising input iteration approach has
been&lt;br/&gt;proposed to take these issues into account, instead of the
traditional&lt;br/&gt;input shaping approach, which is only effective for linear
systems&lt;br/&gt;with a small number of resonant modes. This research will
address the&lt;br/&gt;convergence, performance, and robustness of the iterative
refinement&lt;br/&gt;algorithm, enhance its effectiveness by including on-line
optimization&lt;br/&gt;and general trajectory tracking, validate and demonstrate
the results&lt;br/&gt;experimentally on several precision motion testbeds, and
implement on&lt;br/&gt;industrial electronic packaging machines. Because of the
presence of&lt;br/&gt;motion control in applications small and large, including
MEMS&lt;br/&gt;actuation, micro-manufacturing, disk drives, and machine tools,
it is&lt;br/&gt;anticipated that the algorithms disseminated based on this
research&lt;br/&gt;will have broad applicability to diverse manufacturing
industries. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the precision motion testbeds developed for
this research&lt;br/&gt;will be used in undergraduate control courses to aide
teaching of&lt;br/&gt;modeling and control design of high performance motion
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
