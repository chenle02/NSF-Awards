9300042 Francis This project consists of a series of real time interactive
computer animation programs for mathematical visualization on workstations. This
software will be available to the networked scientific community by anonymous
ftp from a server located at the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications. These short (500-1500 line) programs will be written in simple C
and use the generic graphics primitives in the Iris gl-library. They will be
exemplary codes, intended to help research mathematicians to write their own
code solving similar visualization problems. These programs will treat topics of
current interest to mathematicians and mathematically trained scientists. This
software will be supported by manual pages, tutorials and an informal bulletin
board.
