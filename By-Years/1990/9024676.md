This award will support collaborative research in solar system astronomy between
Dr. Douglas Lin, University of California at Santa Cruz, and three British
scientists: Dr. Sverre Aarseth, Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University,
and Drs. John Papaloizou and Philip Palmer, School of Mathematical Sciences,
Queen Mary and Westfield College, London. The objective of the project is to
investigate the formation of prototerrestrial planets and protogiant planetary
cores in the solar nebula environment. The specific tasks are: 1) to develop an
analytical model for the dynamics of planetesimals, 2) to carry out N-body
numerical simulations to examine the dynamical evolution and mass coagulation of
planetesimals, 3) to investigate the effects of hydrodynamic drag and tidal
interaction on the dynamics of planetesimals and protoplanets, and 4) to
determine the dynamical impact of protoplanets on the structure and evolutions
of the solar nebula. These theoretical investigations will be carried out with
the aid of analytic formalisms and numerical schemes recently developed by the
investigators. Data from solar system exploration and ground based observations
of protostellar disks around young stellar objects will be used to constrain
theoretical models. The project will benefit from the complementary expertise of
the investigators and their successful history of past collaboration. Results of
this research will contribute to the understanding of the origin of the solar
system, one of the most outstanding problems in astrophysics and planetary
science.
