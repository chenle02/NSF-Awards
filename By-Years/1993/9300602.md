The objective of this Workshop is to bring together in one place a group of
specialists of localization and bifurcation analysis of geomaterials, to collect
and debate the main results obtained during the past three years, and to
evaluate the perspectives open by new experimental methods and
analytical/numerical tools. The scope of the Workshop includes the experimental
methods and results, analytical solutions, and numerical methods/solutions.
Besides fundamental research findings, applications in mining, petroleum, and
building industries will be presented.
