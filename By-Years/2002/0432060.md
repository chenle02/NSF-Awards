The University of New Hampshire on behalf of the State of New Hampshire will
conduct an 18 month collaborative state-wide planning process involving
academia, K-12 education, private sector, and local government as a participant
of the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the planning process are to (1)
identify barriers to progress and development in science and technology in the
state; (2) create a statewide New Hampshire EPSCoR Committee; and (3) establish
priorities for research infrastructure improvements in New Hampshire to
stimulate competitiveness for federal research and development (R&amp;D)
funding.
