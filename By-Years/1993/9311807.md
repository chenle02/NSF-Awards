This study is the conduct and analysis of typical manufacturing plants to
determine their use or non-use of some 10-15 production technologies. It is a
follow-up, extension, and improvement of a pilot survey completed earlier. The
National Association of Manufacturers is cooperating and partially supporting
this study. Both "hard and soft" technologies are included. The sample of plants
is about 5,000 requests to complete the survey form and include firms or all
sizes. Respondents are asked to indicate their skill level with regard to each
technology, reasons for adoption or non-adoption, changes over the recent past,
and plans for the near future. Measures of output will be related to individual
production technology used by industry. Aggregate results to be reported in a
report, professional journals, trade press and the data and information
collected (without firm/plant identifiers) to be made available to others
