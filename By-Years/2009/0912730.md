This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to deliver a low-
power real-time Java virtual machine suitable for long-lived deeply embedded
applications. The proposed system will leverage research and publicly-available
open source software components and deliver a clean-room Java implementation
that promises to outperform competing implementations with a dramatically
reduced power and memory footprint.

Embedded real time software is pervasive - it can be found in automobiles,
trains, aircraft, satellites, medical devices, sensor networks, among other
prevalent applications. Currently such software is written in low-level
languages, which drives up costs and delays deployment. Shifting the programming
model of embedded real time software towards Java would: Reduce the cost of
developing software by allowing greater code reuse and giving companies access
to a larger pool of programmers. If successful, the current effort will provide
a new tool for embedded systems development which benefits significantly from
the strengths of Java and the wide pool of talented developers that currently
use Java.
