Partial support is requested to defray room and board costs for graduate
students and some invited speakers attending the West Coast Regional
Developmental Biology Conference for 1991. The conference is to be held on April

tentative schedule calls for about thirty speakers, reflecting as full a mix of
gender, race and degree of professional advancement as is compatible with the
primary criterion of scientific excellence. Topics to be addressed in formal
sessions include: 1) Fertilization and Activation, 2) Determination and Fate, 3)
Axonal Growth and Guidance, 4) Migration, and 5) Patterning. In addition, all
attendees will be invited to contribute to a formal poster session.
