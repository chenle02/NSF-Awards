Under the guidance of Dr. Michael Jochim, Mr. Herbert Maschner will conduct
doctoral dissertation research in the Tebenkof Bay region of Southeast Alaska.
Previous work by Mr. Maschner has indicated the presence of seven archaeological
sites, ranging from small to large, in this limited area. The occupants, he
believes, are directly ancestral to the native American Tlingit who occupy the
region today. He shall map all seven sites and conduct excavations at four of
them. Preliminary work shows that all contain house depressions and a series of
1 x 1 meter test pits will be dug in a selected sample. A number of column
samples will also be collected from midden deposits in front and behind the
houses. The resulting materials will permit the sites to be dated and, also,
provide information on both social organization and diet. Hopefully, changes in
these parameters can be traced over time. The wider region will also be surveyed
for other sites and resource procurement areas will be mapped. This project is
extremely interesting because it will shed light on the processes which lead to
social complexity. The Tlingit developed ranked chiefly societies in prehistoric
times and are unusual because a hunting and gathering (and not agricultural)
economy provided a base for this transition. Theorists disagree about the
processes which underlie this change. Some argue that population growth and
resultant resource scarcity is the causal factor. Others believe that
development of differential access to resources is responsible. Mr. Maschner's
research will help to select between these two options. This research is also
important because it will increase our understanding of traditional subsistence
adaptations in northern environments. It may help to formulate policy for
present day Alaskan aboriginal populations and help determine optimal use of
natural resources. It will also aid in the training of a promising young
scientist.
