An autoclave (sterilizer) will be used for a wide range of biological studies,
from plant tissue culture to the in vitro culture of mammalian cells. All of the
research is to be conducted in the Carver Research Foundation Laboratory
building by a team of fourteen researchers from several areas of the Tuskegee
University campus. The single autoclave that served the researchers in the CRFL
was 25 years old and had been repaired numerous times; it finally became
inoperable. There is a small autoclave nest door in a science building, but it
was too small for some projects, its major use was for classes, and it was often
non-functioning. Therefore, a new autoclave was desperately needed to carry out
research efficiently in CRFL.
