The microcomputer laboratory is used for instrument control and analysis of
experimental data by both scienc and non-science majors in physics and
engineering courses. Also, the computers are used for problem solving in applied
mathematics and engineering courses and to teach Fortran and CAD to engineering
students. A scientific computer literacy course required of all science and
mathematics majors uses the laboratory. Students are able to collect, store, and
analyze large quantities of data from rapidly changing phenomena. Through
interfacing, the computers act as a variety of instruments and, at the same
time, provide students with valuable experience in using computers. The grantee
provides funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.
