This project establishes DNA sequencing and sequence analysis modules in
nonmajors biology labs (500 students per year), 7 majors freshman biology labs
(200 students per year), upper-division genetics lab (20 students per year), and
in the proposed Forensic Science Molecular Biology lab (20 students per year).
The department is also upgrading the existing undergraduate DNA Sequencing and
Sequence Analysis class (16 students per year) and upper-division and graduate-
level classes where sequencing is already a component of the labs (40 students
per year). Undergraduate research involving DNA sequencing is also being
upgraded. In order to accomplish these goals, the department is obtaining a high
sample capacity, fluorescent DNA sequencer. This machine, together with student-
tested, hair-follicle polymerase chain reaction protocol, allows a very large
number of non-science-majors and freshman biologists to amplify, sequence, and
analyze a portion of their own DNA. Experiments like this are essential to
achieving a greater public understanding of the uses and limitations of
molecular biology in general and genome and DNA analysis in particular. In the
upper-division courses, this machine is improving the quality of instruction by
allowing students to learn automated sequencing as well as manual sequencing.
The high capacity of the machine and the fact that it does not involve
radioactivity also allows a much larger number of upper-division students to
sequence in either the advanced lab classes or as part of their own research.
The results of this project will be widely disseminated because of the large
number of students involved. The students co-author papers and present abstracts
and talks which will ensure a broad dissemination to the professional community.
Finally, community college students in the Summer Bridge to the Baccalaureate
Program and middle and high school students in the Saturday College Program can
also learn about sequencing and sequence analysis in this project.
