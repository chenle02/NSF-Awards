9522879 Kerner This research is to develop a nondestructive prototype system to
be used at manufacturing sites for measuring surface contamination on silicon
wafers by light elements. A soft x-ray source will be used to optimize the anode
material and electron beam focus. A monochromator will be designed to
efficiently deliver radiation to the specimen for maximum signal intensity and
minimal spectral "noise". Additional research will be conducted using very
bright x-ray sources to maximize the efficiency of the technique by clarifying
the limitations and guiding future developments. As the requirements for surface
contamination become more strict, existing commercial instruments become less
adequate. The development of the Surface Contamination Analyzer for Light
Elements (SCALE) will meet the semiconductor industry's present and future needs
for measuring light elements, and can be used in other industries to analyze
trace elements in solution.
