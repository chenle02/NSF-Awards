Three-dimensional "alpha shapes" will be explored and evaluated as a technique
for describing and recognizing objects. This problem has important applications
in biomedical research and instruction, clinical practice, and scientific
visualization. Alpha-shapes have a well developed theory and appear promising.
The first task is to complete a global correspondence scheme. Next, a pose-
determination algorithm will be developed, based on matching Delaunay graphs.
Initially, scenes to be described and recognized will consist of single,
isolated objects. Eventually, methods will be developed to decompose complex
scenes into subparts.
