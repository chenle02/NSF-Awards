Hu/Vitek abstract

Large-scale compute-cycle sharing for complex and large scientific applications
is a long standing challenge in distributed computing. Many cycle-sharing
systems have been developed and have delivered orders of magnitude improvement
in available resources. Nevertheless they are limited in their performance or
capability. Furthermore, other forms of resource sharing and coordination are
needed to achieve truly distributed access to scientific infrastructure.

The goal of this project is contribute to the national science and technology
infrastructure by developing enabling technologies for virtual laboratories open
to researchers from all disciplines. This infrastructure will leverage resources
in peer-to-peer computing and programming languages to deliver an alternative
architectural model for resource sharing over wide area networks. The self-
organizing aspects of peer-to-peer networks promise to eliminate much of the
difficulty required to configure and maintain a large-scale globally distributed
computing and control system, and decentralization removes the potential
bottleneck and single point of failure of centralized service nodes. This
project's contributions will be to provide abstractions for Peer-to-peer
Computing based on extensions to the object-oriented programming model and to
develop a Peer-to-peer Infrastructure which extends the current peer-to-peer
networks developed for routing and data-centric applications.

This project will work collaborativey with the DARPA Program Composition for
Embedded Systems (PCES) initiative to apply the proposed resource-balancing
techniques developed in this project to sensor networks and distributed real-
time systems of national importance.

The educational impact of the proposed research includes integration of advanced
distributed systems research into both undergraduate and graduate curricula, and
outreach activities that involve high schools students into active participation
in Internet-scale computing.
