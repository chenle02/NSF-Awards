The thrust of this project is to attack problems faced by institutions of
providing a high quality introductory computer science curriculum while
developing strategies to better utilize the potential of student interaction in
their learning process. This project brings together a diverse group of 30
computer science educators for an ongoing process in the application of peer
learning to the introductory areas of Computer Science education. Invited
participants will address problems of teaching introductory courses by this peer
learning process (ie., students learning in collaboration, and with some faculty
guidance). This forum provides a hands-on environment for using and developing
activities with this method. Outcomes from the work include the instructional
materials produced along with a common assessment of their application to the
faculty members home Computer Science program. A final report will be produced
at a follow-up workshop in the 2nd year, and made widely available to the CS
community through the WWW.
