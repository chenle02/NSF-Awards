The investigator will undertake research on the history of statistics during the
first half of the twentieth century. The research will examine major lines of
statistical development through the works of Karl and Egon Pearson, Ronald
Fisher, William S. Gosset, Jerzy Neyman, Harold Hotelling, Harold Jeffreys,
Jimmie Savage, and Abraham Wald. The emphasis will be on the development of
concept and on the interplay of theoretical development and applications in the
physical, social, and biological sciences. Particular lines to be pursued
include the development of parametric estimation, the emergence of mathematical
statistics as a specialization, the relationship of Neyman-Pearson theory and
Fisherian statistics, the relationship of the theory of games and statistical
decision theory, the development of multivariate analysis, modern Bayesian
statistics, and categorical data analysis. The research will be based upon
detailed study of original sources, both published and unpublished. It is
expected that the research will yield a greater knowledge of the historical
development of modern statistical methods, and thereby a deeper understanding of
the properties and limitations of these methods. For example, by studying the
spread of multivariate analysis from physical science to social science, where
the same numerical algorithms are employed but with an entirely different
conceptual framework, some light will be shed on the current debates on the
appropriateness of such applications, including the use of regression to assess
evidence of discrimination in hiring, the evaluation of educational programs,
and the estimation of census undercount. By understanding the role of statistics
in past questions of public policy, including temperance, immigration, and
military affairs, we will be better able to assess the statistical component of
modern policy questions.
