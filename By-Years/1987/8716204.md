Extratropical cyclones dominate the weather and precipitation in temperate
latitudes. The precipitation pattern is often organized in a banded structure.
The horizontal scales of the frontal rainbands range from a few kilometers along
the cold fronts to several tens of kilometers observed in both the warm and cold
sectors of a frontal system. Several theories have been put forward to explain
the organization of frontal rainbands; presently the conditional symmetric
instability appears capable of explaining several types of rainbands. The most
important next stage in the development of this subject is the implementation of
conditional symmetric instability in numerical models. Using the mesoscale model
of the Pennsylvania State University, Professors Warner and Clark will examine
the model characteristics required of a realistic simulation of the rainband
structures. The bulk of the rainfall received in temperate latitudes is
associated with the passage of either warm or cold fronts. This work, when
successfully completed, represents an important step forward in the numerical
prediction of mesoscale precipitation.
