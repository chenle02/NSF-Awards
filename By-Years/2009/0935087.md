The project supports graduate student participation in the 26th International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2009). Specifically, the project supports
travel to the conference for those who might not otherwise be able to attend for
financial reasons and organizes a student poster-presentation program that will
facilitate one-on-one discussions and other mentoring with the world's leading
researchers in machine learning. Students will be exposed to state-of-the-art
work by other researchers and will have the opportunity to attend tutorials on
material that is not taught at their home institutions. Participating students
will receive feedback from senior researchers beyond their institutional and
national boundaries. Furthermore, participation in the poster session and
conference will help integrate these students into the research community and
represents a natural integration of research and education.
