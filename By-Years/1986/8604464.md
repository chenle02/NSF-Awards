This is a feasibility evaluation of a new method to evaluate plastic strains in
the interior of solids caused by loading, simple from measurements of surface
displacements. The measurement may be performed by holography, for instance.
Most testing methods are capable of measuring microstructures, residual
stresses, and defects of materials located near free surfaces. However, no
method is currently available for measuring plastic deformations in the interior
of solids. The principle of this novel method is based upon an inverse
application of the boundary integral equation method (BIEM). The body forces due
to plastic strains form the boundary values of displacements and tractions on
interfaces in BIEM. The body forces can be determined inversely from the
boundary values of displacements.
