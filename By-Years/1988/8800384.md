The principal investigator plans to work on problems in mathematical analysis
concerning the representation theory of Lie groups. A suitable example of the
latter is the group of rotations of a sphere. Groups like this are important
because they occur in many areas of mathematics ( e.g. geometry, differential
equations, algebraic number theory, mathematical physics ) as groups of
symmetries. Representation theory allows one to take advantage of symmetries in
solving problems. A portion of the research will focus on a closer investigation
of the Euler characteristic appearing in the Osborne character formula, aiming
to describe the individual terms in this characteristic. The structure and
properties of induced representations of real reductive Lie groups will also be
investigated.
