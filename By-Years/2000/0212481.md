0212481 Berry Under the direction of Prof. Paul Berry at University of
Wisconsin-Madison, this project will study the species and relationships of
Croton, one of the world's largest plant genera, with about 1,300 described
species worldwide. This group was selected because it represents a significant
segment of plant diversity (0.5% of all flowering plants), it is ecologically
and medicinally important (especially in the tropics), yet the species are
notoriously difficult to identify, and nobody has applied modern techniques to
understand the genealogical relationships within the group. The project will
conduct a broad molecular-based phylogenetic study of the genus, targeting about
a fifth of the total species to determine how they relate in an evolutionary and
geographical context. It will systematize a huge body of descriptive literature
and specimens and provide an online database to names, distributions, and images
of crotons. This should facilitate species identification and generation of
regional checklists of the genus for any region of the world. There is a strong
collaborative element in the project, as it will form a research network drawing
upon scores of botanists worldwide who have worked on Croton, as well as
training new students in molecular systematics, database management, and field
work. This project is significant to biology because it will provide a much
better understanding of the species and relationships of one of the largest and
least well understood groups of flowering plants. Croton is used medicinally,
and this project could pinpoint promising groups in the genus for more intensive
pharmacological research. In a broader context, the project seeks to provide an
effective model on how to deal with other large and difficult groups of
organisms - using Internet resources to display images, databases, and
identification aids; forming a research network of investigators worldwide,
including training of graduate and undergraduate students in the U.S. and other
countries; and utilizing cutting-edge molecular tools to establish a solid
scientific framework for naming species and establishing their genealogical
relationships. In this way, the Croton project should contribute significantly
towards the societal goal of cataloging and understanding global biodiversity
and presenting it to the public in a timely fashion and in a readily accessible
format.
