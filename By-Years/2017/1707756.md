In the last two decades, numerous research groups worldwide have produced and
studied elemental ultracold atomic gases, i.e. gases at temperatures just a
millionth or billionth above absolve zero and composed of atoms from a single
element on the periodic table. The applications of these ultracold gas
experiments have been mostly scientific, exploring basic phenomena associated
with quantum mechanics and the physics of many-body systems, but also
increasingly of technological utility, such as efforts to develop sensors that
measure acceleration, rotation, forces, and electromagnetic fields with very
high precision. This project will expand on this work by studying quantum gases
composed of atoms of two different elements. The combination of the two gases in
the same experiment allows for studies of a wider range of quantum phenomena.
Moreover, the combination enables the creation of ultracold gases of molecules,
which are formed by binding together two atoms from the two-element atomic gas.
Molecules respond differently than atoms to external fields and to each other.
Correspondingly, quantum mechanical systems composed of molecular gases will
display different quantum phenomena than atomic gases, and can also serve for
different types of sensors than do atoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More
specifically, this project focuses on gases composed of both lithium and
rubidium atoms. A two-element ultracold atomic gas will be used to study
magnetization order and dynamics in ultracold gases for which the spin degree of
freedom is allowed to evolve dynamically. The largely different masses of the
two elements will allow for studies of interactions between heavy and light
atoms within periodic optical potentials. Finally, the photoassociation of
lithium and rubidium into heteronuclear molecules will be investigated. The
project aims to achieve single-site resolution and control over photoassociation
and photodissociation of atoms trapped within optical lattices.
