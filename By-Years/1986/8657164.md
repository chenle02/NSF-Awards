The project deals with an experimental study of nucleation/glass stability as
affected by chemical diffusion in sililicate glasses and glass.ceramics. The
primary emphasis of the study is to characterize the mechanism(s) and kinetics
of oxidation/reduction in iron.bearing silicate glasses and the effect of the
valence state of iron on glass stability and crystalline nucleation. The results
of this research should suggest novel approaches to the preparation of
glass.ceramic materials through `controlled oxidation', i.e., the
application/manipulation of a chemical potential gradient of oxygen to drive
chemical diffusion and consequent structural rearrangement and crystalline
nucleation in the glass. Controlled oxidation should additionally affect the
equilibrium texture in the glass.plus.crystalline system; the ability to control
this texture, and therefore control certain physical properties of the
glass.ceramic. The oxidation/reduction studies will include glasses of basaltic
composition (both fabricated and natural) in an attempt to characterize the
effect of redox conditions on the kinetics of chemical diffusion and crystalline
nucleation in mafic magmas.
