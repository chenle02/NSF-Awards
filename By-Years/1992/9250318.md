Cooper Union's Department of Electrical Engineering will establish an
undergraduate Computer Networking Laboratory with the primary goal of studying
multimedia (data/voice/image) communications, inter-network connectivity, and
network management. To strengthen the Department's traditional emphasis on open-
ended practical design projects, the facility will be used primarily as a
testbed for implementing and testing innovative hardware/software design
projects in several undergraduate courses. In addition, the laboratory will be
used for hands-on demonstrations accompanying class lectures in the
communications courses and others.The plan calls for a PC-based 16 Mbps Token-
ring local area network (LAN) with voice and image capabilities, an X.25 node
interfacing to the LAN, and several measurement/test instruments. Student
projects will emphasize the design and implementation of interfaces, signal
processing, and protocols to support multimedia services on the LAN,
interconnection of the LAN to the X.25 node and other systems, and
management/monitoring of the networks.
