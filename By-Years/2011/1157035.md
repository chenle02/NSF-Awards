This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This funding renews a CISE Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Auburn University focused on smart
unmanned aerial vehicles (smart UAVs). The students design algorithms and
techniques to safely, securely, and efficiently fly in a limited field a fleet
of autonomous UAVs. A nationwide recruitment process is used to select cohorts
of undergraduate students to participate in an eight-week summer research
program at the host institution. Particular emphasis is placed on recruitment of
students from under-represented populations. The project includes mentoring by
the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and
workshops, student presentations, and field trips and other professional
development opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The
projects are in current research areas that are of interest to the community at
large and that have clear practical applications. The students participate in a
full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to
production and dissemination of research results.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience
to undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups.
The participating faculty members are committed to including under-represented
minority students in their research. Thus this project has the potential to
produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to
advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.
