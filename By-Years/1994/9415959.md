9415959 Drabek This project focuses on disaster-induced employee actions,
including activities and decisions ranging from initial departure from the work
place to stabilized return patterns. These actions occur both prior to certain
impacts (e.g., hurricanes), and after others (e.g., earthquakes). The project,
whose primary data source will be interviews conducted following six major
disasters, will provide a new empirical basis for both theory and applications
in preparedness for such disasters as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods. The
project will fill an important gap in knowledge, since no prior comparative work
has been published on this topic, and will also provide a new empirical base for
a variety of training tools for both emergency managers and private firm
executives. ***
