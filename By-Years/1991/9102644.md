This is a study of the synthesis and processing of novel mixed oxide sol-gel
derived ceramics. The research involves a comprehensive examination of the
fundamental processes controlling the simultaneous hydrolysis of precursors, the
kinetics of gelation and gel to ceramic conversion, as well as the
characterization of the microstructure and electrical properties of the final
products. For the synthesis of the precursors the co-hydrolysis of different
alkoxides will be controlled through the modification of their molecular
structure. The objective of studying the gelation and conversion processes is to
establish the relationship between the molecular structure of precursors, the
structure of the resulting gels, and the structure of the intermediate
crystallites during conversion. A fundamental understanding of the sol-gel
process will lead to new and improved ceramics for electronic and structural
applications.
