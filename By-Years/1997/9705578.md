9705578 Hegg The main objective of this project is to include a parameterization
of heterogeneous droplet chemistry into meteorological models, in particular
MM5, and possibly EURAD. This parameterization will be in the form of a linear
operator applied to a standard bulk parameterization of cloud chemistry. The
modified Eulerian model will be tested against observations for a reasonably
complete case study from the literature. Then a set of sensitivity studies will
be conducted to address four specific issues: 1) To what extent does
heterogeneous cloud chemistry impact chemical deposition? 2) Over what spatial
and temporal scales is this heterogeneous chemistry important? 3) How does the
phase partitioning of water in the clouds quantitatively affect the impact of
heterogeneous chemistry? 4) Are there geographic locations or emissions/climate
scenarios where heterogeneous chemistry is likely to have a particularly large
impact? This effort will lead to an improved understanding of chemical and
physical processes occurring in clouds.
