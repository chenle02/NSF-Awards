ABSTRACT 0204388 Ming Gu U of Calif - Berkeley

The San Andreas Fault zone Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) Pilot Hole will provide
an excellent opportunity for exploring the relationship between fault slip and
the thermal evolution of the crust by studying core samples from varying depths
using two complementary thermochronologic methods. The Pilot Hole, located in
Parkfield less than two kilometers from the San Andreas fault will reach a depth
of 2.1 km. The borehole will intersect Salinian granitic rocks at a depth of
less than 1 km and similar granitic rocks outcrop at the surface within a few
kilometers of the Pilot Hole. We will analyze samples from borehole cuttings at
depth intervals of 100 - 200 m and from the surface outcrops. We will determine
the thermal history of the samples using apatite fission track and U/Th-He
thermochronometers.
