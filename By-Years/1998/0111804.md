0111804 Scales

This grant provides support for the costs of acquiring laboratory equipment to
study elastic wave multiple scattering and resonance ultrasound spectroscopy.
The equipment includes a vibration-isolated optical bench, a 16-bit high-speed
digital oscilloscope board, an arbitrary waveform generation board, lock-in
amplifiers and a low-noise preamplifier. This new equipment will allow us to
make a variety of measurements aimed at understanding and exploiting multiple-
scattering of elastic waves and resonance ultrasound, in order to characterize
the properties of geologic materials. The new equipment will complement our
existing facilities for laser ultrasonics, in particular a scanning laser-
Doppler vibrometer. The equipment will be housed in the Green Center at the
Colorado School of Mines and jointly utilized by the Physical Acoustics
Laboratory and the Rock Properties Laboratory. It will also be available for use
in undergraduate and graduate teaching and research within the Geophysics
Department at CSM. ***
