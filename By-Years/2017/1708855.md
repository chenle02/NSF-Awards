This project addresses the relatively recently observed phenomenon of radio wave
emission by meteor trails. Ionized meteor trails have long been providing
temperature and wind information in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere by
reflecting radio signals. However, the mechanism for radio wave emission by
ablating meteors is largely unknown. Knowledge of meteor emissions is highly
pertinent to ongoing searches for extraterrestrial objects on similar time
scales (seconds to minutes). This project will use radio and video measurements
to explore the structure, time evolution, and formation mechanism of the meteor
radio emissions.Â  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas near the PI's telescope arrays
are instrumented with video cameras. This suite of radio and video measurements
will be used to triangulate the trajectories of the meteors, and take detailed
images to measure the trail's expansion. The telescopes are a community resource
that facilitates astronomical research, and involve undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students at a university serving a large minority population. The
telescope arrays are situated within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, and
engage the public through a dedicated exhibit at the wildlife visitor center.
