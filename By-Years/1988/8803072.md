In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program, McIver will develop methods
aimed at efficiently evaluating Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces. The
results will be used in computing polyatomic rate constants, including
tunnelling effects, for a number of reactions involving radicals and biradicals
using Variational Transition State Theory. The critical bottleneck in such
calculations is the evaluation of the Reaction Path Hamiltonian which underlies
virtually all currently used polyatomic rate theories. Three lines of attack on
this bottleneck will be pursued: development of a formalism which explicitly
relates the Reaction Path Hamiltonian coordinates (the reaction path and
transverse vibration) and coupling constants to potential energy derivatives;
development of techniques for speeding up the calculation of potential energy
surfaces using self consistent field wavefunctions; and implementation of the
methods on a distributed memory parallel computer. The computer codes will be
developed with the aid of symbolic algebra software and a parallel computer
simulator, both of which operate on a modestly configured workstation.
