This project improves our understanding of models of dynamic decisions and
bounded rationality. The research will consider issues of dynamic stochastic
choice by providing axiomatic characterizations of two types of stochastic
dynamic choice rules. These two rules have many properties in common and
coincide in static problems. The key distinction is whether the choice rule
exhibits a preference for flexibility (preferring larger choice sets) or error
aversion (preferring smaller sets). Another component of the research studies
market interaction of agents operating under cognitive constraints such as
limited attention, imperfect memory, and bounded ability to form contingent
plans. The PI develops a new theory to explain how the market mechanism
allocates agents' attention. The model yields a number of predictions: limited
market participation, ex post consumption heterogeneity, and high volatility of
asset prices as compared to the fundamentals.

The PI also studies two dimensions of temporal preferences that can be derived
from a recursive utility model. The goal is to derive and analyze the premium
that an agent is willing to pay for early resolution of consumption uncertainty
and to examine the exact form of the aversion to autocorrelation.

The educational component of the award includes the use of a new collaborative
open science approach to developing a decision theory textbook that will be made
available online at no charge. The planned approach also contributes to graduate
education by enlisting graduate students in textbook authorship.

The project provides foundations for models that are being used in practice,
thereby contributing to our understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. It
also analyzes novel dimensions of preferences and choice. These models are key
to understanding many fundamental issues in economics. The project yields
broader impact because adding new and better tools for analysis improves our
ability to formulate and evaluate economic policy.
