Each year honey bees contribute billions of dollars of value to the United
States economy by pollinating food crops. During the past decade, North American
honey bee populations have declined, primarily because of the death of colonies
during winter. The cause of these losses is mysterious, but one possibility is
that reduced fall populations make winter survival more challenging. It is
difficult to assess threats to bee health because little is known about basic
bee physiology. This project fills gaps in our knowledge of bee reproduction by
using molecular methods to identify brain hormones that regulate the ovaries in
queens, the only females in bee colonies who can lay fertilized eggs. The
results will define the brain regulation of bee reproduction, which can in turn
be used to understand how factors such as pesticides and disease disrupt egg
production and lead to reduced bee populations. Because one of these signals is
an insulin-like peptide, these studies will promote understanding of the role of
insulin in insects. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, with
primary data stored for a minimum of 10 years on secure Wake Forest University
servers in standard formats (Excel, Photoshop). Two educational projects will be
supported by this award. First, undergraduates will investigate the ability of
the honey bee gut to repair diet-induced damage. Students will partner with
local citizen-beekeepers to survey gut health in bee populations in the Piedmont
region of North Carolina. The second is development of an insect hormone
laboratory exercise to be used by 200+ undergraduate biology students at Wake
Forest University every semester. The curricular materials will be made
available to all interested college-level instructors of biology through the
national Association of Biology Laboratory Educators (ABLE). Insect-based
exercises provide a safe, cost-effective tool for introducing students to
concepts of hormone action.
