The project, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on
mass spectrometry. The principal emphasis will be on ion chemistry. The work
promises to lead to new instrumental features which will advance the analytical
application of mass spectrometry and also provide a better understanding of ion
chemistry. The work will focus on four areas related to charge-remote
fragmentation in mass spectrometry, namely energetics, mechanism, extension to
new types of reactions, and identification of neutrals produced in charge-remote
chemistry. Ion chemistry studies will include radical cation chemistry, the
study of ionization potentials of small inorganic ions, and aldol-type reactions
of negative ions. Some aspects of instrumental development will be examined that
relate to ion chemistry. In particular, work will be carried out on Fourier
transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) ion traps.
