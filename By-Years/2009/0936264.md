Dr. Vladimr Aizen of the University of Idaho and Dr. Ding Yongjian of the
Lanzhou Cold and Arid Regions Environmental Engineering Research Institute
proposed a U.S.-China Workshop on changes in surface and ground water in the
Tarim River Basin. This workshop will be held in September, 2009 in Urumqi,
Xinjiang Province, China. The topic for this workshop is important for NSF and
the conference will include 10 U.S. scientists at an early stage in their
careers. This is an extreme climate sensitive area of the globe and is the
world?s largest and most densely populated arid-region, closed-drainage, basin.
This workshop is opportune and can lead to the cooperation in addressing some of
the pressing water use issues in this basin. The goal of this workshop is to
produce an integrated research agenda targeted on science that will support the
efforts of the participating countries to address the important water resources
management issues of this region. This workshop will be supported jointly by the
National Natural Science Foundation of China and the U.S. National Science
Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
