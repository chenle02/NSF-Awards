In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Kenneth Hedberg of Oregon State University will use gas-phase electron
diffraction techniques to study the molecular structures of several different
kinds of systems, including high-temperature species such as fullerenes and
metal halides, molecules with internal rotation such as conjugated and
internally H-bonded structures, and small-ring systems. Normal coordinate
calculations and high-level theoretical calculations will assist with the
formulation of structural models. The aim of this project is to understand the
chemical and physical properties of substances due to the structures and
internal motions of the individual molecules that comprise them. The studies
will result in accurate pictures of the spatial arrangements of the atoms in the
molecules and will yield precise values for bond lengths, bond angles, and
torsion angles. Descriptions of chemical and biological phenomena almost
invariably draw on system models that rely on the such accurate molecular
structures.
