The objective of this research is to employ polymer-producing bacteria under an
in-situ environment to a soil of inferior strength so that the biopolymers
released can serve as a binder in soil particles to enhance the soil strength.
The goal is to provide a cost-effective, environmentally-acceptable, in-place
method to increase the strength of the soil matrix. It could also be possible
that this technology can be extended to minimize risks associated with land
subsidence due to fossil energy exploitation.
