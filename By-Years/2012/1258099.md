Beneficial bacteria are the foundation of health in both plants and animals.
Although disease-causing bacteria have received intensive scientific attention,
the processes that drive the evolution of beneficial bacterial symbioses are
still poorly understood. This project will apply the techniques and conceptual
perspectives of molecular genetics, microbiology and evolutionary biology to
document the genetic processes involved in evolution of beneficial symbiosis.
The project will make use of an unusually tractable experimental model involving
marine animals and their symbiotic bacteria: the symbiosis between bobtail squid
and a light-producing bacterium, Vibrio fischeri. Some strains of Vibrio
fischeri form life-long symbioses with squid and fish, whereas other strains are
free-living in the marine environment. Exploiting the natural variation in this
bacterium, the investigators will compare six V. fischeri strains with diverse
environmental histories and differing initial capacities for colonization of
squid hosts to identify bacterial mutations correlated with successful animal
colonization, and with evolution of beneficial symbiotic interactions. This is
among the first experimental evolution models, and the only natural model, to
explore the mechanistic basis of beneficial host-adaptation in symbiotic
microbes. The project includes interdisciplinary training for several graduate
and undergraduate students, and capitalizes upon an engaging model system to
promote an understanding of evolution and of symbiosis among students at all
educational levels. The project will also develop educational resources for
middle and high school teachers, including hands-on experiments using beneficial
microbes in the classroom.
