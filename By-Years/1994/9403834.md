9403834 Caulfield The proposed research will examine the changing significance
of indigenous knowledge and practice in shaping resource management schemes. The
principal research question examines whether attempts to integrate indigenous
knowledge and practice with Danish management systems have led to more effective
resource management in Greenland. The project seeks to understand what forms of
indigenous knowledge and practice underlie use of renewable resources in West
Greenland, and how indigenous knowledge and practice might contribute to future
sustainable development in Greenland under Home Rule. Ethnohistorical materials
will be analyzed, hunting lists compled and case studies will be carried out
within the framework of the project. These data will additionally be made
available to other North Atlantic projects (NABO) and the Danish Polar Centre.
