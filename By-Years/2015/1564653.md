The proposed program addresses two national crises: (i) the extremely low
persistence rate of underrepresented minority (URM) transfer students to
bachelor degree granting institutions in STEM fields, and (ii) the need for
fundamental research and training in energy related fields. Through the awarding
of scholarship support to low-income, academically talented students, and by
designing, implementing, assessing, and disseminating essential new approaches
to transfer student education, S-POWER will unite students and faculty at both
sending and receiving institutions to collaboratively address Grand Energy
challenges, such as developing materials for energy efficient systems and energy
power management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To implement the above vision, the
investigators will create project-specific teams of faculty and students to
build social and mentoring ties and enable focused educational support
structures, including formal mentoring with industry and implementation of
shared educational pedagogies at both the sending and receiving institutions.
This departs from most traditional transfer student educational processes in
which it is only the sender or receiving institution's responsibility to educate
the student attending each institution. In addition, S-POWER will study and
document additional barriers for URM transfer students, while investigating the
similarities and differences of experiences for students that begin their
academic journey in four-year versus community colleges. The success of the
S-POWER educational pedagogy will be assessed throughout each student's
educational career, and factors that positively influence transfer student
success will be disseminated to the broader educational community.
