This research is concerned with the structure of classical groups over rings,
as well as the structure of algebraic groups over rings and the structure of
gauge groups. Topics to be studied include normal and subnormal subgroups,
isomorphisms and automorphisms, and various factorization problems, including
word length problems. The principal investigator will also pursue the Waring
problem and other problems of additive number theory for various rings including
polynomial and matrix rings. In addition, he will study systems of linear
partial differential equations from the algebraic point of view. This research
is in the general area of algebraic K-theory. It is concerned with a wide
variety of qualitative and quantitative problems related to subgroups of
algebraic groups.
