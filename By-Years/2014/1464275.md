Secure and useable end-user authentication is a major challenge in a modern
society that allocates and relocates more and more resources online. As many
users nowadays carry a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone), authentication
approaches beyond the often-criticized traditional password leverage auxiliary
information that can be received by, displayed on, computed by or sent from
these omnipresent personal companions. Such multi-factor authentication schemes
have the benefit of relying on a combination of "something the user knows" with
"something the user has," but are typically only tied to data stored on or sent
to the auxiliary device, rather than to the device itself. The goal of this
research is to enable practical authentication based on hardware characteristics
of consumer-grade mobile devices by transforming the idea of "something the user
has" from intangible software artifacts to physical properties of the device,
without the need of dedicated internal or external hardware or circuitry in
place.

The project focuses on a novel authentication modality based on inherent
physical hardware properties in the form of device-specific, unavoidable and
unclonable manufacturing imperfections of the smartphone's digital camera
sensor. These "sensor fingerprints" can be extracted from probe images displayed
to and captured by the user's smartphone in an authentication protocol. At the
technical level, a major requirement of an effective sensor-based authentication
scheme is leakage-resistance, i.e., adversaries shall not be able to infer the
authentication modality from public images acquired outside of the
authentication protocol. In this framework, the project integrates techniques
for leakage-resistant fingerprint generation and verification, fingerprint re-
use across multiple authentication instances, efficient fingerprint storage, and
fingerprint quality assessment. By putting ideas from the area of media
forensics on the map of an established field of security research, the project
will pave the way for novel perspectives in both domains.
