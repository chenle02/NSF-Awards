This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project is in the area
of chemistry. Beginning in 1992, eight undergraduate students will spend ten
weeks in the summer engaged in research under the direction of various members
of the faculty in Chemistry. This program will allow students to participate in
active research programs applying chemistry to materials science. The goal of
the proposed program is to seek and attract bright undergraduate students,
particularly minority students. It will actively involve these students in
research programs that will develop and encourage them to pursue science
careers, particularly chemistry, ultimately leading to a Masters or Ph.D.
degree.
