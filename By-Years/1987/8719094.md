Dr. Backer at the University of California, Berkeley will use a signal processor
which he developed to search large areas of the sky for pulsars with millisecond
periods. In addition to its search mode, the signal processor can be used for
pulse timing of known pulsars and as a flexible spectrum analyzer. Research into
pulsars with millisecond periods and the related binary pulsars is evolving
rapidly. These objects have established new constraints on the internal
structure of neutron stars and on neutron star magnetospheres. Pulse time-of-
arrival measurements of these pulsars have had a tremendous impact on a number
of branches of science: on high density matter physics, on Solar System
ephemeris development, and on general relativity and cosmology. Dr. Backer's
research is at the forefront of discovering more members of this important class
of pulsars.
