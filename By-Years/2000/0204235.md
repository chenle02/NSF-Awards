This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Microarray analysis to discover
light-quality regulated genes in the cyanobacteria Fremyella diplosiphon."
Microarrays allow researchers to analyze global gene expression. Fremyella
diplosiphon has an adaptive response to light color called complementary
chromatic adaptation (CCA). However, only three operons have been identified as
regulated by light color. This research uses microarrays of PCR amplified
genomic fragments to discover novel genes that are light color regulated and
then uses gene-specific microarrays to examine the expression kinetics of these
genes.
