Recent biology program revisions have placed a greater emphasis on cell and
molecular biology. We are now engaged in a total revision of Genetics, and are
continuing to improve other courses in the cell and molecular area. The major
thrust of this project is to redesign the genetics laboratory and enhance
previously revised cell and molecular courses, by exposing upper division
undergraduate students to advanced instrumentation and techniques critical to
scientific experimentation in modern cell and molecular biology. These
techniques will be presented in an investigative, student-initiated, project-
based laboratory designed to turn "science students" into "student scientists".
Requested instrumentation vital for the successful completion of this project
are a PCR thermal controller, sequencing gel electrophoresis units, imaging
densitometer and sequencing software, and DNA analysis software. The thermal
controller provides for the ability to amplify small amounts of DNA, the
electrophoresis units allow for separation of DNA samples, the imaging
densitometer for quantifying protein gels, Western and dot and slot blots, and
the DNA analysis software for analyzing sequences of DNA, cDNA's, and protein
sequences for conserved motifs, designing PCR primers, and protein structural
and restriction site analysis. By providing state-of-the art instrumentation and
engaging students in the design and analysis of exciting, relevant problems,
this project will increase their knowledge of the scientific process, and
prepare them more completely for scientific careers. We believe this approach
will be of interest to colleagues in other undergraduate institutions, and a
projected outcome from this project will be the creation of laboratory materials
that can be adapted for use in other programs.
