This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry involves two distinct but related advances in
computational quantum chemistry. The first is the extension, testing, and
calibration of a configuration-interaction method based on natural orbitals. The
second is the application of the theoretical methods to answer a number of
important molecular structural questions. The systems being studied include the
ammonia dimer, triatomic halogen radicals, circulenes (hydrocarbons with seven
hexagons surrounding a heptagon), and the cyclocarbinyl cation. %%% Modern high-
speed computers can be used to calculate the shapes and energies of molecules,
including those which have not as yet been synthesized. In this study not only
are the computer methods for carrying out these calculations being advanced, but
they are also being applied to the study of exotic molecules such as that formed
by three chlorine atoms rather than by two atoms as in the more familiar
chlorine molecule.
