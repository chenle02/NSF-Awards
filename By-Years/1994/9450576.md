Abstract 576 Huray High Performance Computational Network Expansion Plan South
Carolina EPSCoR will establish a High Performance Computational Network
Expansion Plan to provide computational tools, training, and programming support
to a broad array of junior faculty at several of the State's senior
institutions, including Clemson University, the Medical University of South
Carolina, the University of South Carolina, South Carolina State University, the
College of Charleston, and USC-Aiken. Effective access to the South Carolina
Supercomputer Network will be provided to computational researchers, graduate
and undergraduate students, and South Carolina's industrial sector. The project
will provide research opportunities to junior faculty and will expand the South
Carolina Supercomputer Network through the purchase and linking of onsite
workstations. In support of this project, the participating institutions will
appoint six graduate fellowships in high performance computational science.
Systemic and potential long-term impacts include the transfer of new knowledge
to non-competitive faculty and the coalescing of the educational agendas of
South Carolina's leading institutions of higher education with those of the
state's industrial sector.
