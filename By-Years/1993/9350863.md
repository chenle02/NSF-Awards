9350863 Bottomley The faculty in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry has
been in the process of incorporating polymer chemistry into its undergraduate
curriculum. Four curriculum changes are underway: (1) offering new courses in
polymer chemistry; (2) creating a polymer option for chemistry majors; (3)
incorporating lectures dealing with and experiments demonstrating the principles
of polymer synthesis, characterization and processing into the undergraduate
chemistry courses; (4) offering workshops in polymer chemistry to faculty in
small colleges and universities in the Southeast. The focus of each lecture and
the workshops is the relationship between molecular structure and the
reactivity, properties and processing conditions of the polymer. The intent of
each of the experiments which are being developed is to demonstrate real world
applications of analytical techniques and how these analyses are used in the
design of new materials with useful properties for specific applications. A new
TGA-DSC-FTIR is now being used to provide students with experience in the
synthesis, characterization and processing of polymers in the laboratory. ***
