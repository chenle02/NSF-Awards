During the initial phase of this five-year Presidential Young Investigator
Award's duration, research activities of Dr. Steven H. Strauss (Oregon State
University) will focus on the molecular phylogeny of forest trees, whereas
efforts during the latter part of the funding period will concentrate on genetic
engineering aspects (gene transfer systems, tree-pathogen interactions, and
control of gene expression). With regard to molecular phylogeny, studies in
Strauss' laboratory have dealt with chloroplast genome mapping and restriction
site analysis of conifers. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method, coupled
with automated gene sequencing of amplified DNA, is expected to provide major
new insights into the phylogeny of plants and factors controlling molecular
evolution's tempo and mode. The progression to a genetic engineering focus is
dependent upon development of gene transfer systems that will enable
incorporation of "foreign" genes into plants. Current work is aimed at insertion
of toxin genes from the insect pathogen, Bacillus thuringensis, into the genomes
of coniferous trees. The potential economic advantages of developing such a
deterrent to damage from forest insect pests are enormous. Attempts will be made
to characterize the molecular physiology of a major root pathogen of Douglas fir
trees. The expectation is that it will then be possible to isolate and modify
the genes responsible for pathogenicity, thereby gaining insights into host-
pathogen interactions and making feasible disease-resistant genetic lines of
trees. Finally, the most scientifically ambitious goals of this research are
directed toward manipulation of the systems controlling gene expression. This
will first involve characterization of the major control sequences governing
tissue-specific and environmental-responsive gene expression in conifers.
Thereafter, it ought to be possible to splice desired sequences onto various
target conifer genes.
