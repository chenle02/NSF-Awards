This award provides support for the continuation of the Natural Hazards
Research and Applications Information Center. The Center will continue to
disseminate hazards research information to potential users--administrators,
technicians, policy makers, and scientists. The Center will publish and
distribute the Natural Hazards Observer six times a year, continue its
publication series, and hold its annual workshop involving users and producers
of hazards research. The Center will provide information on a day-to- day basis
in response to inquiries. The preparation and evaluation of materials and
assistance to other groups in the development of new programs and information
will complete the Center's main responsibilities. Particular emphasis will be
placed on developing lines of communication with groups not previously active in
the hazards field to increase their awareness and to stimulate efforts to
mitigate hazard impacts on their own facilities and in their own communities.
Modest research activities will also be conducted at the Center and the Center
will support researchers throughout the nation as they carry out "quick
response" research on specific hazard events.
