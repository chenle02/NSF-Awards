The conventional transient analysis of many large scale models requires the
solution of nonlinear equations at each time step. In many cases, these
equations are solved directly using sparse techniques. The increasing size of
the models analyzed suggests that iterative methods should be used. The
nonlinear problems that arise in transient analysis have special properties that
may aid in their efficent solution. This research program will study the use of
iterative methods in the special context of transient analysis and transient
analysis methods in the context of iterative methods with a view toward the
development of techniques that will be applicable to parallel or vector
computers. More efficient numerical techniques along with faster and more
powerful computers will allow us to solve more complex and realistic problems in
science and engineering. The present research program aims to improve this
efficiency for the very important and large class of time dependent problems.
