The Green Bank Observatory will organize and host a community workshop on
research experiences for high school students in disciplines supported by NSF’s
Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The workshop is
intended as a forum for sharing, gathering community input, and illuminating
best practices in providing research experiences to high school students and
organizing such research activities across universities, labs, and
observatories. The input gathered from the workshop can be used to inform the
NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate in considering how best to
support K-12 research activities through future targeted programs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is often stated that solving the global challenges
presented by the 21st century requires a United States workforce with training
in STEM fields, and that the STEM workforce may be insufficient to fill that
need. Education research literature in STEM suggests that engaging students
early and often in authentic research experiences enhances STEM identity, STEM
self-efficacy, and STEM career interest: three personal attributes that are
linked to entry into and persistence on a STEM career pathway. Much of this
literature is focused on college students, however. This workshop will convene
people and organizations who have designed and implemented research experiences
for high school students, and who will examine the role such experiences can
play in the development of a student’s interest and STEM
identity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
