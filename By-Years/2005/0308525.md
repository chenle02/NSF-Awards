This award will help produce two tree-ring records of climate from high-latitude
sites in Siberia covering the last 2,000+ years. Field work will be undertaken
to collect several hundred samples of live wood (by increment corer and cut
cross sections) and relict material (by cut cross sections) from each locality.
Ring width measurements, X-ray microdensitometry and chronology building will be
performed on both records. Samples will be archived to allow for future
laboratory analyses such as cell dimension and isotopic
analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution 2,000 year records of climate
have the potential for improving our understanding of global and Northern
Hemisphere temperatures variability over recent millennia and whether the warmth
of the late 20th century was unusual.
