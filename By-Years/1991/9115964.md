This Science in Developing Countries award will support the collaboration of
Kenneth Klabunde of Kansas State University and Galo Cardenas- Trivino of the
University of Conception, Chile. The project aims to (1) prepare M-solvent
colloids with Cu, Ag, and Sn, and with monomers such as styrene and
methylmethacrylate; (2) characterize colloidal particles by electrophoresis,
TEM, SEM, FTIR, Mossbauer, and SRS; and (3) characterize metallic films formed
from the colloids by TGA, DSC, microanalyses, and resistivity measurements. The
researchers will use a new method for preparing nonaqueous colloidal metal
particles, using metal evaporation and solvation of atoms in excess cold organic
solvents. The mobile metal atoms cluster upon warming. The forming particles
stop growing due to solvation and electrostatic repulsion. Various metals have
been shown to form stable colloidal solutions. The major interest in these new
colloids is in their use as metallic film precursors. The researchers aim to
develop them for chemical liquid (rather than vapor) deposition of films. With a
recent patent, much industrial interest has developed. This joint project is
expected to facilitate progress in metal- colloid, metal film work. The U.S.
side has expertise in colloid chemistry and state-of-the-art equipment for
preparing and analyzing colloidal solutions and metal films. The Chilean side
has expertise in polymer characterization and necessary TGA, DSC, and TEM/SEM
facilities, which the U.S. side lacks.
