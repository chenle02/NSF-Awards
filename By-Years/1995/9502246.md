9502246 Beckham Through two distinct projects, detailed characterization of
molecular mobilities will be conducted and then used to engineer improved or
novel polymers and fibrous substrates. Advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
techniques will be employed to specify molecular mobilities not only by
timescale, but also by geometry (2D exchange spectroscopy), and by spatial
direction (NMR imaging). The following two projects are described: (1) solid-
state polymer molecular dynamics, and (2) water distribution and diffusion in
engineered fibrous substrates. In both projects, multidimensional NMR methods
will be used to elucidate that historically "missing link" for the correlation
of molecular structure with macroscopic properties in materials, that is,
detailed descriptions of molecular movements. %%% This research is important
because it provides links to important questions in polymer and textile science,
and covers both basic and applied subjects. The educational component of this
grant consists of introducing modern topics into textile courses and to develop
new teaching methods in which students are activley involved in the teaching
process. ***
