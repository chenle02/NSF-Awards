The study of the sun and its past evolution has a long history in the annals of
astronomy. This proposal is a request for support of the typesetting of the book
Interior and Atmosphere of the Sun, eds. A.N. Cox, W.C. Livingston, and M.S.
Matthews. The book will be a comprehensive source- and advanced text book on the
history of the sun. It is part of the University of Arizona Press Space Science
Series. The individual chapters will be written by the participants of a
conference on the subject, though the book will not be a conference proceedings.
Every chapter will be carefully refereed. The purpose of NSF's contribution to
this book is to bring its price down to the $30 to $50 range and thus make it
afordable to the interested graduate student.
