This award to Clark University is for renovation and reconfiguration of
chemistry research laboratories, with particular emphasis on improving the fume
hoods and HVAC system. The project continues their recent efforts to build a
modern facility, support research and research training, and provide means to
meet their science equipment needs into the next century for their small,
quality doctoral chemistry research program which has just received a $400,000
grant from the U.S. Department of Education to assist it to expand its graduate
student numbers by 50%, with particular attention to the recruitment of women
and minorities. The project includes complete removal and replacement of the
fume hoods and associated duct work in Jeppson Laboratory; renovation of the
HVAC system to accommodate the new air flows; and upgrades and reconfiguration
of several research laboratories to adapt them to the current needs of the
chemistry faculty and accommodate the increased number of research students. The
laboratory renovations, although minor in scope, will greatly enhance
productivity and safety, and will allow the full utilization of existing space
that will be required to accommodate the increased numbers of researchers
associated with the Ph.D. program expansion.
