The Brookings Institution will convene a planning meeting of U.S. and Russian
scientists which is intended to lead to a larger workshop, in Russia, involving
U.S. basic research scientists and engineers and former Soviet weapons
researchers. The objective of these meetings is to identify areas and topics of
civilian-oriented basic research in which former Soviet weapons scientists can
work in concert with American researchers as well as to identify potential
partnerships between specific ex-Soviet and American researchers. Proposals for
actual support of such research will subsequently be submitted to the State
Department's Special Coordinator on FSU Non-Proliferation Policy and considered
for funding either under the International Science Center that has recently been
created by the Department of State or conceivably under existing bilateral
arrangements, including the NSF's cooperative science programs.
