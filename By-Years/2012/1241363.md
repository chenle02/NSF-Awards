This conference will bring together researchers and students for the
presentation and discussion of new advances in stellar astrophysics enabled by
the latest generation of radio facilities operating from meter to submillimeter
wavelengths. The general focus of the workshop will be radio emission from hot
and cool stars during the main sequence and post-main sequence evolutionary
phases. An underlying theme will be "radio stars as players in our Galaxy,"
emphasizing how radio observations provide an effective probe of the roles of
various types of stars in the Galactic ecosystem and the interplay between stars
and their environments.
