This research is to study the seismic velocities and, by inference, the
dynamical processes occurring within D", the base of the mantle just above the
core-mantle boundary. Diffracted P and S waves and core phases will be used as
recorded on digital broad-band seismometers. Many processes that occur within
the earth - convection, hot spot generation, geomagnetic field production,
cooling of the core -would be much better understood if we had improved
resolution of D", the thermal and/or chemical boundary layer at the base of the
mantle. It is the aim of this project to achieve this resolution, and in doing
so, knowledge of deep earth dynamics.
