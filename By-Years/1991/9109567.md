Scientists and engineers routinely use physical arguments and graphical
representations to organize their thoughts and as parts of the process of
solving otherwise verbally presented problems. The goal of this project is to
investigate a computational theory and to develop a system that captures some
aspects of this style of reasoning. The system, consisting of a suite of
computer programs, will have three novel features: (1) Given a set of nonlinear
partial differential equations, it will use "back-of-the-envelope" calculations
to determine the appropriate scaling, and automatically simplifies the equations
by means of classical singular perturbation techniques, (2) In exploring the
physics of the simplified mode, it will combine numerical methods with symbolic
results, and (3) To analyze the qualitative behavior of the simplified model, it
will use a graphical method based on an analytical approximation criterion for
predicting the onset of global chaotic behavior. The power of the approach will
be demonstrated by applying it to a difficult problem in hydrodynamics for which
our computer programs help derive previously unknown publishable results.
Successful completion of the project will provide computer programs that are
significant not only as a useful problem solving assistant for scientists, but
also as an application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to a new and
challenging domain.
