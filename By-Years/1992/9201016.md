Professor Chinburg will work on a theory for a Galois Module Structure for
Schemes and the connection between capacity theory and intersection theory on
varieties. In particular, he will work on generalizing arithmetic intersection
theory to limits of arithmetic cycles. This project falls into the general area
of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved
extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood
generations. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes. Such
codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
