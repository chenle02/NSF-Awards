This project has three parts. (1) Development of new semi- and nonparametric
models that fit data better than existing ones; (2) Development of methods for
semi- and nonparametric estimation and specification testing in the presence of
instrumental variables, and (3) Development of methods for nonparametric
estimation subject to shape restrictions obtained from economic theory. Part (1)
is motivated by the observation that existing methods for achieving dimension
reduction and, thereby, greater estimation precision in semi- or nonparametric
estimation do not necessarily fit the data of interest in applications. The
research will develop models and methods that are more flexible than existing
ones are but still achieve the dimension reduction necessary to obtain useful
results with data sets of practical size. The new models will be applied to data
that existing models do not fit well. Part (2) is concerned with nonparametric
instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation. One objective is to develop methods of
dimension reduction for NPIV estimation. The other is to develop methods for
testing a parametric model against a nonparametric alternative in the presence
of instrumental variables. There is a large literature on testing a parametric
model of a conditional mean or quantile function against a nonparametric
alternative, but testing with instrumental variables is a new area of research.
Part (3) will develop methods for nonparametric estimation of demand functions
subject to monotonicity constraints and the Slutsky conditions of economic
theory. There is a literature on estimation under monotonicity and/or convexity
restrictions, but the Slutsky conditions are nonlinear and, therefore, present a
special challenge. A further objective is to develop methods for testing the
hypothesis that the Slutsky conditions are satisfied in a sampled
population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will have several broader impacts.
First, its results will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate courses
that are taught by the investigator and others. Second, the project will support
the research of Ph.D. students who will work on problems generated by the
project. Third, the results of the project are likely to benefit society at
large by being incorporated into policy studies for public agencies. This will
be done, among other ways, through the investigator's service on committees and
other groups that advise the Federal government.
