Horner-Devine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will
combine a series of laboratory experiments with field observations with the aim
of improving our understanding of the vertical structure of wave supported
gravity currents (WSGC). Specifically, the proposed laboratory studies will
address whether the high concentrations of suspended sediment necessary to
initiate down-slope transport can be achieved solely by resuspension, or whether
sediment convergence is necessary. The work has important implications for
sediment transport in a wide range of environments. Previous observations of
high concentration fluid muds in energetic oceanic environments have been
largely limited to areas with extremely high fluvial sediment input.
Understanding the role of sediment supply to the formation and initiation of
this mode of sediment transport will improve the understanding of cross-shelf
sediment transport. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across-shelf transport by wave-
supported turbidity currents is a newly identified, potentially dominant
mechanism for moving fine sediment (and associated constituents such as carbon
and contaminants) across continental shelves. The project will also support one
graduate student, enhance undergraduate courses, and provide outreach to pre-
college students through the UW Open House.&lt;br/&gt;
