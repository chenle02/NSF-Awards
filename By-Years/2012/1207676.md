The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SKIO) is awarded funding to continue
operations of research vessel Savannah in support NSF-funded scientific research
within Georgia's coastal and ocean waters in the year 2012. For 2012, R/V
Savannah plans to operate 168 days, of which 99 days are in support of NSF peer-
reviewed sea-going science. This is a five-year cooperative agreement, and
funding for the years 2013-2016 will be re-negotiated and evaluated based on the
number of days in service of NSF funded research. R/V Savannah is operated as a
University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) ship, and as such
follows UNOLS safety standards and NSF inspection
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual and Technical
Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R/V Savannah is a 92-foot coastal research vessel,
which was delivered from Washburn and Doughty shipbuilders in September 2001.
This ship is one of the most capable platforms for conducting oceanographic
research and education activities in the continental shelf, estuarine, and
riverine environments of the Southeastern U.S. The vessel has been used to
examine rates of benthic primary production on the West Florida Shelf and South
Atlantic Bight, to assess microbial diversity in environments ranging from
coastal estuaries to the Gulf Stream, to examine the biogeochemical dynamics
within the Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) study sites and to develop a
regional coastal observing system. In addition, the Savannah has been and will
be used for a multibeam survey of the Savannah River. The deck space, a large
hydraulic A-frame, which maximizes the cable bend radius necessary to deploy
acoustic packages, and generally quiet vessel operations make this vessel ideal
for these kinds of projects. R/V Savannahs design capacity to sleep 19
scientists plus crew enables the ship to accommodate large science parties for
it's size.
