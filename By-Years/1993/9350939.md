9350939 Freed The Geology Department is using a Philips PW 1840 automated X- ray
diffractometer system which to enhance both undergraduate courses and
undergraduate research. The goal is to integrate use of the diffractometer into
three components of Trinity's science curriculum: (1) the beginning Physical
Geology course; (2) the geology major, specifically student research projects
and three required sequential courses for the major (Mineralogy &
Crystallography, Igneous & Metamorphic Petrology, and Stratigraphy &
Sedimentation); and (3) laboratory exercises in engineering and physics classes
(Engineering Materials and Condensed Matter Physics). Beginning geology students
use modern analytical X-ray equipment as an integral part of examining minerals
and rocks. Advanced students are using the instrument to study mineral
identification techniques, understand crystallographic relationships,
investigate compositional and structural variations in minerals, and work with
multiple-phase systems, such as sediments or fine-grained igneous or metamorphic
rocks. After completing the required course sequence, geology majors have the
experience necessary to use the diffractometer for addressing mineralogical
problems in a research context. The diffractometer significantly expands the
types of research projects that students can undertake. ***
