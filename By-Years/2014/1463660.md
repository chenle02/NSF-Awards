Clusters of galaxies are sensitive cosmological probes which can be used to
study large-scale structure formation, the physics of diffuse astrophysical
plasmas, and dark matter on megaparsec scales. A better understanding is needed
of cluster masses, which rely critically on knowledge of cluster astrophysics,
as well as biases and limitations of various measurement methods. This
conference provides the opportunity for the astrophysical community to
critically examine how all mass estimators can be combined for maximum accuracy
in galaxy cluster mass estimation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will be an
excellent opportunity for young astrophysicists to gain information and for them
to interact with more experienced researchers in an informal setting. The
Scientific Organizing Committee has taken care to include key representatives
from underrepresented groups in the invitation list.
