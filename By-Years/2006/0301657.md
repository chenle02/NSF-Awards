The advent of single molecule biophysical measurements in conjunction with
advances instructural biology makes it possible to construct mechanical models
of a range of biological phenomena. The aim of the work proposed here is to
investigate two broad classes of problems:&lt;br/&gt;i) the mechanics of DNA
packing both in viruses and eucaryotic cells and ii) the physics of mechanically
activated ion channels. The objective of this work is to link continuum and
atomistic models of these systems with experiments aimed at probing their
specific mechanical action. In particular, we will examine both the packing of
DNA in viruses and the process of ejection of that DNA during the viral
infection process. In addition, we will study the way in which the DNA sequence
dictates its elastic properties and how this in turn affects the self-assembly
process of the eucaryotic chromosome. Our efforts on mechanically activated
membrane channels will be centered on examining the coupling between tension in
the lipid bilayer membrane and conformational changes in the ion
channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
