Dr. Rosemarie Szostak, Chemistry Department, Clark Atlanta University, is
supported under a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers by
the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division to incorporate theoretical modeling into a program in the
experimental design of zeolites and zeolite based catalysts. Dr. Szostak will
join the Biosym Catalysis and Sorption Project, which is a partnership
developing effective software for the solution of catalysis and sorption
problems. Dr. Szostak will apply the newly designed methodologies to examine
faulting in zeolite structures and to predict organic cations that will
alleviate faults in zeolites. Zeolites are widely used industrial materials
which have numerous applications including as catalysts, molecular sieves, and
ion and gas separation materials. While zeolites have been studied
experimentally for many years, the ability to theoretically predict their
structures or properties is only now becoming possible. This Career Advancement
Award will permit Dr. Szostak, a well respected zeolite experimentalist, to
obtain the skill needed for her to apply theoretical tools to the understanding
of these materials. By membership in the Biosym Catalysis and Sorption Project
she will be able to integrate her experimental program with the most recent
computational techniques.
