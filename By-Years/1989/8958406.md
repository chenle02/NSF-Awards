This Presidential Young Investigator Award is concerned with the investigation
of vibration and noise reduction in high performance electromechanical devices.
The research involves the calculation and measurement of structural response to
magnetic and electromagnetic fields leading to the design of compact, high
output and high stability devices. Voice coil actuators, stepper motors, and
direct current brushless motors with high energy magnets are also of primary
interest.
