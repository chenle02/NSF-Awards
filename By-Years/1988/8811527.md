The objective of this research project is to investigate the use of
polyvinylidene flouride (PVF) (a piezoelectric polymer film) as the actuator for
a viscous fluid pump. This material undergoes deformation due to an applied
voltage. Using this effect, a pump constriction could be generated by applying a
voltage to the film causing it to expand its thickness while decreasing its
length and width. This method of pumping viscous fluids has merit because of its
overall simplicity. There are significant problem areas to be investigated: (1)
the joining to form a ring is complex, metallization on the surface and the PVF
material on the interior are required to be connected, (2) the characteristics
of deformation of the material as a flat material as compared to a ring; the
problems associated with a produced magnetic field and with electrical
interference, and (3) a method of applying sequential voltage. The pump would be
relatively inexpensive, have no moving parts and would not churn or contact the
flow. It would be biologically inert allowing insertion into a living organism.
This type of pump could prove useful in biomedical applications
