ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Barvinok, Alexander
&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: DMS - 0856640&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of
Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;Title: Combinatorics, Geometry, and
Algorithms&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator intends to
work on a number of problems in combinatorial enumeration and optimization, with
algorithmic questions and geometric approaches playing the central role. The
project aims to develop computationally efficient approaches to enumeration of
integer points in higher-dimensional polyhedra (such as polyhedra of non-
negative matrices with prescribed row and column sums), optimization of
multivariate polynomials on the unit sphere, computing simple approximations of
complicated convex bodies (such as polytopes associated with hard problems of
combinatorial optimization), and construction of symmetric polytopes with many
faces. Related structural questions concerning random integer points in
polyhedra and concentration of permanents of doubly stochastic matrices will be
investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In combinatorics and discrete optimization
we are often interested in the structure of very large, yet finite sets, where
direct enumeration is prohibitively expensive or impossible because of the size
of the sets and methods of classical analysis are not applicable because of the
discrete character of objects. The project aims to develop computationally
efficient asymptotic approaches to several hard problems which concern counting
and optimization in large discrete sets and describing the structure of a
typical object from such a set. Several of the considered problems are of
interest to statistics, physics, and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;
