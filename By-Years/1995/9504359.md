9504359 Peters This project involves work on several problems involving the
structure of nonselfadjoint operator algebras. These include direct limits of
finite dimensional operator algebras. One of the principal tools is the Connes
spectrum or analytic range for analytic algebras. The isomorphism class of
certain nest algebras can be determined by a finite algorithm. It is proposed to
improve and implement this algorithm. In another direction an investigation will
be made of the notion of topologocal nilpotence. This concept has been recently
studied for Banach algebras, in the context of operator algebras, such as
nonselfadjoint crossed products. Nonselfadjoint operator algebras arise as
triangular subalgebras of objects used by quantum physicists to study particle
theory. The properties of such algebras and their connections with dynamical
systems are questions we intend to investigate. In some cases there are
computable algorithms. The goal of this project is to contribute to the
theoretical understanding of basic mathematical structures. ***
