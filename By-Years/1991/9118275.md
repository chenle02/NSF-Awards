This proposal targets the hormonal bases of insect egg development and
subsequent maternal behavior. Insects have been widely used as model systems to
study basic mechanisms of hormone action, and in the isolation and
identification of key regulatory proteins that hold promise in the development
of biorational pesticides. This investigations utilizes the ring-legged earwig.
Anisolabis annulipes. This relatively primitive insect is an excellent model
system for investigating the hormonal regulation of egg development and
reproductive behaviors because it exhibits discrete cycles of ovarian
development, pronounced maternal behavior, precisely timed juvenile dispersal.
My specific goals are to investigate: (1) the biochemical identity of juvenile
hormone, a primary reproductive hormone produce by corpora allata, an essential
step to future experiments; (2) the hormonal basis of maternal care and the
degree to which it is coupled to the cycle of egg development by manipulation of
levels of hemolymph (blood) proteins that specifically degrade juvenile
establishment of a direct method for determining rates of juvenile hormone
synthesis, and subsequently determining the effects of hormone application and
of denervation of corpora allata on juvenile hormone production. The final stage
of the investigation will be to pursue stimulatory/inhibitory effects of the
brain on corpus allatum activity.
