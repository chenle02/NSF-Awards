This award continues support of studies of current plate motions. In this grant
period the PIs will be re-evaluating closure about the Indian Ocean and Azores
triple junctions, investigating limits on motion along the Owen Fracture Zone
and the implied limits on motion between India and Australia, and studying
limits on the motion and boundary between the North and South American plates,
and building a self-consistent global relative plate motion model.
