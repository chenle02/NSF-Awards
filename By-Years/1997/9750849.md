This project addreses a current dilemma in science education. The subject matter
of physical chemistry is somewhat abstract. Laboratory experiments demonstrating
the results of models are essential to making lessons more concrete. However,
contemporary physical chemistry experiments, featuring the development of a
molecular-level picture of interactions, often use very expensive equipment.
Faced with fiscal constraints, many institutions have been reluctant to invest
in equipment. The result is that physical chemistry laboratory courses tend not
to reflect contemporary practices. The project is developing a series of
laboratory exercises focusing on molecular-level processes in two areas;
materials surface chemistry and biochemistry. A series of open-ended, inquiry-
based laboratory exercises are enabling students to develop an image of
consequences of models such as particle-in-the-box, spherical waves (the
hydrogen atom), and bonding interactions. *
