9614682 Paterson Convergent boundaries between tectonic plates involve such
processes as crustal deformation metamorphism and magmatism. The surficial
counterparts to these internal processes include volcanism, high average
elevation, topographic relief and rapid exhumation, but the connections between
these surficial processes and the internal orogenic processes are enigmatic.
This project will address linked processes between orogeny and mountain building
in a continental margin that has experienced a multifaceted tectonic history.
The Peninsular Ranges Baja California offers a well exposed set of tectonic
assemblages within a manageable area that holds considerable promise for better
understanding the connection between surface manifestation and internal orogenic
processes.
