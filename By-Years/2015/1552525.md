This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award will develop an
efficient resource management framework for a large-scale system to serve a
large volume of multi-stage data processing jobs. The major research goals
include enabling cross-job data flows, and exploiting the dependency between
stages to efficiently allocate system resources. The current data processing
framework encapsulates each job during its execution which disables possible
data sharing between jobs (stages) and query optimization. The proposed work for
this research will allow users to specify enriched job meta-data that identifies
the data input of each stage. Processing servers will recognize the cross-job
data flows according to the job meta-data. In addition, a significant
contribution will be a dependency-driven resource management scheme that
carefully examines the unique overlapping transition and dependency between
consecutive stages. The proposed work will improve the existing platforms of
multi-stage data processing. In addition, the collaborations with industrial
contacts have the potential for rapid technology transfer.
