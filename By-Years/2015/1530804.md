An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at the active
Volcan Santiaguito (Guatemala) in January of 2016. The meeting will bring
together researchers, students, and observatory personnel to exchange state-of-
the-art quantitative geophysical field techniques and to collect and distribute
integrated volcano geophysical data products. The workshop will entail an
initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop,
lectures and presentations, and data analysis and open exchange. It is hoped
that this workshop will be the first in a series of innovative workshops where a
group of scientists target and study a select open-vent volcanic system.

Volcan Santiaguito is the ideal locale for the inaugural workshop owing to its
diverse and continuing low level of activity (lava effusion, explosions, regular
rockfall, and small pyroclastic density currents). The volcanic activity is
amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic,
infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave
sensing. The scientific program will focus on volcano geophysics acquisition,
processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused
discussion. Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse
data.
