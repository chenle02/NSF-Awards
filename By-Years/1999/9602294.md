The University of Puget Sound, located in Tacoma Washington, is the recipient
of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program. The award will be
used to modernize biology research laboratories in the 1967 Thompson Hall
Science Building. Being the largest of the laboratory science departments at the
institution, Biology faculty research is closely associated with mentoring
student research. Research and research training, areas currently devoted to
support plant ecology, marine phycology, molecular systematics, population
biology, molecular biology and neurobiology, will be renovated. Specific
renovations will include: reconfiguring rooms to provide more flexible space;
installation of fume hoods, laboratory casework and benches; and updating
utility systems. Faculty conducting molecular and physiological work will have
appropriate bench space, support rooms, and storage facilities. Every individual
will have the opportunity to participate in the scientific enterprise, and
therefore laboratories will be accessible to physically challenged persons by
providing low-bench and high-bench working spaces. This project will enable all
faculty to conduct year-round, unrestricted research where several students can
work on senior thesis projects with faculty. Expanding the breath of
investigative training for the Department's increasing population of majors will
expose students to the kinds of research that will encourage them to pursue
graduate or advance technical training in science.
