Richard Selander proposes a taxonomic and phylogenetic study of a genus of
South American blister beetles. The research plan includes study of sexual
behavior, adult morphology and host- plant association, and rearing of larvae
for study of immature stages. Ecological and life history traits will also be
studied. A clearer picture will emerge not only of the systematic structure of
the genus, but of the biological bases for species differences. The use of a
number of data types makes this project unusually thorough and valuable. The
proposed project will advance systematic studies of tropical diversity on
several levels, ranging from pure alpha- level descriptions up to phylogenetic
and biogeographic analyses. The research will involve collaboration with in-
country specialists, and representative collections will be returned to South
American museums to help build their biological research resources.
