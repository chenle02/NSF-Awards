9724625 Goodenough An optical float zone, image furnace will be acquired by the
University of Texas at Austin for the growth of complex refractory oxide and
manganese oxide crystals. The furnace will be part of a facility under the
oversight of a Materials Institute that the University is in the process of
establishing. It will be used to grow materials where narrow-band phenomena are
present, including high temperature copper oxide superconductors and manganese
oxides exhibiting "colossal" magnetoresistance. %%% The equipment will support
research in a highly topical field with significant momentum. It will also
enable continued emphasis and training in bulk crystal growth techniques. ***
