With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina in Asheville will
acquire a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and a Linux cluster. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) unimolecular
and bimolecular gas-phase reactions of halocarbon species; b) bonding in
metallocenes; and c) catalytic conversion of vinylcyclobutenes to
cyclohexadienes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric
detection (GC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially strengthen
scientific research at the University of North Carolina in Asheville, a
primarily undergraduate institution. &lt;br/&gt;
