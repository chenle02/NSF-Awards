9307506 Suzuki This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. The
research is a theoretical investigation on the fundamentals of distributed robot
control, to help identify those problems for which the distributed approach is
effective. The theory and techniques should also be useful in future development
of algorithms whose performance is mathematically predictable. The main feature
of the method is to let each robot execute a simple algorithm and determine its
movement adaptively based on the given goal and the observed movement of other
robots. This work is a step toward the ultimate goal of determining exactly what
classes of problems are solvable by the distributed approach. The Office of
Navel Research is expected to provide funds separately for this project,
starting in Fiscal Year 1994, at approximately the level of the NSF award.
