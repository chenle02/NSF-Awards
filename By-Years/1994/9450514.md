9450514 Sylvia Ware Travel to the 13th International Conference on Chemical
Education This project supports the participation of fifty chemical educators at
the 13th IUPAC International Conference on Chemical Education to be held in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, August 8-12, 1994. Half of the educators are elementary,
middle school and secondary school science teachers and half are college
faculty. The purposes of the project are three-fold: i) to use the international
experience to enhance the leadership of the teachers within their own local,
regional and national networks; ii) to introduce teachers to issues of chemistry
and science education in other countries expanding their knowledge and classroom
implementation options; and, iii) to sensitize teachers to ways of teaching
chemistry to different cultural groups, especially those of Hispanic and African
ancestry. Participants attend two orientation workshops, one prior to and one
during the conference, to enhance their participation in the formal program and
to plan networking activities upon their return to the United States. Teachers
also visit schools in Puerto Rico. Networking activities include participation
in an ACS-supported symposium on the San Juan Conference at the 1995 ChemED
Conference; regional workshops and lectures; and articles in journals,
newsletters, and teacher magazines.
