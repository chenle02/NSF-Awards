Fracture under elastic-plastic condition is a topic of current interest to the
fracture mechanics community as crack propagation in engineering metals involves
considerable plastic deformation. The problem of initiation and subsequent
growth of the crack is made more complex under combined loading where both the
in-plane tensile mode (mode I) and the out-of-plane tearing mode (mode III)
occur. The research program analyzes the case of mixed mode loading of cracks in
elastic-plastic materials. The method of solution involves a differential
equation subject to the mixed boundary conditions. The approach yields free
parameters to be evaluated numerically using finite elements.
