The objective of the proposed program is to examine how fracture toughness
parameters are enhanced by the interleaving method of construction. The program
involves both theoretical and experimental phases. The focus will be on the
interlaminar fracture toughness and the quantification of the dimensions of the
plastic zone around the crack tip.
