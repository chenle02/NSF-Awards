The Public Affairs Video Archives at Purdue University includes many
congressional hearings and public policy conferences which involve science and
technology, scientists and engineers. Funds for this project will enable the
Archives to develop several edited videos, video series and teaching guides to
facilitate and encourage the use of these programs for the study of ethics,
values and policy development involving science and technology. A recent
graduate will work with university students and faculty to develop these
materials and test them in classrooms. Advisors will assist in the development
of ethics components. The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for
Ethics and Values Studies. The qualifications and track record of the
investigators and organization are excellent. The project provides a cost-
effective test of the feasibility of developing edited video programming on
social and ethical concerns associated with science and technology for classroom
use. Results will be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups. The
budget is very modest. The proposal is recommended for support.
