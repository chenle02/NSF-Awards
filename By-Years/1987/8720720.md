The objective of this work is to investigate a new method to discover and
describe all features of an unknown algebraic curve resulting in the context of
surface to surface intersections. Our method involves symbolic derivation of the
equation of the curve, using algebraic geometry techniques, and its
representation in the Bernstein basis within a rectangular window, which allows
piecewise representation and provides geometrical significance to the underlying
coefficients. Novel methods to compute the characteristic points of the curve,
useful in guaranteeing correct topology, are proposed. These are based on
symbolic computation, adaptive methods for large scale series summation, to
enhance accuracy, and minimization techniques. Interrogation of the curve, based
on non-uniform adaptive subdivision, and derivation of point and parametric
approximations of the implicit curve, with prescribed distance errors, based on
the properties of the Bernstein representation, are also proposed for study. The
significance of the proposed work is that it promises to provide a robust
surface to surface intersection capability, which is necessary in a more
automated mode of design, analysis and manufacturing of complex artifacts. Many
elements of our technique are also parallelizable which is an important
attribute for real time large scale applications.
