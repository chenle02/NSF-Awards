9503393 Leo This project will study the lattice structure of crystal-crystal
interfaces which are important i semiconductor devices and elsewhere. It will
examine one of the pivotal issued in such materials -- the loss of coherence at
an interface and the subsequent development of defect patterns. The research
will yield specific predictions of the interfacial structures in multiphase
systems. If successful, this improved understanding will lead to new strategies
to prevent or postpone the loss of coherence. ***
