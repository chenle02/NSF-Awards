9631431 Flynn The fossil mammal collections at the Field Museum of Natural
History is an imortant national and international systematic and paleontological
resource for research and education. It comprises more than 60,000 catalogued
specimens. Of these, 20,000 have been collected since 1981, which means that the
data associated with them is exceptionally complete. This rate of growth,
however, has rendered the collection very overcrowded, which is a danger to the
specimens; in addition, for some years it has not been possible to house all of
the fossil mammal specimens in contiguous cases. The Field Museum recently
constructed a new space to house certain of its collections. This project will
install compactors in a portion of the new space, fill these with new cases, and
move the entire fossil mammal collection into one contiguous section of cases.
Such a move will enhance curation and conservation of the specimens, make the
collection much more accessible for use in education and research, and enable
more efficient collection management. This $1.1 million project is funded in
partnership between the Research Collections in Systematics & Ecology program of
the NSF and the Field Museum, which is providing approximately 55% of the total
in construction and equipment costs, student tuition, and staff time.
