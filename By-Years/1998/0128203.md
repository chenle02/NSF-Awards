This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop Pd-
based sensors that are durable and exhibit stable response to hydrogen gas.
These sensors will be fabricated using microstructurally stabilized Pd films.
The morphological stability mandated by the novel composite film should result
in enhanced durability and drift stability by circumventing the issue of film
delamination often observed in Pd-based systems. This should result in the
commercial development of safe, reliable and inexpensive hydrogen sensors, and
thus help promote commercial acceptance of hydrogen as a fuel.

The commercial application of this project is in the hydrogen sensor market.
