Hydrogen will be used in dry and wet medium milling processes in order to
embrittle metal surface layer, and consequently accelerateproduction of granular
monocrystals. A secondary effect sought in some wet medium processes is the
oxidation of fine grain size, which would stabilize the particle dimension. The
particulate system will be characterized before an after milling by X-ray
diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, and compression tests. The P.
I. will explore also the use of other inert gases instead of hydrogen, and
different milling geometries including planar milling. The Proposal
embrittlement approach, if successful, will reduce the time of milling and
increase the uniformity of the granular nanocrystalline materials used in
manufacturing and advanced materials processing.
