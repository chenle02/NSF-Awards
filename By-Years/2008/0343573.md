The structure of the telomere is fundamental to chromosomal integrity and, by
extension, to the state of the cell. Chromosome ends are maintained by the
ribonucleoprotein telomerase in a regulated manner. When telomerase is absent
and cells divide, telomeres erode; when telomeres reach a critical length, the
cells will either enter a non-dividing state or will undergo programmed cell
death. Telomere length regulation in the presence of telomerase, as well as
telomere structural state, can be perturbed by manipulating proteins that bind
the telomere directly; in mammals, these proteins include TRF1, TRF2, and POT1.
Such manipulations have been generally limited to overexpression or expression
of dominant negative forms in cultured human or mouse cell lines. With the
exception of the insights gained from the telomerase-knockout mouse and the
Arabidopsis plant, little is known about the effects of telomere dysfunction in
vivo. In this project the amphibian Xenopus will be used to address the
hypotheses that TRF1 is a negative regulator of telomere length in vivo, and
that telomere dysfunction can be initiated by disrupting the telomere complex,
which will result in phenotypic and chromosome disturbances. The project will
identify and clone telomere binding protein genes from Xenopus laevis and the
true diploid Xenopus tropicalis, using EST database mining and molecular
techniques to amplify the genes from messenger RNA. Cloned gene products will be
tested for telomere binding capability. Finally, the function of these genes
will be disrupted in vivo, using the technique of short interfering RNA (siRNA).
Short double-stranded RNA reflecting the sequence of the target mRNA will be
injected into early Xenopus embryos, which results in the destruction of the
mRNA and the resulting "knockdown" of the target protein. The experimental and
control embryos will then be analyzed for effects on telomere length as well as
developmental phenotype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromosome ends, or telomeres, are
critical to the cell, signalling whether the cell can continue to divide or if
it should die. Though much is known about telomere function in cultured cells,
this project will investigate the role of telomere state in whole organisms.
Furthermore, the project will provide the framework and resources for
undergraduate students to pursue independent research as part of their
educational experience, and prepare them more rigorously for their roles as
educated citizens and future
scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
