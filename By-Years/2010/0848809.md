Frank Brown of the University of California, Santa Barbara is supported by an
award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program within the
Division of Chemistry for the development of theoretical tools to 1) model lipid
bilayers and biomembranes for use in simulating complex biochemical and
biophysical phenomena and 2) to model single-molecule spectroscopy experiments
with emphasis on photon counting measurements that provide both time and
frequency domain resolution. Dr. Brown's Fourier-Space Brownian Dynamics (FSBD)
algorithm allows hydrodynamically consistent modeling of inhomogeneous membrane
surfaces over micron length scales at time scales of seconds or
longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is having a broad impact on the
interpretation of experiments that enhance our understanding of biological
phenomena such as the diffusion of membrane proteins in crowded cellular
environments or the structure and dynamics of human red blood cells. Dr. Brown
communicates the excitement and importance of science to grade school children
through his participation in the Physics Circus and Chemistry Outreach programs
at UCSB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program in a co-funding arrangement with Molecular
Biophysics of Molecular and Cellular Biology.
