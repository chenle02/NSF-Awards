Government agencies and private organizations are accumulating&lt;br/&gt;a vast
amount of sensitive information on citizens. These &lt;br/&gt;organizations
often develop new applications to utilize the &lt;br/&gt;information stored in
the databases. An essential phase of &lt;br/&gt;developing such a new
application is to test it thoroughly &lt;br/&gt;prior to
deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, application developers carry out
tests on their &lt;br/&gt;local development databases. A major shortcoming of
this &lt;br/&gt;approach is that these local databases usually have only a
&lt;br/&gt;small number of data samples and hence cannot simulate
&lt;br/&gt;satisfactorily a live environment. On the other hand, the
&lt;br/&gt;practice of testing applications against live production
&lt;br/&gt;databases is becoming increasingly undesirable due to the
&lt;br/&gt;fact that such use of live production databases may disclose
&lt;br/&gt;sensitive data to an unauthorized tester and incorrectly
&lt;br/&gt;update the underlying databases.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates techniques to
generate mock databases &lt;br/&gt;for application software testing without
revealing any confidential &lt;br/&gt;information on the live production
databases. Cryptographic &lt;br/&gt;techniques such as indistinguishability will
be used to model &lt;br/&gt;privacy preservation as well as the degree of
similarity between &lt;br/&gt;a live and a mock database. Success of the project
will open up &lt;br/&gt;a new approach to secure application software testing
and produce &lt;br/&gt;a prototype system for future
deployment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
