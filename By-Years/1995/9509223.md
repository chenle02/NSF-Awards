The transition from sequential object-oriented programming to parallelism has
been the focus of research over the past decade. Experimental languages that try
to integrate objects and parallelism often compromise the inheritance capability
for parallel objects. Even the languages that permit some parallelism and
inheritance support only single-class inheritance. In this project support for
multiple-class inheritance for parallel objects will be investigated. The
technique employed is based on `separate` methods which generate processes and
provide rendezvous type coordination. The project will apply this technique to
Oberon language. The research will be performed under the Research for
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.
