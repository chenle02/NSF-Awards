This project funds two new research-oriented courses in the upper-division
biology and environmental science curricula: (1) Life at the Edge: the
Physiological Ecology of Life in Extreme Environments and (2) Bioenergetics.
Students in these new courses are engaged in the actual "doing" of science as
they conduct open-ended scientific inquiries for the lab portion of these
courses. The new equipment, together with existing equipment, enables students
to design their own research projects in many areas of ecological physiology and
bioenergetics, including studies of whole animal responses to environment as
well as the cellular bases to those responses. These research experiences are
critical to providing context for the lecture portions of these courses as well
as stimulating the development of skills in scientific inquiry that are not
possible in other formats. The objective is that students learn and use methods
of physiological inquiry and construct their own understanding of physiological
phenomena. Another aim is to bring these skills into the classroom and design
and implement a "research as curriculum" pedagogical model.
