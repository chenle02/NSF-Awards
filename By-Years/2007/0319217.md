This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop
methods to prepare xyloglucan conjugates for use as molecular anchors for the
attachment of functional chemicals to cellulose and/or cellulose textiles. The
functional chemicals that can be attached to cellulose by this method include
dyes, fabric softeners, antimicrobial agents, and lubricants. The water-soluble
xyloglucan conjugates will bind irreversibly to cellulose, providing an
economical and efficient alternative to the currently available textile
industrial technology. The objectives of this project are to develop and
optimize chemo-enzymatic methods for the preparation of novel xyloglucan
conjugates and the testing of the conjugates in various textile manufacturing
processes. This Phase I project will result in the laboratory scale production
of these xyloglucan conjugates and to the analysis of these molecules as
industrial materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this
project is in the area of consumer products. The development of environmentally
benign methods for the production of finished textiles and the reduction of need
for re-application of textile finishes (e.g. fabric softeners) will provide
significant economic and health advantages over existing technologies.
