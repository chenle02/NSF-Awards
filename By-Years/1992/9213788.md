This project involves exploratory research by an economic anthropologist from
Harvard University studying how tribal peoples in Nicaragua, Central America
exploit non-timber tropical forest products. The researcher will spend two and a
half months in the field locating two different Indian communities which vary
substantially in income, wages, and prices but resemble each other in type of
forest setting. The research will explore how income, wages and prices of non-
timber forest products affect how the Indians use the forest by studying time
allocation, informant diaries, and surveys of household income and expenses.
This research is important because the relatively rapid decrease in extant of
tropical forests is related to how local people use the forests as well as to
how large corporations exploit the forest resources. This sort of exploratory
research will allow the researchers to develop plans for a more extensive study
of local forest exploitation, which can inform plans for long-term forest use.
