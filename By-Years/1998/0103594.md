Next Generation Scalable Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational Power
constantly is opening new opportunities for numerical simulations, in turn
opening opportunities for new science. This computational power is expected to
be a low cost alternative for design and validation, boosting efficiency of
manufacturing, and be a reliable source of forecast (e.g., weather earthquakes.
the stock market, to name just a few domains), as well as all the other claimed
and realized advantages for academic computing. This constant demand for faster
and faster compute servers drives vendors to introduce more and more
sophisticated; scalable architectures including scalable
interconnects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's will develop high-level user
directed assists to enable application programs to exploit cluster-computing
resources; this will connect application level resource requirements with lower-
level scheduler and middleware resources. The work will advance the usability of
clusters by a significant class of applications.&lt;br/&gt;
