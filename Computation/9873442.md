Moore 9873442 There many massive databases in industry and science, and this is
particularly true for Astrophysics. There are many kinds of questions that
physicists and other users wish to ask the databases in real time, e.g., 'find
outliers'; 'find clusters'; 'find patterns'; 'classify the data records into N
predetermined classes.' Wide-ranging statistics and machine learning algorithms
similarly need to query databases, sometimes millions of times for a single
inference. With millions or billions of records (such as the new generation of
astrophysics sky surveys) this can be intractable using current algorithms. This
project aims to make repeated statistical querying of huge datasets
computationally feasible by transforming massive databases into condensed
representations that permit the rapid answering of such questions. To achieve
these goals, the investigator and his colleagues explore ways in which tools
from statistics (such as Bayesian networks), databases (such as kd-
trees/R-trees), and Artificial Intelligence (such as AD-trees and rule-finders)
can help, how they scale up, and how they can be combined. The investigators
intend to help automate the process of scientific discovery for astrophysical
data sources in which there is too much information for any unaided human to
have a chance of spotting patterns, regularities, or anomalies. Government and
industry in the U.S. have invested heavily in ingenious new ways to gather
information in all branches of science and industry, from cell biology to the
flows of capital in international commerce. Scientists and analysts who have
worked so hard to gather magnitudes more data than they had ten years ago are
now faced with an equally daunting task: exploiting it fully. It is ironic that
in fields such as astrophysics there is now so much data that no human has
enough time to even see a tiny fraction of it. The job of discovering new
relationships, anomalies, and even causation, must now be at least partly turned
over to computers. The investigators comprise a team of statisticians, computer
scientists, and astronomers who have each already made progress in this
direction. This team develops new algorithms to squeeze as much information as
possible from trillion-byte astrophysics databases such as the Sloane Sky
Survey. They also make sure that the resulting technology is deployed elsewhere
in science and industry.
