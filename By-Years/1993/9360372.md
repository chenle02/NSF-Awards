9360372 Sofge Fiber/resin composite fabrication technologies new can produce
high-strength, low weight structural components, while fiber-optic sensing
technology provides a means for sensing various structural properties such as
stress, strain, and elasticity when these sensors are mounted on, or embedded
within, a material structure. Composite structures may degrade due to improper
manufacture, hysteretic wear, impacts and corrosion. While embedded sensors
provide a means for gathering vast quantities of data relating to the structural
and dynamic history of composite structures, it is necessary to process,
itegrate, and interpret this information if the embedded sensors are to be
useful in determining structural integrity, using methods that can deal with the
distributed and nonlinear nature of the problem. This research will utilize
advance neural network based techniques for modeling and analyzing dynamic
structural information, as well as neural network classifiers for performing
real-time sensor interpretation. This will yield an intelligent system for
processing , integrating, and interpreting embedded sensor data to give a real-
time, robust, accurate measure of structural integrity for thick-section
composite structures. This project involves cooperation with McDonnell Douglas
based on earlier work with them in the area of embedded sensor signal processing
and neural network based classification for composite structures. ***
