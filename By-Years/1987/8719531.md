Regulation of circadian rhythmicity in mammals by a neural pacemaker, the
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), will be studied using a new transplant technique
recently developed in our laboratory; neural transplants of 14-day embryonic SCN
restore circadian rhythmicity in adult male hamster hosts previously rendered
arrthymic by electrolyhtic SCN lesioning. The planned transplant experiments
will address: specificity of SCN in restoring rhyhthmicity, role of age of fetal
transplant tissue in graft survival and restoration of rhythmicity, effect of
transplant location on restoration of rhythmicity, neural or humoral mode of SCN
action, rate and pathway of SCN transplant re- enervation, and degree of optic
nerve fiber re-enervation for photoentrainment. Locomotor activity will be used
to monitor daily rhythmicity of intact hosts initially in constant conditions
(DD), as well as after lesioning and transplantation and in a final light
schedule of LD entrainment. Subsequently, animals will be sacrified,
hypothalamic areas will be serially sectioned, and the tissue stained with
histological and immunocytological methods to confirm viability of transplants,
their normal neuropeptide expression, and completeness of host lesioning. SCN
transplantation holds promise, in specific term, for elucidating SCN pacemaker
mechanisms. More generally, the transplant paradigm may serve as a model for
understanding neural mechanisms.
