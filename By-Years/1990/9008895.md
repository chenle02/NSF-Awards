This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Chlan to initiate studies of
temporal and tissue specific regulation of gene expression in plants. She will
focus on cottonseed storage proteins as a model system. It is anticipated that
this award will help Dr. Chlan obtain preliminary results necessary to launch an
independent research career.
