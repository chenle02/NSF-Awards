Project UPDATE (Upgrading Practice through Design and Technology/Engineering
Education) will develop K-8 curriculum materials for teaching integrative
mathematics, science and technology using a design, technology and problem-
solving approach. The project will have widespread impact on teachers, students
and practitioners by providing twelve curriculum packages as models for (a)
innovative instruction and (b) further curriculum development efforts of
collaborative teams of teachers and practitioners from science, mathematics,
engineering, design and technology. The inservice training of other teachers
will be initiated regionally through participating teacher-training institutions
as an initial step for national dissemination and training. National
dissemination of the models and materials will be accomplished mainly through
TIES Magazine, a free periodical for teachers published by Drexel University.
The curriculum materials from Project UPDATE will support a national commitment
to improve education in mathematics, science and technology by engaging students
in using, discussing, assessing and reconstructing what they have learned as
they continue to put their knowledge to work.
