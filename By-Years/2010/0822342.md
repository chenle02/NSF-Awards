The goals of this five-year project are (1) to improve the learning of physics
and physical science teachers and students in grades 5-12 by developing a
science teacher education model focused on the establishment of a diagnostic
learning environment through formative assessment as a powerful instructional
practice for promoting learning of all students on the topic of energy; and (2)
to increase the understanding of the processes through which teachers develop
the requisite knowledge, skills, and dispositions for effective deployment of a
formative assessment instructional cycle. Its three specific objectives are: (1)
to produce research-based diagnostic tools on energy in the context of physics
and physical science; (2) to develop research instruments to probe teachers'
understanding of content, students' ideas, and instructional responses to
formative student data; and (3) to document case studies of teachers' formative
assessment practices in the classroom in order to identify the components of,
and obstacles to effective practice. Major activities of the proposed model-
development process will center on: (a) Identifying pre-college students' and
teachers' modes of reasoning on energy; (b) developing and implementing
research-based internet diagnostic tools that provide real-time information to
teachers to advance instruction; (c) developing tasks to probe (i) teachers'
knowledge of common student thinking in energy, (ii) teachers' skills in
selecting appropriate strategies for diagnosing the students' ideas, (iii)
teachers' skills in selecting effective instructional practices based on
diagnosed students' thinking; and (d) characterizing teachers' development
toward the use of formative assessment through the study of teachers' real
practices.
