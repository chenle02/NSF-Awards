Initial results have indicated that liquid crystals may be very effective
boundary lubricant film formers, which potentially could lubricate some complex
systems currently not easily lubricated, such as ceramic sliding systems. In
this study the tribological properties of a number of liquid crystal
compositions will be determined in collaboration with a team at another
university, which is studying the chemistry and synthesis of liquid crystals.
Load carrying capabilities and friction forces will be determined and related to
structure and composition. The results will be used as basis for formulation of
additional liquid crystal compositions to be tested.
