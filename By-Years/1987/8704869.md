Experimental earthquake engineering research allows first-hand observation of
behavior of building and building components to simulated earthquake loadings.
This research equipment grant will provide two 110-kip servo-controlled electro-
hydraulic actuators to meet the current and pending research needs in the
structural engineering laboratory of the University of Colorado, which is
currently engaged in several NSF-supported research projects on the experimental
investigation of the seismic load- resistance mechanisms of reinforced-masonry
structural components. In particular, tests of full-scale story-height
reinforced-masonry wall panels will be tested. Furthermore, the actuators will
be needed in several new research projects that involve the evaluation of the
inelastic seismic performance of masonry-in-filled reinforced-concrete frames,
as well as the verification of a computer-controlled pseudodynamic test facility
that is being developed in the laboratory for seismic performance testing. The
new actuators will not only enlarge the scope of the current research
activities, but will also open new opportunities for future earthquake
engineering research.
