Lawyers draft documents called "conveyances" that govern the transfer of
property. These conveyances are written in an intricate syntax that follows
precise rules. In previous work, the investigators developed a system for
reading standard conveyances and computing their consequences. The present
project extends that preliminary work by generalizing it to cover a wider range
of conveyances and adding an accessible graphical interface. The project's
novelties are in bringing ideas from the fields of programming languages and
formal methods to bear on problems in the legal domain. The project's impacts
are to create a system that can be used by lawyers and legal educators to reason
about complex conveyances and to understand how the laws governing them
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a technical level, the system models the language
of conveyances as a domain-specific programming language whose concrete syntax
is a restricted subset of the legal English used by the lawyers who draft them.
It parses a conveyance into an abstract syntax tree, which it then transforms
according to a formal operational semantics to account for subsequent events. A
graphical interface provides features such as stepping forward and backward
through events, enabling users without a background in computer science to
absorb the insights offered by the language-based approach. The project develops
a richer model of events, enabling the system to engage in automated reasoning
about interactions between events and conveyances that are used by lawyers and
judges to settle disputes. Finally, the investigators will deploy the system in
the classroom, developing a series of exercises that explore the main elements
of property law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
