The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement
"PolarTREC - Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating", a program
that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research
with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and
Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica,
participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching
strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM
in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and
understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in
professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC
will help sustain and grow the considerable academic and public enthusiasm for
polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides funding
for ARCUS to support 12 teacher-researcher teams during 2016. ARCUS will
recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for
dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training
for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide
travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and
for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results
of the program. Teachers will participate in a variety of outreach events
following their deployments to ensure dissemination of information about the
polar science and educational activities related to their scientific
expeditions.
