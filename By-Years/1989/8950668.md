NSF provides funding for the development of an integrated digital
instrumentation approach to instruction in basic electrical circuits and
experimentation in the electronics laboratory. Four laboratories are outfitted
with eight workstations consisting of the IEEE 488 bus instruments including an
oscilloscope, function generator, digital multimeters, frequency counter, and
pulse generator is interfaced to an AT-compatible engineering workstation which
provides enhanced graphics, data acquisition and processing software, circuit
simulation available in a MS-DOS environment. Eight workstations networked to
two printers are provided each of the laboratories. Experiments are revised to
incorporate the capability of the enhanced environment. The institution is
providing matching funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds
provided by the Foundation.
