The goal of this research is to characterize the mechanosensors on the first
antenna of calanoid copepods and evaluate their importance for prey and predator
detection. Behavioral and morphological analyses have indicated that
mechanoreception may be critical to pelagic copepods for prey detection,
predator avoidance and mate recognition. Yet mechanoreception in copepods has
not been studied physiologically. Dr. Hartline and a collaborator at the State
University of New York, Stony Brook will combine expertise in copepod ecology
and crustacean neurophysiology to investigate the sensory capabilities of
copepods physiologically, and to integrate the sensory physiology with data on
their ecology. The basic objectives of this project are: 1. To characterize the
physiological responses to quantified mechanical stimuli. 2. To relate the
physiological data to the external and internal morphology of the sensors. 3. To
determine intraspecific differences in physiological properties and relate these
to differences in species ecology. 4. To measure behavioral responses to
mechanical stimuli and relate these to the physiological properties and the
species ecology.
