9322798 Olejniczak This project will investigate new harmonic signal models and
state estimators for electric power quality analysis and assessment. Using
state-variable techniques, harmonic signal models will be investigated to
represent the stochastic variations in the amplitude, phase, and radian
frequency of harmonic components in signals corrupted by noise. Nonlinear
stochastic state estimators to identify the harmonic components of each measured
signal for use in harmonic mitigation methodologies will be constructed. The new
harmonic signal models in conjunction with their respective estimator may be
applied to new flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) controllers (e.g.,
static condenser) which have the capability of performing real-time harmonic
filtering. Also, it is conjectured that the harmonic signal models created in
this research project may be used in electric power system simulation software
packages to more accurately represent field measurements and observed phenomena
in the distribution system. ***
