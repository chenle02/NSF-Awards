This research project investigates protocols to support group communication
services in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. As ATM networks are
increasingly used to provide services in telecommunications networks and the
Internet, there is a pressing need for flexible and extensible group
communication protocols that exploit features of ATM in order to offer high
performance services to group-based applications. Important issues that must be
addressed in providing group services include construction and maintenance of
multipoint connections, group membership management, and consensus on a group
leader. This research explores novel solutions to all three problems that take
advantage of the underlying link-state routing (LSR) algorithm used to support
point-to-point communication. Specifically, by modeling various aspects of group
communication as consensus problems under LSR, robust and efficient solutions
are developed to support multiple types of multipoint connections, fault-
tolerant leader/membership consensus, and even improvements to LSR itself. The
resulting protocols are intended to provide new group services both within
individual ATM networks as well as across interconnected, hierarchical ATM
networks. Additional and updated information on this project can be found at
