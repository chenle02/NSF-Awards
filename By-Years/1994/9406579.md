9406579 Linduff Under the direction of Dr. Katheryn Linduff, Mr. Gideon Shelach
will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological
fieldwork in the "Northern Corridor" region of China, an area which lies to the
North of the Yellow and Wei River Basin. He will employ a variety of data to
examine culture change in the period between ca 2300 - 1600 BC. During this same
interval, large complex societies arose in the river basins immediately to the
South. While the prehistory of the latter region is relatively well known, the
Northern Corridor has been the subject of less intensive archaeological
investigation. Mr. Shelach has reviewed the published literature. He will now
conduct systematic regional surface survey to locate sites and will also study
unpublished site reports and curated collections. On this basis he hopes to
trace culture change. The goal of the research is to gain insight into the
processes which lead to the development of complex societies in different
environmental settings. While it is clear that such societies emerged in the
Yellow and Wei River Basins and that they were agriculturally based, the
sequence to the North is less well understood. Archaeologists know that Northern
Corridor people were primarily pastoralists. They have assumed that innovation
spread from South to North and that development could be explained within a
Southern "core", Northern "periphery" model. However the data to support this is
minimal and Mr. Shelach has proposed a model in which interaction between the
two areas leads to simultaneous change in each. The data he collects will permit
him to evaluate these two alternatives. This research is important for several
reasons. It will provide insight into the emergence of complex societies. The
results will, likely, be applicable in many regions of the world. The work will
also assist in the training of a promising young scientist. ***
