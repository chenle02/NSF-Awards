Although the focus on evidence-based explanations is prevalent in the science
education research literature, few concrete examples exist of what this inquiry
practice looks like when successfully implemented in the classroom. The co-PIs
have developed the middle school comprehensive science curriculum, Investigating
and Questioning our World through Science and Technology (IQWST), which
emphasizes scientific explanation and argument through out. Based on the
workshops with the teachers testing IQWST and the research accompanying that
development, a book linking current science education research to classroom
practice is to be written and tested. The book provides concrete written and
video examples of student explanations and arguments, along with accompanying
professional development facilitator materials. The examples include a variety
of different contexts in terms of content and diversity of students. Teachers
are supported in incorporating various instructional strategies in their own
teaching. The framework of claim, evidence, reasoning and rebuttal is made
explicit for both teachers and students. These materials take the theoretical
ideas and illustrate what they look like in actual classroom practice to educate
inservice and preservice teachers, teacher educators and professional
development providers. In addition, research is done with twenty-five teachers
to determine the impact of the materials on teachers' beliefs and classroom
practice around scientific explanation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
