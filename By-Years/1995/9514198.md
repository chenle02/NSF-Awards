A. Ronald Gallant University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill SBR-9514198 This
research represents a continuation of research in nonlinear econometric methods.
The research has applications in other disciplines than economics, such as
biological sciences. It will develop better approximations to underlying data.
The P.I. will continue to work on methodologies that sequentially improve the
approximations as information becomes available and permit reliable inference at
each intermediate stage of model evolution. Application fields within economics
include money, macroeconomics, and finance.
