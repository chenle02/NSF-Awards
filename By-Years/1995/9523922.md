This project is part of a longer-term research effort to promote a firmer
understanding of the factors that control the transport and chemical fate of
pollutants, substrates, and electron acceptors at the Darcy scale, in practice
the smallest scale for modeling the transport and chemical fate of solutes in
porous media. At the Darcy scale, a complex medium consisting of pores, a solid
matrix with biofilm, etc. is replaced by a homogenized medium characterized by
constitutive relations and parameters. The methodology of the project will be to
model flow, transport, and chemical transformations at the pore scale and then
to scale up in order to derive constitutive equations and parameters. The
constitutive equations and parameters to be obtained will thus be consistent
with the fundamental physico-chemical principles as well as the heterogeneity of
the medium. The fundamental objective is to derive relations among quantities
defined and measurable at the Darcy scale.
