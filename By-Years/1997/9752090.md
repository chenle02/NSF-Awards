Foothill College and its partners are developing a four-year curriculum
development project in advanced technology education entitled "Cases in Industry
Practice in Biotechnology" (CIPB) to address the critical need for a trained
workforce in the rapidly expanding biotechnology industry in the United States.
In active partnership with local industry, the project is first developing an
on-line infrastructure that permits industrial partners to participate in the
development of biotechnology instruction; this infrastructure is then being
utilized to develop three casebooks containing six industry-based teaching cases
that help students in biotechnology programs gain practical insights into the
skills required for research and development, intellectual property,
manufacturing, production, quality assurance/quality control, and clinical
studies. These materials are being used in classrooms at the high school,
community college, and university levels with over l OO,OOO students nationwide
and are suitable for use within industry employee training programs. This
project addresses the two most significant shortcomings in contemporary
biotechnology education programs: a lack of active involvement from industry
participants in the instructional process itself, and a dearth of high quality
biotechnology education curriculum materials. The unique time and resource
limitations that characterize the workforce of young biotechnology companies
make it necessary to explore a variety of methods for getting industry
involvement and buy-in into the biotechnology education process. Core partners
in this effort include representatives from industry and education. By preparing
students with the requisite biotechnology workplace skills--beyond biotechnology
content knowledge--the project's materials promote a wide range of career
opportunities in the field for high school, community college, and university
students nationwide.
