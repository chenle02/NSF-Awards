9505534 Bray The XIII International Symposium on Nuclear Quadrupole Interactions
will be held July 23-28, 1995 at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
The symposium will be devoted to all aspects of NQI in gases, liquids and solids
covering both experimental and theoretical work e.g. microwave measurements in
gas phase, Mossbauer spectroscopy, NMR, ESR, NQI, quadrupolar interactions in
superconductors, metals, biological and polymeric materials. There will be
several plenary lectures given by the internationally known scientists in the
field. Scientific papers will be reported in the oral and poster presentations
at the meeting. %%% This symposium presents a unique opportunity for
international scientists to present multidisciplinary research results in broad
classes of materials and enable students to interact with world-class
scientists. ***
