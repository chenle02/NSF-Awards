Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is one of the most powerful techniques
available for the high-resolution imaging of distant radio sources in the
universe and for making accurate measurements of the motion of the earth in
space. Multiple radiotelescopes scattered over the surface of the earth
simultaneously record data from a radio source at streaming data rates as high
as 1 Gbps for a 24-hour period; the data are then shipped to a central
processing site for correlation analysis. Because the signal-to-noise ratio
achieved by VLBI increases with the bandwidth of the observations, there has
been a continual effort to increase the captured data rate. The advent of modern
high-speed networks offers the possibility to transport VLBI data electronically
with much higher data rates and lower costs to maximize the scientific potential
of the observations. The electronic transmission of VLBI data (dubbed e-VLBI),
however, presents a special challenge to the use of high-speed global networks.

New protocols and strategies must be developed so that these applications become
efficient high-bandwidth 'background' users, while not significantly impacting
other normal network traffic. Because many high-speed networks, such as Abilene,
are not heavily loaded on an average basis, there is considerable potential for
applications of this class to productively use background capacity, promoting
better science for fewer dollars. MIT Haystack Observatory, working jointly with
the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, proposes to
undertake the following tasks to realize this potential:

1. Develop and test network protocols and algorithms that take advantage of the
special characteristics of real-time scientific instrumentation applications to
utilize low-priority bandwidth that is available in fair abundance on many
networks. 2. Develop a system that can be deployed widely at low cost, that can
be easily updated as algorithms improve, and that can track technology evolution
to gain higher performance over time. 3. Disseminate the work to a broader
community.
