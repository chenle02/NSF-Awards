This project concerns the reliable transmission and storage of digital
information. These are similar notions; digital transmission concerns the
transport of information from here to there while digital storage considers the
task of conveying digital information from now until then. Fundamental issues in
the design of codes and algorithms for modulation and error-control codes are
addressed. The application of the theory applies to both digital transmission
and magnetic and optical storage systems. The research is organized into five
components: (i) variable-length codes from symbolic dynamics: the mapping of
data onto walks through a graph; (ii) run-length codes with coding gain: where
the goal is to understand the nature of codes for saturation systems; (iii)
cascade codes, Grobner bases, and algebraic geometry: where the emphasis is on
developing the algebraic theory of cascade codes to provide for algebraic
decoding procedures; (iv) convolutional codes over finite rings: use of
arithmetic over rings to study CPM and rotationally invariant PSK and QAM; (v)
adaptive trellis coding: algorithms for sequence estimation that do not rely on
a fixed a priori response but allow the labels of the trellis to adapt.
