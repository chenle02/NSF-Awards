With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Professor
Nathanson is studying the gas-liquid interface by scattering molecular beams
from liquid surfaces. His group is studying the local roughness and rigidity of
the surface and the effect of solvent molecules on solvation, surface
adsorption, and surface chemistry. Under vacuum conditions that suppress
collisions in the vapor above the surface, Nathanson uses time-of-flight
spectroscopy to measure the details of scattering and adsorption-desorption of
individual solute molecules striking the liquid surface. Inert gases and protic
solutes such as water and ammonia are being scattered from hydrophobic,
hydrogen-bonding, and acidic liquids to learn how the incident collision energy
and angle of approach of the impinging beam control adsorption, solvation, and
proton exchange at the interface.
