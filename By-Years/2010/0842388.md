Electrons in Earth's radiation belts can have serious effects on spacecraft
electronics through radiation damage and deep dielectric charging. The physical
mechanisms governing the variability of these energetic electrons are still hot
topics of debate. The paradigm for explaining the creation of the electron
radiation belts has recently been shifting from one using only the theory of
radial diffusion to one including an important role for plasma waves. The
interaction of plasma waves with the electrons can result in in situ heating.
This project will investigate the relative contribution of radial diffusion and
in situ heating to the enhancement of MeV electrons inside geosynchronous orbit.
An internal source term will be added to a currently existing radial diffusion
model. Measurements of electrons using Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
satellite data at geosynchronous orbit will be used to determine the source
population. Realistic loss rates will be determined from data taken from the
SAMPEX satellite. The model results will then be compared to GPS satellite
measurements inside geosynchronous orbit. In this way, it will be possible to
determine how much enhancement of the MeV electrons measured by GPS can be
attributed to inward radial transport and how much to in situ heating.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will include research and training for
graduate students. The results will enhance our ability to predict an important
space weather phenomenon.
