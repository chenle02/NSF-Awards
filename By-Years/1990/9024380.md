Central to the mission of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study in the
equatorial Pacific is an understanding of the composition of the planktonic food
web, and the efficiency with which it transports carbon to the deep ocean. One
of the specific questions being posed is whether or not iron availability is
limiting productivity in this area. This project will address several dimensions
of the overall equatorial Pacific plan through the flow cytometric analysis of
the phytoplankton component of the food web. Specifically, the project will: (1)
Measure the distribution, abundance, and light scatter properties of the
picoplankton, and of the larger phytoplankton, on a transect across the equator;
(2) Measure the daily changes in cell number, forward light scatter (size), and
DNA content of individual cells, which can be translated into estimates of net
and gross population growth rates; (3) Use the measured daily changes in cell
number and light scatter per cell to help interpret beam attenuation
measurements; (4) Test the hypothesis that iron limits phytoplankton growth in
the equatorial Pacific by measuring changes in forward light scatter per cell,
carbon-14 incorporation per cell, and the distribution of DNA per cell of
specific components of the phytoplankton, in response to iron enrichment. //
