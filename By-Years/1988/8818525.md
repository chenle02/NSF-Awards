This grant provides partial support for the travel expenses of selected U.S.
scientists attending an international conference on the science and basic
mechanisms of fracture. This conference will bring together leading scientists
(and young scientists just entering this field) to discuss the fundamental
materials science of fracture, concentration on the processes occurring in the
vicinity of a crack tip. Disciplines represented will include mechanics,
ceramics, metallurgy, polymers, chemistry, and physics. Participation in this
conference by U.S. scientists is vital for maintaining our leadership role in
this important field.
