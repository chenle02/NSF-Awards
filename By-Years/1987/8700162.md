The evolutionary relationships of the avian family Heliornithidae will be
determined by solution DNA hybridization and nucleotide sequence comparisons.
Alternate hypotheses of heliornithid relationships are predicted differentially
by the assumptions of molecular versus morphological and paleontological studies
of organismal relationships. The assumptions include, but are not limited to,
the correlation of phylogeny and biogeography, the constancy of the rate of
evolution of DNA, and the irreversibility of morphological specializations.
Resolution of finfoot relationships will test these assumptions indirectly,
hence their general applicability to other groups. This study is feasible only
because the DNA of some very rare species will be cloned from long-dead museum
specimens, demonstrating unforeseen utility of museum collections. Dr. Peter W.
Houde will conduct this postdoctoral fellowship research during a two-year
tenure period at Princeton University.
