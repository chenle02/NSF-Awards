This project is the continuation of research involving the operation of, and
analysis of, data from a magnetometer at Frobisher Bay, NWT, Canada. The
magnetometer is almost exactly "conjugate" to the South Pole station which
supports a magnetometer belonging to the Co-Principal Investigator, L.J.
Lanzerotti of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. The object of the investigation is to
determine the extent to which these two very high lattitude stations have
similar or different magnetic flucuations and how the similarities or
differences are controlled by the solar wind as measured by several space craft.
Of particular interest are the magnetic signature of the merging of the sun's
interplanetary magnetic field with the earth's field; so called flux transfer
events.
