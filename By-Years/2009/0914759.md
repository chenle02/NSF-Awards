Many modern programming languages fit in a category called "scripting
languages." These languages are especially flexible, and they allow a programmer
to quickly assemble pieces of a program to solve a problem. Unfortunately, a
scripting language's flexibility can also hinder the programmer's ability to
develop and maintain a script when it grows into a larger program. As scripting
languages have become more popular, especially with new programmers, long-term
development and maintenance problems affect a growing body of programs at many
layer of our computing infrastructure. This project is about smoothing the path
from scripts to a more rigorous style of programming by introducing type systems
into scripting languages. A type system can offer up-front guarantees about how
a program will execute, and it can help isolate the effects of program
modifications. Rather than imposing a particular type system, however, this
project's goal is to explore a particular way of defining and customizing a type
system while introducing it gradually into an existing program. The specific
technical approach in this project builds on Lisp-style macros as provided by
the PLT Scheme programming language.
