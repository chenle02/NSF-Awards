Sensitivity to touch is known to be different between "passive" touch when an
object simply touches the skin, and "active" touch when an object is felt by
moving touch. We know very little about the mechanisms in the brain that
underlie these differences. This project exploits a novel approach recently
developed using rodent whiskers as a model system. Rodents actively explore
surfaces using characteristic "whisking" movements of their array of whiskers
called facial vibrissae. Recent work has shown that texture discrimination by
rats using their vibrissae is excellent, comparable to primates using their
fingertips, and that the behavioral strategies for discrimination are similar.
The rat whisker system is particularly well-suited for study because a lot is
known about its elegant anatomical orderly projection to the brain, and because
the whiskers are easily accessible for harmless manipulation and observation.
This project uses a novel combination of animal training, computer-assisted
movement analysis, and electrophysiological recordings from single nerve cells
to investigate this active touch. The relationship between whisking contact,
activity in peripheral neurons and activity in central cortical neurons is
compared, and the role of multiple whiskers and of sensory experience is
explored. Results from this work will have an impact beyond somatosensory
neuroscience toward better understanding how animals use actively driven sensory
behavior in general, how sensory experience and learning enhance discrimination,
and more generally how the brain acquires and processes information.
