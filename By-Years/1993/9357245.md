9357245 Mason This NSF Young Investigator award investigates the
interrelationships among natural products chemistry, behavioral biology,
reproductive physiology, and ecology. This research uses a comparative,
interdisciplinary approach that combines and integrates the molecular,
organismal, and ecological levels of analysis. It is conducted both in the
laboratory and in the field to illustrate the adaptive functions of
semiochemicals or pheromones. Field and laboratory studies are complementary,
bridging the gap between natural products chemistry and behavioral ecology by
incorporating laboratory-based analyses of the structure, manufacture, and
delivery of semiochemicals with studies of the animals's physiological ecology
and behavior in the field. Specifically, the research focuses on vertebrate sex
pheromones. Using state-of-the-art chemical techniques such as gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
the principal investigator has isolated, identified, and synthesized the first
pheromone in a reptile, the Canadian red- sided garter snake, Thamnophis
sirtalis parietalis. These studies address the practical applications of this
research. Currently rattlesnake repellent based on semiochemicals produced by
other snakes is being developed. A second project is aimed at using pheromones
to help control populations of the Guam brown tree snake, an introduced pest
species that has destroyed most of the native bird populations on Guam and
threatens the ecology of other Pacific Ocean islands, including Hawaii. ***
