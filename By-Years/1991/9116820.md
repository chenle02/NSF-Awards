The rearrangemnt of N-acyl-2-furylamines to N-acyl-3-piperidinones (the "aza-
Achmatowicz" reaction) is a novel, practical method for enantioselective
preparation of nitrogenous substances. A key step in the technique is the
chemoenzymatic resolution of racemic furylglycine and furylalanine. The resolved
aminoacids are efficiently transformed into building blocks for the synthesis of
structures as diverse as azasaccharides, beta-lactams, unusual aminoacids,
glycoside antibiotics, and amphibian alkaloids. %%% With this award, the Organic
Synthesis Program will support the research of Dr. Marco A. Ciufolini at Rice
University. The research explores new ramifications of an old well-established
nitrogen heterocycle ring-forming reaction which permits asymmetric control at a
crucial stage of the reaction sequence. This is combined with utilization of new
organometallic reagents to generate new synthetic methodology that should
benefit research in biochemistry, medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
