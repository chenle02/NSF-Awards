Preliminary research investigating the efficacy of the pedagogical innovations
described in this proposal--ConcepTests coupled with Peer Instruction-has shown
very promising results. The technique has two primary goals: 1. to expose
students' common misconceptions about fundamental principles via the use of
ConcepTests, and 2. to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of basic
concepts, through Peer Instruction. Greater understanding, in turn, leads to a
greater appreciation of the material, and is ultimately expected to result in an
increased interest in the sciences. An initial application of this method in
introductory physics classes indicated that the program achieved both of these
objectives. The initial research is being extended to quantify the results,
improve and fine tune the procedures, and systematize its application so it can
be widely applied in undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering
education. A parallel application of the method is being conducted at Lowell
University to examine the transferability of the methods.
