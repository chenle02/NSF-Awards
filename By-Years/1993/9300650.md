A three-day workshop will be held on the subject of coral-based climate
reconstruction. Participants are to include scientists engaged in paleoclimate
studies using corals as well as specialists from related disciplines. The
purpose of the workshop is: (1) to discuss and evaluate methods for chronology
development, paleoclimate time series, (2) to disseminate information about the
use and fidelity of new and existing paleoclimate tracers in corals, (3) to
explore ways in which coral-based paleoclimatology would benefit from
methodologies and expertise developed in related fields, (4) to develop
strategies for coordinated studies, and (5) to initiate discussion on
development of a regional or global "scleroclimatic" database.
