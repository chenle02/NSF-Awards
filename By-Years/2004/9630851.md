Gibbs 9630851 The gonadal steroid hormones have marked and various effects on
the central nervous system. However, the receptors for these powerful hormones
are not restricted to areas of the brain involved in reproduction, but are also
found in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These areas receive dense input
from neurons containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It has long been
postulated that the cholinergic neurons play an important role in learning and
memory and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including estrogen. This
effect of estrogen may be mediated, in part, by growth factors. In the
experiments supported by this award, the effects of estrogen on
acetylcholinergic function and growth factor production are being investigated.
These studies will provide significant new information regarding the mechanisms
by which estrogens influence cognitive function. As populations age, estrogen
levels decline and how this impacts on cognitive function is crucial to
improving the quality of life of the general population.
