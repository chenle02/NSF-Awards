9421811 Raja Description: This proposal provides final funding for one year to
support participation of Delhi University scientists currently resident in the
US and working on the DO Experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory. The project is headed on the US side by Paul Grannis, Stony Brook
with coPI, Hugh Montgomery, Fermilab. The cooperating Indian scientist is Dr.
Ram Shivpuri, Director of the Centre for Detector and Related Software
Technology. The Delhi group has extensive experience with the study of quark and
gluon structure, with detectors, and have the computational techniques required
for particle physics studies. They also have a strong capability with the design
of software systems for offline computer analysis of data. Scope: The
collaboration brings technical capabilities from India, as well as equipment
provided from Indian sources, to allow participation with American scientists in
the particle physics studies carried out at Fermilab. This is a unique
opportunity for the Indian participants to work on high energy experiments at
one of the world's most powerful accelerators. On March 3, 1995, Fermilab
announced the discovery of the TOP quark by this group of high energy
physicists. ***
