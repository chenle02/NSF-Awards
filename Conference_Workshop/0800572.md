Abstract Zheng

The proposal is for partial funding of the 24-th Southeastern Analysis Meeting
(SEAM) and Shanks lectures at Vanderbilt University, from March 5 to 9, 2008.
The purpose of this supplement is to request funding to help defer the expenses
of graduate students, minorities, women, and recent doctoral recipients in an
effort to give them the opportunity to participate in the conference. The SEAM
conference was first held at Virginia Tech. in 1985. Since then its location has
rotated among the institutions in the southeast. The annual Shanks Lectures at
the Department of Mathematics, Vanderbilt University date back to 1985. The SEAM
affords established and new researchers, and advanced graduate students, the
opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and discuss the wide variety of
mathematics encompassed within modern and classical analysis. In particular, the
conference has traditionally provided an opportunity for young researchers to
present their work and to discuss their research with more experienced
mathematicians. The diverse topics presented during the conference provide a
unique opportunity to see the wide variety of problems in analysis. The Shanks
Lectures have played a prominent role in the Mathematics Department at
Vanderbilt University for the past 23 years. The lecturer for this conference
will be Charles Fefferman, Princeton University. NSF's funding will be used
completely for participants' support. Priority will be given to members of
underrepresented groups, graduate students, postdocs, and younger faculty.
