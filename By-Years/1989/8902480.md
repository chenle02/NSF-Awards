8902480 Buss This research project deals with the relationship between low-level
complexity and weak formal systems of arithmetic and mathematical logic. Low-
level complexity concerns feasible computational models such as polynomial time
computation, logarithmic space computability and alternating logarithmic time.
Past research has already shown intimate connections between low-level
complexity and very weak logical systems. The intended areas for research
include research on lengths of propositional and first-order proofs, on
axiomatizations of Bounded Arithmetic, on intutionistic Bounded Arithemetic, and
on obtaining formal theories which have proof-theoretic strength equivalent to
computational classes such as alternating logarithmic time and nondeterministic
logarithmic space.
