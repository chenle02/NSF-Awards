A VLSI integrated circuit design course is being developed for the Gonzaga
University Electrical Engineering curriculum. This project provides for a
laboratory to support the VLSI design course. This enlarged VLSI design program
provides the VLSI design course (EE475) and a follow-on course in integrated
circuit testing (EE476). The laboratory consists of a network of four SUN
computer workstations and a Versatek electrostatic plotter. The laboratory
interfaces with the campus Ethernet for access to printer and backup storage
facilities as well as provides wider access to the laboratory. This equipment
allows student access to the "ChipCrafter" commercial VLSI design software
package as well as software academic tool sets available from several sources.
Integrated circuit testing equipment is already on hand in the department to
test the design products.
