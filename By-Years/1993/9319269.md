This research is concerned with finding efficient hierarchical testability
techniques for controller-data path systems. The approach is to start with
module level test sets, derived for any suitable fault model, and use high level
synthesis to ensure that these test sets can be combined into a system level
test set which can provide complete test coverage of all the embedded modules.
The aim is to invent algorithms that reduce test generation and application
times, yet obtain complete, or nearly complete, system level test coverage with
little or no area and delay overhead. The testability techniques are being
embedded into algorithms for scheduling and allocation. Also being explored are
methods for performing synthesis with both low power and testability as design
criteria.
