All three major projects in this proposal, although fundamentally different,
require the use of a basic biochemical technique- following metabolic function
with radioisotopes. One of the proposals is designed to utilize experiments to
study the regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression by thyroid hormone.
Results obtained may possible allow us to correlate the appearance of
disappearance of certain phosphoproteins with the transcriptional regulation of
this gene by thyroid hormone. Another one of the projects proposed also
investigates the regulation of gene transcription but does so by trying to
determine the role of methylated DNA. The third project is focused on
understanding the regulation of the synthesis of lipids in rat hepatocytes. The
forth project is designed to examine the effects of various conditions on the
cAMP levels on isolated arterioles. In all projects proposed, radioisotopes are
use in a monitoring or detection manner and thus quantitation of these
measurements by liquid scintillation counting is essential.
