Glutamate biosensing probes based on fiber optic technology will be developed.
These probes consist of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase immobilized at the
distill tip of an optical fiber. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction between
glutamate and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to form 2-oxoglutarate,
ammonia and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The generation of
NADH is monitored by either a fluorescence or bioluminescence process. In both
cases, a steady-state signal is produced which can be related to the sample
concentration of glutamate. If successful, the proposed glutamate biosensors
will be suitable for in vivo studies to determine the neurological properties of
glutamate. These sensors will allow localized, intratissue measurements of
glutamate (and possibly aspartate) in intact neuoral tissue. Such localized
measurements can potentially separate synaptic from non-synaptic pools of these
putative neurotransmitters. In addition, a reagent-less glutamate probe will
also be investigate as a means to make continuous, in vivo glutamate
measurements.
