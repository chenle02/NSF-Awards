The Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) workshop is an annual event with the goal of
encouraging participation of junior researchers in integer programming and
related areas. The primary goals of this workshop are to showcase young
researchers; to increase the visibility for accomplished students at an early
stage in their career; and to provide an opportunity for graduate students to
network with the world's top researchers. This award will provide funds for
graduate students to attend the 19th MIP workshop, each of whom will be
presenting his or her poster at the workshop. MIP student poster sessions
provide students with an opportunity to highlight their ongoing work and network
with other researchers from industry and academia. During the workshop, student
posters are also judged by a workshop committee and outstanding posters are
recognized. In addition, this year the workshop will introduce a computational
competition that will allow students to test their skills on a challenging
optimization problem. This award provides travel support for 10 student poster
presenters. The conference has been a fertile ground for students' professional
development, with a number of previous participants supported by NSF now holding
faculty positions across the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2022 MIP workshop will
be held from May 24 to May 26, 2022 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The
solicitation for the poster presentations will be sent to a variety of mailing
lists, with particular effort to broaden participation by attracting students
from underrepresented groups in engineering. By providing travel funds for
graduate students, NSF will help to decrease the cost of attendance to encourage
participation of students and will support the engagement of STEM students in
emerging research in the field of MIP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
