9512376 Pahlavan The proposed project is to develop an experimental wireless
network with ATM connectivity for multi-media applications. An experimental
wireless campus test-bed will be used to construct a wireless classroom
environment. In this classroom environment, the instructor presents his/her
lecture material that is prepared on a personal computer through the electronic
projector and an electronic board. Multi-media services including voice, text,
and bit-mapped images will be provided to students dispersed over a small
geographical area on the campus. The results of the experiment will have a
multifold impact including the feasibility of access multi-media information
using portable wireless terminals, the development of benchmarks specific to
multi-media wireless network applications for future comparative performance
evaluation of different wireless technologies, and the development of multi-
media wireless networking protocols and mobility management algorithms. ***
