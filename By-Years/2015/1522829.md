The goal of this research is to better understand the connection between mid-
latitude clouds and dynamics in observations. The reasons for why the such
linkages are well-represented in some global climate models but not in others
will be studied. The implications of these processes on model climate
sensitivity and future climate projections will also be examined. In the first
part of the project, observed and model cloud radiative properties will be
composited with respect to the centers of cyclones and anticyclones over the
mid-latitude oceans of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, to examine in the
sectors of weather systems linked to model biases and uncertainties in future
climate projections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the second part of the project,
idealized model experiments will be performed using two versions of the
Community Atmosphere Model with very different representations of Southern Ocean
cloud radiative properties. In both model versions, quadrupled carbon dioxide
experiments will be run with the radiative properties of the clouds enabled and
disabled, in order to explore the role of varying cloud-radiative effects in
governing the response of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet to increased
greenhouse gas forcing. By better understanding cloud-radiative-dynamical
connections in observations and how they are misrepresented in models, the
proposed project not only can improve theoretical knowledge of the role of
clouds in the climate system, but also can provide additional constraints on
cloud parameterizations that will help to reduce uncertainty in future model
projections.
