This project will support the participation of junior researchers (students,
postdocs, and early-career faculty members) in the Workshop on Artificial
Intelligence (AI) Applications in Nuclear Physics that will be held on March
4-6, 2020, in Newport News, Virginia. The Workshop will help define the
priorities of the U.S. nuclear physics community with respect to AI applications
in nuclear physics. The goal of the Workshop is to document areas where AI can
be used to meet the scientific goals outlined in the Nuclear Sciences Advisory
Committeeâ€™s 2015 Long Range Plan. AI applications to Theory, Experiment, and
Accelerator operations and design will be addressed. The findings of the
Workshop will be collected in a workshop report.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
