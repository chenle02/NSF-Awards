Communication and imaging through the atmosphere, the ocean, the geophysical
medium, or the biological medium by electromagnetic and acoustic waves are often
severely affected by the random spatial and temporal variations of the medium.
Although considerable progress has been reported on the interactions of waves
with such random media, some fundamental questions are still not resolved,
impeding progress in several important areas of application. Theoretical
formulations for these problems are often complex, involving various assumptions
and approximations, and their range of validity is difficult to determine. The
researchers are attacking these problems using both analytical and experimental
methods. The experiments are carefully controlled so that the results can be
compared with theoretical predictions and extended by numerical computations.
The results of these studies may be useful in various applications including
atmospheric optics, ocean acoustics, geophysical remote-sensing, radars, lidars,
ultrasound imaging, and optical inverse scattering of random inhomogeneous
media.
