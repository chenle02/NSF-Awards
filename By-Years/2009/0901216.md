ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Vu, Van

University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;Title: Random Graphs, Random Matrices and
Subset sums&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is going to work on several basic
problems concerning random graphs and random matrices. For example, as far as
random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp
thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a
special case of which is the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect
matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and
the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs and random
regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems
concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity,
distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in
theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural
theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links
to other fields, such as number theory and probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For
a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult
structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the
spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms. Another is the use
of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is
to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with
some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be
related. He strongly believes that a systematic study of the proposed problems
will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be
useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations
between various fields of mathematics.
