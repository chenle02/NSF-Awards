Ralph Roskies and Michael Levine have organized a workshop on Fast Processes in
Protein Folding Dynamics. Understanding how proteins fold is one of the central
challenges in biology today. Only recently, with the advent of advanced
computational methods, has it been possible to simulate the dynamics of protein
folding. To apply theoretical and computational approaches in biology it is
essential to link in experimentation; today, technical limitations lie in the
way of interlinking theory, simulation, and experiment. The workshop will be
structure to develop new approaches to central questions or challenges by
bringing together scientists from different disciplines who would ordinarily not
attend the same meeting, by developing seed questions in advance of the meeting
to focus the discussion throughout the course of the meeting, by setting aside
specific panel sessions following each major set of talks to allow open and
extensive discussion of possibilities and difficulties. The meeting will help
set a research agenda for a diverse community of scientist drawn from several
disciplines.
