9301043 Lysak The primary goals of the first GEM campaign are an understanding
of the mapping of dayside magnetopause processes to the ionosphere and a
determination of the ionospheric signatures of such processes. Although previous
attempts have been made to consider the static mapping of magnetopause processes
to the ionosphere, the fact that the Alfven transit time from the magnetopause
to the ionosphere is comparable to the evolution time of magnetopause processes
suggests that the dynamics of this coupling is important. This proposed work
focuses on an investigation of these effects by means of a three-dimensional
model of coupling of the magnetosphere and ionosphere by means of Alfven waves
which considers the global, linear response of the magnetosphere and ionosphere
to perturbations at the magnetopause. In this model, perturbations representing
magnetopause processes such as transient reconnection, Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities or dynamic pressure pulses can be imposed on the magnetopause, and
the resulting ionospheric signature can be self-consistently calculated. This
model will be extended to include finite pressure effects, finite ionospheric
conductivity and a generalized magnetic field geometry. This project will be
supported by two related projects, one of which considers a localized model of a
diverging auroral flux tube which includes nonlinearities, ionospheric dynamics
and parallel electric fields. The other related project is an investigation of
transport processes at the magnetopause and their role in the generation of
field-aligned currents. The numerical results will be compared with data from
ground magnetometer arrays in order to determine the most likely source for the
observed magnetic vortices. ***
