This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will development a smart
seal using shape memory alloy technology (SMA) combined with elastic foundation
bedding. The use of active control allows corrections to take place during the
operation. Active control protects against seal failure and preserves the
tribological characteristics. The objective is to develop a class of non-
contacting mechanical annular seals (e.g. labyrinth, smooth bushing, and step)
where their clearance can be actively controlled.

The commercial benefits from this application will be in compressors and
steam/gas turbines. This project will have a significant advantage over existing
types of labyrinth seals by reducing the leakage rates, extending operational
life, decreasing required maintenance, decreasing fuel consumption or electric
power of the machinery and will lessen contamination of the environment.
