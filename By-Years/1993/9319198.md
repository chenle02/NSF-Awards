9319198 Dawson Computer simulation of plasma accelerators, light sources and
solar/astrophysical phenomena are used to study a broad class of basic plasma
processess. The simulations are performed on supercomputers, workstations and
PC's. Recent studies have successfully explored the application of parallel
computers to plasma physics and have provided a model for advanced scientific
computing for the community. Training of students in the use of the most
advanced computing techniques is a significant aspect of the research. ***
