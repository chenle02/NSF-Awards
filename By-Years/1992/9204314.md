The principal investigator will study geometric rigidity and related problems
from harmonic maps. The Kodaira-Bochner formulae on submanifolds will be related
to the formulae on the ambient manifold. In addition the principal investigator
will continue his work on compactification of Kahler manifolds that satisfy
certain curvature conditions. This award will support research in the general
area of differential geometry and global analysis. Differential geometry is the
study of the relationship between the geometry of a space and analytic concepts
defined on the space. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and
topological properties of a space by piecing together local information.
Applications of these areas of mathematics in other sciences include the
structure of complicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale
structure of the universe.
