This proposal creates a computer-based undergraduate laboratory for archaeology
with workstations supporting visual, statistical and textual tools linked to an
existing Ethernet. This laboratory serves three existing archaeology courses.
Other courses can be modified to take advantage of the equipment. The department
has begun to incorporate computer usage into the teaching of classical
archaeology, developing laboratory exercises based on hyptertext technology
which allow students to solve archaeological problems using scanned images of
artifacts and stratigraphy. This project facilitates this trend, allowing the
inclusion of basics such as the use of data-base systems and statistical
packages, and the development of more comprehensive and innovative projects such
as an archaeological role-playing game. The institution is matching the NSF
grant with an equal amount of funds.
