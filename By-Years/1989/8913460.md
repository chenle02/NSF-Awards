This is a joint project staffed by investigators at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University and Cornell University. The motivation of the
work is the extension of the capabilities of power transmission systems to a
point closer to their thermal limits. This is done by extending (expanding) the
stability and security limits of the system. The approach is the use of an
improved out-of- step relay which employs real time phasor measurements.
Included in the project are issues of protective relaying, modelling, the one
machine/infinite bus equivalent, and network dynamic reduction. The project
builds on work using the Global Positioning Satellite for real time phasor
measurements with applications in power system protective relaying. This project
is being jointly funded by the Electric Power Research Institute and the
National Science Foundation.
