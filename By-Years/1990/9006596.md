The principal investigator will work on applications of the wavelet transform
and neural network models to density and regression estimates. This topic treats
one of the fundamental problems in mathematical statistics. It has important
applications to pattern recognition, prediction, and expert systems designs. The
investigator will bring to these problems knowledge from mathematical physics.
In addition, the investigator will work with undergraduate students on aspects
of this topic. In particular, the undergraduates will be introduced to these
topics via data analysis.
