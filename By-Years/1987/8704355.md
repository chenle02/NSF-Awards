The research combines modelling and experiment for studying metallorganic
chemical vapor deposition of gallium aluminum arsenide. The models will utilize
advances made under the previous grant, DMR-8351249. The following chemical
vapor deposition reactors will be modelled: 1) three dimensional models of
horizontal reactors, 2) optimization of the shape of vertical reactors, 3)
optimal operating conditions and shapes for rotating disk flow reactors, 4) time
dependent simulations of growth of superlattice structures, 5) three dimensional
flow structures in vertical reactors. The modelling will be coupled with the
experimental research which includes growth of the materials in existing
reaction chambers for processing of integrated electronic materials,
determination of gas phase and surface diffusion chemical kinetics using
molecular beam sampled mass spectrometer and thermogravimetric measurements, and
measurement of the rate and uniformity of deposition. The research will allow
improvement in design of reactors used to process integrated electronics,
improved control of the operation of the reactors, assurance that the components
will be uniform (thereby increasing yield and quality).
