The object of the research is to develop a new approach for control design of
flexible multibody systems. Distributed parameter actuator and sensor
technologies which incorporate piezoelectric materials within structural
components will be used in conjunction with discrete controls applied at the
component boundaries to effect high-precision operations of a multibody system.
The distributed parameter control algorithms will be derived from multibody
systems models based on geometrically exact structural theories. Such structural
theories provide an accurate representation of the nonlinear dynamics of finite
rotations and also model nonlinear effects of moderate large deformations,
centrifugal stiffening, and material damping. The intent of such an advanced
formulation is to provide a unified theory to address the increasingly
lightweight and flexible designs of next-generation space structures and robot
manipulators.*** //
