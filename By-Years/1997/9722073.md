Research will be done at the interface of theoretical nuclear and elementary
particle physics using the analytical and numerical techniques known as `lattice
QCD` to investigate a set of topics on computers at major supercomputer centers.
QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) is the theory which describes the strong nuclear
force. Lattice techniques make impossible calculations possible by replacing the
continuum of spacetime by a discrete lattice of points. The first of the topics
to be pursued will be the interaction between light and the `pion` particles
found in collisions of nucleons. The second project will be an updated and more
precise computer study of neutron and proton electromagnetic structure. The
third project will be a detailed investigation of a set of numerical techniques
which deal with so-called `disconnected diagrams` in lattice QCD. QCD is part of
our theory of the four fundamental forces of nature. The studies to be carried
out here will test whether the implications of QCD can be reliably determined
using lattice techniques.
