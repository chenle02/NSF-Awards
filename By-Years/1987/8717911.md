Blennies of the family Chaenopsidae number about 60 species of primarily
tropical fishes and are particularly notable for their varied patterns of
anatomical differences between males and females. This study will investigate
the evolutionary relationships of 26 species within the family by analysis of
these traits. This approach will address several taxonomic controversies within
chaenopsids, provide a detailed study of the historical patterns of change in
their sexually dimorphic traits, and, together with earlier studies on the
ecology of chaenopsids, permit evaluation of alternative hypotheses for the
evolution of conspicuous morphological differences between the sexes.
