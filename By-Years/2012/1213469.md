This award from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of
the Division of Chemistry supports research by Professor Liu of Duke University
on the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs can be either metallic
or semiconducting depending on their detailed molecular structures. The metallic
and semiconducting nanotubes are suitable for very different applications. The
growth of either pure metallic or semiconducting CNTs has been very challenging.
Obtaining specific types (either metallic or semiconducting) of CNTs is critical
for the realization of next-generation carbon nanotube-based nanoscale
electronics. Over the last decade, significant efforts in research have been
focused on selective growth of type-specific nanotubes but only limited progress
has been made. Recently, there have been important breakthroughs in experimental
observations, by the PIs and other research groups, that selective growth of
semiconducting carbon nanotubes is possible. The underlying mechanism for such
selective growth is still not clear and more experimental proofs and theoretical
modeling is needed to complete and confirm the mechanism. This proposal will
produce new knowledge on how to grow pure semiconducting carbon nanotubes
suitable for electronic devices. In this proposed program, the PI will work
closely with theoreticians to study the chemistry during and after the growth of
carbon nanotubes. The researchers will study the differences between metallic
and semiconducting nanotubes in terms of nucleation energy, growth rate, etc.
Based on the experimental results, the researchers will build up deep
understanding on the mechanism of the growth selectivity. The results from this
research will enable wide range of carbon nanotube technological applications
including nanoelectronics, bio- and chemical sensors. Students at all levels
will be engaged in the project.
