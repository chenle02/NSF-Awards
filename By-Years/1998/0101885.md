The proposal provides travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a
DELOS workshop on "Information Seeking, Searching, and Querying in Digital
Libraries" to be held in Zurich, Switzerland December 11-12, 2000. DELOS is a
major forum for and organizer of digital libraries research and planning
activities in Europe. It is funded by the Information Societies Technologies
(IST) 5th Framework Programme of the European Commission.

The workshop continues the planning and research agenda put forward by the
multi-year NSF-EU working groups' process jointly sponsored by CISE/IIS, SBE/INT
and the European Union. In the groups' final report "An International Research
Agenda for Digital Libraries", increased levels of collaboration and interaction
was seen as critical to building multi-lingual, multi-national digital
libraries.
