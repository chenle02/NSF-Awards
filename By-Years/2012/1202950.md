The intellectual merit of this award is based on the fact that a sensitive
search for neutrino-less nuclear double-beta decay is the only practical way to
determine if neutrinos are Majorana particles (their own antiparticles). This
exotic decay is the most sensitive test of lepton-number conservation, which is
an important symmetry in elementary particle physics. In fact, if neutrinos are
Majorana particles, an accurate measurement of the beta-decay half-life would
yield the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino. The laboratory
observation and measurement of such a decay would be truly transformative of
elementary particle physics, astrophysics and
cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides base support for a team
working on two neutrino-less double-beta decay experiments: USC has a major task
for CUORE (using Tellurium-130) at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso
(LNGS). The PI is the U.S. Coordinator for the construction of CUORE-0, which
will operate in the CUORICINO cryostat and yield physics beyond that of
CUORICINO, the precursor experiment to CUORE. USC also leads a major Task in the
MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR R&amp;D (using Germanium-76). The PI is responsible for
the procurement of enriched 76-Germanium Oxide, its reduction to metal, zone
refinement to detector quality metal, and reprocessing of scrap material. He was
responsible for building the facility for the Germanium-processing and is in
charge of its operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broader impact would be an
important contribution to cosmology. Another is, and has been, new detector
technology for National and Homeland security. A third broader impact is new
cryogenic and Germanium-detector technology for other basic and applied
sciences. CUORE is yielding the new technology of large cryogenic detectors.
