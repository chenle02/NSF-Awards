The principal investigator plans to continue his research in Riemannian metric
geometry; in particular some basic problems in two area: (1) collapsed
Riemannian manifolds with bounded sectional curvature (in absolute value or from
below) and (2) rigidity and stability problems in Alexandrov geometry. In his
research, mathematics from several disciplines interact, such as metric
Riemannian geometry, analysis and partial differential equations, compact
transformation group theory and topology. This project is amplified by the fact
that among the manifolds of same dimension whose sectional curvature is bounded
from between below and whose diameter is bounded above by a constant, all but
finitely many are collapsed and are close to some Alexandrov
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics is the foundation of the natural
sciences, and differential geometry/ Riemannian geometry are among the most
important branches of mathematics. The PI is pursuing solving some basic
problems in this field that would have a broad intellectual impact. The PI will
continue to actively pursue collaborations with other mathematicians in the
United States and abroad and to speak at several national and international
meetings a year.
