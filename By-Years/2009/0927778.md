The research objective of this award is to determine the mechanism of hydrogen-
bonding directed molecular recognition in water and the installation of such
motifs onto known polymeric scaffolds. This study will provide a quantitative
basis for consideration of hydrogen bonds in aqueous environment in the context
of a synthetic or bio-derived scaffold. This fundamental component of the award
lays the groundwork for incorporation of selective hydrogen bonding groups onto
different polymeric backbones. It is anticipated that the use of selective
recognition groups on natural and synthetic polymers will lead to enhanced
function. Selective heteropolymeric interaction guided by hydrogen-bonding has
great potential utility, especially in the context of surface coatings. Overall,
this work traces an arc from study of molecular properties to the production of
chemically-responsive, biocompatible and biodegradable materials.

If successful, selective surface adhesion would be possible in water, with no
oxidative or photocuring required, making it widely applicable as a ?molecular
Velcro?, which would allow only designated coated surfaces to adhere. This would
be useful in a number of industrial ad biomedical applications, such as in
marine environment coatings or biocompatible surface adhesives as suture
alternatives, and hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering. This
research bridges synthetic chemistry, materials science, engineering and
biomedical research and will facilitate new cross-disciplinary educational
experiences for graduate and undergraduate students. Students will also be
exposed to the practical aspects of developing a new materials application. The
simple hands-on experimental approach to molecular recognition concepts is
amenable to incorporation into instructional labs. It is anticipated that
development of a general methodology to enhance the synthetic and biopolymer
function will have a transformative impact on both the agricultural and coatings
industry with significant economic and environmental benefit.
