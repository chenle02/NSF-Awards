Oleg Prezhdo of the University of Washington is supported by an award from the
Theory, Models and Computational Methods program for the development of novel
simulations approaches for nonadiabatic and semiclassical molecular dynamics,
their implementation within time-domain density functional theory and the
investigation of the fundamental questions posed in the recent time-resolved
experiments performed on nanoscale materials. This work provides a detailed,
atomistic picture of photo excitation dynamics in real-time and in direct
connection with experiment. The research focuses on the quantum properties of
condensed phase environments at the nanoscale, such as decoherence, state-
specific dynamics, zero-point energy, and non-adiabatic transitions, providing
more rigorous treatments of ultrafast phenomena. These methods are applied to
the excitation dynamics in novel nanomaterials, including wet-electrons, carbon
nanotubes and nanoribbons, and metallic particles.

The PI and his coworkers develop methods to study many important features of
nanoscale systems. These studies are the first to provide the highly desirable
details and understanding of many experimentally observed phenomena, generating
the theoretical basis for the development of novel devices for solar energy
conversion, electronics, and imaging. The PI also develops novel teaching tools
for use both in introductory and advanced chemistry courses.
