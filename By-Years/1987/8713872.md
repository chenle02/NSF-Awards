In the Fall of 1985, the PI in an NSF funded project undertook an extensive
geophysical survey of the O'Gorman Fracture Zone. This feature comprises two
segments lying to the west and east of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) at 13 degree
N. The former appears to be a normal fracture zone, while the East O'Gorman is
marked by several seamounts. The geophysical survey comprised of Ocean Bottom
Seismic (OBS) refraction shooting, SeaBeam profiling and magnetic and gravity
measurements. In this award, the PI will continue the analysis of the data
collected on this experiment particularly the OBS data which is of excellent
quality. The major goal of the project is to characterize the internal structure
of the EOG seamounts, and hence to constrain models for the origin of seamount
chains on young oceanic lithosphere.
