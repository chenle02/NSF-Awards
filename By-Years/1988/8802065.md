Polyspermic eggs usually die after a short period of abnormal embryogenesis,
but eggs of many animals and at least two plants are protected from polyspermy
by "fast" and "slow" blocks. The studies proposed here will extend out general
understanding of the fast block (a transient, ion-mediated blockage) using
fucoid algae as a model system. Physiological and electrophysiological
techniques will be used to describe the ionic dependence of the fast block and
the fertilization potential. The effect of the sperm/egg ratio on polyspermy
will be evaluated in several fucoid species, and data on fertilization and
sperm/egg rations in the field will be collected. Natural levels of polyspermy
will be determined by placing tiles within appropriate portions of the
intertidal zone and observing the development of colonizing zygotes. Such
studies will examine the possibility that recruitment of zygotes is affected by
failure of the fast block during periods of natural osmotic stress. Little
information is available on polyspermic blocks in plants. The proposed work will
make a significant contribution in this area, both through the proposed studies
of fucoid algae and by examining several other marine and freshwater algae for
the presence of an ionic block to polyspermy. %%% Eggs that are fertilized by
more than one sperm usually die after a short period of abnormal embryogenesis.
In many organisms polyspermy is prevented by two successive mechanisms- a fast
acting block and a slower one. The fast block is mediated by transient ionic
fluxes that begin immediately after the first fertilization. In spite of its
widespread occurrence, there is little ecological data available to evaluate the
importance of this fast block under natural circumstances as opposed to in the
laboratory where ionic conditions are manipulated or sperm/egg ratios are high.
Dr. Brawley proposes to investigate the natural situation using fucoid algae in
tide pools where ionic conditions can vary dramatically. She will thus obtain
ecological data that are currently lacking on natural sperm/egg concentrations,
and an evaluation of how common polyspermy is in nature.
