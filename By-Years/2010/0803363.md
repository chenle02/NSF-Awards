The PI will work on diverse problems in the algebraic topology of manifolds. The
area of investigations are equivariant homotopical intersection theory, higher
Reidemeister torsion, the construction of periodic families of Poincare duality
spaces, and multiple disjunction problems for spaces of smooth embeddings. The
methods to be employed on each of these projects have a common thread, involving
equivariant and fiberwise homotopy theory. The proposed activity will strengthen
collaborative mathematics between individuals at 5 universities (Brown, Notre
Dame, Buffalo, Altoona and Wayne State). It will also foster the training of
graduate students in algebraic topology at Wayne
State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "manifold" is a topological space that
satisfies a homogeneity property. Locally speaking, all manifolds are alike in
that at any point one sees a copy of Euclidean space. It is the global structure
of manifolds that makes them interesting objects of study. Typically, algebraic
topologists study manifolds by assigning certain algebraic quantities, called
"invariants," to them, which measure their global topological structure.
Manifolds having different invariants can then be distinguished from one
another. Manifolds arise naturally in physics, chemistry and biology as spaces
of solutions of a suitably "nice" set of algebraic equations modeling the
scientific object of study (space-time, atoms, dynamical systems, etc.) .
Manifolds play a central role in mathematics. It is often the case that
mathematical questions about manifolds can be formulated in terms of
parametrized families of functions between spaces associated with manifolds.
Homotopy theory is a subject designed to tackle questions about such families of
functions. The PI proposes to study certain kinds of manifold questions which
can be analyzed from the homotopy theoretic toolbox.
