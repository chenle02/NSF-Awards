IBN-9511077 Truman, James W. The brain contains a myriad of substances with the
potential to be used as chemical messengers between cells. One class of
messenger molecules are small protein-like substances called neuropeptides.
These messengers can function in communication between cells where their release
is a local event or in situations where they are carried great distances and act
as hormones. The target tissues, either local or distant, contain recognition
sites for these substances, which then use secondary systems to transmit the
signal into the cell, thereby altering its level of activity. Altering the
activity of a large population of cells potentially changes the physiology and
behavior of the organism. Dr. Truman isolated and characterized such a
peptidergic messenger molecule called eclosion hormone (EH) and has provided
preliminary information on the biological significance of this messenger. In the
present studies, he will investigate the mechanisms employed by neurons to
generate second messengers functioning inside the neuronal targets for EH. In
addition, because of his past ability to isolate the gene encoding EH, he will
use molecular biological tools to generate mutants unable to produce this
messenger molecule and study their behavior. These investigations will further
understanding about the role of neuropeptides in the functioning of the nervous
system and the mechanisms used by peptides to alter behavior.
