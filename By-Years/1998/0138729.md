The Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Animal Behavior Site Grant
enables promising undergraduate students to participate in laboratory or field
research projects in animal behavior. Each year, the program awards internships
to 10 students who experience firsthand the nature of the research process, the
conduct of science in general, and the integrative study of animal behavior. To
accomplish these goals, REU pays travel expenses, room &amp; board, and a
stipend so that interns can spend 10 weeks in the summer on the Bloomington
campus or at a field site conducting research with scientists from Indiana
University's Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior. Participation
in the research project provides the main focus of the program, but interns also
participate in research ethics workshops, attend lectures that introduce them to
the integrative approach to studying animal behavior, and write up and orally
present their research findings at a final REU Research Symposium. Interns also
participate in social activities, field trips and activities that help them
prepare for graduate school or other postgraduate training. An important
objective of the REU in Animal Behavior program is to provide to students from
groups traditionally underrepresented in science and from institutions with
limited research opportunities access to cutting-edge research and membership in
a research university community. It is expected that in the long term this
program will help such students consider careers in animal behavior or related
disciplines and increase their representation in science in general.
