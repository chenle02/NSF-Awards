This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program in support of the research of Dr. Daniel Nocera. The thrust of
the research is the photo-driven, two-electron oxidation-reduction reaction
between metal centers in binuclear transition metal complexes. The research will
include the synthesis of quadruply-bonded tungsten and molybdenum complexes,
mixed-valence binuclear rhodium complexes, and layered vanadium and niobium
phosphates intercalated with dimolybdenum and dirhodium cores. Photoexcited
intermediates will be characterized by picosecond and nanosecond time-resolved
excited-state spectroscopy with the ultimate objective of understanding the
mechanisms of multi-electron processes. %%% Some of the chemical systems to be
studied in this project are appropriate to energy-converting multi-electron
transformations such as splitting hydrogen chloride into hydrogen and chlorine,
while other systems will be used to prepare novel photoactive layered solids
possessing multi-electron reactivity.
