Eastern Maine Technical College will conduct three five-day training conferences
on Metallurgy for 18 engineering technology faculty from 6 technical colleges
throughout the state of Maine. One conference will be held each year for three
years. Each Conference will include lectures, participation in laboratory
testing procedures, and evaluation, as well as discussions among participants
about the integration of these topics into their classes. The first conference
will focus on iron and steel; the second conference will emphasize aluminum and
stainless, and the third conference will be devoted to titanium and exotic non-
ferous metals. Each conference will result in the development of a laboratory
manual. After each conference a mini-conference will be held to assess the
integration of the conference curricula into the institutional curricula of the
faculty participants.
