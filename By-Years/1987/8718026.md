Recently the PI's have obtained some explicitly solvable stochastic optimal
control problems of diffusion type in noncompact, rank-one symmetric spaces. It
is proposed to generalize these results to noncompact symmetric spaces of rank
greater than one, compact symmetric spaces, and homogeneous spaces. Such
manifolds provide models for many physical phenomena, and relatively few
examples of solvable stochastic control problems are known. It is proposed to
continue work in stochastic adaptive control by investigating the asymptotic
distribution and the rate of convergence of the average costs or the estimators
for continuous-time, linear stochastic systems with and without time delays. It
is proposed to investigate some specific models, and to expand work on the
adaptive control of bilinear stochastic systems. It is proposed to relate
adaptive control to geometric control by investigating some stochastic adaptive
control problems in the aforementioned symmetric spaces. The aggregation of an
autoregressive process is often used in applications, and they propose to
continue some of their previous work. Some estimation problems have been solved
in compact Lie groups and a symmetric space, and it is proposed to expand this
work to other Lie groups and symmetric spaces. From these special estimation
results and the relation between nonlinear filtering and stochastic control, it
is proposed to use the aforementioned estimation and stochastic control results
to solve some nonlinear filtering problems.
