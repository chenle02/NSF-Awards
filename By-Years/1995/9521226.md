Szyld This award will support collaborative research between Daniel Szyld of
Temple University, and Rafael Bru, Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain.
The proposed study will focus on the parallel solution of large systems of
linear algebraic equations. In particular, asynchronous iterative methods and
preconditioned Krylov-type methods, for both singular and nonsingular systems,
will be studied. The primary benefit of the collaboration is the joining of
complementary skills and compatible research views. Professor Bru's work on the
convergence of the product of nonnegative matrices is relevant to Szyld's work
on analyzing the convergence of two-stage iterative methods and on asynchronous
methods, and has already led to joint publications by the collaborators or their
students. The proposed research includes theoretical, algorithmic, and
experimental elements. It will explore convergence properties and implementation
details of parallel block and asynchronous iterative methods. Numerical
experiments will be performed.
