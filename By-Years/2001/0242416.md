This is a two-year project to create a series of supplemental curriculum
packages aimed at aligning recent reform curricula with state standards and
high-stakes exit level state tests. Twenty supplements are planned including
activities, homework, 'tips' sheets and teacher materials. The materials will be
suitable for use with a wide range of textbooks and will be disseminated on the
World Wide Web. A review panel of university faculty with assessment background
will guide the work. Authors will include teachers with experience with students
at risk of failure in exit examinations. The materials will be field tested in
Texas. A professional development program will be prepared. Evaluation will
examine both the materials themselves and their implementation by teachers and
students, and will use classroom ovservation, teacher and student
questionnaires, teacher interviews and analyses of student works.
