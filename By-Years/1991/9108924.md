Existing psychological theories portray the domain of morality as extending
beyond justice considerations to encompass interpersonal responsibilities (i.e.
obligations to be responsive to the needs of family and friends). They generally
assume, however, that universally individuals conceptualize interpersonal
responsibilities as matters of personal choice rather than as socially
sanctionable duties. This research examines cultural influences on the moral
status of interpersonal responsibilities. Three experimental studies will be
conducted assessing American and Hindu Indian adults' and childrens' (second
grade and sixth grade) interpretations of obligations to help needy others. The
research is expected to demonstrate that Americans tend to hold a relatively
voluntaristic "relationship-based" perspective on interpersonal
responsibilities, in which commitments to others are seen as capable of being
voluntarily abandoned, not personally demanding and as dependent, in part, on
whether or not the agent likes the other. In contrast, it will be shown that
Indians tend to hold a less voluntaristic "role-based" perspective, in which
commitments to others are seen as based on unalterable role expectations,
potentially personally demanding and as unrelated to the agent's liking of the
other. The investigation will make a theoretical contribution to social
psychology in its demonstration that conceptions of interpersonal
responsibilities are culturally patterned rather than universal. In identifying
a system of interpersonal morality that has not been previously recognized
within psychology, the project will also serve to expand current knowledge
regarding the scope of the moral domain. Finally, in contrasting the reasoning
of different age groups of children from markedly different cultures, the
research will enhance current understanding of the processes underlying social
cognitive development.
