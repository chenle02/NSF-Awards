The purpose of this project is to improve educational experiences for students
enrolled in physical science, integrated science, and calculus-based
introductory physics. The first objective of this project is to equip an
available room so that students in the physical science laboratory course and
students enrolled in the integrated science sequence can benefit from a modified
version of the research-based lab activities (for example, Tools for Scientific
Thinking) that have been used with great success in the introductory physics
labs. The second major goal of this project is to enable the physics department
to enhance student learning in the calculus-based introductory physics course by
using the "Workshop Physics" format--a technique that Priscilla Laws at
Dickinson College has shown to be educationally effective. Ten audiovisual
computers are provided through this project. Site licenses for software packages
are also provided. Version 1.1 of the "Scientific Reasoning Series," along with
SoftWindows, allow the department to upgrade and update this software, which has
been used on a limited scale with the physical science labs. "Interactive
Physics" (version 2.5) is being used in a pilot program for the physical science
and integrated science classes to determine if this program can be used
effectively with these students.
