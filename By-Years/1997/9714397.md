9714397 Mullen This project represents a collaborative effort between Dr.
Sanders (Individual award, ATM-9712925) and Dr. Mullen. It involves an
investigation of the impact of initial data uncertainty and model error on, and
the usefulness of ensemble forecasting techniques for, medium range (3-5 day)
prediction of explosive cyclogenesis. The principals investigators are employing
fields from a long-term climate simulation with NCAR's Community Climate Model
(CCM2) as well as analyses and operational forecasts of a classic case of
explosive cyclogenesis which was observed during the Experiment on Rapidly
Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA) project. Critical issues to be
explored include the design of initial perturbations, the minimum number of
members for the ensemble and the minimum resolution required for ensemble
forecast purposes. The results of this research could be of enormous practical
benefit to operational weather forecasting.
