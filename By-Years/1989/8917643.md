This award will continue the measurement of trace atmospheric gases that are
considered to be important to the formation of the annual antarctic ozone hole
and also are important for controlling the Earth's radiation balance. Two
techniques will be used. At McMurdo, in conjunction with the New Zealand
Antarctic Research Program, infrared absorption measurements using the sun as an
infrared radiation source will continued during the time of the ozone hole, as
they have for the past few years. A new instrument has been installed at South
Pole that will measure emitted atmospheric infrared radiation in the winter
(polar night) as well as absorbed solar radiation in the summer. This instrument
will be operated every day. In both cases the wave number region to be covered
will be 750-4000 inverse centimeters. The gases that should be detected include
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine nitrate, nitrous
oxide, methane, ozone and the chlorofluorocarbons 11 and 12 (F11 and F12) during
the time of the ozone hole and the total column abundances over South Pole of
nitric acid, ozone, water vapor, F11 and F12 on a continuous basis for the
entire year. The measurements are not only important for achieving a better
understanding of the stratospheric chemistry that causes the ozone depletion but
also for determining how radiatively important trace species (RITS) are
affecting the Earth's climate. This research is jointly supported by the
Atmospheric Chemistry and Polar Aeronomy and Astrophysics programs at NSF and
also by the Upper Atmospheric Research Program at NASA.
