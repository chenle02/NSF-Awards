This RUI grant supports the research of Professor T. Schmidt. He will work on
the Chinburg conjecture about the interplay between analytically defined
invariants in a number field and the algebraic structure of the S-units in
Quaternion extensions of the rationals. This is research in the field of number
theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of
mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However,
within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new
algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
