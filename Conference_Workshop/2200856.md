The international conference "Bundles and Conformal Blocks with a Twist" will
take place June 13-17 2022 at the International Center for Mathematical Sciences
in Edinburgh, Scotland. The aim of this event is to bring together a diverse
group of researchers, from a mixture of fields and in different stages of their
careers, to disseminate recent work, to foster collaborations, and to develop
future connections. It is the first conference on the subject and this grant
provides support for US-based participants. The conference website is at
https://twistedcb.wixsite.com/conferenceicms. The main research foci of the
conference are geometric representation theory, differential and algebraic
geometry, and cohomological/topological field theory. In particular the
conference will focus on three interconnected topics: (a) parahoric torsors and
their moduli spaces, (b) twisted conformal blocks, their properties and
relations with moduli spaces of parahoric torsors, (c) topological and
cohomological field theories and their generalizations which arise from
(twisted) conformal blocks. The conference will follow the usual format with
research talks and an introductory lecture series that the organizers hope will
be a fundamental review article for the subject.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
