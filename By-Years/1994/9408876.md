ABSTRACT CTS-9408876 T. T. Kodas A for phase segregation in reaction-controlled
gas-phase particle production routes will be investigated, in order to improve
the generation of nanophase multicomponent powders. Three new production routes
will be tested: (i) single source precursors, (ii) precursors with matched
reactivities, and (iii) reaction between precursors in gas phase to fix
stoichiometry. The limits on phase purity, phase segregation, and multicomponent
particle size and morphology will be determined. The research approach includes
the characterization of the precusors and reactor, gas-phase chemistry studies,
aerosol dynamics studies correlated to chemistry, and characterization of the
resulted powders. The project is based on an exploratory approach, and may lead
to materials with new properties tailored for special uses. Metal alloys and
mixed metal oxides with properties unavailable by other routes will be produced,
with applications to microelectronics and high-strength coatings.
