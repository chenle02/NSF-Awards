ABSTRACT Kirk Schulz This is an investigation of the variations in reactivity
for desulfurization of several alkyl and cyclic organosulfur compounds on model
molybdenum sulfide catalysts as a function of surface conductivity. Among issues
addressed are selectivity changes as a function of surface conductivity, the
catalytic activity of sulfur vacancies, the correlation of surface conductivity
with catalytic activity of sulfide materials, and the similarities and
differences between sulfided single crystals and single crystals of sulfides.
The issues addressed in this study are important in extending the very
successful empirical technology for desulfurizing crude oil to other systems
such as flue gas and wastewater. This is a Faculty Early Career Development
award. It includes an effort to introduce a "writing-across-the curriculum"
(WAC) program to improve presentation skills of chemical engineering
undergraduates, the development of a tool to assess writing skills, and the
application of this tool to assess the effectiveness of this approach. ***
