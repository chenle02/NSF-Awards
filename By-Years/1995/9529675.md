This research is on developing structured design methods for Micro-Electrical-
Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The focus is on MEMS fabrication process simulation
and mask-layout synthesis. In analogy to present-day VLSI design, tools to
permit rapid, accurate, conservative mask layout synthesis of MEMS are being
explored. The objective for the tools is to enable a MEMS designer to specify a
desire micro-mechanical function (e.g., a mechanical spring with particular
characteristics), and have a system automatically generate the information
(mask- layout, and other fabrication instructions) to create the shape that
exhibits the desired function. This would includes refining and extending the
3-D anisotropic etch simulation methods. Prototype software design tools are
being developed.
