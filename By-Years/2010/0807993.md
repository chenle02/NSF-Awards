The investigators will carry out a detailed exploration of the relationship
between quasar outflows and the properties of the quasars that produce them.
Such outflows are thought to inject energy and momentum into the intergalactic
medium, and to influence galaxy evolution. Narrow absorption lines intrinsic to
the quasar will be used to investigate outflow properties in about 200 quasars
at high redshift (z &gt; 2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
work include training of research students public lectures, and a public
astronomy activity called Astrofest. &lt;br/&gt;
