This proposal provides support for the 2013 Workshop on the Economics of
Information Security (WEIS) and a one-day follow-on workshop. WEIS fosters
cross-disciplinary, cross-sector (i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and
government), and cross-national discussion on information security. The focus on
the economics of information security was chosen not only because of its
intrinsic importance, but also because of its basis for bringing together
social, computer, and information scientists and engineers to share knowledge,
information and methods from their respective domains. WEIS covers issues that
are core to the NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and
spans both the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and
Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the
Foundation. The one-day follow-on workshop focuses on incentive-related issues
to cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds for this grant are from NSF for
student travel support, and via inter-agency transfer from DHS Science &amp;
Technology for sponsorship of the follow-on workshop.
