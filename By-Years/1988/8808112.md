This Research Oppportunities for Women Career Advancement Award will support
Professor Ruskai's work in mathematical physics. Her specific interests concern
the analysis of Schroedinger operators for many-particle systems with a non-
trivial interaction, such as the Coulomb potential. She will investigate
asymptotic cluster properties of such systems, binding limits for nuclei with
finite mass, and the dependence of the number of bound states on certain
physical parameters.
