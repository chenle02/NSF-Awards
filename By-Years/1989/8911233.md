The effects of disorder on the transport properties of a non- degenerate two
dimensional electron gas will be studied. The primary emphasis of the research
will be to characterize the strong disorder limit (i.e., strong localization
regime) as one goes from low carrier densities to high carrier densities, where
the electron gas in known to solidify into a Wigner crystal. The ability to
control the electron density over several orders of magnitude gives one the
unique opportunity to "turn on" interaction effects at a given level of
disorder. The work will represent an important contribution to the field of
localization by probing regions of parameter space that are generally
inaccessible to the much more widely studied semiconducting and metallic
systems. The effects of disorder on the superfluid density in thin films of
helium deposited on hydrogen will also be studied. The work will provide the
first measurements of the onset of superfluidity on well characterized (i.e.,
from electron conductivity measurements) and purposely disordered surfaces.
