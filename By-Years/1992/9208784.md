Distribution of data of a parallel computation such that data are accessed free
of memory bank and interconnection network conflicts, is a critical issue for
efficient use of shared and distributed memory computers. Conflicts in memory
banks and interconnection networks increase inter-processor communication
delays, which in turn adversely affect the execution times of parallel
computations and cost-performance ratio of parallel computers. This research
investigates hardware and software solutions, which can be applied in the design
of parallel architectures for consistent high performance for a variety of
parallel computations and efficient execution of tasks in a transparent manner,
even in the presence of faults. In the first part of the research, recent work
on hardware techniques, called skewed storage schemes applicable at the time of
task execution, will be expanded upon. The new techniques will be useful to
design and use efficiently fault-tolerant and gracefully degrading memories,
multidimensional memories, and memory hierarchies for large data accesses in
parallel computations. Suitability of the techniques will be investigated with
theoretical analysis, experiments on current parallel computers, and
simulations. In the second part of the research, software techniques, applicable
at compile-time, will be investigated to utilize and assist hardware techniques
for partitioning and allocation of data, including heavily accessed and hotspot
type data. Effectiveness of these results will be evaluated experimentally.
