This project is building fundamentally new types of cameras that combine novel
optics and algorithm design to overcome the diffraction limit for macroscopic
scenes, achieving unprecedented levels of precision in image, depth, and
material acquisition. This project improves computer vision tasks performed on
images of distant objects, increasing precision for applications such as
surveillance, remote sensing, robot navigation, and autonomous vehicles. In
addition, the work has direct applications in ongoing art conservation efforts
to non-destructively acquire microscopic surface details of paintings and
drawings. The research program is also tightly integrated with a comprehensive
education program incorporating imaging and photography. The research team is
developing curriculum for Chicago afterschool programs to introduce at-risk
youth to basic concepts in optics, electronics, electrodynamics, and image
processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is to increase the
level of detail that can be recovered when imaging macroscopic objects at large
distances. The research is based on a wave-model of light with computational
photography. This new theory of coherent light transport incorporates even the
most complex effects of visual appearance such as participating media, sub-
surface-scattering, multiple-bounce inter-reflections, diffraction, and
interference. The research team is developing theory, hardware, and algorithms
that lead to fundamental improvements in image, shape, and material acquisition
for computer vision applications. The project is developing fundamentally new
types of cameras for computer vision that rely on a synergistic combination of
coherent optics (both active and passive) and novel algorithm design to overcome
the diffraction limit. This project is constructing computational cameras that
can resolve scene details well below the diffraction limit.
