The recent significant progresses of information-sensing techniques, wireless
communications, and embedded systems have greatly accelerated the generation of
sensory data, which provides a nourishing fertile ground for the development of
deep learning and machine learning in data-hungry applications. Nevertheless,
the inherent limitations of traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
including limited lifetime, difficult battery replacement, and centralized
network architecture, become an unavoidable obstacle to the wide deployment and
adoption of sensory data. Moreover, due to the big volume and high complexity of
sensory data, processing sensory data in a centralized manner would increase the
consumption of network resources and the risk of privacy leakage. To tackle the
aforementioned limitations as well as to satisfy the needs of managing massive
sensory data in real applications, developing power-optimized, sustainably-
reliable, and efficiently-distributed solutions has become an essential
task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the energy characteristics of
battery-free WSNs, capacities of edge-assisted sinks, and advantages of
distributed multi-task learning, which will result in the following technical
innovations. (1) The seamless integration of battery-free sensors, edge/cloud
computing and machine learning can break through technique imprisonments in
traditional WSNs, in which new problems are defined and new methodologies are
developed. (2) The energy correlation of battery-free sensors in the temporal
and spatial domains is exploited to predict sensorâ€™s dynamic sensing ability for
scheduling sensing activities, in which the schemes of time-energy-correlated
sensing, time-space cooperative data acquisition and energy-accompanied data
acquisition will be developed. (3) The interference of battery-free sensors in
the temporal, spatial and energy domains is utilized to construct multi-
dimensional conflict graphs for interference-free transmission scheduling, in
which the algorithms of associating battery-free sensors with edge-assisted
sinks and scheduling data collection from sensors to sinks will be designed. (4)
The diverse capacities of computation and communication on edge-assisted sinks
are employed to schedule learning process so that multiple related tasks can be
simultaneously completed in a distributed fashion. (5) The validation is well
planned, where an analog simulator and a prototype system will be built to
perform the designed simulations and real-data experiments,
respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
