The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and bring to market tools that
improve code quality and help avoid dangerous bugs, while also improving
programmer productivity. Poor code quality leads to bugs which often translate
into financial loses and can even endanger human life. A study by NIST estimated
software bugs cost $59 billion annually. The key aspect of this project is a
programmer-friendly language for describing software fixes. Successful adoption
of the language by the programmer community can have a far-reaching positive
impact upon the software community: programmers will have a common, formal,
language to discuss ways to fix bugs, and the result of their collaboration
could be used to automatically fix software systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
research and technical challenges in providing programmers with a language to
express their knowledge of error patterns and their fixes, and a tool that uses
this information to check and fix software systems. The research objective is to
refine the language such that it is easy to use by programmers, and to provide a
scalable infrastructure. This will be achieved by iteratively improving both the
language and the supporting infrastructure with feedback from early users. The
anticipated result is that the technology will be applicable to a wide variety
of bugs and to large code bases.
