Dr. Omar M. Yaghi has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Yaghi's doctoral degree was from the University of Illinois under
the supervision of Professor Walter G. Klemperer. Dr. Yaghi intends to continue
research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Profesor Richard Holm.
Dr. Yaghi's area of postdoctoral research and training will be structure and
reactivity of metal sulfide clusters. Longer term, he plans to extend his
studies to metal sulfur, chalcogenide, oxide and nitride superclusters and
organic/inorganic composites. The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program
is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the
knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers
in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
