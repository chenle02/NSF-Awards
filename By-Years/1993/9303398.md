This proposal is for a grant to partially support block travel for a number of
US scientist in the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural
Networks to Power Systems (ANNPS"93"). The forum will be held in Yokohama, Japan
during the period from April 19 to 22, l993. This Forum, which was initiated by
NSF, is the most comprehensive conference solely devoted to the development of
neural network technology as applied to complex power system problems. The forum
is widely attended by scientists, engineers, consultants, manufacturing
representative and academicians from around the world. The ANNPS"93 is being
organized in Yokohama, Japan, and sponsored by Weseda University, Meiji
University, Tokyo Electric Power, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi and others.
Several international and local scientific societies are cooperating in the
Forum arrangements such as the IEEE Neural Networks Council, IEE of Japan,
Institute of Electronics, Information &amp; Communication Engineers of Japan,
Japanese Neural Network Society. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is
also supporting some US scientists to attend the ANNPS93.
