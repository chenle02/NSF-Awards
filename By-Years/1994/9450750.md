9450750 Dubinsky This project is engaging in assessment, evaluation and research
into how students learn mathematical concepts to determine effects of the
calculus reform curriculum and dissemination activities from the previously
supported Calculus project at Purdue. Assessment activities will be closely
related to research into how students learn mathematical concepts and will also
include studies of the effect of the role of the teacher when changed from
instructor to facilitator and the use of group learning. Current dissemination
approach will include the preparation of an Instructor's Resource Manual,
workshops and the continued growth and development of a network of implementers.
A model will also be developed for evaluation of student attitudes, performance,
and conceptual understanding in comparison with students who took calculus in
standard models.
