0119452&lt;br/&gt;Fujimoto&lt;br/&gt;The development and application of
biomedical imaging technologies such as multiphoton confocal microscopy and
optical coherence tomography are critically dependent on the availability of
ultrashort pulse laser light sources. The lack of compact and low cost
ultrashort pulse light sources is a critical factor which limits wider spread
research and clinical applications of many of these imaging technologies. The
objective will be to develop a third generation ultrashort pulse laser
technology which achieves shorter pulse durations, broader bandwidths and
broader tunability, as well as being one order of magnitude lower in cost than
current technology. The design principles that are developed will be applicable
to a wide range of different solid state laser materials. This proposed project
is a continuation of an ongoing collaboration between Profs. Fujimoto and
Kaertner at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor Franz Kaertner
is currently at the University of Karlsruhe, but will be joining the faculty in
the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Summer of 2001. &lt;br/&gt;
