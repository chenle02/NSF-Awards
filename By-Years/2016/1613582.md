The team will use their array of telephoto lenses, Dragonfly, to observe the dim
starlight from galaxies. Such dim optical signals have never been observed
before. The innovative array is located in New Mexico and operated from
Connecticut or Ontario, Canada. The observations will be used to test models and
simulations of the dim starlight. The team will continue to develop industrial
links with Canon, a lens manufacturer. Undergraduates and graduate students will
gain hands-on experience with instrumentation, software and
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will use their purpose-built array
to observe the low-surface-brightness stellar emission from galaxies. Their
goals are to study (1) the outskirts of nearby galaxies, (2) the faint dwarf
galaxies around luminous spiral galaxies, and (3) the ultra diffuse galaxies in
the Coma Cluster and Virgo Cluster.
