Professor Osheroff will determine properties of the nuclear antiferromagnetism
in solid 3He to provide increased understanding of cooperative magnetic
phenomena. The sub-milliKelvin solid growth techniques which the PI pioneered
will be used in measurements of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), heat flow,
and sound propagation phenomena. The strong temperature dependence of the
antiferromagnetic resonance will be used to measure the entire thermal
distribution across a heat carrying single crystal. Thermal diffusivities will
be determined as well as various magnon scattering probabilities. From sound
studies the solid elastic constants of the ordered phases and the tensor
components of the magnetic Gruneisen constant will be measured. Lattice
distortions will be obtained from the NMR studies.
