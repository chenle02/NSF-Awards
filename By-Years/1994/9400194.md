9400194 TEDROW This award provides funds to continue an REU Site at the
Demographic Research Laboratory at Western Washington University. Ten
undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in "Applied Demographic
Research on Migration" for two months in the Summer, 1994. These students,
supervised by a project team of professional demographers, will focus their
research efforts on the study of migration profiles and analytical models. A
variety of data files, including the Public Use Microdata Sample, the 1990 STF's
and the Cumulative General Social Survey, will serve as primary data sources for
the students. The program will include an ethics component featuring a two-day
workhop with outstanding ethicists focussing on ethical issues in demography and
in student research projects. This award contributes to the Foundation's
continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
active undergraduate research experiences. ***
