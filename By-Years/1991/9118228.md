Both natural climate and ecosystems may respond abruptly to gradual forcings.
During the late glacial time window between 14,000 and 10,000 years BP, large
magnitude changes occurred within decades. This project will examine the records
from integrated close-interval samples of two different climate proxies with
different response rates in the climatically sensitive Midwest region south of
the Great Lakes. We will use stable isotopes present in lake sediment carbonates
as a proxy measure of almost instantaneous response to changes in regional
precipitation patterns. We will use pollen deposition as a proxy for regional
vegetation (and indirectly climate), giving a record with a time lag. The area
including Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois will be examined. These sites
will allow direct comparison of response rate of different systems during the
two warming events in the late glacial around 13,000 BP, and in the Younger
Dryas Chron around 10,200 BP.
