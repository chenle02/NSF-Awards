Surface spectroscopy is an important area of active research as it probes
reactions and dynamics specific to interfaces. In the proposed research, both
picosecond time and frequency resolved coherent Raman spectroscopy experiments
will be conducted on molecularly engineered Langmuir-Blodgett films in a guided
wave configuration to probe interaction and dynamics at an interface. The guided
wave configuration provides a longer interaction length so that monolayer
sensitivity can be achieved.
