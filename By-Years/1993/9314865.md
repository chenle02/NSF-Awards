9314865 Borden The focus of this research is the investigation of the physical
and chemical properties of pyramidalized alkenes. Gas-phase measurements on the
radical anions of the most highly pyramidalized alkenes will provide values for
singlet-triplet energy spearations and heats of hydrogenation. Separate
computational studies will be conducted on strained olefins, carbenes, potential
surfaces for organic reactions, fluorine substituent effects, radicals,
diradicals, effects of substituents and heteroatom substitution on open-shell
molecules, and determining which computational methodologies are most
appropriate for performing calculations on different types of open-shell
systems. With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Weston T. Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Washington. Professor Borden will focus his work on the
experimental and computational studies of highly strained carbon-containing
molecules. His work provides an insight into the limits of bonding possible for
carbon. ***
