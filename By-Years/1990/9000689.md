The goal of this project is to provide a quality research experience to
undergraduate students selected from institutions around Lincoln, Nebraska where
research opportunities are limited. A total of 10 students will be selected to
participate in this research during the summer of 1990. The primary areas of
research for student participants will be in databases, expert systems,
algorithms and VLSI design, all of which are areas of faculty strength. Students
will participate in lectures, research colloquia, relevant literature search,
project selection, technical report writing and oral presentation.
