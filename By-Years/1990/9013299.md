This proposal is to complete the analysis of data taken from the Santa Monica
and Santa Cruz basins off California. Since 1985, deliberate tracers have been
placed in the basins to measure directly the vertical diffusion coefficients.
These measurements have been supplemented by measurements of internal waves,
microstructure, and other ambient processes. The analysis should lead to
estimates of mixing rates which are essential for numerical models of ocean
processes.
