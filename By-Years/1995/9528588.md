This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program
provides continued support to research by Dr. Thomas P. Onak of the Chemistry
Department, California State University at Los Angeles, concerning the chemistry
of cage compounds of carbon and boron, called carboranes. The reactions that
will be investigated are: (a) selective, progressive, cage opening with
nucleophiles such as fluoride ion, amines, phosphine, and hydride ion; (b) the
syntheses of new carboranes; (c) the syntheses of new substituted carboranes
that exhibit different modes of bonding and structure; (d) the influence of a
variety of attached groups on the mechanism of rearrangement of substituted
carboranes; (e) equilibration studies involving isomeric substituted carboranes
to assess cage stabilizing and destabilizing influences of various substituents;
(f) a study of net front-side cage displacement reactions; (g) the examination
and delineation of products from the reaction of diborane with nido carborane
anions; (h) the applicaton of MP-NMR computational methods, including IGLO,
GIAO, and FPT, for the comparison of predicted NMR structural assignments to
experimental data. Carboranes form large molecular structures with unusual
bonding and structural characteristics. Insight about the behavior of such
clusters is potentially applicable to other large molecular structures,
including those found in electronic materials. Attention will be paid to
developing a theoretical framework for interpreting the experimental results.
The work will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students
