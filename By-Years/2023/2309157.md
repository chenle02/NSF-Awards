Recent and near-future quantum technologies will push the boundaries of
information processing, with applications in communication, computation, and
measurement. This project studies underlying problems in theoretical physics and
mathematics that make “quantum advantage” possible. In addition to achieving
scientific progress through new results, a major project component is scientific
development of undergraduate students through participation in real research.

This project will implement a resource theory framework to study classes of
invertible free operations including local unitary transformations, permutations
of subsystems, and matchgates (two-qubit operators arising from fermionic
physics) to probe multiparticle quantum entanglement and classical
simulatability, and to develop applications for quantum protocols. Methodology
will utilize representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, together with
the PI’s past results. Achievements will contribute theoretical results and
applications in mainstream Quantum Information Science.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
