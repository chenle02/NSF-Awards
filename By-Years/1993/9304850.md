9304850 Hendrickx Unstable wetting fronts are the least understood physical
phenomenon in soils. They start out as horizontal wetting fronts that under
certain conditions break into "fingers" or "preferential flow paths" as the
front moves downward, much like rain running off a sheet of glass breaking into
streams. These fingers facilitate the transport of contaminants to the
groundwater at velocities many times those calculated if a stable horizontal
front is assumed. The investigators describe theoretical, experimental, and
field evidence that confirm the occurrence of unstable wetting fronts in field
soils. The research objectives are: (1) Verify the hydrodynamic stability by
applying Richard's flow equation for a wide range of field soils with lysimeter
and field experiments; (2) Apply theory to derive the relations between soil
physical characteristics, initial water content, infiltration flux, and the
occurrence of unstable wetting fronts; (3) expand the theory and experiments to
include heterogeneous soils and boundary conditions. The main experimental
difficulty of this study is the labor intensive nature of the lysimeter and
field work. The researchers propose to fill large lysimeters (volume 1.2 m3,
diameter 1.0 m) with different soil types to study fingers with large diameters
that have not been studied before. They will take about 500 volumetric water
content samples at each sites for a precise description of the wetting patterns
in field soils. Better understanding of the mechanism of unstable wetting fronts
will lead to better risk assessments for groundwater contamination, allow
construction of more effective landfills and storage ponds, and help in the
design of more efficient groundwater recharge systems. ***
