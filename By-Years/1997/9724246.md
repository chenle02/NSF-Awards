*** 9724246 Strait This award is for the purchase of core instrumentation to
enhance the quality and scope of research training in the new Williams College
Laser Facility. The shared equipment will be used by those faculty and advanced
undergraduates in the physics and chemistry departments who use lasers and
optical techniques in research. The research impacted covers a broad spectrum of
atomic, molecular, optical, and chemical physics subfields, including modelocked
laser dynamics, precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy, and molecular
energy transfer. This action is partly supported by the NSF Major Research
Instrumentation Program and partly by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
Activities. ***
