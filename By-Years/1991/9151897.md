Students are using a laboratory equipped with microcomputers running computer
algebra systems to focus on mathematical concepts rather than manipulation of
formulas. Derive is used in college algebra, trigonometry, and first year
calculus and Mathematica is used in multivariable calculus and differential
equations.
