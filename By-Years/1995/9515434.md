9515434 Skvoretz The proposed research is a cooperative effort between
researchers at the University of Carolina (John Skvoretz and David Willer) and
the University of Iowa (Michael Lovaglia and Barry Markovsky). This work extends
a program of theory-based investigations on power and social exchange processes.
Network Exchange Theory (NET) is one of several theories that attempt to explain
the development of power in networks of exchange relations. While previous
research has demonstrated that NET predictions are more accurate than its
competitors, a problem recently surfaced in a fundamental part of the theory
that classifies networks as strong or weak power, the Graph-theoretical Power
Index (GPI). In solving this problem, two independent methods of predicting
power relations in exchange networks were developed by the investigators. This
set the stage for a dramatic improvement in the sped and quality of exchange
research. By developing integrated computer programs, the investigators proposed
to automate the systematic construction, comparison and classification of
exchange networks. Networks for which the two methods disagree can be culled
from further analysis from thousands of potential test networks. This will then
enable the PIs to make exact predictions for resource distribution in these
networks and compare them to computer simulations. The entire process of
discovering problematic test networks and preparing them for experimental test
can be accomplished in a matter of hours, whereas previously, suitable test
networks were discovered largely by chance and the process could take years.
Then the PIs propose to improve experimental methods and statistical techniques
to investigate a number of networks that were crucial in the solution to the
classification problem. These advances will bring us a step closer to modeling
exchange processes in complex networks commonly found in society. ***
