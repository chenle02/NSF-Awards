Acquisition of a wide bore 9.4 Tesla magnet for the assembly of a solid state
NMR spectrometer is proposed. This research is directed toward the structural
and dynamic characterization of protein complexes (collagen), protein lipid
complexes (Gramicidin A in a lipid bilayer) and DNA liquid crystalline phases.
Further use of the instrument will be made by individuals in a wide range of
disciplines as time permits. Solid state NMR is beginning to play a major role
in biophysics, especially in the realm of dynamics. The other approaches to
dynamic characterizations do not yield the same sort of detail that is possible
with solid state NMR. It is possible from specific site labeled biomolecules to
determine a model for molecular motions with atomic resolution. This model
includes a description of the axis about which the motion is occurring, the type
of motion, whether it be diffusional or discontinuous, the amplitude of the
motion and finally the frequency of the motion. With such characterizations of
the dynamics the potential for obtaining correlations between dynamics and
function is very high. Many of the specific experiments described herein would
not be possible on the present relatively low field (4.7 Tesla) solid state NMR
instrumentation in the FSU facility, not only because of the low field but also
because of the severely limited time available on it. A detailed justification
for a high field (9.4 Tesla) instrument is given, based on improved sensitivity
(Boltzman distribution), improved resolution (by minimizing field dependent 14 N
line broadening effects on the 13 C spectra), observation of low gyromagnetic
ratio nuclei, reduced acoustic ringing (for 2 H spectra), and observation of
quadrupolar nuclei with nonintegral spin.
