Shepherd College, founded in 1871, is part of the West Virginia State College
System, that serves approximately 3500 students. The institution is moving
vigorously toward improving the academic performance of its students, and
increasing the number of graduates who enter graduate and professional schools.
In commitment to this effort, and in response to changes in research and in the
science and mathematics curriculum, Shepherd College has begun a major multi-
phase renovation project of Synder Hall, the science building, and construction
of a new science addition. Research space in Synder Hall, assigned to biology
and chemistry, will be relocated to the new wing. NSF funds, however, will be
used to partially support the consolidation and renovation of research and
research training spaces dedicated for archeology, geology, environmental
science, mathematics, computer sciences and engineering. Laboratories currently
used for faculty investigations and student research projects are located in
insufficient areas void of adequate ventilation, and compliance to safety
requirements. Due to the multi-use of laboratory space, research activity is
limited for practical and safety reasons. In order for students to remain
competitive, Shepherd College must provide an environment commensurate with the
protocols of contemporary research required. By renovating Synder Hall, students
and faculty will have new opportunities to meet their research and research
training needs and the needs of the modern technology based industries in the
Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
