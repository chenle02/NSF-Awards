The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports the
efforts of Kirk S. Schanze of the University of Florida, James M. Boncella of
Los Alamos National Laboratory and Janet R. Morrow of the State University of
New York at Buffalo to organize and conduct a NSF Inorganic Chemistry Workshop.
This Workshop is designed to promote a discussion of current research findings,
challenges, and new opportunities in inorganic chemistry and related sub-
disciplines. The rapid pace at which the field is advancing as well as the
increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the research problems necessitates the
workshop format. The Workshop has special importance to younger faculty as they
will be given opportunities to test their ideas on their more senior colleagues,
to find collaborators, and to interact extensively with scientists from
industry, government labs, and federal funding agencies.
