With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. DiMare of the University of
California, Santa Barbara, will elaborate the reaction dynamics and parameters
for the enantioselective-titanium catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction. If successful,
the results of the investigation will provide future investigators with a
rational basis for catalyst design and improvement. This proposal is in an area
which is both fundamental and significant for chiral chemistry objectives. The
ability to catalyze a chemical reaction is important since it reduces raw
material usage and waste products. To catalyze an enantioselective process is
more significant because the appropriate three-dimensional molecule can be
generated. This is useful for academic knowledge as well as for industry and the
fields of medicine and pharmaceuticals chemistry.
