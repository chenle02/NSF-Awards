This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ohio State University, in
partnership with Columbus State Community College, STEMColumbus, and the Ohio
STEM Learning Network, will develop a Geoscience Awareness Program (GAP)
targeted at underrepresented minority students at five academic levels - middle
school, high school, community college, and university freshmen with undeclared
majors, and university seniors. These last two academic levels will include only
students enrolled at The Ohio State University. The program will include
development of a package of lectures, presentations, brochures, and educational
material about geosciences. These materials will be used to develop
underrepresented minority students' interest in majoring in geosciences. The
educational materials developed will also be used for targeted recruitment of
underrepresented minority undergraduate students with science backgrounds to
Ohio State's graduate program in geological sciences. The GAP program will
include materials to communicate to students the job opportunities that a career
in geosciences could offer. Ultimately, GAP's model can be replicated at other
institutions and communities to promote geological sciences as an educational
option in the STEM fields to many pre-college students, undergraduates at
community colleges, undecided college students, and college senior students,
whatever the students' ethnicity or background. The eventual outcome of this
project will be to increase the number of minority students majoring in the
geological sciences and thereby increase the numbers of trained professionals in
this nationally important area of STEM education.
