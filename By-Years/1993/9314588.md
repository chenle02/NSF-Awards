ABSTRACT: 9314588, PI-Satterlie: This action is to provide travel costs for
scientists to attend a special symposium at the Annual Meeting of The American
Society of Zoologists on December 27 30, 1993. The symposium will consider
invertebrate neuromuscular systems, and especially how variability in their
cellular and developmental organization is reflected in behavior. This is an
important topic that is important to both general and comparative neurobiology.
The symposium will be important for synthesizing new data and suggesting new
insights into how the brain controls movement. The lectures will be published in
a special issue of the journal "American Zoologist". All of the scientists
receiving support are American scientists, who will be speaking at the symposium
and contributing papers to the final publication.
