State-ordered diversionary programs, such as treatment, reentry, and
rehabilitation programs, provide alternatives to incarceration for defendants,
probationers, and parolees. To take part in and complete these programs, various
outlays and expenditures can be required. This project will examine the social,
economic, and legal consequences of these costs on compliance with court-ordered
treatment, rehabilitation, and reentry programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will document the underlying structural mechanisms involved in
participating in and completing state-ordered diversionary programs. Access to
resources, including money, information, flexible work schedules, reliable
transportation, and time, is necessary to avoid noncompliance with these
programs. The research will include a randomized control trial (RCT) that will
causally investigate whether and how investments in rehabilitation programming,
as well as the alleviation of particular forms of disadvantage, can increase
program participation and completion rates. The project will use full sample
comparisons between treatment and control groups to estimate the effects of
economic, socioeconomic, and informational variables on rates of program
enrollment, dropout, re-enrollment, and completion. Findings from the RCT will
be included as inputs to an agent-based simulation model that will evaluate
influences on compliance with rehabilitation and reentry programs at the
population level. The result will be an assessment of the causal relationships
involved in compliance rates as the project tabulates shadow costs and measures
willful noncompliance with court-ordered diversionary
programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Law and Science
Program and the SBE Science of Broadening Participation
Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
