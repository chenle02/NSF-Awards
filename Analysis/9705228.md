Abstract 9705228 Rosenblatt This proposal is for research in a number of new
directions in harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. The main principle at work
here is that there are fundamental connections between classes of operators
arising in harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, and probability theory. For
example, there is a very strong connection between the behavior of martingales
and the averages in ergodic theory. This is clear where maximal functions are
concerned, but it also is an important principle in regards to upcrossings of
both processes. Using estimates on the degree to which ergodic averages are a
perturbation of suitable martingales, precise estimates on oscillation of
ergodic sums can be analyzed. There has been a good deal of success in this
direction in the work of Jones, Kaufman, Rosenblatt, and Wierdl, but additional
studies of these properties are much needed . In particular, it is proposed here
to show that the best possible jump and upcrossing inequalities in ergodic
theory are the ones that can be obtained by relating the ergodic averages to
martingales. In this same spirit, the variational behavior of ergodic averages
is linked closely to the behavior of martingales. In recent work in ergodic
theory, the importance of square functions for measuring the oscillation of
general averages of ergodic transformations has become very clear. This work has
also led to obtaining estimates on the square function of the difference between
ergodic sums and martingales. Such analysis is yet in progress.However, the
analysis of square functions of moving averages and of related operator
sequences is not yet at all complete. Also, other aspects of differences in
ergodic theory, like unconditionality, and how they mimic the behavior of
martingale difference sequences, is well worth more investigation. This grant is
to fund the study of the long term behavior of dynamical systems and stochastic
processes. Many important physical phenomena, as varied as the beha vior of the
stock market, lines in the supermarket, and data being received from a distant
transmission source, exhibit locally erratic behavior which can be understood
better by looking at the long term average behavior instead. The study of such
stochastic processes and their connections with one another, as well as their
connections in terms of their fine structure with other less random processes,
is a central one in modern mathematics. It is only through such studies that we
will be able to understand better and thus be able to control or predict the
evolution of the physical phenomena which this mathematics can model.
