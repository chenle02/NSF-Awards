This research examines the ways in which families change in response to large
scale social changes. The investigator will draw on data from U.S. census
schedules between 1850 and 1900 to chart the consequences, for families, of the
transformation of the Los Angeles, California environment from a small,
isolated, domestic economy in 1850 to a major urban center in 1900. By examining
relationships between gender, generation, and class position, on the one hand,
and household composition, education, and employment, on the other, the
investigator can test a theoretical model of how families meet their
responsibilities under conditions of major economic upheaval. The census data
for Los Angeles in the late 19th century provide a strategic entry point in
which to link family change with large-scale social change. This study will test
existing assumptions about family strategies, that is, the choices families make
as to which family members should work as well as decisions about who should go
to school, marry, have children. This research is important because it
investigates the manner in which the larger economy affects the range of
alternatives from which families and individuals make their choices. By viewing
family decisions as a consequence of the interplay between social structure and
individual choice, this research can contribute to our understanding of family
life and how it has been transformed in the United States.
