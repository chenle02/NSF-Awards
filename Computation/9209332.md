In this project, the investigator will study nonconforming multigrid methods.
Robust multigrid algorithms for various finite element methods in elasticity
will be developed, the performance of which will not deteriorate as the material
becomes nearly incompressible. A nonconforming multigrid method for a fluid flow
free-boundary problem will also be studied. Numerical experiments will be
performed for these problems. In addition, some theoretical topics (conforming
and nonconforming) such as pointwise convergence of multigrid methods, and
multigrid methods that can overcome the pollution effects of singular solutions,
will also be investigated. The results of this research will lead to efficient
algorithms for the solution of large-scale computational problems in fluid
mechanics and elasticity. They will find many applications in various fields of
engineering and physics.
