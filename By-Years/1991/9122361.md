The field of research supported by this award is that of stellar populations in
globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. Dr. Roger Bell and Dr. Michael
Tripicco at the University of Maryland will continue to work on the generation
of integrated spectra of globular clusters and galaxies. The method used is
unique in that Drs. Bell and Tripicco build the integrated spectra from
synthetic stellar spectra, theoretical isochrones, and mass functions, and they
are guided by observed cluster color-magnitude diagrams and luminosity
functions. In test cases, the agreement between the model and observation is
extremely encouraging, but improvements are planned.
