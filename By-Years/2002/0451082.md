ABSTRACT

PI: Michael A. Henson Institution: University of Massachusetts/Amherst Proposal
Number: 0451082

Intellectual Merit:

The Chemical Process Control (CPC) conference series is aimed at reviewing and
assessing the current state of process control technology. Consistent with this
goal, the conference has been held every five years since 1976. All oral
presentations are by invitation only to ensure that the conference themes are
covered in a consistent fashion by internationally renowned researchers. The CPC
VII conference will take place January 8-13, 2006 in Lake Louise, Alberta,
Canada. This grant is to defray travel and conference expenses of the invited
academic speakers.

The goal of CPC VII is to provide an open form for discussing the current state
and future needs of process control research and education. Since the initial
conference, the term "process control" has been interpreted in an increasingly
broad sense. In addition to sessions on traditional chemical process control
topics, CPC VII will address emerging applications areas including microchemical
and fuel cell systems, multiscale systems, information and enterprise systems
and systems biology. The theme of the meeting is "Assessment of Core
Technologies and Emerging Applications."

Broader Impact:

Better process control should lead to more efficient operation of chemical,
petrochemical, pharmaceutical, etc. manufacturing facilities, which should
benefit the US economy. The interaction of academics, industrial practitioners
and government officials should advance process control research and education.
