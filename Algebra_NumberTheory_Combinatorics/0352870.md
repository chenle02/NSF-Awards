This award provides support for the participation of ten US graduate students in
a school at the Newton institute in Cambridge, England on "Random Matrix Theory
and Number Theory." This school will be part of the program on "Random Matrix
Theory approaches in Number Theory" which will run at the Newton institute from
January through July 2004. Many of the worlds leading experts in this field will
give lectures at the school which will provide the students participating access
to a current and very active research topics at the boundary of Number Theory
and Physics.
