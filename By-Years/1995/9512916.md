9512916 Schilling This U.S.-Brazil collaborative research project will carry out
synchrotron radiation research using VUV spectroscopy and EXAFS, including
establishment and characterization of a soft x-ray spectroscopy workstation and
the conducting of experiments in small-angle x-ray scattering. The project will
take advantage of newly created laboratory facilities installed at Louisiana
State's Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) and Brazil's
Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sincrotron (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil. The project
will be headed by Paul Schilling, Volker Saile, and Paul Russo at LSU and by
Aldo Craievich at LNLS. The facilities at the two sites were each built with
attention to compatibility with those at the other, including a toroidal grating
monochromator beamline at LNLS and a joint LNLS/CAMD beamline at CAMD using a
double crystal monochromator. Besides carrying out their own experiments, the
PI's will train students and younger scientists in the use of the equipment.
