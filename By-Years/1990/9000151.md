This project will test several hypotheses regarding the control of oceanic
primary productivity (primarily phytoplankton productivity) by varying the
amounts of dissolved trace metals needed for growth (Fe, Mn and Zn) and also
those which may be toxic and are often also present (Cu and Co). In nature the
extent to which these metals are complexed by naturally occurring organic
compounds may control their availability to the phytoplankton. This research
will investigate several areas of the ocean which are underutilizing the
dissolved nutrients nitrate and phosphate, perhaps because of lack of needed
trace metals or excess of toxic trace metals. The experiments to be done will
involve: 1) determining the concentrations of dissolved trace metals versus
depth at several stations, and 2) at each station varying the amounts and
availabilities of the trace metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Co in living phytoplankton
cultures. The results of the second set of experiments will be compared with
phytoplankton growth experiments wherein no additional metals have been added in
order to quantify the magnitude of varying availabilities of the trace metals.
