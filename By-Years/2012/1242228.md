A workshop on "The Topology of Algebraic Varieties" will be held in Montreal
from September 24 to 28, 2012 preceded by three related mini-courses from
September 21 to 23, 2012. Additional information can be found at the following
website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2012/Topology12/index_e.php This is a
workshop on connections between simple topological invariants of a normal
algebraic variety, and other natural invariants, especially those coming from
birational and affine algebraic geometry. Major themes will include the simple
connectedness of rationally connected varieties, the related development of the
Shafarevich map via cycle space theory, and the resolution of the Shafarevich
conjecture on the universal cover of a smooth variety (with linear fundamental
group) via Hodge theory in various guises. Among other central subjects there
will be recent advances in the theory of plumbing for surface singularities that
bridged many classical problems on algebraic varieties with knots and the theory
of 3-manifolds, and the key role of the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality on
(orbifold) Chern numbers of singular varieties in several new break-through
results in affine algebraic geometry.

The conference will bring together experts in algebraic/analytic geometry as
well as relevant topologists working in low dimensional complex singularity
theory for fruitful exchange of information and interaction on an international
scale. It will introduce modern topological and analytical tools used in this
area to a new generation of researchers.
