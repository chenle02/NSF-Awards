The University of Tulsa will initiate a two-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in Engineering for 35 students entering grades 9,10 in the eastern
Oklahoma regional area. This program is designed to introduce students to
engineering as a career option, and is geared toward identifying students of
high potential who have had limited prior exposure to engineering or science as
a career. The summer program consists of a series of hands-on engineering
experiments, an engineering research project, computer workshops to introduce
the students to the uses of computers in engineering, field trips to area
industries to see and talk to engineers at work, and workshops on engineering
ethics. Several follow-up sessions occur during the academic year, during which
students spend a Saturday on the UT campus in workshops on engineering problems.
