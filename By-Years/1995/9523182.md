9523182 Wu This research uill focus on the development of ultrahigh sensitivity
chemical analysis of the surface and near-surface regions of solid materials. It
will determine the feasibility of developing innovative mass spectrometry
techniques based on laser ablation and subsequent nonresonant laser
photoionization processes above the surface, coupled with high performance time-
of-flight mass spectrometry. Two primary goals of this research are spatial
resolution chemical imaging and sub-ppm sensitivity semiconductor surface
impurity analysis. The potential applications of this research include a highly
improved surface analytical instrumentation and the establishment of a dedicated
analytical facility for material characterizations. Markets for this
instrumentation include semiconductor manufacturers, environmental testing
laboratories, and biological research institutions
