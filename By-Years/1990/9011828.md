This project involves theoretical and experimental work on a problem of great
importance for game theory generally and for the evaluation of game-theoretic
experiments. The problem to be addressed deals with learning and models of
learning. Of particular interest is the learning which occurs when individuals
play the same game against different opponents. The theoretical part of the
project will focus on studying those conditions under which individuals do or do
not converge in such games to the Nash equilibrium. The experimental portion of
the project will pursue a combination of two classes of designs in an attempt to
evaluate both the theory of strategic learning and some of the myopic learning
models developed by the investigators. The first design involves repeated play
of a game with incomplete information between fixed opponents, while the second
involves repeated play between changing opponents. These designs will enable the
investigators to study learning explicitly within a dynamic framework.
