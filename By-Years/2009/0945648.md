This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish the
feasibility of a power scalable, short pulse fiber laser that is suitable for
use in Extreme UV Lithography (EUVL). A power scalable solution is proposed
here, based on fiber lasers using Chirally-Coupled Core (3C) fiber that is 3X
more energy efficient and dramatically more compact than competing alternatives.
3C fiber enables single-mode optical output from fibers with core diameters much
larger than conventional double-clad fiber.

Successful completion of this project would provide a technology to extend
photolithography for feature sizes below 22 nanometers. Currently available
laser technology can deliver only one third of the power required for high
volume manufacturing by EUVL. Source laser power scaling is a key enabler for
high volume manufacturing with EUVL and hence the production of semiconductor
integrated circuits (ICs) that are smaller, more powerful and more energy
efficient.
