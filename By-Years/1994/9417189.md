9417189 Barger This award supports a three-year cooperative research project
between Dr. Vernon Barger of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Professor
Tsutomu Yanagida of Tohoku University. The collaborators assembled also include
phenomenologists from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of
Hawaii as well as theorists from Nagoya University and the National Laboratory
for High Energy Physics (KEK). This project will address some of the most
important areas of research in the phenomenology of fundamental particle
interactions. This collaboration will facilitate in- depth studies of the
phenomenology of physics beyond the Standard Model on the following topics:
physics at linear e+e- colliders; supersymmetry; strong WW scattering;
astrophysics; and B physics. This proposal brings together research scientists
from two countries working in the area of theoretical physics. The U.S.
scientists will have the opportunity to become familiar with research techniques
and equipment at Tohoku University and KEK. Therefore, this proposal fulfills
the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific
knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
