This is an investigation of the dispersion of modifiers (potassium and copper)
in supported ruthenium catalysts using steady-state isotopic transient kinetic
analysis (SSITKA) of the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction. Since this reaction is
highly structure sensitive, it can be used to detect modifier- induced
disruptions in the surface of the active metal. In fact, from isotopic
transients, it is possible to determine directly how the modifier adspecies
affects the population of active ensemble sites. Along with the interpretation
of SSITKA-derived reactivity distributions of these sites, the project addresses
fundamental questions regarding modifier location and modifier dispersion.
Catalyst promoters are often used to improve activities and selectivities of
industrial catalysts. Despite their wide use, the nature of their influence is
unknown, resulting in a lack of a rational basis for selection of modifiers.
