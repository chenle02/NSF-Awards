The workshop to be held in Paris May 1992 will deal specifically with ground
improvement technology. The topics envisioned for discussion are physical-
chemical modification; novel grouting methods; use of geosynthetics; ground
improvement techniques for liquefaction control, hazard mitigation and slope
stability; in situ testing and non destructive evaluation of improved ground;
and numerical modeling of the engineering behavior of stabilized/improved
systems. The invited group of participants will include members from the
academic community, federal agencies, consulting firms, and contractors.
