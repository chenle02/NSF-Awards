Atoms of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and sulfur naturally occur in
multiple stable states know as stable isotopes. The atom?s nucleus may have
differing numbers of neutrons that result in these stable states. Scientists
have been able to use these different isotopic forms of atoms to study
biological, chemical and physical processes in the environment. Stable isotopes
are routinely used for animal and plant physiology, community and ecosystem
ecology, biomedicine, paleo-biology, evolution, and climatology.

Given the broad diversity of questions that can be answered with stable
isotopes, coupled with advancements in instrumentation that yield extremely high
throughput on a single mass spectrometer, isotope datasets now represent "big
data" that can (and should) be mined repeatedly, just as genomic data are
routinely accessed. Unfortunately, a centralized database tied to Darwin Core
Standards through museum specimens does not yet exist for stable isotope data.
The use of stable isotopes in the natural sciences is no longer limited by data
acquisition, but rather data exchange, availability and integration with other
large databases (e.g., GIS, GenBank). Such inefficiencies have led to
unnecessary duplication of effort, redundancy in data and generally stymied
progress as researchers spend more time generating pilot isotope data, rather
than testing biological hypotheses and research ideas. This workshop will focus
on the development of the first centralized, online, broadly accessible database
for stable isotope data - an IsoBank.
