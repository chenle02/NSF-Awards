This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
auction software that allows bidders to specify budget constraints, and will
assess the feasibility of this software for conducting large-scale multi-item
auctions. Multi-item auction design has been at the frontier of research in
economics and computer science over the past fifteen years. Yet no existing
mechanism enables effective competition when bidders face serious budget
constraints. New, sealed-bid designs that enable bidders to specify a budget
encourage bidders to place more and higher bids, better reflecting values.
Sellers will therefore receive higher prices and assignments of goods will be
more economically efficient. In multi-item auctions, bidders often cannot risk
outcomes where they may be required to pay more than their authorized budgets.
Examples are widespread, ranging from online ad placement to auctions of mineral
rights and radio spectrum licenses, and rudimentary technologies to account for
Internet ad budgets have already been deployed. There is an immediate need for
related budget-based technology physical world auctions where the absence of
such technology is reducing the number and level of bids. For example, in sales
of oil and gas rights by the US DOI, the average number of bids has been only
1.3 per tract, with losing bidders unable to compete for more tracts due to
their need to limit budget exposure. Building on economic analyses of multi-item
auctions successfully produced under previous efforts, this proposal will take
the next step, creating multi-item auction software that allows bidders to work
effectively with limited budgets. These auctions will promote more efficient
outcomes and higher revenues for sellers. This research will initially assess
the feasibility of software for use in oil and gas leasing, which will be a
crucial milestone in bringing efficient auctions to other important markets in
both the public and private sectors.
