The Amazon Deep-Sea Fan is a typical large modern deep-sea fan. Past studies
have documented the structure and surface morphology of the fan, including the
location and character of the most recently active channel which crosses the
fan. Cores collected in the vicinity of this channel sample the sediments
deposited by channelized flows before activity ceased following post-glacial sea
level rise. We propose here (1) to use morphological and sedimentological data
to determine the likely characteristics of channelized turbidity currents and
(2) to develop a stratigraphy which will allow us to determine the age of
sedimentary activity on the fan. The stratigraphy will be based on delta 0-18
curves supplemented with AMS C-14 dates. New techniques developed at NCSU can
measure 0-18 on samples containing few foraminifera, an advantage in cores with
high sedimentation rates. AMS C-14 dates on the biogenic carbonates and pollen
analysis will help to constrain the stratigraphic dates. Benchmark isotope
stratigraphies, developed in the middle and lower fan areas where downslope
flows are minimal, will applied to the most recently active channel/levee areas
where downslope flows are more common. Such a stratigraphy will allow us to
determine the ages associated with depositional events such as the cessation of
flow down abandoned channels and the emplacement of major debris flows. We can
then determime rates for fan processes and tie depositional patterns to sea
level. The high-resolution 0-18 stratigraphy will also be valuable for assessing
the late glacial/early interglacial role of the amazon River in determining
paleoclimate and paleoceanograhic changes.
