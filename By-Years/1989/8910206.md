To date, the optimization of mammalian cell bioreactor performance has been
implemented via the application of empirical correlations relating easily
observable cellular kinetics to medium composition and bioreactor operation.
While moderately successful, there is a limit to the success that may be
achieved with such an empirical approach. A greater degree of success maybe
obtained by selectively altering the activity of the metabolic pathways of the
cells in a manner that increases bioreactor performance. However, it is
difficult to alter pathway activities in a rational fashion if the regulatory
characteristics of these pathways are not known, or, more importantly, if they
can not even be accurately measured. The development of a method to measure in
vivo metabolic activities, as presented in this proposal, addresses this
limitation. This method will provide a tool for mammalian cell technologists to
approach process optimization from a different and more knowledgeable direction.
