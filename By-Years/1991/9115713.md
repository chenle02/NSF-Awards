In this project, the PI's will continue to study the response of the continental
shelf surface boundary layer to atmospheric forcing through analysis of data
from a major collaborative field experiment, SMILE (Shelf Mixed Layer
Experiment). SMILE was conducted over the northern California shelf from mid-
November, 1988 to mid-May, 1989 and included moored and land-based ocean and
atmospheric time series measurements and overflights with an instrumented
aircraft. Addressing several specific tasks will lead to a coherent picture of
the seasonal behavior of the shelf surface boundary layer and its response to
atmospheric forcing.
