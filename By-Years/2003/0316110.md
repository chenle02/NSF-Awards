Mutualisms are ecological relationships in which both participating species
benefit. These beneficial interactions are universal among organisms, impacting
ecosystem function and community integrity. In this project the investigator
addresses the ecological conditions leading to the collapse of a pollination
mutualism by conducting three experiments in the field. In the first experiment,
nectar-thieving ants will be introduced to plants to determine whether the
stability of the pollination mutualism depends on the abundance of floral
antagonists. In the second experiment the diversity of pollinators visiting the
host plant will be manipulated to test whether alternative pollinator species
can buffer a host plant from the destabilizing effect of floral antagonists. The
third experiment will manipulate drought stress experimentally to test whether
plant-pollinator relationships are more vulnerable to disruption under harsh
environmental conditions. The proposed research evaluates how abiotic stress
affects the net benefits derived from a&lt;br/&gt;plant's relationship with its
animal pollinators in the presence and absence of cheaters.&lt;br/&gt;
