This proposal requests support for the purchase and development of several
pieces of instrument which will be used to significantly advance a current
research effort supported by the National Institutes of Health in the area of
novel three-dimensional (3-D) microscopy. Specifically, the 3-D microscopy
system currently being investigated will be developed into a high-resolution
fluorescence microscopy system with real-time reconstruction capability by
acquiring an Argon laser, an x-y computer-controlled scanning system, and a
workstation. The Argon laser at 470 nm extends the microscopy system to be able
to operate in a fluorescent mode, thereby potentially making the system a very
useful and powerful tool in many branches of biology and the life sciences. The
x-y scanning system allows the microscopy system to perform specimen-scanning
instead of optical beam-scanning, thereby ensuring that the resolution and
contrast are identical across the entire field of view. The workstation will
improve the speed of the analysis of the 3-D data obtained from the microscopy
system by an order of magnitude, thereby making it possible for real-time 3-D
data manipulation and image presentation. The results of the proposed
instrumentation development activity could lead to better 3-D information
processing in areas such as real-time image processing, microscopy, and data
storage and acquisition in the life sciences.
