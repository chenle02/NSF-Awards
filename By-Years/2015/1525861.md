News reports are rife with accounts of data breaches, network security problems,
and the dangers of keeping personal information online. Modern life, though,
makes it impossible to avoid doing just that. It is almost no longer a choice
whether we make purchases, communicate with our bank, apply for government
services, or file our taxes online - it is the standard expectation. This
research explores how people resolve the tension between these two realities and
the practices that people have adopted to balance competing demands upon
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to understand how people manage security
online, in two ways. The first is in the sense of engaging in technical fixes
for potential problems; the second is how they come to terms with the potential
risks and develop strategies, accommodations, and justifications for particular
ways of working online. Using techniques from anthropology and sociology, this
project sets out to understand online security as part of people's everyday
lives. The research will have two major outcomes. The first to document the
conditions of contemporary digital life, as a contribution to ongoing studies of
the impact of digital technology. The second is to provide the basis on which
new technologies can more adequately protect people's privacy and security
online, and more easily integrate with people's online and offline practices.
