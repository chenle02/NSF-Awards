The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is providing scholarships to 39
academically talented transfer students from the Alamo Community College
District preparing to become science and mathematics teachers. The effort will
involve a partnership of the College of Sciences, the College of Education and
Human Development, schools within the Alamo Community College District and
several local high needs school districts in and around San Antonio,
Texas.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The program follows a previously established model
at UTSA shown to be successful with students majoring in STEM within UTSA. The
Generating Educational Excellence in Math and Science (GE2MS) program is
providing pre-service teachers with mentoring and academic support to
effectively integrate the students into the pre-service activities at UTSA
(including a summer bridging institute) while providing the students the
opportunity to participate in a rigorous science and mathematics preparation
program. In addition, project personnel are offering continuing support for the
new teachers including access to induction support services offered by the
Academy for Teacher Excellence (ATE) and Career Transitioning Guidance (CTG),
and conducting regular online sessions through an eCommunity of Practice to
provide support, advice, mentoring and help with curricular challenges
encountered by new teachers. The evaluation of the Noyce GE2MS program is also
providing information on the efficacy of mentoring and academic support and to
inform how these activities can be structured to increase the recruitment and
retention of highly qualified secondary STEM teachers.
