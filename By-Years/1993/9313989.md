9313989 Whitmire This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in inorganic and organometallic chemistry between Kenton H. Whitmire, Rice
University, and Jean-Yves Saillard, University of Rennes. The objective of their
research is to perform experimental and theoretical studies on a class of large
cobalt- bismuth cluster compounds, an organometallic cluster recently discovered
by Dr. Whitmire's group. Large cluster compounds are important for studies on
main-group and transition metals, and on separating molecules and solids. The
U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the synthesis and
characterization of large bismuth cobalt clusters and in experimental studies of
main group elements and transition metals. This is complemented by the French
group's expertise in small organometallic cluster molecules and extended solid
state structures, which are important to understanding bonding of these
molecules. They have worked on methods for determining orbital structure for
both organometallic cluster complexes and extended solid state arrays. This
project will advance understanding of the formation of complex molecules of main
group and transition metal atoms and their chemical reactivity. ***
