9505689 University of New Hampshire Virendra Mathur This workshop will bring
together several scientists and engineers from universities, industries and
government laboratories to discuss sorption with chemical complex formation. The
focus of the workshop will be on the "Role of Thermal Swing Absorption in Air
Separation." Thermal Swing Absorption (TSA) is an emerging non-cryogenic
technique that is specifically designed to use waste heat as the energy source.
An oxygen binding complex is used to selectively and reversibly bind oxygen,
which can be released at a higher temperature. The experience and knowledge
transfer from this workshop may lead to research and development with
significant impact on cost-effective production of oxygen for its use in
pollution prevention or control and for energy savings. The research needs in
this topic will be documented in the form of proceedings. There is potential of
long term impact on the manufacturing of oxygen, a critical gas for industrial
and biomedical applications, and on pollution control as well as energy savings.
