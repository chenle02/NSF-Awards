9615706 Sitar The proposed project will study heteroepitaxial nucleation and
growth of diamond films on nickel (Ni) metal substrates via hot filament
chemical vapor deposition. The goal of this research is to produce high quality,
single crystal diamond films up to an area of l x l square centimeter on Ni
substrates by using a novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process involving
seeding, annealing, solution treatment, nucleation, and deposition. This multi-
step CVD technique has recently been demonstrated to be very effective in
suppressing graphite formation and promoting oriented diamond nucleation and
growth on Ni substrates. The issues which will be investigated in this proposal
include: solubility of carbon in presence of atomic hydrogen, effect of atomic
hydrogen on the eutectic temperature; developing effective seeding techniques;
optimizing the multi-step deposition process; promoting desired growth
orientations; and performing detailed in-vacuo surface characterization and
modeling of the nucleation and growth process. %%% The proposed research
integrates state-of-the-art equipment and experienced personnel to conduct
forefront research in the field of diamond science and technology. It will
develop and expand our current knowledge base of diamond growth and enhance the
ability to transfer a technological development out of the laboratory stage into
useful industrial applications. The successful implementation of this program
will greatly advance this vital diamond technology and help the U. S. enjoy
continuing global leadership in this important research area. ***
