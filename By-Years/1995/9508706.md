9508706 Gordon The purpose of this project is to enhance the participation of
minority students and faculty in plant science research by supporting the costs
for attendance at plant science meetings. This program is limited to minorities
who are US citizens, and attendance is open to any area of plant science
including regional meetings of plant science professional societies and other
related plant science meetings. Costs to be covered include transportation
costs, registration fees, and subsistence costs while in attendance at these
meetings. Applicants will be asked to submit a short proposal requesting funds
to attend a specific meeting. The American Society of Plant Physiologists
Minority Affairs Committee will receive and review applications. Awards will be
made on the merits of the proposal. Each award recipient will be required to
submit a report of the meeting attended to provide an assessment of the impact
of this project.
