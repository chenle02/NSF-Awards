The Horse H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies, the College of Engineering,
and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of
Michigan hereby apply for $1,149,642 under the Research Careers for Minority
Scholars Program. These funds will be used to conduct the University of michigan
Research Careers for Minority Scholars (UM-RCMS) Programs, a program of
undergraduate research, faculty mentoring, and related support activities to
identify highly talented students who are from minority groups underrepresented
in science, engineering, and mathematics and encourage them to pursue doctoral
study in these fields. The UM-RCMS program will annually appoint twenty students
as UM- RCMS Scholars. Ten of these students will be from the Ann Arbor Campus
undergraduate program; the others will be visitors invited from Historically
Black, Hispanic-serving, or Native American- serving Universities, or from
colleges and universities serving large proportions of students from these
underrepresented populations. A unique aspect of the proposed UM-RCMS program is
the Scientific Executive Committee, composed of a distinguished group of
minority faculty with exceptional science research credentials and Associate
Deans from the three sponsoring units. The Scientific Executive Committee, will
oversee the RCMS Scholars Program and engage in all decisions regarding its
execution, including selection of the students who will be designated as UM-RCMS
Scholars each year and selecting research mentors most appropriate for these
students. The primary direct benefits will be an increase in research and
mentoring opportunities for talented students. 1. Um-RCMS will provide a forty
percent increase in the available placements for visiting students in our Summer
Research program, most of which are now directed toward SEM field. 2. UM-RCMS
will permit a doubling of the full year placements available for University of
Michigan undergraduate students in Science, Engineering and Mathematics, and the
opening of such positions for the first time to juniors and seniors in SEM
fields such as Geology, Astronomy, Biology, and Economics. 3. UM-RCMS will
enable the University to make a significant increase in the duration and quality
of the research and mentoring experience available to the most talented students
in the SEM fields. Extended benefits will be realized by faculty and students at
the University of Michigan, by the University as a whole and the communities it
serves, and by colleges and Universities which have joined in partnerships with
the University in order to increase the diversity of this nation's academic and
scientific community.
