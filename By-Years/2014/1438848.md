This award supports the Committee on Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Science
(CAMOS) of the Board on Physics and Astronomy of the National Academies. CAMOS
is a standing committee with membership drawn from universities, industry, and
government laboratories. Its members have expertise that is intended to cover
the full breadth of the atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) sciences. The
activities of CAMOS engage a group of leading scientists from across the
subfields of AMO science in joint deliberations and provide a learning
environment for that body regarding the public-policy process for science and
the position of AMO in the broader context of the physical sciences. In
addition, CAMOS activities lead to an improved understanding of AMO science by
the broader scientific and policy-making communities. By holding multi-
disciplinary workshops, preparing short, nontechnical documents, and initiating
studies, CAMOS will continue to educate researchers, policy makers, and the
general public about advances in AMO science that have impact in other fields of
science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAMOS has the following objectives:
to provide active stewardship of the agenda laid out by the most recent decadal
study prepared for AMO sciences, "Controlling the Quantum World"; to provide a
means by which federal agencies can request technical information and assistance
from the NRC about AMO science and related fields, and by which other units in
the NRC can obtain expertise on AMO science; to initiate ad hoc studies and
workshops on important timely topics in AMO science and/or its multidisciplinary
connections with other fields of science and technology; to develop brief
informational summaries of emerging topics and/or questions of current interest;
to provide an interface for communication among the subfields of the AMO
community as well as with the staff of federal agencies that support research in
the field; and to begin preparations for the next decadal survey of AMO science.
