ABSTRACT

Preparing Meteorology Undergraduates for the "Grand Challenge": a Prototype
Course for Hands-on Observations of Climate Variables

The principal investigator is developing an innovative, undergraduate level
course that focuses on meteorological instrumentation and observations of
climate variables, along with the analysis and interpretation of climate data,
and community interactions to develop cause-effect associations. The course
involves hands-on training with meteorological instrumentation and analysis of
climate variables using real-time and archived data, and web-based models. The
curriculum introduces undergraduate students to practical applications of field
instrumentation, measurements and observations while introducing them to the
synthesis of heterogeneous instrumentation output with human observations. The
project promotes and emphasizes student - community interactions for
understanding the microvariability in climatological observations, and its
feedback on regional perceptions. It focuses on educating students on climate
analysis both as a monitoring and outlook problem, and employs a variety of
field-tested instrumentation (radiation, micrometeorological and air pollution
related) and calibration facilities.
