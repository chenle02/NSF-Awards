The University of North Carolina Mathematics and Science Education Network
(MSEN) will initiate a four-week summer program with follow-up sessions during
the academic year for 480 seventh and eighth grade students called the MSEN
Middle School Academy. The program is a commuter Early Alert Initiative (EAI) in
mathematics and physics. Students will participate in experimental learning
activities in mathematics, physics, career exploration, and communication. The
program will involve industry and university scientists and engineers in
classroom demonstrations, career awareness sessions, and self-development
activities.
