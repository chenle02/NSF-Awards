Title: SHF:Small:Compiler Validation via Equivalence Modulo Input

Compilers are among the most widely-used and complex software systems ever
written; they are the trusted foundation for building other software. Perhaps
less known is that production compilers also frequently contain bugs, which
frustrate programmers and may lead to mysterious program failures and disasters.
Compiler validation is both scientifically and technically challenging. The
intellectual merits of this project are novel methodologies and practical
techniques for validating production compilers. The project's broader
significance and importance are improved reliability and usability of modern
compilers. It also indirectly improves the quality of every piece of software
upon which society increasingly depends.

Technically, this project is centered around equivalent modulo input (EMI), a
general concept and approach for validating compilers. A basic realization of
EMI is effective and has discovered more than a hundred important bugs in
widely-used compilers. This project builds on that success and focuses on three
main directions: develop advanced strategies to realize EMI's full potential,
test a compiler's diagnostic support and performance, and generalize techniques
toward testing C++ and OpenMP compilers. The project aims to significantly
advance our knowledge and state-of-the-art practices on validating and
engineering reliable and usable compilers.
