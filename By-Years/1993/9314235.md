9314235 Taub Technical abstract: Neutron and x-ray scattering experiments on
adsorbed films are proposed to address a variety of problems of current interest
in surface physics: 1) determination of the multilayer structure and growth mode
of the simplest (rare gas) films as well as that of more complex hydrocarbon
films adsorbed on solid substrates; 2) elucidation of the role of molecular
steric properties in the diffusive motion, growth kinetics, and phase
transitions of adsorbed films. Experiments will be conducted at the University
of Missouri Research Reactor (neutron diffaction) and at the National
Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven (x-ray diffraction). Non-technical
abstract: A microscopic understanding of the structure of organic films on metal
surfaces is fundamental to the technology of catalysis, lubrication, and
adhesion. Toward this end, neutron and x-ray experiments are proposed to
investigate the layer-by-layer structure and growth of the simplest (rare gas)
films and then of more complex hydrocarbon films adsorbed on solid surfaces.
Quasielastic neutron scattering will be analyzed to determine the effect of
molecular size and shape on the motion of adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules.
Experiments will be conducted at the University of Missouri Research Reactor and
the National Synchrotron Light Source. ***
