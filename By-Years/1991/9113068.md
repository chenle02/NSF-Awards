The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is supporting in part the Richard
Bernstein Symposium on April 19 and 20, 1991 at the University of California at
Los Angeles. This is a symposium on molecular dynamics in memory of the late
Richard Bernstein, one of the founders of this field. The use of molecular beams
has transformed the field of chemical reactions from the macroscopic to the
molecular levels and Richard Bernstein was one of the leading scientists who was
instrumental in the rapid advancement of this field. %%% This symposium will
allow graduate students to interact with the different contributors to the field
of molecular dynamics, and be exposed to the most recent developments in state-
selected, oriented or aligned molecules dissociating or reacting in beams or on
surfaces.
