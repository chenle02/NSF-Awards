This proposal is a mechanism to disburse funds to the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration for the acquisition of reprints of special journal
editions containing key articles by numerous NSF arctic principle investigators
on the ecosystems in the Bering Sea. The NOAA contact is placing the order on
behalf of a NOAA editor/author and this is the only opportunity NSF will have to
obtain copies for its own use. The material will be used at the suggestion of
the Arctic Section Head for arctic section information functions - primarily to
distribute to individuals as background information on what NSF scientists have
done in the Bering Sea.
