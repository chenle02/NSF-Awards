The San Simon Valley of southeastern Arizona maintained high plant diversity
over much of the past 30 years. However, during the mid-1990's, this plant
community underwent a dramatic change associated with the sustained irruption of
the invasive winter annual plant, Erodium cicutarium. Coincident with the
increase of this invasive plant, the winter annual plant diversity dramatically
declined, species composition shifted, and the seed-eating rodent community
changed. This research utilizes physiological, ecosystem, community and
theoretical approaches to disentangling the various environmental factors
hypothesized to have led to the dominance of E. cicutarium, and its major
impacts on the local ecosystem. These environmental factors include recent
changes in climate (decreased winter rainfall and more frequent drought),
pollution in the form of nitrogen deposition (from agricultural fields and
nearby copper smelters) and changes in the rodent community (from dominance by a
kangaroo rat to dominance by a pocket mouse). Results from field manipulations
and growth chamber studies will form the basis of mathematical models to predict
changes in the annual plant community and in the functioning of the ecosystem
under future climate and nutrient enrichment regimes. These models should
elucidate the roles of human drivers of change in this ecosystem. Results from
this work will inform mitigation and management strategies for plant invasions
in arid ecosystems, and should aid efforts to restore native plant communities.
This project also has an important research training component for
undergraduates and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow. It will support
the training of women and minorities in a scientific discipline where they have
been underrepresented.
