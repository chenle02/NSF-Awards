It is critical that we acquire a new mask aligner such as the Karl Suss MJB 3.
The MJB3 is designed to work with up to 3 inch wafers or with pieces of wafers
which is more typical for our GaAs processing. The MJB 3 has gentle substrate
handling, and highly sensitive and fragile materials such as GaAs, InP, and InSb
can be used. The MJB 3 is also capable of 0.6 um resolution with the optics and
exposure system we are requesting.
