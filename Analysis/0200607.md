ABSTRACT

Research will be conducted on problems arising from the interaction between
function theory and functional analysis. Primary emphasis will rest on the study
of Toeplitz operators on some function spaces. The topics to be considered
include compact operators ``closely associated with function theory'' on the
Hardy space or the Bergman space, bounded Toeplitz operators, algebraic and
spectral properties of dual Toeplitz operators, Hankel and Toeplitz operators on
the Segal-Bargmann spaces and quasi-invariant subspaces of the Segal-Bargmann
spaces. This project focuses on the central problem of establishing the
relationship between the fundamental properties of those operators and analytic
and geometric properties of their symbols.

The proposed work involves ideas and problems from operator theory and complex
analysis. Operator Theory grew out of ideas used to study certain partial
differential equations arising in physics, and became increasingly important
with the advent of Quantum Mechanics. There are at least two reasons for the
continuous and increasing interest in Toeplitz operators. In addition to
differential operators, Toeplitz operators constitute one of the most important
classes of non-selfadjoint operators and they are a fascinating example of the
fruitful interplay between such topics as operator theory, function theory,
harmonic analysis and operator algebras. On the other hand, Toeplitz operators
are of importance in connection with a variety of problems in physics,
probability theory, information and control theory, and several other fields.
