In this project, the PI will collect and analyze water samples for concentration
and distribution of radiocarbon (C-14) on hydrographic survey lines in the
Pacific, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Lines to be
done in 1992 and early 1993 will complete the coverage of the US contribution to
sampling in the South Pacific. C-14 data will be incorporated with data on other
transient tracers and hydrographic variables, and with ocean general circulation
models, to determine the large- scale and long-term flow characteristics in the
Pacific, with application to the role of the ocean in heat storage, heat
transport, and the effects on climate variability.
