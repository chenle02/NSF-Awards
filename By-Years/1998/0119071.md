9901033 Garbini The Marine Board of the National Research Council's (NRC)
Transportation Research Board (TRB) serves the national interest by providing
evaluations and advice concerning ocean developments and uses and the nation's
ability to meet its marine and maritime goals. The Board considers questions of
the relationship of engineering and technology to coastal and offshore resource
development and operations; to navigation and the commerce of the seas,
waterways and ports; to related human resources and onshore activities; and
their relationship to the establishment and implementation of public policies.
The Board identifies opportunities and needs for new technologies and other
developments and recommends appropriate actions. It stimulates the exchange of
information and cooperative activities and provides a forum for the national and
international professional community.&lt;br/&gt;The activities through which the
Board accomplishes its programs are: (1) assessments of the technical capability
to undertake and manage offshore and maritime developments and uses, including
the adequacy of knowledge to support technology development; (2) evaluations of
safety of personnel and of the environment; (3) assistance in the preparation
and assessment of the government's programs directed to ocean and maritime
developments and uses and (4) identification of future opportunities for the
integration of advanced technology into marine and maritime systems and the
influence of technical advances on the establishment and implementation of
public policy. ***&lt;br/&gt;
