The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology to determine robot
process capability in terms of position accuracy, precision, repeatability and
stability for operational characteristics of arm speed, weight handled and
spatial location. The methodology will be experimental and will employ a non-
contact (vision) measurement technique. The research will identify the critical
factors which affect robot process capability. The developed procedure will be
validated by evaluating an industrial robot.
