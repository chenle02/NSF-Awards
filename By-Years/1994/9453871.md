9453871 Fox We propose a two-tier project including: a)an assessment task, aimed
at evaluating potential of VR in education and identifying the associated
R&amp;D issues, b)a planning task, aimed at developing the proposal for the
follow-on R&amp;D project at NPAC. The assessment task will be conducted from
the perspective of the global scale program towards educational VR. The planning
task will identify a set of pilot modules to be developed at NPAC, tested in
local schools, and included into the global infrastructure developed by several
sites. Within the assessment task, we expect to interact within the NSF guided
electronic forum with other sites developing components of information
infrastructure. This will allow to both establish unified global strategy and to
identify the most appropriate focused modules to be prototyped at NPAC. ***
