This award supports mathematical research focusing on holomorphic dynamical
systems in the plane, exploiting the interaction between classical function
theory and ergodic theory. Particular emphasis is placed on thermodynamical
formalism. Such systems are given by holomorphic functions defined in
neighborhoods of compact sets defined to be the infinite past history of the
neighborhood. Of the three objects of this work, the first is to establish the
singularity of harmonic measure on the compact set with respect to one-
dimensional Hausdorff measure. The second objective is finding the description
of those cases where the harmonic measure is equivalent to the measure of
maximal entropy. The third goal is to investigate the rigidity of harmonic
measure in the sense that if two holomophic dynamical systems are
quasiconformally conjugate with equivalent measures, can one determine if they
are actually conformally conjugate? All of these problems have their roots in
potential theory, combining probabilisitic and ergodic theoretic techniques. The
research is related to analysis of fractal sets, since the most interesting
compact sets formed by the infinite past of holomorphic functions are often of
this type.
