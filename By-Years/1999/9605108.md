*** Graf The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Physics
program brings 13 undergraduate students to the Stony Brook campus each summer
for participation in forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook
physics faculty members. The aim of the program is to foster interest in, and
appreciation of, scientific research in physics and to facilitate career
planning, by the actual doing of research in a collegial setting, by site visits
to research laboratories at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory, by
weekly seminars on current problems in physics and finally by student
presentations of research results in a formal symposium at the conclusion of the
program. Outstanding projects will be presented at the national student
symposia. The program offers research opportunities in the areas of nuclear
physics, particle physics, lasers and optics, solid- state physics and
atmospheric physics. Most projects are experimental, but a few are theoretical.
Recruiting efforts concentrate on sophomore and junior level physics majors of
high academic standing, many from colleges in which research opportunities are
limited. Particular efforts are made to attract women and students from under-
represented minorities. ***
