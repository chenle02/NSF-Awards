9523205 Rinard This research is to produce a low field magnetic resonance
spectrometer for localized spectroscopy of numerous large and/or lossy samples
related to environmental, biological, and materials problems. The spectrometer
will function in the 150 to 300 MHz frequency region to provide deeper
penetration into samples for accurate and efficient chemical analyses. An
innovative new low-field, air-core magnet will be developed to create the
magnetic fields and gradients for this spectrometer. After completion of all
phases of the project, the spectrometer system will be compact, light weight,
and portable. This spectrometer will find wide use in both research and testing
applications in a wide range of areas that involve various aqueous, electrically
conducting, and other lossy samples.
