Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul D. Ronney&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern
California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop (July31 - August 1, 2014)
will be held at the Stanford University campus with experts from around the
country to address the research needs for basic combustion and reacting flows.
The proposed Workshop is a "grass roots" activity that is intentionally not
affiliated with or sponsored by any institution other than NSF, so that the
Grand Challenges will be chosen independent of whether the research required to
address these Challenges is within the interests of any particular organization
or funding agency, thus preserving the fundamental nature of the issues and
research needs that will be identified. The participants will be selected from
the combustion research community and the target audience for the outcomes of
the Workshop is the combustion research community itself.
