The overall objective of this program is to gain a better understanding of how
aerosol particles impact climate and climate change by examining the chemical,
physical, and optical properties of the major aerosol species over the tropical
and subtropical North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean to understand the processes
that cause any significant temporal or spatial variations in those properties.
Continuous measurements of aerosol properties will be made at three ground
stations: Izana, Tenerife, Canary Islands; Ragged Point, Barbados; and Miami,
Florida. These measurements will become part of a long-term database that began
in 1965 with the establishment of an atmospheric sampling site at Ragged Point,
Barbados and continued through the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment
(AEROCE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean are
particularly important and interesting because tropical oceans are thought to
have a significant impact on weather and climate, and because these ocean
regions underlay an atmosphere more impacted by airborne particles, especially
mineral dust, than any other. During summer months, pollutants from North Africa
and southern Europe are transported with mineral dust. During the winter, less
frequent episodic transport of mineral dust from more southern regions in Africa
are carried through the atmosphere often with biomass burning products.
