The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-IR for use in organic,
analytical and physical chemistry laboratories. The students are using the
instrument to analyze reaction products, study reaction rates, and determine
molecular constants for several gases. The instrument also is being used in
undergraduate research projects investigating polymeric materials.
