This is a program which will investigate the collisions between ions and highly
excited atomic Rydberg states. These Stark states will be created with a large,
welldefined degree of anisotropy, and inelastic capture and ionization
properties will be studied as a function of the anisotropy. The results of these
studies have important implications in understanding three-body motion in the
region of space connecting the classical and quantal descriptions of atomic
behavior.
