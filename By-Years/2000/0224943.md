0224943 Schulz This award supports Michael Schulz, Don Madison and students from
the University of Missouri, Rolla in a collaboration with Joachim Ulrich in the
Department of Quantum Dynamics at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics
in Heidelberg, Germany. The collaboration will investigate single and double
ionization of helium by ion impact. The U.S. group recently obtained for the
first time complete three-dimensional images of the electron emission pattern in
single ionization with the kinematics of all collision products fixed. It was
found that even state-of-the-art theories, which have been successful in
describing the ionization process under restricted geometries, do not reproduce
the measured three-dimensional images very well. The present collaboration will
develop new theoretical approaches designed to identify the important physical
effects. The German group is world renowned in the experimental techniques
necessary to this collaboration. The combination of experimental and theoretical
expertise will lead to new and fundamentally important insight into the
collision dynamics under study.
