Mathematics researchers from US institutions will participate in a three-month
program on Geometry and Quantization of Moduli Spaces to be held at the Centre
de Recerca Matem√†tica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain in the period March 26 - June 22
2012. This research program focuses on the geometry of algebraic moduli spaces
associated to compact Riemann surfaces. The scope is wide, ranging from
questions on the topology of moduli spaces to problems on their quantization,
including also problems on dynamics, quantum cohomology and other areas.

The central aims of the program on Geometry and Quantization of Moduli Spaces
are to bring together experts in the different focus areas of the program, to
advance these topics, and to introduce research students and post-doctoral
fellows to the wealth of ideas and problems in them. The program includes an
advanced course, two workshops, a final conference, as well as a regular
seminar. The funds provided by this grant will allow selected participants to
attend the special activities of the program or to spend an extended time in
residence at the CRM. The funds will be used mostly for graduate students,
postdocs, junior faculty, and other researchers with no current NSF support.
