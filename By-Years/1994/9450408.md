SSC-9450408 Johnson C. Smith University Charlotte, NC Dias, Benjamin and Appovoo
Perumal "Summer Science Camp" Johnson C. Smith University plans a four-week
intensive residential Summer Science Camp and a monthly Saturday component for
50 seventh, eighth, and ninth grade minority students for the three year period
1994-1997. The program focuses on classroom and field activities in biology,
chemistry, computer science, physics, mathematics, and problem-solving.
Activities invovle the Scientific Method as students make observations, collect
and analyze data, and draw conclusions. Field experiences involve visits to
industry, government labs, and science museums. Group meetings with minortiy
scientists, engineers, and teachers, are planned to promote careers which are
mathematics and science based. Participants will also be encouraged to consider
teaching as one of their career choices. The Saturday component is designed for
further mentoring, follow-up activities, and for students to continue working on
their summer projects. The program encourages students to enroll in mathematics
and science in school and to be successful. In so doing, we seek to address the
need for a scientifically literate society, and to help reverse the declining
achievement, interest, and participation by minority students in science and
mathematics.
