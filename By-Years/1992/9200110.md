This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student in a
tribal area of Thailand. The student will examine how local tribal peoples have
changed their social organization in response to government activities in the
region. He hypothesizes that the recent increase in local-community social
hierarchies is related to access to government programs which provide access to
income. His method will be to focus on three villages selected to vary along the
dimension of local- state interactions. Using participant observation and
structured interviews, he will study how people think of their relationships
with the state institutions they are aware of. He will conduct weekly economic
surveys in these villages as well as a wider socio-economic survey of an
additional 8 villages. This research is important because tribal peoples
everywhere are in intimate contact with state (and international) programs.
Understanding how one regional case has evolved can help decision makers
understand how to influence people in similar areas to change their behavior to
stimulate beneficial economic development.
