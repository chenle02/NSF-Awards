During recent years, the energetic phase field approach has emerged as a
successful modeling and simulation method with many advantages in studying
microstructure evolutions. The idea of phase field methods is to introduce a set
of phase field variables to implicitly track the moving surfaces of
microstructures, which can be very complex and nonlinear. In this project, the
investigator and his collaborators apply phase field methods to study biological
microstructures, especially cell membranes. The project is mainly concerned with
further analysis on phase field methods, and the broadening of applications in
studying the evolution of biological microstructures for which phase field
methods and related concepts can be used as a basis for more convenient or
efficient treatments. The project includes modeling, numerical methods, and
theoretical analysis.

The investigator studies some theoretic and algorithmic problems in phase field
methods that still remain unsolved or partly unsolved today, such as asymptotic
behavior of phase field variables (which is related to the De Giorgi
conjecture), the consistency of the fluid coupled phase field model to the sharp
interface model, topological information retrieval formulations, and convergence
and acceleration of some popular algorithms. He also applies the theoretical
results to the modeling and simulation of some complex microstructure systems,
especially cellular adhesion and rolling in a shear flow, which can be used in
the study of blood flows. Cell motility is another complex biological phenomenon
that can be simulated using phase field models. Also considered is the
simulation of acto-myosin driven cell oscillations, which can be applied to
study cell division and migration, two of the most important functions of living
cells. Besides simulating some observed phenomenon, phase field models can also
be applied to predict details of some structures that are not yet fully known,
such as highly folded membranes.
