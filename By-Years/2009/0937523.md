This project will support US researchers' active involvement in the Large Sky
Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) project, one of the
National Major Scientific Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Construction of the LAMOST facility is complete, and the telescope is undergoing
engineering tests. The principal investigator, with previous NSF support, has
established close collaborative ties with the Chinese leadership of the project,
and has been a member of the working group tasked with defining the Galactic
survey, one of two major projects to be undertaken in LAMOST's initial years of
operation. Funding of this project will permit establishment of a partnership
between US astronomers and LAMOST. This partnership will formalize participation
in the Galactic survey and guarantee the ability of US researchers who join the
PLUS collaboration to propose and be PIs on 10% of LAMOST key projects, and to
have early access to data.
