Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;The power and versatility of modern NMR spectroscopy
make it an essential tool for chemists. The Department of Chemistry is adapting
a variety of experiments from the research and educational literature that uses
nuclear spin to obtain structural information and implementing them as
discovery-based experiments. These experiments are providing the context for
introducing NMR techniques in a sequence that gradually increases the difficulty
of relating molecular structure to spectral
information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic chemistry students are being
introduced to NMR early in the first semester through C-13, DEPT, and HETCOR
experiments, followed by the characterization an organofluorine compound, using
2-D NMR to identify an unknown ester, probing the stereospecificity of a
reduction reaction using NOE, and investigating the conformational dynamics of
DEET. Students in Organic Spectroscopy are characterizing non-trivial unknowns
using a variety of complementary spectroscopic techniques. Students in advanced
courses are investigating phosphorus-phosphorus coupling and characterizing
structures of enzyme inhibitors, among other laboratory projects. These
discovery-based experiments require a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
with multinuclear capability and possessing the resolution and flexibility
required by such experiments. Research in a variety of areas has become an
integral part of the training of our undergraduate students and the high-field
NMR is finding numerous applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
