A graduate student research conference on algebra and representation theory will
be held at Kansas State University in the spring of 2006. The conference
features two keynote speakers in the fields of commutative algebra and
representation theory respectively. The rest of the talks will be all by
graduate students. The organization of the conference will be by graduate
students only. One of the main features of the conference is to encourage
graduate students from different universities to interact and get acquainted
with their future colleagues.

The conference will also encourage women and underrepresented minority students
to participate.
