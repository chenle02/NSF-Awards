9318381 Eanes Chromosomal rearrangements are a significant feature of animal and
plant genomes, and are a significant cause of cancers. However, to date little
is known about the features of the breakpoints of such arrangements. Using
Drosophila melangaster as a model organism, this project will examine DNA
sequence features associated with the chromosomal breakpoints of three
inversions found to be polymorphic in natural populations. This will also
examine the one fixed inversion difference between D. melangaster and D.
simulans. The proposed investigation will use an established microdissection-
polymerase chain reaction approach to efficiently recover genomic clones
spanning breakpoints. The subsequent analysis of these clones and population
samples of inverted and standard arrangements will permit evaluation of a number
of hypotheses of long standing interest. These include determining whether
rearrangements are each unique mutational events, and cause mutations in genes.
It will also allow us to determine if some inversions are old. Overall, our
study will contribute novel information specific to the mutational origin,
phenotypic consequences, and population genetics of inversion polymorphism. The
fruit fly species. Drosophila melangaster, is growing rapidly as a model of
molecular change particularly with respect to variation in single genes. This
study will add a unique and significant contribution to our understanding
chromosomal rearrangements in general. p d z _ _ !u ! F _ _ ( Times New Roman
