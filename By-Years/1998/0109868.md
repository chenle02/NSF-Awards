This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
the problem of chlorinated solvent contamination in saturated, low permeability
soils. The specific objectives of Phase I research are : (1) to quantify the
effectiveness of chitin as an electron donor facilitating reductive
dechlorination and enhancing bioavailability of tetrachloroethylene (PCE and
TCE); ( 2) to incorporate chitin into a delivery system designed for low
permeability soils; and (3) to evaluate the delivery method in the field.
Preliminary studies have shown that chitin may be an ideal candidate to
facilitate low cost, low maintenance bioremediation of chlorinated solvent
residual sources. Obtained as a byproduct from the shellfish industry, chitin is
particularly attractive as it is very commonly available. If favorable results
are obtained during Phase I column and field studies, then a follow on Phase II
project will further examine mechanisms controlling process efficiency and
longevity.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the multi-million dollar
bioremediation market.
