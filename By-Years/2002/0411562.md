This planning grant proposal under the Historically Black Colleges and
Universities Undergraduate Program will enable Philander Smith College (PSC) to
engage in planning efforts to enrich the institutional plan and to produce a
comprehensive proposal for strengthening its STM program. Several areas will be
investigated: increasing the number of students entering PSC STM programs;
improving retention; enhancing the pre-freshman program and redesigning the
freshman level courses to change instructional strategies and increase infusion
of technology; developing new courses to include interdisciplinary approaches
and new technological techniques; increasing the research experiences of
students; engaging faculty in professional development opportunities to enhance
their instructional and research capability; and providing necessary supporting
infrastructure enhancements.

The Internal Steering Committee will implement the planning process through
working sessions, individual member task assignments, the Community Forum,
Faculty/Staff/Students seminars, Site Visits/Model University Programs, and
other strategies and assessment tools. An External Advisory Committee will
oversee the planning process and development of a comprehensive proposal. The
college will host a forum to gain input from representatives from the three
local school districts and other identified districts to address recruiting and
retaining students. A STM Opportunity Forum will be held to introduce students
to the campus, community leaders, teachers, counselors, students, professors,
scientists, and many others. This forum will serve as a platform to focus on
enhancing the number of minorities participating in higher education and to
succeed in careers in STM. Activities will also include site visits to a
university planning grant site and NSF/HBCU-UP model sites; to hold focus
discussions and seminars with faculty and staff on program redesign to support
research as well as faculty development; to analyze data and questionnaires; and
to look closely at gaps in curricula that presently exist between students
leaving high school and entering undergraduate courses of study at PSC.

The intellectual merit of this project is that the planning process is being
designed to provide a logical approach to assessing the issues at the
institution needed to strengthen its STM program and to develop a comprehensive
proposal to address these needs and provide a plan that can significantly
contribute to increasing the STM academic capability at PSC.

The broader impacts of this planning grant is the strengthening of the STM
academic capability at PSC which will result in the increase of the number and
preparedness of African American students that can contribute in this essential
area of society.
