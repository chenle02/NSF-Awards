White dwarfs are dead stars that have the approximate mass of the Sun, but size
of the Earth. They are made up of extremely densely packed carbon and oxygen
atoms. A Type Ia supernova occurs when a white dwarf in a binary star system
pulls enough mass from its partner to trigger an explosion. When helium is the
type of mass transferred from the donor star, this is called a Type Iax. Type
Iax supernovae appear weaker than Type Ia and they may leave behind a surviving
white dwarf. This project will use spectra of several Type Iax supernovae to
test models of how both types are formed. Since Type 1a supernovae are often
used as distance indicators, results from this work will help test models of the
expanding universe. A graduate student and postdoctoral researcher will be
trained and mentored in research. The team will also prepare and distribute
physics education materials aimed at preparing under-represented students for
graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the hypothesis
that Type Ia explosions arise from double-degenerate progenitors, while SN Iax
come from single-degenerate systems by analyzing spectra of early-phase and
late-phase Type Iax supernovae. The researchers will use data from existing Pan-
STARRS and ASASSN (All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae) surveys and collect
new data from the SALT (Southern African Large Telescope) and Gemini Observatory
instruments. The project includes a detailed comparison between the spectra and
model predictions to constrain elemental composition and velocities. The team
will also apply these techniques to other classes of unusual white dwarf
supernovae, including those where the inferred ejecta masses are more than 1.4
solar masses.
