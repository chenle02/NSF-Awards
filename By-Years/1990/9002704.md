This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER program to cover
the critical costs for field measurements of the large (Ms=7.1) Santa Cruz
Mountains earthquake, for data reduction, data analysis and for rapid
distribution of this information to the scientific community. Prior to the main
shock on October 17, 1989, the principal investigator, on the basis of two large
foreshocks, installed four digital strong ground motion recorders in the area of
main shock which recorded invaluable strong motion data. This grant will support
that work and enable follow-on analysis of the aftershock series. This work has
direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
