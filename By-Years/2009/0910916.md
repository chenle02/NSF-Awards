&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support US
participation in the Xth Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
International Biology Symposium. The funds will provide partial travel support
(airfare) for 7-8 US participants to travel to Hokkaido, Japan to attend the
SCAR International Biology Symposium in July 2009. Preference will be given to
applicants who are students and early career scientists, and especially members
of under-represented groups. The SCAR International Biology Symposium is a
unique opportunity for US scientists to present their work and learn about the
most recent findings on all aspects of Antarctic organisms and ecosystems, to
establish and strengthen international contacts, and to be actively involved in
the development of new directions and the establishment of new frontiers in
polar biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel support to students and other young
polar scientists will enhance their career development by providing the
opportunity to learn about recent advances in Antarctic research, gain
experience in presenting their own research results, and establish professional
relationships with other polar biologists from the US and other countries.
Attending an international meeting such as the SCAR Symposium can be a catalytic
experience for many young investigators and can be a significant event in their
research careers.ling (e.g., IMBER) and climate variability&lt;br/&gt;
