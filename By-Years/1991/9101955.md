This applicant proposes to construct and test a new kind of probe to be used to
enhance near-field optical microscopy. More specifically, the work will focus on
construction of a submicron probe based on a Schottky barrier diode. The work is
planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Carlos Bustamante at the
University of Oregon.
