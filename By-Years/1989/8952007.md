Laboratory exercises developed for an introductory microbiology course will
allow students to use a gas chromatograph and a UV/visible spectrophotometer to
follow substrates and products through a series of bioconversions, and thus to
learn basic biological principles. Instruments will be interfaced with a
computer for data collection and analysis. Students will learn rates of
conversions and will be able to investigate factors affecting these rates. The
knowledge gained about methods and applications of instrumental analysis in
biology will help to produce students better able to succeed in our nation's
industrial and academic laboratories. The college will provide 50% matching
funds.
