This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Houston acquire a new departmental
computer system. The areas of chemical research that the acquisition will impact
are the following: 1. Theoretical/computational approach to problems in peptide
mimetic design and antiviral nucleic acid oligomers. 2. Development and
application of powerful new methods for time-evolving wavepackets describing
multiparticle systems. 3. The refinement of crystallographically determined
structures using XPLOR and studies of protein dynamics on aspartate
transcarbamylase. 4. Reaction dynamics in organometallic, solid-state and
biological areas of chemistry. 5. Exploration of several problems in the areas
of molecular recognition, binding and reactivity. %%% The use of mini-
supercomputers provides theoreticians with computing performance equal to that
of large mainframe computers. Theoretical chemistry computations give a
quantitative description of the energetics and rates of elementary chemical
reactions and also provide a qualitative understanding of the fundamental
factors governing chemical changes. Most of these studies would not have been
possible before the acquisition of the mini-supercomputer because the cost of
mainframe computers or the computer time required would have been prohibitive.
