This work will investigate the evolution of starforming galaxies over
cosmological lookback times by conducting deep, detailed studies of distant
galaxies in the optical and near-IR wavebands. The primary scientific goals are
to fill in the redshift gap for field galaxies between redshifts z = 1 and z = 2
(with lookback times of more than half the age of the Universe) and to establish
detailed connections between star-forming galaxies in the early Universe and
nearby galaxies today, especially by directly constraining the masses of distant
systems. The project will build on an ongoing study of luminous, compact, star-
forming galaxies at 2 < z < 5. The specific goal is to study Lyman break
galaxies in detail, searching especially for clues to their masses, which are
essential for placing the Lyman break galaxies in the proper context of galaxy
formation and evolution.
