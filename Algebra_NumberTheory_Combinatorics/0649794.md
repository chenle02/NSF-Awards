The University of West Georgia will be host to the Integers Conference 2007, a
conference in the areas of combinatorics and number theory. The conference will
follow the style of the successful "Integers Conference 2003," and "Integers
Conference 2005," The 2005 conference will be held over a four-day period,
October 24-27, 2007. One of its main goals will be a catalyst for important
collaborative projects among mathematicians and computer scientists representing
the areas of additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, probabilistic
number theory, combinatorics, combinatorial optimization, game theory, and
Ramsey theory. There will be several plenary speakers including George Andrews,
Ken Ono, and Florian Luca. There will also be approximately sixty 20-minute
talks.

The conference will gather mathematicians, graduate students, undergraduate
students, and others interested in combinatorics or number theory. It will
include student research talks, and promote interaction among research
mathematicians at all stages from the talented undergraduate to the
internationally distinguished researcher. A variety of areas of expertise will
be represented from within the general area of discrete mathematics. Leading
experts will present their latest work, and there will be much collaboration
among participants. The research areas have many applications, including
cryptography, genetics, neural networks, mathematical biology, coding theory,
sequences for communications applications, and interconnection networks.
