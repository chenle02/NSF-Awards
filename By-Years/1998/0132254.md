This project investigates the role of affect in information processing. Affect
plays an important role in everyday life, and it has a significant influence on
human cognitive functioning and social interactions. Although a large and
growing body of research demonstrates that affect influences the extent to which
individuals rely upon general, categorical information (e.g., stereotypes) as a
basis for forming impressions of others, researchers disagree about what
accounts for these findings. This project is concerned with how affect
influences global/local processing during impression formation and evaluates a
new conceptualization of the role of affect in processing. According to this
conceptualization, affective feelings serve as conscious feedback about largely
nonconscious emotional processes. This feedback is used by individuals to direct
their information processing. In evaluating this conceptualization, the research
acknowledges that many real-world impression formation contexts require
individuals to actively seek out information about others. Despite this, many
researchers have treated the perceiver as a relatively passive recipient of
target information. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of how affective
feelings function in more naturalistic contexts, it is essential to study active
information seeking behavior. This will be done by initiating a new direction
for research that examines how feelings guide information search and impression
formation. Given that impression formation is one of the most common goals that
individuals have in human interaction, a greater understanding of the role that
feelings play in this process will serve to illuminate further our understanding
of human behavior.
