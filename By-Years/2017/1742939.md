This proposal is for support of travel to ICDCS, which is a premier conference
and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing. Selected papers have
influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems,
software and applications in use today. The conference continues to evolve in
terms of the number of paper submissions and in the quality of accepted papers.
The number of submissions has consistently increased. In addition, the
conference also accepted another 40 presentations in the tracks of Industry,
Applications, and Visions.

The conference, to be held in Atlanta, USA, June 5-8, 2017, will span four days
and will consist of technical paper presentations, panels, presentations, and
workshops. It will also feature keynote speeches from leading researchers and
practitioners in the field.

Student travel to conferences is an important activity. Funds will be dispersed
with preference given to students who would not otherwise be able to attend the
conference and students who are not already scheduled to present a paper, paying
particular attention to diversity and relevance of the student's research
interest.
