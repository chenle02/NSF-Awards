A biological oxygen monitoring system for the direct measurement of metabolic
activity within organisms provides the resources for laboratory exercises
examining such metabolic processes as photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
The versatile system is used to evaluate different metabolic processes in
bacteria, plants and animals. Exercises utilizing the oxygen monitoring system
will clarify concepts discussed in lecture by providing students with hands-on
experience. Advanced students in biological chemistry use the equipment to
design and perform experiments analyzing specific biochemical reactions.
