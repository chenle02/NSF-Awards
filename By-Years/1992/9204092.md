The principal investigators will study dynamical systems in the classical case
of the complex plane. One investigator will study the relationship between
harmonic measure and analytic capacity. The other two investigators will
continue their research on the moduli spaces associated with Kleinian groups and
Teichmuller theory. The research spans classical analysis in one complex
variable, group theory, and differential geometry. This award will support
research in the general area of dynamical systems. A process which is very
simple and easy to understand locally can become extremely complicated,
nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study of
this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can best be modeled
using this area of mathematics including fluid flow and turbulence, complex
biological systems, mechanical systems, and chemical reactions.
