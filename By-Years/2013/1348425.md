This proposal proposes to study the counting and equidistribution problems of
geometric and arithmetic objects on homogeneous spaces arising as orbits of
discrete subgroups of Lie groups which are not necessarily lattices. The guide
line is to use the techniques from various different fields such as harmonic
analysis, dynamics of group actions, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and
automorphic forms of semisimple algebraic groups in order to describe the
asymptotic distribution of an infinite sequence of submanifolds arising in
number theoretic and geometric situations. However most of these techniques are
well developed only for the study of orbits of lattices and our main focus lies
in investigating to what extent we can further develop similar techniques for
orbits of discrete subgroups with infinite co-volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed projects lie in the intersection of several fields of mathematics
including Lie groups, analytic number theory, hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian
groups, ergodic theory and dynamics. It involves connections between several
areas of research, and has deep applications to various topics in different
areas of mathematics.
