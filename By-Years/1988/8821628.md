The investigators for this Accomplishment Based Renewal are concerned with the
conditions under which democracies are able to be sustained over time. The
importance of this research derives, in part, from the significance of this
topic and the fact that voting, public opinion and political participation are
fundamental to the promise and performance of democratic forms of government.
The setting of this empirical work is Canada, a country that is one of the
world's oldest functioning democracies, but one that continues to encounter
support-eroding problems that most other mature democracies already have
resolved. The research focuses on the electoral process as the key feature of
democratic forms of government. In this research, the investigators have
generated a series of hypotheses regarding the role that elections play in the
support process. To test these hypotheses, they conduct a three-stage panel
survey of a national sample of the Canadian electorate before, after, and
approximately one year after a national election that is being held in November,
1988. Of special importance, because of the panel design, is the ability to
measure individual change - - whether, and to what extent, changes in support
delineated in the first two waves of the study persist over a longer period of
time. This research is particularly promising because rarely does a specific
election provide as theoretically attractive a setting for studying matters such
as the manner in which elite representations of election issues affect support
levels, how people make politically relevant economic judgments, and whether
changes in the operative choice set defined by major political parties influence
the extent to which people think in retrospective or prospective terms.
