The research will apply high temperature Moire interferometry and high
temperature digital image correlation to obtain strain and displacement fields
in the vicinity of crack tips under high temperature creep loading. THe work
will include microstructural examination of damage initiation and growth to
develop a better understanding of the physics, at the same time advancing
analytical and numerical solutions for the near tip stress-strain fields. The
ultimate aim is to develop improved methods for prediction of creep damage in
materials and structures.//
