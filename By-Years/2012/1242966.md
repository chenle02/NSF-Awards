The workshop, organized by researchers from Pepperdine University, brings
leading STEM educational researchers from the US and Finland together to expand
the discussion of innovation in education. The workshop brings about 40
researchers, half from each country, together to focus on technology enhanced
learning, educational innovation, and learning analytics. At the heart of the
workshop is a series of short presentations, followed by intense, high-level
discussions. The participants will produce a series of white papers that
synthesize what is known on these topics and frame future research directions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pairing of researchers from the US with those from
Finland, a nation whose students regularly rank at the top in international
measures of STEM learning, in such a workshop holds great promise as scientific
communities with somewhat complementary strengths come together. The goal of the
workshop is to foster international collaboration between nations and, by so
doing, to spur the production of proposals at the frontiers of our knowledge of
STEM learning.
