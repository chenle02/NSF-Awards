Abstract- DMS-0104007-Geometric Variational Problems

The principal investigator proposes to continue the study, joint with R. Schoen,
of constrained variational problems for lagrangian cycles. In its most basic
form the problem can be posed as follows: Consider a symplectic manifold with a
metric compatible with the symplectic form. Fix a homology class that can be
represented by a lagrangian cycle. Find a lagrangian cycle that minimizes volume
among all lagrangian cycles representing this class and derive optimal
regularity of this cycle. In the case that the symplectic manifold is Kaehler,
with Kaehler-Einstein metric, sufficient regularity of the minimizer implies
that the minimizer is both lagrangian and minimal (zero mean curvature). If the
first Chern class is negative such submanifolds could be unique, in a suitable
sense, and then useful in understanding the geometry of the ambient manifold. If
the Kaehler manifold is a Calabi-Yau manifold sufficient regularity implies that
the minimizer is a calibrated submanifold, a special lagrangian submanifold. We
propose to investigate the existence and regularity of this and related
varitional problems and to study the consequences of these results on the
geometry of Kaehler-Einstein manifolds.



A consequence of the proposal is an existence theorem for special lagrangian
submanifolds of a Calabi-Yau manifold. This result is an essential part of the
program proposed by Strominger-Yau-Zaslow for the geometric construction of
"mirror symmetry". Mirror symmetry is one of the most interesting and important
problems currently being studied in mathematics and theoretical physics. At its
core it proposes a duality between a class of manifolds called Calabi-Yau
manifolds. This duality allows computations to be performed on one manifold that
yield a result for its "mirror". Thus computations that are otherwise extremely
difficult can be achieved. The realization of mirror symmetry will effect such
diverse subjects as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, topology, partial
differential equations and string theory. The current interest in this subject
helps bridge the gap between physics and mathematics. In two-dimensions our
proposal has some close analogies to a well-known model problem in non-linear
elasticity. The regularity theory developed here will shed light on the
difficult regularity problems of that theory. Finally this problem is the first
attempt to make a systematic study of a variational problem with a geometric
constaint. This idea will have other important applications in geometry and its
applications.
