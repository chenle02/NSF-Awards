*** 9708939 ORWOLL This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and
Facilities (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at The College
of William and Mary acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) synthesis and characterization of
dicyanoanthracene-B-cyclodextrins, (2) polymer degradation and stabilization,
(3) transition metals in multidentate chelates, (4) coordination polymers, (5)
structure- reactivity studies of simple organic molecules, and (6)
organometallic complexes, polymerizations, electronically-delocalized systems,
thermally-stable electrooptic modulators. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as
polymers, catalysis, and in biology. ***
