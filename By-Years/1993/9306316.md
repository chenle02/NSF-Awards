9306316 Lafyatis This proposal is for an experimental investigation of the van
der Waals interaction between a ground state alkali atom and a conducting
macroscopic surface. The goals of the investigation are: a) to resolve a long
standing discrepancy between the only previous study of this nature and what is
widely regarded as a reliable theoretical treatment b) to make benchmark
measurements to maximally challenge the theories for these fundamental
interactions c) to make the first measurements of the van der Waals potential
energy function for atom-surface distances where retardation effects are
important. The proposed experiment consists of passing a laser slowed atomic
beam over an extremely flat gold surface and measuring downstream the density of
the beam bent by van der Waals forces into the geometric shadow of the surface.
By using laser slowing and working with near atomically flat surfaces the
experiment will make measurements for atom- surface distances from 10 nm to 850
nm. The proposed experiments complement the ongoing Rydberg atom-gold surface
studies of Hinds and Haroche. The proposed work will directly address the long
standing experiment-theory discrepancy. The physics of a ground state atom's
interaction with a conducting surface differs in important ways from that of a
Rydberg atom's interaction.
