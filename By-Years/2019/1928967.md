The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in providing
new techniques for brewers, distillers, biofuel producers, and biopharmaceutical
companies to increase yield, reduce cost and minimize potential losses.
Microwave flow cytometry (microFC) technology is promising to accurately measure
cell density, monitor cell viability, and detect microorganism contaminations at
high throughput and in real time without the use of expensive reagents. The long
term and continuous monitoring process also requires minimal human intervention.
Thus, the technology is promising to provide its users precise and instantaneous
information for process control and optimization as well as early contamination
detection. It can help improve yield and product quality while save water,
energy and manpower, while promoting discoveries of new biomanufacturing
processes and new products.

This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for microwave flow
cytometry (microFC) technology by investigating the needs of companies that use
biological cells to manufacture products. microFC is based on novel microwave
interferometer technology, which includes novel tuning mechanisms to cover
broadband frequency ranges for specificity and allows for high sensitivity
sensing. Employed in the interferometer system is a microwave sensor with
embedded microfluidics that transport individual cells through the sensor,
measuring multiple parameters of yeast cells and bacteria including cell density
(cells/mL), volume, and physiological state (viability and bedding cells). The
measurements are reagent-free and noninvasive. microFC's are expected to enable
low cost and easy-to-use online cell monitoring, which will fill an
instrumentation gap in both industry and academia.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
