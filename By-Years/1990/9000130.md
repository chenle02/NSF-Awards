The University of Michigan will operate the R/V LAURENTIAN during 1990 as a
general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The
LAURENTIAN is a 80' general research vessel constructed in 1974. It is owned by
the University of Michigan. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National
Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country. The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the
work proposed. The program considers the ship an important part of the fleet due
to its location. The LAURENTIAN is the only NSF-funded vessel that operates in
the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve
usage of the vessel.
