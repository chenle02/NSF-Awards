The RFID chips are at the core of the tags typically attached to commercial
items in the marketplace - although they can have a lot more uses. The main goal
of this project is to reduce the cost of RFID chips by eliminating most of the
circuitry needed for managing the recovered power on the chip. This technique
has potential to reduce the chip cost by about one-third. Another variant of
this technology permits tags to operate at high efficiency, and thus at low RF
or magnetic power levels. The research also has potential to increase the range
at which the RFID tag can be powered. A successful outcome will open new market
opportunities to use RFID technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main technique
employed in this project is to directly operate the circuits from recovered
wireless power. A new chip design technique has been identified for doing this
and will be exploited and further explored in this project. At the core of this
proposal is a new circuit structure, one that permits digital and some analog
operations to be performed from an AC, rather than DC, power supply. Unlike
previous AC powered circuit concepts the proposed method can be powered from RF
sources up to approximately the unity gain frequency of the device technology at
that operating voltage. This circuit structure is likely to work well at next
generation RFID frequencies in the 860 to 960 MHz range as well. Demonstrations
at the level of complete RFID tags are planned.
