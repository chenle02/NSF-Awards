9618738 Kennedy This proposal is for a Local Systemic Change project to improve
science teaching and learning in six school districts in Southwest Washington
State. In the 5 year project, professional development will be customized to
meet the specific needs of the 402 grades K-6 teachers who each will receive
over 140 hours enhancement over a four year period to enable teachers to
implement curricula and teaching units consistent with the best inquiry based
science teaching. Various levels of support for the teacher participants will be
provided by full time resource teachers and scientists and engineers from the
community who will be partnered with teachers to act as a personal resource.
Partners include faculty from science and education departments of Western
Washington University, personnel from local business and industry (e.g. Hewlett
packard and American Cyanamid) and the informal science community in nearby
Portland, Oregon. A regional materials center will supply instructional
materials such as FOSS, Insights and Science and Technology for Children (STC)
for teachers. The request is for $1,205,593 with cost share estimated as
$986,290 (82%).
