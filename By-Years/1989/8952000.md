This grant supports the acquisition of equipment for upgrading the image
processing capability of the senior design laboratory course. The two-semester
senior project laboratory is the capstone of the Broadly undergraduate
engineering program. In recent years interest in image processing has grown,
requiring students to generalize their knowledge to the two-dimensional spatial
and spatial frequency domain. Processing "real world" images motivates a deeper
understanding of signal processing concepts and increases awareness of such
fields as manufacturing and quality control, autonomous vehicle guidance,
microscopic analysis of materials, satellite resource imaging and medical
imaging. The equipment includes two PC video frame processors, upgrades memory
and disc capacity for an existing PC, and one new PC computer. New video input
devices include one medium resolution camera, one line scanner, one video
recorder and other supporting hardware. The institution is providing matching
funds in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the
Foundation.
