This research investigates the application of the phase of laser light to
understand and manipulate the behavior of electrons and/or nuclei in isolated
molecules and in condensed matter. By varying the relative phase of two
electromagnetic fields, it is possible to control the interference between two
competing excitation paths and thereby to alter the branching ratio of a
chemical reaction or the direction of a photocurrent. Moreover, from the laser-
phase dependence of the observable, it is possible to obtain fundamentally new
information about continuum structure. Three new initiatives are designed to
deepen our understanding of such interference effects. The first is the
application of coherent control to bond-selective chemistry of complex
molecules. Specifically, the interference between one- and three-photon
excitation will be used to control the product distribution in the
photodissociation of vinyl chloride. Second, coherent control will be used to
manipulate the photodissociation of hydrogen molecules in selected vibrational
and rotational levels. The phase lag spectrum for this process will then be
compared with theoretical predictions. Finally, the theory of phase-lag
spectroscopy will be extended to deal with surface resonances, thereby providing
a tool for understanding a variety of decay and decoherence mechanisms relevant
to photon- and electron-triggered surface chemistry and to electron transport in
molecular devices. This project is jointly funded by the AMOP program in the
Physics Division and the EPC program in the Chemistry Division.
