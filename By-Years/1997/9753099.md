This research involves the incorporation of composite materials such as fiber
reinforced plastic (FRP) into reinforced concrete beam-column connections for
strengthening/rehabilitation purposes. FRP materials have several advantages
over steel including, light weight, corrosion resistance, and the ability to
mold FRP overlays to concrete surfaces. The FRP products can be used in the
initial construction or for structural repair/enhancement. The use of FRP
overlay reinforcement is not new, nor is its application to concrete. What is
new is the application of this technology to structural joints. The objective of
this research is to determine appropriate configurations of epoxy bonded FRP
overlays to obtain moment transfer at beam-column connections. This
investigation will concentrate on an exterior joint of a frame. This research
will use analytical modeling and laboratory testing of scaled down models to
study the ability of various configurations of epoxy bonded FRP overlays to
increase the flexural capacity of a beam-column joint.
