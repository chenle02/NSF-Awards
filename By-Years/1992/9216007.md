In this renewal grant theoretical research will focus on the effects of strong
disorder and correlation in electron systems. New results have been obtained for
the fractional quantized Hall state, particularly in confined geometry. The
overlap factor which appears in tunnelling measurements has been calculated and
the possible existence of a Fermi liquid state at half filling has been
explored. The new work will build on this past work to further study the
properties of edge channels and the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the fractional
quantized Hall regime. %%% Theoretical research will be done on the fundamental
properties of the fractional quantized Hall state - a new state of matter
exhibited by two-dimensional electron gases. This special state of matter is
usually obtained at semiconductor interfaces in strong magnetic fields. The
effects of strong disorder and correlation among the electrons will be studied.
While contributing to basic condensed matter physics, there may be wider
ramifications of this work in microelectronics.
