NEON, Inc. a not-for-propfit corporation, proposes a television series for
children, initiallyu 30 programs, suitable for daily or weekly broadcast, for
home viewing via PBSA (with appropriate availability elsewhere). Program length:
30 Minutes. The premise: Three Wufniks--creatures from the cartoom world--draw
their way into our world and with the help of children, undertake the adventure
of finding our what it's all about. Thesek characters (played by adult
professional performers in structurally sophisticated fantasy/animal costumes),
move from dthe uncertain world of animated film into a range of encounters with
ourrock-solid environment, get to know children and adults, scientists and
laypeople, and must continually reconstruct their naive theories and their image
of life on earth. The concept, designed to appeal to five- to nine-olds,
combines education with entertainment (and is inclusive of other age groups,
such as parents, to enhance educational effect). School and other non-broadcast
distribution of program elements is planned, plus ancillary materials including
computer software and print. The educational approach is interdisciplinary, with
emphasis both on content and the development of positive attitudes towards
science and mathematics; sub-objectives geography and history. The Principal
Investigators are a television producer experienced in science programming for
children, and a scientist with extensive children's educational television
background. Program appeal for girls and minorities is integarl to the design;
project staff will also cover a broad spectrum. Encouragement of science-and
math-related audience activities is a project objective. Planning includesds
extensive outreach and promotion related to the show premise.
