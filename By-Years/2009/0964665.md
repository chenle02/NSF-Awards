Manipulation allows a robot to alter its environment by performing mechanical
work on it. Combined with locomotion, autonomous manipulation will be a key
enabling capability in future robot systems for exploration, home care,
military, industrial, and space applications. While most current robotic
manipulation consists of simple grasp-and-carry operations, the spectrum of
manipulation methods is much broader, including throwing, pushing, rolling,
sliding, tapping, etc. Humans and animals make use of these methods on a daily
basis, but robots do not. What is missing is a theoretical framework for
combining and sequencing such manipulation methods for automatic planning and
control of robotic manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is working
toward autonomous manipulation by bridging the gap from individual robotic
manipulation primitives to full manipulation sequence planning. The project is
developing theoretical tools, a mechanics-based manipulation planning framework,
feedback control algorithms, and an experimental manipulation testbed
incorporating high-speed vision. The tools developed for autonomous planning and
execution of manipulation sequences will allow future robot users to program
robots at a much higher level of abstraction than currently possible. For
example, instead of programming low-level control of motors, the user can simply
say "place object A on object B." This will help grow the field of personal
robotics, by allowing non-experts to interact with
robots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International partners in this work include leading
laboratories in Italy and Japan. These collaborations provide unique access for
graduate and undergraduate researchers to the world's leading experts in robotic
manipulation.
