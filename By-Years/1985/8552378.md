This project funds a six-week summer Physical Science Workshop for teachers of
grades 7-9. The workshop will be an opportunity for 24 teachers from an
11-county area of Central Iowa to participate in an in- depth program to update
their skills. The workshop will do the following: (a) update knowledge of
participants in physical science, (b) advance skills in physical science
instruction and experimentation, (c) prepare diverse curriculum materials that
cover a complete physical science course and (d) make equipment for schools
which have a minimal quantity of laboratory materials. During the academic year,
the participants will meet for post-sessions with the workshop staff, principals
of participating schools, and science consultants to discuss progress and
problems in implementing the workshop concepts and materials. The workshop staff
will visit each teacher's local school to assist in implementing new materials.
