A diffuse reflectance accessory for Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy is
acquired for use with a demonstration instrument supplied by Nicolet
Instruments. This is used to study mechanisms in heterogeneous catalytic
systems. Systems to be studied include methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) on ZSM-5,
studies of zeolite acidity, oligomerization of olefins in zeolites, and methanol
synthesis over copper/zinc oxide. All of these systems are of current importance
industrially. //
