The PIs propose application of boron isotopic studies to elucidate
mineralization at massive sulfide ore deposits (Kidd Creek and Broken Hill).
They have developed new mass spectrometric methods for improving analytical
precision, and carried out sufficient preliminary work to show that boron is a
valuable trace of fluid evolution in such deposits. The work is novel and holds
potential for new insights into the source of mineralizing fluids and processes
of fluid-rock interaction.
