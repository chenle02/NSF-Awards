Ray tracing has long been recognized for its quality and flexibility in
visualizing three dimensional data. To date, the single factor which has been
limited the algorithm's use is its computational complexity. In an effort to
overcome this problem an application specific parallel computer is proposed.
This architecture is based upon a ray partitioning approach, in contrast to
previous spatial partitioning approahces. It employs a multitude of processing
elements, each with access to a global shared memory. To reduce the bandwidth
requirements between individual processors and this shared memory the need for
an efficient private cache arises. We suggest that the design of a cache
specialized for accessing ray tracer databases is the single most important
factor in the practical realization of the ray partitioning approach. The
objective of this research is to determine the ray allocation scheme, the
internal database structure, and the appropriate cache parameters which provide
hit rates high enough to support the number of processors required for real-time
ray tracing performance. Special attention will also be paid to load balancing
and practical VLSI implementation.
