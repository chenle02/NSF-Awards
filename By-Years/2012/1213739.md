In this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes in the Chemistry Division,
Dr. Judith Burstyn, from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, will study how
sensory protein function is regulated allosterically by binding of small
molecules to heme cofactors. Heme-containing modular transcription factors
regulate energy metabolism, circadian rhythm and developmental timing, which are
fundamental homeostatic processes in living organisms. Dr. Burstyn will
investigate the heme-dependent gas-responsive bacterial transcription factors,
CO-sensing CooA, CO-sensing RcoM and NO-sensing DNR, to elucidate the mechanism
by which these proteins respond to CO and NO. The project will advance
understanding of allosteric regulation in these modular transcription factors,
where effector-binding and DNA binding domains are coupled in ways that are
poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project
address the recruitment and retention of students who are underrepresented in
science. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with this project
will be trained as mentors, and will supervise the research of undergraduate
students who are selected from among underrepresented groups. The research
carried out by these undergraduates will contribute toward the scientific
objectives of this project. The research team will also present an outreach
workshop on the biochemistry of nutrition, through existing outreach mechanisms
in the University's Department of Chemistry.
