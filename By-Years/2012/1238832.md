The primary objective of the Drosophila Neurobiology: Genes, Circuits & Behavior
course is to provide state-of-the-art training in modern and emerging
experimental approaches to study the nervous system of a major invertebrate
model system, Drosophila melanogaster. The course is designed to introduce
students to a wide variety of topics and techniques, including the latest
approaches to study fly nervous system development, connectivity and behavior.
Daily research seminars present comprehensive overviews of specific subfields of
nervous system function and behavior, or focus on specific techniques and
approaches to study diverse aspects of fly neurobiology. The course takes full
advantage of the genetics of the fly as an experimental system for analyzing
neural development, neuronal physiology and behavior. The course emphasizes the
relevance of this powerful model system to advancing our understanding of the
function and dysfunction of human brain. Significant emphasis will be placed on
the disruption and reorganization of neural circuits upon chronic exposure to
alcohol and drugs of abuse.

The broader impact of the course is the training of researchers from throughout
the world in the most recent findings and techniques in Drosophila neurobiology.
In addition, they are introduced to the available resources and tools of
advanced research in fly neurobiology. The students are chosen to include those
who will disseminate information acquired in the course most broadly. Many of
the students are likely to have educational and supervisory responsibilities in
the near future; others are already professors or post-doctoral fellows, who
will pass on what they have learned in the course. Many of the students who take
the course go on to lead their own laboratories and the course provides a
foundation of knowledge for these new lab heads.
