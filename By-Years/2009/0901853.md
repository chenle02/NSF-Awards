This project concerns several aspects of invariant descriptive set theory and
its applications to classification problems in mathematics. Gao studies the
structures of large Polish groups such as Graev metric groups and the isometry
group of the universal Urysohn space. In this project both the problem of
surjectively universal Polish groups and the notion of group involvement will be
studied. Another objective of the project concerns countable group actions that
are likely to generate hyperfinite equivalence relations. For this objective Gao
and Jackson will work collaboratively. The focus will be on universal actions of
countable solvable groups. For applications of invariant descriptive set theory
the PI proposes to study the uniform classification problem for separable Banach
spaces as a part of the current project. This involves further collaborations
with other experts in Banach space theory.

Invariant descriptive set theory is a structural complexity theory for
equivalence relations arising in logic and mathematics. Many significant
problems in mathematics ask for satisfactory classification of mathematical
objects. These classification problems can be viewed as equivalence relations,
allowing the framework of invariant descriptive set theory to be applied. In the
recent years invariant descriptive set theory has been greatly advanced and
successfully applied to obtain an understanding of the complexity of many
meaningful mathematical classification problems. This project seeks further
development of the theory and its applications. The topics investigated in this
project are interdisciplinary and bring together concepts, methods, and
techniques from different areas of mathematics and logic.
