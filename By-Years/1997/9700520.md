Abramovich 9700520 In this project, the principal investigator will study
semistable reduction problems, making use of the Alteration method of de Jong,
the Torifying Blowup of Abramovich and de Jong, and Toroidal Geometry of Kempf,
Knudsen, Mumford and Saint-Donat. He will work on generalizing his results on
fibered powers to the logarithmic case, and continue the study of stably
integral points on abelian varieties, using the compactified moduli spaces of
Alexeev and Nakamura. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful having
recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences
are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern
computers and compact disks.
