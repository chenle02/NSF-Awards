Funds are requested to support an American Society for Cell Biology Summer
Conference on the "Biology of Plant and Animal Extracellular Matrix", to be held
from June 9-13, 1990 at the Airlie House near Warrenton, VA. The extracellular
matrix of animal cells, once considered mainly in structural terms, is now known
to play important roles in development, homeostasis, repair, cell migration, and
control of prolifereation. Over the past 10 years it has become clear that the
extracellular matrix (cell wall) of plants not only performs many of these same
functions, but also contains structural/functional counterparts. Thus, animal
collagens and plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), though un related
evolutionarily, represent similar solutions to similar biophysical problems, as
do the complex carbohydrate polymers that comprise a large proportion of both
kinds of matrix. In addition, recent evidence for the existence of plant
intergrins and their potential role in cell wall formation indicates that
membrane-ECM interaction are mechanistically linked across large phylogenetic
distances. With recent development of new methods and systems for studies of
plant and animal matrix recognition/assembly, and regulation of matrix gene
expression, and the realization that many common principles are likely to exist,
an interdisciplinary conference that brings investigators together to studying
plant and animal matrix biology would be very timely. The meeting will include a
PLenary Lecture, and ten platform sessions, spread over three and one half days,
in a meeting designed to accomodate 150-300 people. In addition, there will be
afternoon/evening poster session designed to encourage maximal interaction among
participants. This is a timely and important conference, which is likely to lead
to new and fruitful collaborations and insights.
