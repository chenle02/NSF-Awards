The Dimensions Program

Discipline: Mathematical Sciences (21)

"The Dimensions Program" is creating new learning materials by adding contextual
information to application problems to help pre-algebra students understand how
mathematics is used to relate to the world around us. The first, second, and
third geometrical dimensions are a unifying theme for the six STEM projects
being developed, each comprised of a half dozen unique laboratory activities and
association question-banks. The application contexts of these six projects have
been identified through research on labor market needs, local business and
industry, and national developing technology.

Seven community colleges are involved with the development of the learning
resources. The materials are being tested for usability and effectiveness in
community college pre-algebra courses. The evaluation of these materials
includes using pre and post tests to document changes in students' geometric
understanding and in their attitudes toward learning mathematics. An electronic
Resource Book of projects, laboratories, and supplemental questions is being
published on the web for a broad dissemination of these easily implemental
projects and corresponding laboratories. The first chapter of this Resource Book
is designed to help teachers know the best educational practices for
implementing these materials in the classroom.
