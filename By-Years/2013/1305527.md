Understanding the breakup of atoms and molecules remains a formidable task.
Complex experiments using free electron lasers at SLAC in California and at DESY
in Germany, or low energy antiproton beams at CERN in Switzerland, are a
challenge to explain for modern theoretical methods using massively parallel
supercomputers. Our project will provide new insights into the quantal dynamics
found in the photon electron, and antiproton ionization of atoms like He, Li,
and Mg, as well as molecules like H2 and Li2.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since atomic
and molecular processes are present in most physical phenomena, ranging from
astronomical observations of the early universe to laboratory production of
microchips a more complete understanding of the few body dynamics of atoms and
molecules can lead to a wealth of new scientific discoveries.
