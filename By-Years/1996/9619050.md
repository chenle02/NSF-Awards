9619050 Selfe This three year project is an outgrowth of an existing project
with the University of Washington. It proposes to provide 25 teachers each who
either are Native Americans or teach largely Native American children on or near
the reservations. The project will provide four week enhancement activities in
chemistry and other disciplines within the context of current environmental
issues of importance to the tribal communities. The primary area of interest and
the basis of the enhancement activities are environmental issues. The PI has
clearly addressed concerns with the learning styles of Native American children.
All activities with teachers will model effective pedagogy. The teachers will
work directly with secondary school students to determine how well their methods
work in a classroom environment. These students are/will be a part of a
companion program not funded by this project. The project director is a Native
American and a teacher. Extensive follow-up during the academic year as well as
electronic communication using computer systems donated by other groups. A cost
share of gifts-in-kind will bring the total up to approximately 28% of the award
amount.
