The Synthetic Organic Program will support the research of Dr. Robert West of
the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dr. West
will continue his innovative studies of compounds compounds containing silicon,
with a focus on compounds containing multiply-bonded silicon. The new types of
multiply-bonded silicon compounds that will be synthesized and characterized
include disilynes, silynes, silanamidides, silandiimines, sila(iso)nitriles and
1,2-disilabenzenes.
