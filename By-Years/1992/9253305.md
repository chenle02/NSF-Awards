The California Institute of Technology will develop and deliver through a
collaborative effort by scientists, teacher- educators, and master teachers, a
one-semester course for the elementary teacher education program. Future
elementary teachers will construct their own science knowledge and work
cooperatively in a "hands on" science classroom environment. These prospective
teachers will do challenging investigations with sophisticated tools while
modeling good science teaching. Simultaneously, the course will provide a solid
foundation in fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, physics and earth
science. The course will be integrated into the elementary science teacher
program.
