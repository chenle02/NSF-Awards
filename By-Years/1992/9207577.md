Several intriguing hypotheses have been proposed regarding large-scale temporal
patterns of morphological diversity in the history of clades, particularly those
originating in the early Paleozoic. However, the testing of evolutionary
hypotheses regarding diversity has either used taxonomic diversity as a proxy
for morphological diversity, or focused on patterns at relatively small scales.
The proposed research will investigate temporal patterns of morphological
diversity in large clades of Paleozoic echinoderms, Class Crinoidea, as well as
in smaller clades. Specifically, it will be determined whether morphological
diversity is concentrated early in the history of a clade, and whether there are
temporally directed differences between morphological and taxonomic diversity.
Morphological diversity will be measured directly, using dissimilarity measures
based on discrete-character data. These data will be collected from published
species descriptions as well as museum specimens. The approach adopted for
quantifying morphology will allow direct documentation of morphological
diversity patterns at a broader taxonomic scale than has heretofore been
practiced, and will therefore provide important new data relevant to major
questions of interest in evolutionary biology.
