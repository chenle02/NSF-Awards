OISE-0812104 (Spencer, University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign)&lt;br/&gt;?Smart Structures Technology Summer
School?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a
series of three 3-week international Summer Schools in the design and
construction of smart structures. The schools will provide students with
multidisciplinary training in key areas related to smart structures: structural
dynamics, control systems, circuit technology, wireless technology, and
informatics. In addition, they will familiarize students with forefront research
related to smart structures technology in participating countries. The Summer
Schools will be held in Korea in 2008, the US in 2009, and Japan in 2010 and
will involve approximately ten graduate students in civil and mechanical
engineering from each of the participating countries. The program of each school
includes coursework, labs and site visits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is a
collaboration among PI Spencer, C.B. Yun, professor and director of the Smart
Infra-Structure Technology Center (SISTeC) of the Korea Advanced Institute of
Science and Technology (KAIST) in Korea; Yozo Fujino, head of the Bridge
Engineering Laboratory at University of Tokyo in Japan; and Guo-Qiang Li,
professor of structural engineering at Tongji University in China. It is
expected that the schools will create an environment in which highly motivated
students, faculty, and professionals will be able to establish lasting
international collaborative arrangements. The NSF award, jointly funded by the
Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Civil,
Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation in the Directorate for Engineering,
supports the U.S. side of the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
