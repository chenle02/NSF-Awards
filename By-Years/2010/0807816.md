In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the
goals are to understand the role played by fluctuating chemical equilibrium in
developing signals at nanostructured chemical sensors; and to use this
understanding to develop new electrochemical routes to chemical sensing and to
fabricating stimulus-responsive structures. A key characteristic of
nanostructures is the role played by fluctuations in populations of reactants
and products at equilibrium - fluctuations that are significant only when the
number of molecules participating in the reaction is small. This project
addresses these fundamental issues of chemical reactivity by first developing
robust fabrication methods to produce atom-scale junctions (ASJs) - metallic
wires a few atoms wide. Then, the ASJs are used to study fluctuating adsorption
and desorption of electron donor molecules and electrochemical processes that
can be used either for chemical sensing or to template nanoscale patterns into
supermolecular architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the
project will be felt principally through human resource development. Ongoing
activities such as the Beginning Faculty Workshop at PittCon and the Summer
Program at Clark Atlanta University will be continued. In addition, a
substantial international experience for graduate students will be developed as
part of the project. The students will collaborate with members of the Life
Sciences Interface group at the Tyndall National Institute (TNI) in Cork,
Ireland and will spend up to 30 days each year at the TNI. The success of the
proposed international component will be judged by the number of jointly
authored conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications, how
effectively the seed funding is leveraged to obtain funding for follow-on joint
efforts between the two labs and by exit interviews.
