Computer Science (31)

This project is to run a pair of one-day workshops on qualitative research
methods, for use in computer science education research. Computer science
education researchers examine issues such as overall retention, retention of
women and minorities, ways students understand or fail to understand key
concepts, effective teaching techniques, and other issues relating to teaching
and learning computer science. Both qualitative and quantitative research
methods are important in educational research. However, the typical computer
science researcher is only comfortable with quantitative methods and has had
little or no exposure to qualitative ones.

These workshops provide active computer science education researchers with a
short course in two or three qualitative research methods. The first workshop
covers the theory, and teaches participants how to design and conduct studies
that involve qualitative techniques. Participants design and implement small
qualitative research projects between the two workshops.

Intellectual merit: This project takes well-trained computing researchers and
expands their repertoire of research techniques by bringing in an expert in
qualitative research methodologies to provide guidance.

Broader impacts: Participants improve their ability to collect and analyze
qualitative data. This improves the overall quality of research in computer
science education. Naturally, an increase in quality of computer science
education research leads to an increase in quality of computer science education
practice, pedagogy and curriculum.
