0216066 Thompson This proposal is for the acquisition of instrumentation that
can be used to measure the carbon-14 isotope. The equipment will support
undergraduate research activities in Seattle University's Department of Civil
and Environmental Engineering. The research activities discussed in this
proposal seek to study uptake and transformation of the explosives RDX
(hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-
tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) by plants. The requested equipment will enable
mass balances on [U- 14 C]RDX and [U- 14 C]HMX to be performed which will in
turn determine the transport and fate of the explosives in plant tissues.
Previous plant uptake studies with RDX and HMX have indicated an undesirable
tendency to accumulate in the leaves of plant tissues with slow rates of
transformation. This project will explore two ways in which to decrease RDX and
HMX accumulation in plants and thus increase the applicability of
phytoremediation of these compounds.
