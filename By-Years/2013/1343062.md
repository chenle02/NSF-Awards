This grant supports travel of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers,
junior faculty, and under-represented participants to attend the conference
entitled ?Active Fluids: Bridging Complex Fluids and Biofluids? from January 27-
February 1, 2014 at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colorado. Research in
active fluids is multidisciplinary, encompassing many branches in physics,
mathematics, and engineering, including fluid mechanics, hard and soft condensed
matter physics, polymer physics and engineering, continuum mechanics, complex
fluids, biologically inspired engineering, statistical physics, and high-
performance computing. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas
among researchers with an interest in the areas of complex and non-Newtonian
fluids on one hand, and biological fluids on the other, within the common theme
of active fluids. The schedule consists of informal in-depth lectures and
discussions, with a large number of contributed oral and poster presentations.
The scope includes but is not restricted to addressing questions such as: How to
model active fluids? How to experimentally capture the range of time and length
scales in prototypical active fluids? How to adapt these techniques to the study
of active matter which typically requires resolution at both the nano scale and
at the continuum level?

Approximately 85-100 participants in total are anticipated. The broader impacts
of the Conference include forming a nucleus of new contacts and collaborations
that could potentially result in future transformative works, raising awareness
in a variety of key scientific communities regarding the state-of-the-art
techniques with great potential in biofluidic studies, providing novel insights
about the role of fluid dynamics in biomedical applications, and envisioning new
scenarios to address environmental concerns.
