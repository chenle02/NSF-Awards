Documenting the variability in climate on the century and millenial time scales
remains an important goal because this frequency band is the least understood of
the climate system. The goal of this project is to characterize the variability
in monsoonal upwelling during the last 40,000 years at these high frequencies.
The approach uses standard techniques: a terrestrial pollen indicator of
monsoons and a marine foraminiferal indicator of monsoons will be measured in
samples from a very high sedimentation rate core recovered on the Oman margin.
Chronological control will be obtained from high precision radiocarbon
measurements. The results of this project will provide us with important
information on the frequency and variability of climate change in the tropics.
When compared with other tropical and extratropical paleoclimate records, a more
complete picture of century and millenial climate variability will emerge.
