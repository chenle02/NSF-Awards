The researchers conduct millimeter-wavelength interferometry of CO (and related
isotopologues) gas and dust emission from circumstellar disks that are at
different stages of growth. The PI and his research team will also model the
molecular chemistry and radiative transfer for each disk in order to estimate
mass as a function of time. The new mass estimates will be used to constrain
models of disk and planetary formation and evolution. He plans to use the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) on Mauna Kea, and ALMA. A graduate student at
University of Hawaii-Manoa, undergraduate student at University of Hawaii at
Hilo and student in the Research Experiences for Undergraudates (REU) summer
program will also participate in the research.
