The Rochester Institute of Technology will implement a small focused research
project that is designed to provide a better understanding of how academic
content and communication skills transfer into the entry-level workforce. It is
adapting foundational research on learning in an academic setting to the
workplace and provides multiple perspectives of the "skills gap" between higher
education and the workplace. Specifically, the researchers propose to examine
the use of mathematics, optics, and physics content knowledge and communication
skills within the Rochester-region optics, photonics, and imaging community.
They will conduct two interrelated studies. The first study will produce
evidence about the skills required to obtain, keep, and succeed at a job in
optics with immediate relevance to local colleges and universities focused on
optics education. The second study will expand on the first by examining the
employee perspective in more detail. The PIs will use data-based deduction
research to integrate the two studies within a higher education framework. The
project will reveal differences in skill sets between academia and industry and
provide evidence regarding whether or not a common curricula can serve each
path. Rochester is an ideal location for the study. Xerox, Kodak, and Bausch and
Lomb made Rochester the optics and imaging hub in the nation.
