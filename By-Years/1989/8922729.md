This proposal supports a conference on the topic of Geometric Modeling and
Design to be held at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI on May 6-8, 1990. The
following areas will be addressed: continuity of parametric surface patches, the
emerging role of algebraic geometry in geometric modeling and design, and
numerical control machining and toolpath planning. One important aspect of this
conference is its effort to bring together industry, especially the auto
industry, and academia to collaborate on geometric modeling and design problems
of mutual interest.
