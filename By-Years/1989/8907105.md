Investigations of the local structure about defect atoms in several lightly
doped materials with the emphasis on the continued study of off-center systems
and the conditions for off- center behavior. The paraelectric-paraelastic
tunneling centers represent ideal test systems for understanding low temperature
tunneling behavior. Paraelectric resonance, dielectric constant measurements,
and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) studies will be made on
systems such as KCL with substitutional Li ions, NaBr with substitutional F
ions, and KI with substitutional Ag ions as a function of hydrostatic pressure.
Pressure moves the off-center defects back on center and leads to information
relating to the conditions for the off- center displacement. It is also hoped to
study off-center defects at much higher concentrations above the solubility
limits as a function of temperature. It is hoped this work will have some
connection to tunneling behavior in glasses.
