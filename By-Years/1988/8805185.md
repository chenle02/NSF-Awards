Description: This project supports participation by 10 Indian scientists and one
Egyptian scientist in the 10th Conference on the Application of Accelerators in
Research and Industry. The conference is designed to review current and planned
industrial applications of accelerator developments and emphasizes the many
connections between basic accelerator research and applications. Scope: The
series of conferences on applications of accelerator technology has grown in
importance. The exposure of foreign scientists is important to their countries
and helps U.S. scientists and industries in their dealings with these countries.
