This research will study various aspects of the solutions of nonlinear
stochastic differential and difference equations. Among the problems to be
viewed are the asymptotics and the distribution of the solutions to these
equations. An attempt will be made to find ways to estimate the coefficients of
the equations. A closely related problem of filtering will be considered as
well. Monte Carlo simulations and optimization will be employed.
