This research project is to create new statistical models and methods for the
analysis of hierarchical functional data. In particular the investigator
proposes a novel methodological framework for fast and robust inferential tools
when the true data generating process accounts for complex correlation
mechanisms that mimic and represent true biological structures. The project has
the following aims. (a). To develop a new methodological framework for the
analysis of hierarchical univariate functional data when the functions at the
lowest level of hierarchy are correlated. Understanding and quantifying the
dependence structure between these functions is of scientific importance. (b).
To extend the developed methodology to the analysis of multivariate functional
data. (c). To propose new inferential methods for group means and differences
between group means when functional data have a natural hierarchical and spatial
structure.

Modern research data have become increasingly complex, raising non-traditional
modeling and inferential challenges. In particular, advancements in technology
and computation have made recording and processing of functional data possible.
An increasing number of scientific experiments record hierarchical functional
data with complex dependence structures. Although the proposed research was
motivated by data from a colon cancer experimental study, correlated functional
data arise in many areas of research. The statistical methods developed in this
proposal are timely and important and will be relevant to many new data sets,
where the object of inference are functions or images that remain dependent even
after conditioning on the subject on which they are measured. Such data are
collected in engineering and climate modeling among others. In contrast with
other published methods, the methodology proposed here is computationally
efficient and it scales well to moderate and large data sets.
