String Matching is one of the fundamental and most studied problems in computer
science. In contrast, multidimensional matching proved more difficult to tackle.
However, multidimensional pattern matching is central to many important
applications, from multimedia to computational molecular biology. This research
develops a theory of multidimensional matching, involving new insights into the
nature of multidimensional matching, and results such as the following: better
serial and parallel algorithms for exact multidimensional matching; efficient
algorithms for rotations and approximate matching; and efficient algorithms for
approximate dictionary matching. Several of the algorithms have been implemented
in some practical application systems.
