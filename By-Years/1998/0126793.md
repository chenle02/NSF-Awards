Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing,
evaluating, and disseminating web-based modules for courses on numerical methods
and for upper-level engineering courses using numerical methods. The two
prototype modules concern nonlinear equations and interpolation. The modules
allow user-customization of content based on engineering major and mathematical
package used. The effort provides the basis for a full development proposal
focusing on eight mathematical procedures taught in typical undergraduate
numerical analysis courses. The project includes an evaluation study to compare
the performance of students who have and have not used the modules on specially
designed tests. Dissemination efforts include posting material on the course web
page and on web site hubs for mathematical packages and sharing the results at
engineering education conferences and in engineering education
journals.&lt;br/&gt;
