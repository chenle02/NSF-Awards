This grant permits Dr. Ambrose and his colleagues to conduct one season of
archaeological excavation at the site of Twilight Cave, located in the Naivasha
Basin of Kenya's Rift Valley. Previous work at the site has revealed a long and
well stratified sequence which extends from the Pleistocene (Ice Age) into
recent times. Continued work at the site should provide evidence for: the
antiquity of the Late Stone Age mesolithic tradition in East Africa and the
subsistence base of these hunter.gatherers; the cultural and adaptive changes
which accompanied the end of the Pleistocene; the age of the introduction of
pottery and domestic animals. With this information it should be possible to
determine the nature of subsistence and settlement patterns through time. These
goals with be accomplished through excavation and collection of faunal, cultural
and other biological remains. Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope
analyses of organic and inorganic fractions of bones and sediments should
provide insight into environmental change over time. The question of how hunters
and gatherers adapted to long term environmental fluxuation is of interest to
anthropologists. Consideration of this requires a detailed and long term
cultural sequence as well as good paleoenvironmental data. Sites which provide
such information . as Twilight Cave does . are rare and therefore valuable. This
research is important for the insights it will yield about how humans adapt at a
simple level of technology. It is also important because of the scientific ties
it will help build with Kenya. Dr. Ambrose has worked closely with Kenyan
scientists, helped to train them, and included them in his research. Because of
the important scientific materials which Kenya contains, it is valuable to
strengthen this bilateral relationship.
