The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric regions) program
carried out an extensive multi-instrumented collaborative campaign ( AIDA ) in
Puerto Rico in the Spring of 1989. This project is a combined
analytical/theoretical program focusing on mesospheric dynamics. Two
diagnostics, a meteor radar and an optical OH/O2 nightglow imager, were operated
during the campaign. Interpretation of these and a variety of other observations
made during the campaign will be made to test theoretical concepts on
atmospheric wave phenomena in the mesosphere. Theoretical work will involve
simulations with an existing numerical model of the propagation and breakdown of
large-amplitude waves in the upper mesosphere. *** //
