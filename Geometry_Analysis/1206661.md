The research activities supported by this award are in the field of geometric
analysis, and the specific problems posed are at the intersection of three
fields: partial differential equations, differential geometry, and mathematical
physics. For example, the functional determinant of an elliptic operator is a
problem originating in spectral theory and mathematical physics, and the
analysis of the particular problem considered is a variational problem leading
to a fourth order elliptic equation. The associated Lagrangian is unbounded, and
the existence of solutions and their qualitative properties is highly
nontrivial. Similar equations are used to model the properties of thin films.
Another problem proposed is the construction of Bach-flat metrics on four-
manifolds using surgery methods. The Bach tensor arises in general relativity
and conformal geometry, and the Bach-flat condition is the Euler-Lagrange
equation for a functional on the space of Riemannian metrics which is quadratic
in the curvature, and can be viewed as a nonlinear system of partial
differential equations with certain invariance properties. The final set of
problems we propose involves nonlinear equations arising in conformal geometry
and the theory of optimal transportation. We are specifically interested in the
construction of singular solutions of these equations as a way to study the
existence of complete Riemannian metrics with prescribed curvature conditions.

The interaction of geometry and analysis dates back to at least the eighteenth
century, and yet continues to be an important and highly active field of
mathematical research. The classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire
to understand certain properties of the physical world, and differential
geometry was developed to understand the geometry of curved spaces - for
example, the curvature of the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space by
matter as predicted by general relativity. In the same way that Descartes
realized that plane geometry can be studied using algebra, so differential
geometry can be studied using techniques from analysis, especially differential
equations. The research in this proposal involves disparate problems from
geometry and mathematical physics but are united by the role played by
mathematical analysis in their study.
