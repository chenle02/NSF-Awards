9725829 Farmer The precambrian and lower paleozoic continental crust of
southwestern United States has been involved in extensive paleozoic, Mesozoic
and Cenozoic deformation caused by a variety of plate interactions. Many large-
transport faults have been proposed for these younger events, but attempts to
prove or quantify them is hampered by the lack of knowledge of the original
spatial distribution of the older rocks. This project will utilize a new
approach to establish paleo-proximity of now separated terranes. Recent studies
have identified a 1.1 by granite with a very unique Nd isotopic signature,
erosion products of which can be identified in sediments deposited in the
suspect terranes. Proximity to this unique source can be estimated by looking
for l.1 by zircon detritus and the Nd spike in candidate sediments. Such data
from several key terranes will help establish their original spatial
relationship thus allowing the subsequent translations to be determined. Results
are expected to assist in resolving several regional problems in the
reconstruction of the southwest US craton.
