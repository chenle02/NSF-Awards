Lesley College and BBN Laboratories propose to organize an invited conference
series on the use of modeling in precollege education. The purpose is two-fold.
First, to significantly increase the level of communication among acknowledged
experts in the field - concerned teachers, educational researchers, curriculum
and software developers, and practicing mathematicians and scientists. The
second is to produce a research and planning agenda that policy makers can use
to prioritize funding of research and implementation projects. A small group of
key participants, representing teachers, researchers, developers, and
scientists, will form the steering committee to guide in the selection of
conference participants. The two conferences will be held one year apart, with
work groups established during the first conference to gather data for writing
the final guide for policy makers. Immediately after the first conference an
anthology of papers contributed by invitees will be published as a statement of
current understandings about using modeling and simulations in the precollege
environment.
