This San Diego State University (SDSU) Noyce Mathematics and Science Master-
Teaching Fellowship Program represents a focused and concerted effort to
identify effective mathematics and science teachers and provide them with
professional development experiences designed to further empower them to improve
their practices, serve as mentors for student teachers and novice teachers, and
become leaders at their school sites and districts. The program supports the
development of Master Teaching Fellows through three research-based phases: (a)
the improvement of the Fellows' classroom practices, (b) the development of the
Fellows' leadership skills, and (c) the opportunity for the Fellows to continue
to grow while they serve as mentors and teacher leaders. The partners are: SDSU
College of Sciences, the SDSU College of Education, the nonprofit organization
San Diego Science Alliance, three high-needs school districts and a public-
private venture with Qualcomm, Inc.'s commitment to support 10 of the 32 Master
Teaching Fellows' $10,000 stipends resulting in a corporate-sponsored grant of
$500,00 to the project. The Co-PIs support and investigate changes in the Master
Teaching Fellows' classroom practices and development as teacher leaders. The
project builds on previous work and is designed to support teachers in targeted
ways through three research-based phases, recruitment of strong, effective
mathematics and science teachers and investigate their changes in classroom
practice and in becoming teacher leaders. Long range sustainability is
programmed as SDSU's student teachers are to be placed with the Master Teaching
Fellows, providing, year after year, opportunities for SDSU's student teachers
(long after grant expiration) to receive support consistent with their
credential programs.
