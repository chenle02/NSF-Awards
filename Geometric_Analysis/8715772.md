David Barrett will work on various topics relating to function theoretic and
geometric properties of smooth bounded domains lying in n-dimensional complex
space and in more general manifolds. Several of the research topics concern
questions which are fairly well understood on domains which satisfy certain
positivity conditions on the Levi form but are poorly understood on more general
domains. The questions raised about approximation theory in standard function
spaces, regularity of the Bergman projection, and singularities of biholomorphic
and proper maps fall into this category. Barrett will also investigate problems
relating to domains and CR manifolds satisfying very strong conditions on the
Levi form. These include questions about global embedding of strictly
pseudoconvex three dimensional CR manifolds and about global properties of Levi-
flat hypersurfaces.
