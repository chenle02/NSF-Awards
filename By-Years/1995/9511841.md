Production of Videotape for Ethics Training of Students. This project will
produce a play and a videotape of the play for widespread use in classroom
instruction on science ethics. The play will address the most significant
ethical problems in science, including falsification of data, ownership of
intellectual information, harassment, and other problems which plague all of our
scientific establishments. The play has been read and used in its script form at
numerous universities and annual meetings of professional societies, and has the
potential for being widely used in ethics training programs as mandated by the
NIH and perhaps by other governmental agencies. More specifically, the objective
of this proposed project is to produce the play, using drama department
personnel and facilities, and to videotape the production for dissemination to
the widest possible audience. A workbook consisting of historical material and
discussion questions will accompany the videotape. The videotape will be tested,
revised, and made available through professional organizations and appropriate
newsletters. A demonstration will be conducted at the earliest meeting of the
Association for Practical and Professional Ethics.
