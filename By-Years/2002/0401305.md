The overall goal of this project is to develop GaN-based gas sensors at high
temperatures with improved sensitivity, response time, stability and
reliability. The outcome of this research program will provide technology that
will greatly enhance the capability of gas sensing in harsh environments. The
technical merit of this exploratory research for new gas sensing materials and
devices in harsh environments is as follows: (1) fundamental knowledge of the
gas sensing mechanisms and the physics of GaN-based devices; (2) fabrication of
GaN-based gas sensors for high temperature applications; and (3) advanced sensor
packaging technology for extremely high temperature applications.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new gas sensing technology will have great potentials
in energy and automobile industry for next generation of energy, and in defense
applications for anti-terrorism. The success of the project will provide
technology for research and development in compact, efficient fuel cell system.
This project will provide an environment where students can be trained in a
broader perspective of the research process, from device modeling, design,
fabrication, to device testing and package. Collaborative efforts required in
this project will allow students to broaden their research experience beyond the
norm by learning new techniques and participating in related research normally
outside their adviser's activities. Hence, students associated with this project
will be trained on state-of-the-art methods that will be cornerstones for their
future careers that will enhance the future infrastructure for research and
education. Research discoveries and results will be incorporated in the course
development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
