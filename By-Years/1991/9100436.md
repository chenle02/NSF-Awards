The goal of the conference is to facilitate description, discussion, and
documentation of current knowledge about precipitation scavenging and
atmosphere-surface exchange processes. The themes for the conference are
measurements of and models for scavenging and air-surface exchange processes,
adequacies of representations of these processes for current applications, and
requirements for applications to future problems, such as those associated with
atmospheric oxidants, hazardous wastes, and global environmental change. The
conference will be held in Richland, Washington, 15-19 July, 1991.
