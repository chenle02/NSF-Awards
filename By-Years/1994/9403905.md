9403905 Zakhar The scope of research to be undertaken by I. Zakharevich entails
the geometry and spectral analysis of the Riemann zeta function along with the
direct and inverse scattering transform with parameters. The research is
intimately linked with the theory of differential equations arising in many
mechanical and dynamical systems. ***
