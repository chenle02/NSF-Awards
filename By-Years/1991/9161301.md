Four of the most important surface analytical techniques for materials science
are: (1) Auger Electron Spectrometry, (2) X- ray Photo-electron Spectrometry,
(3) Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, and (4) Rutherford Backscattering
Spectrometry. While of widespread use, there has not been a concomitant increase
in their emphasis at educational institutions. The research effort in this
project is the creation of a Computer- Aided Instruction (CAI) laboratory
resource for surface analysis education. Instrumental, experimental, and
theoretical considerations for the techniques will be presented along with the
ability to design and conduct hypothetical experiments.
