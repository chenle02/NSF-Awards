This project deals with the dynamics of magma ascent in volatile-rich volcanic
systems such as Mount St. Helens. Petrological studies of natural samples are
used to obtain temperature, oxygen fugacity and dissolved volatile data for the
preeruption magmas. Projects planned for the next two years are: (1) A detailed
study of the magma dynamics during 1980 cryptodome formation at Mount St.
Helens, (2) An investigation of the changes in magma dynamics in the same system
over the 1985-86 period, (3) Experiments on plagioclase growth rates in wet
silicic magmas in collaboration with K. Cashman, and (4) Magma ascent rate
studies of two volcanic systems of contrasting composition and magmatic
properties, the Moat Rhyolites of Long Valley, Ca., and the Hawaiian basalts of
Crater Flats Nevada.
