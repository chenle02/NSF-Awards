This biodiversity survey project will complete the final, three- year phase of a
remarkable ten-year study that will document the plants of Costa Rica. The
manual will be published in English and Spanish and will include keys, diagrams,
descriptions and geographic distribution of the plant species. Simultaneously,
this data (checklists, keys, full treatments and illustrations) will be
available as a computerized database to scientists and students. Collaborators
in Costa Rica include scientists at INBio, the Museo Nacional and the
Organization for Tropical Studies. The data will be incorporated into a GIS
database at INBio. Representative plant collections for research and training of
students have been and will continue to be deposited at these institutions as
well a Missouri Botanical Garden. The manual and the on-line database will be an
essential biodiversity research and conservation reference for tropical
biologists and for biologists in Costa Rica and throughout Latin America. %%%
