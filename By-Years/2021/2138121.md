Marco Muzio is awarded an NSF Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending
Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a program of research and education
at the Pennsylvania State University. Muzio will use multi-messenger astronomy,
combining neutrino, gamma-ray, and particle detection to study the highest
energy events. Specifically, Muzio will use data from the Askaryan Radio Array
(ARA) to perform new, higher sensitivity studies related to very high-energy
(VHE) neutrinos above approximately 10 Petaelectronvolts. Along with the
research, Muzio will work with the Climate and Diversity Committee and others at
the university to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities at
both the postdoctoral and undergraduate levels. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Detection
of VHE neutrinos will address pressing questions in the study of ultrahigh
energy cosmic rays, including how their sources are distributed, what their
composition is, and if accelerators produce a substantial flux at energies at
length scales inaccessible through cosmic ray observations. Importantly,
neutrinos will address these questions in a hadronic interaction model-
independent way, sidestepping particle physics uncertainties that plague the
interpretation of cosmic ray data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
