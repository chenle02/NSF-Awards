The College of Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will
implement FORCES (Focus On Retention in Cohorts of Engineering Students) to
create two cohorts each with 21 engineering students supported by scholarships
in their freshman and sophomore years. FORCES cohort students will take classes
together and a peer counselor-taught class covering academic skills and
engineering topics. Additionally, the FORCES program will provide student
support academic activities during all semesters. The FORCES cohort program will
be open to all incoming freshman engineering majors with financial need who have
acceptable admission credentials and test ready for Pre-Calculus I; emphasis
will be placed on recruiting students historically underrepresented in
engineering.
