The focus of this research is to use the polymerization of ylides by trialkyl
boranes for the controlled synthesis of linear and cyclic hydrocarbon polymers.
The attributes of this methodology are the ability to control molecular weight,
to prepare functionalized polymethylene derivatives and novel architectures and
polymethylene copolymers. Because of the importance of the closely related
polyethylene, these functional materials have potential value as
compatibilizers, blending agents and surface
modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kenneth J. Shea of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Shea
will focus his work on the development of new polymerization reactions for the
preparation of substituted carbon backbone polymers. The development of new
catalysts for these reactions will contribute to the mechanistic understanding
of carbon-carbon forming reactions and can benefit both polymer and small
molecule synthesis. The research is also an excellent arena for the training of
graduate students.
