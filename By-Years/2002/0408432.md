Biological evolution occurs in a community context, and likewise, evolution
produces the&lt;br/&gt;differences (or similarities) among species that are
crucial to their coexistence. Yet despite the best efforts of leading
researchers, evolution and community ecology have developed largely as separate
disciplines. Because of recent advances in molecular phylogenetics and in the
analysis of community phylogenetic structure, the possibility of integrating our
understanding of the evolutionary history of taxa in ecological communities with
knowledge of the ecological structure of communities is becoming a reality. But
the techniques and ideas involved are still not widely known among mainstream
ecologists. As an initial attempt towards integrating ecological and
evolutionary perspectives, a symposium entitled "Phylogenetic approaches to
community ecology" will be convened at the Ecological Society of America's
annual meeting in 2004. The value of this symposium will be greatly increased by
the rapid publication of the talks in a special feature publication in the
journal Ecology, that is widely available. &lt;br/&gt;
