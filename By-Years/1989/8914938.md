The purposes of this research are to: 1). produce a physically based, testable
ice-stream resolving finite- element model of West Antarctic, 2). parameterize
important atmospheric and oceanic controls on ice-sheet mass balance (including
the possible ice-sheet topography/surface-airflow feedback), and 3). conduct
forecasts of West Antarctica's response to future "greenhouse" warming (and
comparisons with documented past behavior serving as confidence tests). Funds
are requested to support postdoctoral, graduate student and faculty salaries,
equipment, travel and computer support.
