9523483 Greenberg Recognizing that computer graphics and visualization have
become an essential part of the mainstream computing environment, this MRA, in
partnership with the Cornell Theory Center, will investigate one aspect of the
technology, and provide a forum for the community to exchange
information/ideas/studies. Global illumination solutions, pioneered by the
principal investigator will be further extended for parallel systems, and new
more efficient algorithms developed. These will be experimentally tested and
validated in a light measurement laboratory. A series of workshops will be held
at Cornell University to bring together academic and industry experts to provide
feedback and input to the project. These workshops will help determine
priorities and formats for providing data and documentation on the World Wide
Web.
