ABSTRACT: &lt;br/&gt;0241919&lt;br/&gt;Paulraj, Arogyaswami&lt;br/&gt;Stanford
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent work in multiple antenna communications
(MIMO systems) has cleverly exploited rich scattering in the environment to
build wireless links with multiple antennas that offer huge capacity gains.
Systems studied so far are narrowband systems. Use of very wideband signals
offers new ways to exploit rich scattering. Also, sensor systems that exploit
rich scattering have attracted little attention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research will explore multiple antenna signal processing applications
for wireless communications and sensor systems that use wideband signaling in a
rich scattering channel. Multiple antennas, wideband transmission and rich
scattering, each provide a number of leverages, which must be carefully
exploited. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While multiple antenna systems and rich
scattering provide increased capacity, diversity and sensitivity, wideband
transmission offers increased diversity, and, in the case of sensors, better
resolution. The proposed research will study: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1. Signal
processing in wireless communications and sensor systems. &lt;br/&gt;2.
Fundamental performance limits (ergodic/outage capacity, etc), space-time coding
and receiver design for multiple antenna communication systems with wideband
signaling in rich scattering environments. &lt;br/&gt;3. Fundamental limits to
resolution in sensor systems exploiting rich scattering and wideband
signaling&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
