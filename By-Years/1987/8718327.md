Raman spectroscopy enables the research chemist to study the structural features
of short-lived electronically excited states of molecules and thus compare these
structures with the corresponding ground states. Knowledge of these differences
allow the chemist to predict reactivity of molecules in a rational manner. This
award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will aid the Department of
Chemistry at Wabash College, a RUI institution, to acquire a Raman spectrometer.
The acquisition of the Raman spectrometer will enhance the research
opportunities for both faculty and undergraduate students at Wabash College. The
opportunities include studies in the following areas of chemistry: 1) Study of
the structures of short-lived intermediates containing bonds between transition
metals. 2) Study of the structural properties of intermediates formed during the
reactions of formyl/transition metal porphyrin complexes.
