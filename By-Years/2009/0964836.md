Despite the fact that mercury is well known to be dominantly associated with
particulates in aquatic systems, surprisingly little is known regarding how this
influences mercury methylation and transport in aquatic systems. Mining-impacted
areas in Ecuador provide unique opportunities to examine the role of colloids in
mercury transport due to the high levels of mercury in unlined mining
impoundments. This planning visit will lay a platform to explore the following
science questions: 1) Does association with colloids significantly alter the
transport distances of mercury in subsurface and surface aquatic systems? 2)
Does association with colloids significantly alter the rate or extent of
methylation of mercury in aquatic systems? Knowledge gained from this research
may help to mitigate mercury contamination in both U.S. and international
settings. The work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ximena Diaz of
Ecuador's National Polytechnic University, and will engage U.S. and Ecuadorian
graduate students in project development activities. This planning visit will
also support the development of two Ph.D. theses and one M.S. thesis by U.S.
grad students.
