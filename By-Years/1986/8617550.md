This project involves the experimental determination of the phase relations of
coexisting clinopyroxenes and (majorite) garnet at very high pressures (150-250
kbar) and temperatures (1300-2200 >C) in the system Na2O-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2.
Equilibrium compositions of coexisting C2/c clinopyroxene, majorite garnet, and
P21/c clinoenstatite will be determined, as will the high pressure stability
limit of the diopside- jadeite-enstatite C2/c clinopyroxene solid solution. The
results of these experiments will provide information on the phase relations in
sodium bearing systems at very high pressures and temperatures, on the mixing
properties of the C2/c clinopyroxene solution near its high pressure stability
limit, on the mixing properties of majorite garnet, and potentially on the
breakdown products of clinopyroxene (perovskite phases). This information will
test the feasibility of explaining the high seismic velocity gradients in the
transition zone of the earth's mantle by dissolution of C2/c clinopyroxene in
majorite garnet, and if confirmed, would place narrow constraints on the bulk
chemistry of the mantle in the transition zone.
