Abstract for award DMS-0400232 of Ramakrishna: The main purpose of this project
is to continue an investigation of the PI of mod p Galois representations,
p-adic Galois representations and their relations with problems in number theory
and arithmetic algebraic geometry. A particular emphasis will be the
understanding of how Selmer groups of various sorts change as more primes are
added to the ramification set. In one context this variation of Selmer groups
relates to how many `new at q' newforms there are congruent to a particular
oldform. The PI's research is in Algebraic Number Theory. This field has its
roots in the study of whole numbers and their various properties. A key tool in
the PI's research is Galois theory. Galois theory is the study of symmetries of
solutions of equations. The understanding of these symmetries shed slight on the
the solutions themselves, a basic mathematical question. An example of such a
symmetry is the fact that complex solutions to polynomial equations occur in
complex conjugate pairs.
