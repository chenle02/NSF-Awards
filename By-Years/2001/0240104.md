&lt;br/&gt;In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Bruce S. Hudson of Syracuse University
will investigate the nature of hydrogen bonding, with emphasis on short,
symmetric hydrogen bonds and the cooperative nature of hydrogen bond formation.
The major experimental techniques used are vibrational inelastic neutron
scattering (INS) spectroscopy and deep inelastic neutron scattering (DINS),
using the ISIS facility in the United Kingdom and that of the NIST Center for
Neutron Research. These techniques possess advantages over the commonly used
infrared and Raman spectroscopic methods: the spectral intensities are easily
and reliably computed from proposed nuclear dynamics, and the higher sensitivity
of INS spectroscopy to motions of hydrogen atoms relative to all other atoms,
including deuterium. Ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) modeling
methods will be used to compute the INS vibrational spectra and the DINS
scattering functions. The objective of this study is to establishment the limits
of validity of theoretical descriptions of hydrogen bonding in the organic solid
state. This is a necessary condition for the rational design of nanostructured
materials, nonlinear optical materials and organic electronic devices, for the
control of polymorphism in pharmaceuticals and in predicting the structures of
globular proteins or designing inhibitors of their
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and undergraduate students participate
in this research, as are postdoctoral research associates. The research will
lead to the development of fundamentals of hydrogen bond interaction in self-
assembling organic structures, which are the most important structure-specific
interactions that are in reversible equilibrium at room temperature under
ambient conditions.&lt;br/&gt;
