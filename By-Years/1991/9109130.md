This project is concerned with research in matrix theory. The principal
investigator will investigate spectral problems and matrix completion problems.
She will also study matrix completion problems and k-cyclic matrices. A matrix
is a rectangular array of objects. Given two matrices there is a notion of how
to add them and how to multiply them. This rather general setting turns out to
be useful in describing situations which arise in many areas of science.
