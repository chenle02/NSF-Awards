9617951 Clark Videodiscovery will design and produce a CD-ROM software engine
that will deliver a collection of science performance-based assessment tasks for
grades 5-8. The work will be modeled after another successful Videodiscovery
Project, Science Sleuths. The content of these tasks will be in line with the
National Science Education Standards, and include the use of video clips,
graphics, virtual tools for information gathering, and simulation techniques. A
sophisticated scoring system for scoring student performance will be embedded in
each performance event, thereby eliminating the need for time-consuming teacher
scoring and contributing to improved economy and reliability. Using this
technology to deliver performance assessments will overcome many of the
obstacles that prevent frequent and widespread use of performance tasks in test
settings. Well-designed, field-tested tasks that are delivered electronically,
will enable teachers to obtain frequent and ongoing feedback on student
performance and these tasks can enhance the opportunity for successful science
education reform.
