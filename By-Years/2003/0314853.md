The National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is reaching a major
milestone, its 25th anniversary. Created in 1977, NEHRP is comprised of four
agencies - the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology - that have complementary roles in furthering earthquake research
and application in the nation. This workshop is being organized by the National
Academies through its Natural Disasters Roundtable, which provides a venue for
researchers and policy makers to discuss key issues related to disaster
reduction and preparedness. The focus of the one- day workshop, which will be
held on February 20, 2003, will be on the accomplishments of the multi-agency
program since its inception and future challenges. The workshop will be open to
the public, and participants will be drawn from the research and practitioner
communities. A summary of the meeting will be made available to the public
through the National Academies web site.
