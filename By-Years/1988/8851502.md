This project introduces a state-of-the-art laboratory experience to students
whose concentration is in Polymer Engineering. The laboratory equipment
(Differential Scanning Calorimeter/Thermogravimetric Analyzer), permits students
to study and analyze polymer products that have recently been developed. This
award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
