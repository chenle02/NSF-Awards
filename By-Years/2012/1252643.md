The emerging wireless paradigm of dynamic spectrum access via cognitive radio
technology has been increasingly recognized for its great potential in
drastically enhancing spectrum utilization efficiency. The basic requirements of
cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are to protect licensed primary users and
provide reliable dynamic spectrum access to secondary cognitive users, which
give rise to a new fundamental issue in spectrum access related security. This
project develops a comprehensive security system that lays down a secure
backbone for CRNs that coexist with primary networks under various network
architectures and spectrum coexistence paradigms. The developed security
measures are coherently embedded into the entire CRN, from the very beginning of
the spectrum sensing stage to the dynamic spectrum access process until the data
communication stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Targeting three main sources of CRN
security vulnerability, our research objectives and thrusts include: 1)
systematically identify the unique primary user related attacks in CRNs and
develop a suite of attack detection and defense mechanisms; 2) develop secure
and robust strategies of dynamic spectrum access for benign cognitive users; 3)
design confidential and anonymous mechanisms to solve the distinct challenges in
privacy protection, taking full advantage of the unprecedented flexibility that
CRNs offer in dynamic spectrum utilization. This project lays out the foundation
for the development of enabling security technologies for the new paradigm of
dynamic spectrum sharing, which in turn can substantially improve the spectrum
utilization efficiency of wireless networks, offering a multitude of new
cognitive radio devices and wireless services with secure and reliable spectrum
access.
