This project will advance the development of an in-situ sensor package designed
to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of environmental parameters and
associated microbial communities within submarine hydrothermal systems. The
ultimate goals of this project are to determine under in-situ conditions the
upper temperature limit of life, what environmental parameters may promote
growth under these conditions and what consortia are present. This project
builds on the successful field testing of three prototype sulfide microbial
incubators within the Mothra and Main Endeavour vent fields on the Juan de Fuca
Ridge. Questions to be addressed include: What thermal gradients are present
within the walls of mature, diffusely venting edifices? What is the hydrogen
fugacity and oxidation state of fluids within the chimney walls? What is the
maximum growth and survival temperature of natural microbial communities and of
representative isolated cultures of hyperthermophiles within active vents? What
is the naturally occurring phylogenetic and physiological diversity of
hyperthermophiles in mature, diffusely venting sulfide structures?&lt;br/&gt;
