Research will be conducted on the movement of water soluble substances in
groundwater aquifers. Solutions will be sought for mathematical models that
describe solute-transport in homogeneous and layered aquifers. Results of this
research may be applied to the rehabilitation of aquifers that are chemically
contaminated and to problems of extracting thermal energy from geothermal
reservoirs.
