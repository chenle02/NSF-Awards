A request has been made for funding to help offset the costs of travel of
invited speakers from Eastern Europe and Russia, graduate student (USA) travel,
and publication costs in conjunction with the 12th International Symposium on
Plasma Chemistry (ISPC 12) to be held at the University of Minnesota on August
21-26, 1995. The ISPC serves as the primary international forum for researchers
in the areas of plasma chemistry and plasma processing. Topics ranging from the
basic physics and chemistry of discharges to the modeling of industrial plasma
processing and techniques will be covered. It is expected that the conference
will attract 500-700 participants, with representation from academia, industry,
and government laboratories. A strong effort is planned to attract researchers
from Eastern Europe and Russia. To that end a special workshop will be organized
which will highlight research areas in which they are in the forefront. This
particular aspect of the meeting makes it especially attractive since the U.S.
stands to gain much from such an interchange. Special arrangements will also be
made to encourage graduate student attendance by having reduced registration and
inexpensive dormitory lodgings and partial travel support available to them.
