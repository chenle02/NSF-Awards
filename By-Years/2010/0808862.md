Assessment/Research (91)&lt;br/&gt;This project is one component of a
collaborative effort to develop and pilot the National Statistics Teaching
Practice Survey (NSTPS), which is based on the Statistics Teaching Inventory,
which was designed as part of the NSF-funded ARTIST project (DUE-0206571). This
project is evaluating and refining the instrument and working with researchers
from other STEM disciplines to align this project with similar efforts in other
fields. A sister project (National Statistics Teaching Practice Survey: Planning
and online logistics) based at the Ohio State University is creating the
mechanism for administering the survey online, creating a data base and report
structure, and administering the instrument. Working jointly, the instrument is
to be used to gather and examine pilot data over multiple time points, including
settings where change is anticipated (e.g. in gauging instructional changes for
participants in a best practices workshop). Together these two projects are
preparing the way for follow on work to gather longitudinal data on the teaching
of STEM undergraduate courses in order to track changes over time and measure
the alignment of teaching with data-based recommendations for improvement in
teaching methods and materials. &lt;br/&gt;
