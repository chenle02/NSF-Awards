Texas A&M University plans to design and build a 256 processor, medium grain
parallel machine with as close to maximum floating point performance per dollar
as possible. This system, commonly referred to as a Beowulf cluster, will
require a modification of the usual paradigm in order to solve certain design
problems inherent in these systems. The cluster will contain 256 processors
consisting of 128 nodes using dual AMD motherboards, each with 1GB ECC DDR DRAM
and will be interconnected with Gigabit Ethernet to form one of the largest and
most powerful academic clusters. Components will be chosen to minimize cost
while maximizing performance. Novel techniques for mounting and cooling the
motherboards will be explored in an effort to maximize the density of the nodes.
Multiple operating environments will also be made available, allowing the end
user to determine which environment yields the peak performance for their
application. This machine will be used to solve a variety of computationally
intensive problems in the mathematical and physical sciences and support
researchers primarily located in chemistry, mathematics, physics and statistics.
One group, with a core in numerical analysis but with emphasis on fluid flowing
porous media, will also include researchers with expertise in oil recovery and
in groundwater flow (from Petroleum and from Agriculture Engineering) and in
parallel architectures (from Computer Science). In addition to problems in
large-scale computation, the groups will be solving problems in inverse
problems, nonparametric function estimation, statistical methods for
computational biology, quantum dynamics, high energy physics, inorganic and
organometallic systems, and polyatomic molecules.

This effort will also provide an educational benefit, both within the design
and the implementation stages. Mechanical Engineering will use the novel power
and cooling requirements of the system as source of activity in a senior design
class. Once the system is in place, the departments of Mathematics, Statistics
and Computer Science will provide courses in efficient utilization and
programming to allow maximum benefit to the designated research groups, as well
as the rest of the university community.
