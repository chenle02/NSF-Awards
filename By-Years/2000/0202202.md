&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and disseminating low-cost laboratory
apparatus and innovative, competency-based, activity-based, interdisciplinary
curriculum materials that integrate mathematics, science, and technology. The
project objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop four curriculum modules
incorporating 24 Authentic Learning Tasks to be distributed to high school and
community college faculty using inquiry-based activities that apply rigorous
mathematics and science to realistic technological tasks.&lt;br/&gt;2. Offer
four in-depth summer institutes based on the curriculum modules to 72 Ohio high
school and community college faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is
implemented in two major phases: Curriculum Development and Summer
Institutes.&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Four curriculum modules incorporating laboratory
apparatus and innovative, competency-based, activity-based learning through 24
Authentic Learning Tasks (a series of discrete learning events that build
experience and competencies related to the module's goals) are being created in
the following curriculum modules: Algebra, General Mathematics and Trigonometry,
Science/Physics, Technology and Electronics. Leading developers of hardware and
software are participating in this phase. &lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: A series of four
institutes are being offered for 72 mathematics, science, and technology high
school and two-year college faculty in Ohio. &lt;br/&gt;
