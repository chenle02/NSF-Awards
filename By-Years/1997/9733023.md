One of the important issues in particle physics in recent decades has been the
question of neutrino mass. To date, no experiment has clearly measured a
neutrino mass that is different from zero. This proposal can lead to approval of
an experiment that will make a definitive measurement in a mass region where
some indication of non- zero mass has been seen. In addition, this proposal
includes an education/outreach component that connects basic scientific research
with important applications in medicine.
