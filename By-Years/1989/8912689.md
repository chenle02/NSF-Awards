Research focusses on 3 major topics. 1. Element nucleosynthesis by nuclear
inelastic neutrino reactions in the mantle of a collapsing star. 2. Geochemical
methods for measuring the flux of astrophysical neutrinos, specifically the mean
galactic neutrino luminosity arising from stellar collapses. 3. The response and
significance of the proposed 127 I solar neutrino experiment.
