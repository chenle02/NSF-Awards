9523678 Fergusson This award supports a 24 month Science and Technology Agency
of Japan Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Neil Fergusson at the Mechanical
Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Tsukuba, Japan. Dr. Fergusson will work with Dr.
Nobuo Tanaka, senior scientist in the Vibration Engineering Division, on a
research project entitled, "Active Control of Distributed Parameter Systems."
The proposed research will entail the development of innovative control theory
techniques and mathematical systems, which, when implemented, provide the
engineer with hardware used to achieve a desired output in a particular dynamic
environment. With the recent invention of new techniques for the design of
controllers, a series of questions need to be explored concerning the reaction
of mechanics and materials in unique and changing structural conditions.
Therefore, in addition to theoretical research, Dr. Fergusson plans to research
applications of the new techniques to practical industrial problems which are of
current interest to the international engineering community. ***
