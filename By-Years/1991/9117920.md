Contrasting styles of deformation to some degree are commonly exhibited along
strike in orogens despite being developed in basically the same tectonic
setting. This proposal will investigate a particularly abrupt change in
Cretaceous deformation style along the western cratonic margin in Sonora, Mexico
that is represented by the ductilly deformed crystalline rocks in northwestern
Sonora and gravity-driven low-temperature slide masses in eastern Sonora.
Deformation in both areas is the consequence of Cretaceous convergence, and this
study is expected to illuminate the response of the crust to the tectonism.
Results may guide research in similar orogens showing along-strike changes in
tectonic style.
