9400255 Briggs Research supported by this grant is under the Arctic Systems
Science (ARCSS) Global Change Research Program and the Polar Earth Science
Program in the Office of Polar Programs. The research will be centered around a
unique and intensive, multidisciplinary research expedition to parts of the
Arctic Ocean that have never been extensively studied. The 1994 U.S./Canada
Arctic Ocean Section is a collaborative effort with Canada that will involve
approximately 60 scientists on a Canadian and a U.S. icebreaker during summer
1994. NSF-funded projects will focus on hydrography, biology, paleo-, and sea-
ice studies. Data collected will be amongst the first ever from several regions
of the Arctic Ocean and will be highly relevant to improving our understanding
of how the Arctic is an indicator of changing global climate conditions and how
it affects the physical, chemical, and biological features of the more temperate
oceans and regions. This work is a component of the collaborative
paleoceanographic program. Work will involve research on ostracodes contained in
sediment samples to be collected during the Section as well as from existing
surface sediments collected by the Geological Survey of Canada, from several
other Arctic Ocean sites, including the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago.
Ostracodes are small calcareous bivalved crustaceans, and some benthic marine
ostracodes are attuned, within narrow limits, to several environmental
variables, the most important of which are temperature, salinity, dissolved O2,
nutrients, and substrate. Their distribution on the sea floor therefore reflects
bottom water conditions, making ostracodes ideal monitors of water mass changes
and circulation anomalies through geological time. Previous investigations have
suggested that ostracodes are useful for paleoceanographic reconstructions of
water-mass history. This work will provide a better understanding of the
relationship between modern ostracodes, water masses, and Arctic bathymetry; of
the relationship between intermediate depth and deep water ostracodes and
Atlantic and Pacific faunas, and of faunal history and inferred ocean history
during the Holocene, the Last Glaciation, and possibly the whole of the Brunhes
Epoch.
