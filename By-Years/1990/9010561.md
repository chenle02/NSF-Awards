The fundamental surface chemical interactions involved in the epitaxial growth
of gallium arsenide from organometallic precursors are investigated using
molecular-beam scattering techniques and surface-sensitive probes such as
electron diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. Supersonic beam techniques
are a powerful means to probe adsorption, the prerequisite to epitaxy. Behavior
of the adsorbed intermediates on the surface, including reaction, diffusion, and
decomposition, are assessed by modulated beam techniques and by modulation of
surface temperature. Several crystallographic orientations are studied. Attempts
are made to synthesize adsorbed decomposition products such as hydrogen and
carbonaceous species in order to assess their influence on the growth kinetics
and the composition of the film. This work provides the fundamental information
needed to develop processes for more precise and uniform production of gallium
arsenide crystals for microelectronic applications. The data produced will also
find use in the simulation of existing processes employing epitaxial growth.
