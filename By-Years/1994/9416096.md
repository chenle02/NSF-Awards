ABSTRACT J. N. Newman MIT CTS-9416096 This project will develop new theoretical
and computational methods for analyzing the interaction of steep ocean waves
with offshore platforms, in the regime where the waves are relatively long but
their amplitude is comparable to the platform cross-sectional dimensions. This
will extend our recent analysis which is restricted to a single vertical
circular cylinder, and is expected to provide a quantitative understanding of
the phenomenon of `ringing' which has been encountered in experiments and
prototype measurements. Appropriate time-domain panel methods will be used to
solve for the first-order velocity potential in a prescribed incident wave
system. From this linear solution the forcing function for the third-order
potential will be computed on the free surface, and the resulting inhomogeneous
free-surface condition will be solved by a second application of the panel
method. In the latter application a relatively large number of free-surface
panels are required, and it will therefore be very effective to make use of the
Order-N Laplace solver FASTLAP. The corresponding wave loads and integrated
forces and moments will then be computed, both for simple and practical
structures, and compared with existing measurements.
