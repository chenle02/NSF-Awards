The principal investigator proposes to study the Smartville complex in the
northwestern Sierra Nevada to determine its thermal structure, constrain its
thermal history, and in general to test the hypothesis that metamorphic effects
at collisional continent-ocean margins are more the result of precollisional
phases of arc volcanism than of tectonic and thermal effects from the collision
itself. The study will focus on the chemistry and paragenesis of pumpellyite-
bearing rocks, and is to include determination of ferric: ferrous ratios in
pumpellyite itself as a critical component, as well as a detailed petrologic
study of the complex and a comparison with correlative 160 Ma rocks along the
length of the western Sierra Nevada.
