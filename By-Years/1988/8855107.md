The participants in the Horizons Program (HEP) at the University of Maryland
Baltimore County (UMBC) will develop skills, identify resources and gain
insights into a variety of science, mathematics and engineering careers. HEP
opportunities will provide participants with in-school as well as out-of-school
learning experiences that are predominately "out of the conventional classroom."
The goals of the Horizons Exploration Program will be achieved through four
themes that address biology, earth science, engineering, mathematics, physics,
chemistry and information management. Strong components from these disciplines
will be threaded throughout the project. Presenters will be highly competent in
their fields and believe that the targeted student population can learn the
material to be presented and benefit from the associated career exploration
activities. HEP will have a heavy emphasis on the applications of science and
mathematics in the careers examined, and participants will be exposed to careers
having varying educational and entry level requirements. HEP participants will
come from the Baltimore City Public Schools. HEP will involve 15 male and 15
female students who have completed eighth grade and are entering their first
year of high school. Acceptance is dependent upon interest and aptitude in
science and mathematics, an academic average of above 80, evidence of financial
need and potential for success. Particular attention has been made to include
parents of participants at appropriate junctures during both the summer and
school year agendas. HEP participants will reside in UMBC dormitory rooms during
the summer component of the project. During the school year the HEP participants
will continue to explore career options, develop science process skills and
conduct science investigations in a variety of settings and science disciplines.
