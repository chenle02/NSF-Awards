&lt;br/&gt;To foster cross-disciplinary interaction, a conference in
nanoparticles and nanostructure is planned for the period June 16-21, 2002 in
Barga, Italy. This is a relatively small conference being organized thought he
United Engineering Foundation. The conference title is "Nanoparticles and
Nanostructure Through Vapor Phase Synthesis." A mix of synthesis and
applications as, outlined below, are planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Thermal and
plasma synthesis of nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;- Particle Cluster formation and
growth processes&lt;br/&gt;- Advanced Characterization&lt;br/&gt;- Carbonaceous
nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;- Nanoparticle structure / property
relationships&lt;br/&gt;- Catalytic nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;- Nanostructures in
drug delivery and biological imaging&lt;br/&gt;- Electronic Devices (single
electron transistors)&lt;br/&gt;- Polymeric composite nanomaterials&lt;br/&gt;-
Other applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
