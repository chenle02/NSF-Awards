0933225&lt;br/&gt;Rajagopalan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Communication between
different cell types is essential for the proper function of many human organs.
What signals different cell types transfer between each other and how they
respond to these signals is far from completely understood. This project studies
the liver, which is one of the most important organs in the human body. Using a
discovery-driven and inter-disciplinary approach, the goal of this project is to
understand communications between the two main cell types in the liver, namely,
hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. The scientific objectives of
the project are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective I: Assemble three-
dimensional liver mimics composed of hepatocytes and endothelial cells and
collect temporal gene expression data using DNA
microarrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective II: Compute molecular interaction
networks that capture the response of hepatocytes and endothelial cells in liver
mimics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The transformative nature of
this project stems from the use of three-dimensional liver mimics to
systematically probe and untangle the complex phenomena underlying cellular
interactions in the liver. The integration of genome-wide transcriptional
measurements in such liver mimics with molecular interaction networks will
reveal the signals that mediate communications between hepatocytes and liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells. Together, these studies will lead to deeper
insights into the modes of interactions between cells types in the liver and
their role in the maintenance of adult liver
function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. A comprehensive understanding of
biomimetic spatial organization and choreographed communication between
different cell types has profound implications for tissue engineering.
Information gleaned from this project will provide a sound theoretical basis for
the design of the next generation of tissue-engineered livers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach to middle school students and to ethnically
diverse female high school students through summer camps sponsored by Virginia
Tech's Center for Enhancement in Engineering Diversity will introduce students
to the notion of interdisciplinary research and demonstrate how collaborative
advances in engineering and computer science can have a direct impact on human
health.
