9312986 Berndt A plasma spray apparatus with an axial feed torch will e
developed, and the production of nanoparticle and nanostructures from colloids
and powders will be investigated. A mass spectrometer will be used to analyze on
line gas composition and particle size distribution, as well as to form
nanostructured thin layers. The project objectives include basic understanding
of the interactions of colloids and powders with high temperature plasma gases,
and the optimization of a scalable plasma torch manufacturing process to produce
ultrafine particles and particle-based solid structures. This interdisciplinary
project is well supported by industry and the host university. Main outcomes
will be improving plasma torch processing, developing specific instrumentation,
and proposing suitable models for the corresponding physical and chemical
processes. The work is relevant to plasma spray development, ultrafine particle
generation at high production rates, and nanostructured coating. ***
