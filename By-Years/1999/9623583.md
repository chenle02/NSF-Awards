The focus of this research is threefold. First, methods will be developed for
the preparation of a new class of materials derived from condensation of amino
acids with both carboxy and amino termini of polymeric sialic acid oligomers.
Second, solid support methods will be developed for the preparation of a new
class of materials utilizing sialic acid as peptide equivalents. Third, the
solution phase conformation of these materials will be examined using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular modeling. Educational
activities involve a program in chemical education directed to developing
discovery based learning methods in organic chemistry. With this CAREER award,
the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and educational activities
of Dr. Jacqueline Gervay of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Arizona. Professor Gervay will focus her research efforts on developing
synthetic routes to novel materials that will selectively replace important
biological recognition processes. The synthetic targets include sialic acid
based oligomeric compounds that will disrupt protein-protein interactions
involving both helical and electrostatic interactions. Dr. Gervay's educational
activities involve a program in chemical education directed to developing
discovery based learning methods in organic chemistry.
