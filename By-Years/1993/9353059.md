9353059 Aliaga The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor seeks to provide an
innovative summer program in mathematics for 30 female students entering grade 9
in schools located in Detroit, Michigan. The program is a three-week summer
residential Young Scholars project in mathematics with follow-up activities
during the academic year. The program is designed to accomplish the following
objectives: enhance students' positive attitudes toward mathematics and
statistics; develop confidence in their potential in the field of mathematics;
encourage the female students to pursue careers in mathematics; and to
incorporate mathematical skills and thinking in their everyday lives. This will
be accomplished through classroom discussions, field trips and participation in
hands-on laboratory activities. Instructional classroom activities will be
conducted by professors from the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics on
the campus of the University of Michigan.
