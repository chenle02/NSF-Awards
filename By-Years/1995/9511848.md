The PI proposes to investigate learning and adaptive behavior in economic
environments. In particular, the PI hopes to develop game theory in order to
make it more descriptive of observed behavior. The PI has developed a model of
reinforcement learning which explains and organizes previously-collected data
from a variety of strategic environments. In addition, the PI has designed new
experiments to test this model and to distinguish it from other models of
economic behavior.
