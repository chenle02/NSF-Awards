It has been long recognized that the crust upon which the Cenozoic Andes
Mountains are founded have had a complex tectonothermal history that dates back
to the Precambrian. Testing of the applicability of recent regional theories to
the Chilenia area have been hampered because of the lack of a sufficient, up-to-
date, structural-petrologic database. This field project is a pioneering effort
that will gather critical new structural, timing, and petrologic data in this
important area. Results will have important implications for the geologic
development of South America and for the reconstruction of Gondwanaland.
