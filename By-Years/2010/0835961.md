This exploratory project will form the Central Texas Engineering Education
Collaborative which will leverage and scale existing proven program components
to strengthen the regional engineering pipeline. It will support current pre-
engineering programs in local high schools that encourage many students who may
not have thought of pursuing engineering careers to do so. In addition, the
Collaborative will recruit new industry volunteers to serve as mentors for
middle school teams participating in hands-on pre-engineering activities to
attract more students into these programs. Postsecondary engineering faculty
will work with local high school educators to compare curriculum and develop
articulation agreements to strengthen secondary to postsecondary engineering
pathways. The project will afford a much-needed opportunity to study how a
variety of secondary and post-secondary institutions, including traditional high
schools, tech-focused high schools, a community college system, a teaching
college, and a top-tier research university, can collaborate to improve
communication and vertical alignment of STEM educational and career
opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Collaborative addresses a critical need
for regional and state competitiveness. Central Texas is a recognized technology
and entrepreneurial hub, but remaining competitive requires providing a skilled
engineering workforce to local business and creating strategies that attract and
retain students traditionally underrepresented in higher education, particularly
in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;
