There are two major methods for image reconstruction from projections,
transform and finite dimensional. The transform methods ultimately yield the
picture pixel values as a convolution of the projection data with some weights
(filter). Finite dimensional methods discretize at the very beginning by
assuming a fixed set of basis pictures whose linear combination gives an
approximation to the image. The choice of coefficients in the linear combination
is determined by some optimization criterion. Current comercial CT-scan machines
and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) machines employ the transform methods in
image reconstruction. The reason for this is that transform based algorithms are
simpler and faster. Finite dimensional methods however, are more robust in data
collection geometries, noisy data or small number of views. This project
explores a finite dimensional method that is computationally competitive with
the transform methods and enables one to express the picture pixel values in
closed form. The essence of this approach is to use dynamic programming ideas to
express the optimization criterion as recurrence relations. One then solves
these recurrence relations and uses the solutions to obtain the pixel values of
the picture.
