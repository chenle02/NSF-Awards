A 3-manifold is, from one point of view, a description of a possible shape of
the universe. From another point of view, it is a possible symmetry group of
such a universe, generalizing the crystallographic groups used by chemists and
others. In this project, the Principal Investigator uses abstract and practical
algorithms, as well as more traditional mathematical techniques, to study
symmetry groups related to 3-manifold groups. The theorems and software that
will be produced should be useful to other investigators of 3-manifolds and
geometric group theory.

The Principal Investigator will work on two projects in Geometric Group Theory.
The first applies computer algorithms to understand (1) the set of virtually
geometric words in free groups and (2) the space of possible counterexamples to
the Simple Loop Conjecture. The second project will refine and expand our
understanding of group theoretic Dehn filling.
