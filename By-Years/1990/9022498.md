On September 11 & 12, 1991, the Engineer Manpower Commission of the American
Association of Engineering Societies will hold a major conference, "Engineers in
America's Future." The meeting will take place at Loew's L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in
Washington, D.C. It is expected to involve 150 to 200 participants from major
engineering employers, the Congress and other policymaking bodies, professional
societies, and the press. Emphasis has been placed on the recruitment of women
and minorities as presenters for this meeting. The meeting will begin with an
assessment of current predictions as to supply and demand for engineers. This
will be followed by a session examining some of the factors that will influence
engineering in the future, including technological changes as well as
demographic trends. Then, the meeting will turn to more detailed consideration
of these matters, in sessions devoted to implications of the trends for
policymaking at both the national level and at the level of employers of
engineers in industry, services, government and education.
