This award will be used to support the participating scientists from the United
States in a Synthetic Biology "Sandpit", which will be held at Airlie Conference
Center in Warrenton, Virginia from March 29 through April 3, 2009. The field of
Synthetic Biology is at a stage where many of its biological tools, analytical
methods engineering technologies are being developed; however, much of its broad
conceptual framework as well as its overarching goals, challenges and projects
remain undefined. The purpose of this workshop is to assemble a group of life,
physical and social scientists from the United States and Great Britain
(selected from applications submitted to an open call for participants) whose
interests and current work encompass the broad field of Synthetic Biology. By
combining the diverse outlooks and expertise of these participants, the ultimate
goal of the 5-day "sandpit" is to collectively identify the key challenges and
questions facing researchers in Synthetic Biology, and to chart the major
directions and potential funding areas of the field for the coming years.
&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact &lt;br/&gt;The sandpit activity is expected to foster
international and interdisciplinary collaborations within this emerging area of
scientific endeavor. The creation of opportunities for interfacing the social
sciences with core areas of biology, engineering and the math and physical
sciences will be an especially important aspect of this activity.
