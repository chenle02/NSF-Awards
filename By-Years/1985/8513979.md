The goal of this research is to develop an advanced model of metal machining.
This research will build on successful preliminary research employing a
Lagrangian elastic-plastic dynamic finite element-based model. this work will
couple the prior work with an Eulerian approach to handle the excessive grid
distortion in the metal curring shear zone. This research will result in a
coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian model which will include temperature effect and
strain-rate material properties. Material property data will be generated
experimentally for use in the model. Machining tests will be performed to
validate the model.
