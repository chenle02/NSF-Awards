Genetic stock centers are indispensible repositories of commonly used
laboratory organisms. These centers facilitate modern genetic, taxonomic and
biotechnological research by making available genetically defined strains and
species, thus providing a standardized set of living laboratory models for use
in both basic and applied research. In many cases, the stock centers also
maintain considerable amounts of data about the organisms they distribute,
including genetic maps, standardized allele designations, information on
availability of related organisms, and comprehensive bibliographies of research
publications on the organisms. For example, the most-cited biological
publication, describing the genetic map of the bacterium Escherichi coli, was
written by the Director of the E. coli genetic stock center, Dr. Barbara
Bachmann of Yale University. The growing magnitude and breadth of data
maintained at stock centers have begun to mandate that computers be used to keep
track of them. Consequently, a workshop on the topic "Computerization of Data
Bases for Genetic Stock Centers" will be held on August 25, 1988, as part of the
sixteenth International Congress of Genetics. The main aims of the workshop are
to discern the databasing needs of stock centers, to provide a forum for the
exchange of information on databases that have already been developed at various
stock centers, and to facilitate ultimate decisions on hardware and design of
software for such sites. Participants have been selected based on their
responsibilities for maintenance and distribution of genetically characterized
stocks of genetically important organisms and for their computer science
backgrounds. A summary of the workshop's findings will be published; it will
have great importance for stock center managers and will help NSF plan more
rationally its allocation of funds to current and future databasing efforts.
