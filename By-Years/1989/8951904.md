This project involves the acquisition of three data acquisition and signal
processing systems to assist in implementing an innovative approach in teaching
instrumentation to undergraduate students. The new approach addresses the need
to teach digital data acquisition and signal processing techniques such as:
concepts of dynamic system response, data sampling, leakage, aliasing,
transformation, and others to mechanical-engineering undergraduate students. In
the newly designed instrumentation curricula, spectrum analyzers are being used
much like oscilloscopes were used previously. The significance of this new
approach to undergraduate instrumentation is due to the fact that industry
heavily uses these techniques while they are not taught in the schools (at least
in mechanical-engineering curricula). These principles will be taught not only
in the class room environment but also through newly designed laboratory
experiments in two undergraduate instrumentation courses. The equipment will
provide the laboratories with three work stations consisting of personal
computer controllers, data acquisition and signal processing peripherals, and
appropriate signal condition and excitation hardware.
