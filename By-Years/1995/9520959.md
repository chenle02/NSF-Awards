This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division in
support of the research of Dr. Dennis Dougherty at the California Institute of
Technology. The research will continue Dougherty's efforts on the design,
synthesis, and characterization of model spin- coupled and di- and tri-radicals
based on complex heterocycles and/or radical ions where the spin-containing
moieties are connected by a ferromagnetic coupling unit which ensures that any
two or more spins linked through it will experience high spin ferromagnetic
coupling rather than low spin antiferromagnetic coupling. Meta-phenylene will be
the primary coupling unit. Radical systems which have high spin ground states
and a large energy gap to low spin excited states will be candidates for
assembly into highly cross linked organic networks with controlled topologies to
ensure favorable magnetic coupling. Strategies for building extended networks
will involve synthesizing closed shell polymers or networks, fully
characterizing them, and then introducing spins by a chemical or electrochemical
doping procedure. Magnetic properties will be characterized by variable
temperature SQUID magnetometry and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements.
This highly interdisciplinary research addresses fundamental issues of spin-spin
interactions in simple model polyradical systems and how they can be applied to
extended bulk organic magnets. Critical to the success of the project will be
band gap engineering which will assure high spin ground states at ambient
conditions. Magnetic materials are ubiquitous in modern technology. Organic
magnets will find potential applications in light weight motors and information
storage systems.
