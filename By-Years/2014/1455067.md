High power electronics is playing a vital role in rapid advancements in energy
generation, storage and transmission, hybrid automobile vehicles, defense, and
aerospace technologies. Wide bandgap semiconductor (WBGS) devices are the
leading contenders for high power electronics, but they operate at high current
densities requiring the rapid dissemination of heat. Current strategies for
thermal management of power electronics have limited efficacy due to their
reliance on bulky, multicomponent heat extraction strategies via multiple
interfaces with high thermal interface resistances. Therefore, there is a
critical need for a simplified commercial thermal management technology which
will enable direct extraction of heat from operating power electronics devices.
The lack of such a technology limits the operating conditions, reliability, and
efficiency of WBGS power electronic systems. This team proposes to address this
technological gap by commercializing a novel thermal management strategy based
on nanocrystalline diamond (NCD), which is an excellent thermal
conductor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rationale behind the proposed technology is
that: NCD possess high thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity making it
well-suited for thermal management of WBGS power electronics, extraction of heat
directly from a device (as opposed to heat extraction through a substrate) will
result in significant enhancements in efficiency, and higher heat extraction
efficiency leads to longer operating lifetimes, enables higher device density,
and reduced operating costs. The preliminary research consisting of experimental
and simulation studies has demonstrated proof-of-principle for the proposed
technology.
