Driver will study differential and integral calculus on path and loop spaces of
compact Riemannian manifolds. The long term goal is to develop Malliavin
calculus, Hodge and index type theorems for Wiener spaces of paths and loops on
curved manifolds. The specific problems include constructing path and loop space
valued Brownian motions by stochastic development using two-parameter stochastic
calculus, and investigating the existence of log-Sobolev inequalities for
different path and loop space measures. The project involves loop spaces. In the
special case of two dimensional manifold, the loop space is just the family of
all continuous closed paths on a surface which start at some fixed point. One
key idea is to construct a measure on these paths so that one can talk about the
"volume" of a set of paths and thus integrate over the loop space. This is
important for understanding the topology of loop spaces and has implications for
string theory in physics.
