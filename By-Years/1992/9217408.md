This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award will support the continuing
collaboration of five condensed-matter theorists: two from the U.S.--Leo Falicov
of the University of California at Berkeley and Mark Robbins of Johns Hopkins
University--and three from Brazil--Belita Koiller of the Pontifical Catholic
University in Rio de Janeiro, Helio Chacham of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais, and Roberto Os>rio of the Federal University of Bras>lia. The research
will focus on semiconductor alloys, fluid invasion of porous media, and
pressure-induced electronic phase transitions. The project extends previous
collaborative research in the U.S., while Koiller was on sabbatical at Johns
Hopkins. NSF support will allow the reciprocation of this collaboration, by
funding three trips by the U.S. side to work in Brazil. The project promotes
cost- effectiveness by teaming a total of five different institutions, two in
the U.S. and three in Brazil. Both the U.S. and Brazilian sides will contribute
expertise in condensed-matter physics theory in application to this important
research topic.
