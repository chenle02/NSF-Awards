This SBIR Phase II research project will develop energy-aware compiler
techniques to reduce power and energy consumption in microprocessors, without
affecting performance. A key principle behind this approach is to use
speculative information available at compile time to reduce power and energy
consumption. The key qualifier is speculative: the information does not have to
be provably correct. Speculative information that turns out to be correct will
enhance energy reduction; if it is incorrect, the worst that will happen is that
a penalty (in terms of energy) will have to be paid. The use of such speculative
compile-time information opens up a largely unexplored dimension in compilers
and computer architectures, to target energy
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few years, energy consumption by
computers has emerged as a major area of intellectual and commercial activity.
These techniques if successful will permit substantial savings in energy
consumption. The outcome of the proposed effort will not merely be a set of
products, but also a vastly increased understanding of the means by which
compile-time information can be exploited for energy savings. With the
increasing prevalence of battery-powered computing devices such as PDAs, mobile
telephones, and notebooks, power-aware computing is becoming increasingly
important commercially. &lt;br/&gt;
