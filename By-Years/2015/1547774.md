This grant will provide travel support to U.S. based graduate students to attend
IEEE GLOBECOM 2015 to be held in San Diego on 6 - 10 Dec 2015. IEEE GLOBECOM is
a premier international conference for the dissemination of state-of-the-art
communications and networking technologies and identifying future directions in
the research and development areas. It is one of two flagship conferences of the
IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc), together with IEEE ICC. This grant
encourages participation by students who would normally find it difficult to
attend. Women and minorities will be especially encouraged to apply. NSF support
is used exclusively to fund a group travel grant to subsidize junior
researchers. No NSF funds are used to conduct the
conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year IEEE GLOBECOM attracts about 3,000
submitted scientific papers and attracts roughly 2,000 leading scientists,
researchers and industry practitioners from all around the world. IEEE GLOBECOM
is therefore one of the most significant scientific events of the networking and
communications community, a must-attend event for scientists, researchers and
networking practitioners from industry and academia. It offers not only
technical paper presentations but also a wide range of other educational
formats, including panels, tutorials, industry presentations, posters and
keynote speeches by academic and industry leaders. This student travel support
will enable sharing scientific information and stimulating research interests
for U.S. based students in the field of communications and networking.
