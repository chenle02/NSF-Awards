This Small Business innovation Research Phase I project is concerned with the
development of molecular tools for direct haplotyping of an individual's genomic
DNA without access to family or related individuals. For many questions in
population genetics, it is necessary to consider the arrangement of multiple
polymorphisms along either the maternally or paternally derived chromosome. Such
arrangement constitutes haplotypes, i.e., haploid genotypes. Classically,
haplotypes have been inferred from mammalian inheritance in families or from
statistical simulations of genotyping data. The overall aim of this project is
to develop molecular haplotyping reagents for several loci distributed
throughout the human genome. Phase I research objectives include the following.
First, development of a molecular haplotyping strategy based on allele-specific
extension and exonuclease VII degradation of single-stranded DNA resulting in a
hemyzygous double-stranded product. Second, application of the molecular
haplotyping strategy to targets in the CD4 gene and HOX2 cluster. Third,
molecular haplotyping at these targets of 100 human samples from African and
non-African populations. The development of haplotyping reagent kits will
accelerate the information gathering efforts of,the Human Genome Diversity (HGD)
initiative. The kits will be designed to be analytically robust and
operationally simple. In addition, the molecular haplotyping kits could be used
to supplement current databases on selected loci thus enhancing their value for
anthropologists and geneticists. The HGD provides the primary and immediate
market for this project, but applications in forensic science are also
practical.
