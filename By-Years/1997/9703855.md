9703855 Kulkarni This award provides support for a conference on algebraic
combinatorics and its applications. The conference is to be held at Oakland
University in May 1998. The organizers will focus thier activity on recent
developments and surveys in algebraic combinatorics. The organizers are making a
special effort to stress applications of algebraic combinatorics in commutative
algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, theoretical computer science, coding
theory, and mathematical physics. The organizers will encourage participation of
minorities, women and graduate students. This conference will provide a timely
opportunity for national and international experts in algebraic combinatorics to
participate in the active exchange of new ideas and techniques, and for young
researchers to broaden their horizons into applications of algebraic
combinatorics. This conference is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of
the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
