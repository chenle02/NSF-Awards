The modern study of rational points on curves has its origins in the mathematics
of the ancient Greeks, who studied whole number solutions to polynomial
equations. These equations can turn out to be tremendously tricky to solve,
sometimes resisting efforts for centuries. A numerical invariant -- the genus --
of the curve can reveal quite a bit about the fundamental nature of its set of
rational points. Indeed, in 1922, Mordell conjectured that the set of rational
points on curves of genus at least 2 is finite. This was proved nearly 60 years
later by Faltings. However, Faltings' proof does not explicitly construct the
finite set of rational points for these curves. Producing a constructive,
algorithmic version of Faltings' theorem remains a challenging open problem in
number theory.

The main aim of this project is to address this problem by giving new algorithms
for explicitly finding rational points on certain higher genus curves via tools
in iterated p-adic integration. The PI will combine theoretical machinery and
explicit computational techniques to prove results conjectured by the nonabelian
Chabauty program. Specifically, the PI will study methods situating the finite
set of rational points in a slightly larger finite set of p-adic points coming
from nonabelian Chabauty and will give practical algorithms for computing the
p-adic functions cutting out these p-adic points. To facilitate this, the PI
will use ideas from p-adic cohomology to produce fast algorithms for iterated
p-adic integration.
