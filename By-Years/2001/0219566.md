GOALI: Reflective Crack Control Treatment and Design Procedures:&lt;br/&gt;A New
Integrated Approach&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
0219566&lt;br/&gt;PIs: Glaucio H. Paulino, Philip Blankenship and William
Buttlar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The University of
Illinois will collaborate with researchers and staff from Koch Materials Company
to vigorously expand fundamental knowledge of damage mechanisms in reflective
crack control systems. The industry-academia partners will address the
aforementioned problem through an advanced laboratory testing and
instrumentation program, development of new models to field performance data. As
the industry partner to this venture, Koch Materials Company will provide: (1)
annual matching funds; (2) technical expertise, including access to field
installation and performance data; (3) laboratory and field materials for
laboratory testing at UIUC, and; (4) mentoring of UIUC students through extended
site visits at the national laboratory in Wichita, Kansas, and by serving on
doctoral thesis committees. Combined with the University of Illinois "Kent
Memorial Scholarship Fund," matching funds are proposed at a level of 168% of
the requested NSF GOALI funds. The computational and laboratory facilities
available at UIUC to bear upon the proposed research problem are truly world-
class, and include the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
and the Advance Transportation Research and Engineering Laboratory (ATREL). As a
result of the proposed three-way leveraging, the research team will consist of
two cross-discipline faculty members, three doctoral students, one undergraduate
research assistant per year, several industry researchers from Koch Materials
Company, and at least one student per year from the Summer Graduate Minority
Program hosted at ATREL, each summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
