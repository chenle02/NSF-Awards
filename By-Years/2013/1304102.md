The Irvine Valley College (IVC) Photonics Initiative is developing technician-
level professionals with the skills required to earn gainful employment
designing and building devices that interact with light. These optics and
photonics jobs are essential to our nation's economic and technical
competitiveness. This Initiative is combining OP-TEC's proven fundamental optics
and photonics courses with an electronics core curriculum to create a hands-on,
two-year Photonics Technology program. Reaching out to youth, veterans, and non-
traditional students, this project increases awareness of careers in photonics
through coursework, experiential learning, and internships that lead directly to
employment. IVC is establishing itself as the West Coast leader among OP-TEC's
network of Partner Colleges. The IVC Photonics Initiative supports regional
optics and photonics companies and encourages others to locate in the Western
United States. Current employees are acquiring competitive technical skills that
allow them to improve job performance and increase career opportunities. This
responsive, photonics-based collaborative creates a pipeline between IVC and
regional high schools, industries, and universities. IVC's Photonics Initiative
prepares graduates with STEM knowledge and skills that cross multiple
industries, lead to innovative applications in advanced technologies, and
contribute to an innovative and vibrant national economy.
