Accurate, low-computational-cost recognition of 3D objects having highly-
variable curved surfaces, or of the membership class of an object, or of a
deformable object, have been among the research topics most resistant to
satisfactory solution, and yet are necessary if reasonably general practical
machine vision is to become a reality. This research explores solutions to these
problems based on the unified use of patches of 3D surfaces and space curves
modeled by high-degree implicit polynomials, algebraic invariants, probability
distributions on the coefficient vectors for the polynomials, and asymptotic
minimum probability of error (i.e., Bayesian) recognizers. The implicit
polynomial curves and surfaces are generalizations of quadrics, and have much
greater representation power than do quadrics or superquadrics. The algebraic
invariants are functions of the polynomial coefficients having values that do
not change when the data is translated, rotated or scaled differently in two
different directions (i.e., an affine transformation). Among the intended
applications are service robots that must recognize and handle materials and
parts, service robots or machine vision systems that must interact with people,
and parts inspection for manufacturing automation. The techniques to be used
have received very little attention in the research literature, but now are the
subject of growing interest.
