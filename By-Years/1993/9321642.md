9321642 Davidson This project is the continuation of an investigation of the
transport of chemical trace elements and species from source regions through the
atmosphere to the Greenland ice sheet. Its goal is to provide information for
the interpretation of the trace element distribution in a long ice core being
obtained through the Greenland Ice Sheet Program (GISP-2) drilling effort. The
ice core is expected to provide a detailed record spanning 200,000 years. The
project has three specific objectives: (1) the identification of source regions
and atmospheric pathways for the chemical constituents reaching the drill site,
including the possible changes in air mass characteristics during transit, (2)
the study of the wet and dry deposition mechanisms and rates of incorporation of
chemical species into precipitating snow, and (3) the development of methods of
interpreting the deep ice core data. Prior field work has resulted in the
collecting of air, aerosol, precipitation, and deposited snow samples, which
will be analyzed for various anions and cations, trace elements, carbon
compounds, and trace gases. This project will emphasize the deposition
mechanisms. ***
