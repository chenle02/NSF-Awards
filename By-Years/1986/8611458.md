Convection produces significant amounts of precipitation in a wide variety of
atmospheric disturbances. In some places and times convection produces the
entire annual rainfall. Hydrologists, largely concerned with the structure and
evolution of observed rainfall patterns, have been successful in devising
statistical description of these events though unable to relate the latter to
the relevant physical processes in the atmosphere. Meteorologists on the other
hand, have devised various formulations of convection but often are unable to
compute or infer rainfall amounts at the ground in sufficient detail for
hydrological purposes. This research will combine these disparate approaches to
produce a stochastic model capable of relating the statistical results to
several known meteorological processes using an existing model of convection.
The results should not only illuminate the physics of mesoscale precipitation
but provide some measure of insight into the illusive character of how
convection modifies the near atmospheric environment. Such a model could account
for both the spatial structure and temporal evolution of convective rainfall.
The work will be jointly supported by the Meteorology Program and NASA.
