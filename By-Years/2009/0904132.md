This award will support the participation of US-based mathematicians, especially
women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in a workshop entitled
Computational Methods and Function Theory to be held June 8-12, 2009 at Bilkent
University in Ankara, Turkey. It will be co-funded by the NSF Office of
International Science and Engineering (OISE). This conference, which is to be
hosted by Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, has been endorsed by the Dean at
the University and financial support will also be applied for from TUBITAK.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference themes are Applied Complex Analysis,
Geometric Function Theory, Scientific Computation (including algorithms),
Clifford Analysis and Potential Theory. T he format of the conference is such
that young people will have ample opportunities to interact with senior
researchers A key purpose of this event is to promote the formation of
collaborations between the younger generation of American complex analysts and
their Asian and European counterparts.
