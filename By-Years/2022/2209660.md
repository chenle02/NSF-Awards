The broader impact/commercial potential of this Partnerships for Innovation
(Conference) project will be on the engagement of about 200 participants from
local community colleges and underrepresented backgrounds to learn about
concepts, processes and skills for business, innovation, and entrepreneurship as
well as inclusive practices, and on creating a template for a scalable platform
to foster inclusion and innovation and inspire future entrepreneurs and
innovators. The results of the project will be disseminated through
presentations and conference and journal
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will develop
a roadmap for inclusive technology development and commercialization.
Participants will build knowledge in invention, innovation, technology transfer
and entrepreneurship and will learn these skills in the spirit of inclusive
innovation practices. We envision this workshop as the first in a series that
will mitigate barriers to participation, enable a more inclusive innovation
ecosystem and serve as a platform in the preparation and development of future
entrepreneurs from diverse groups. The project team is uniquely qualified to
offer activities geared towards equitable access and diversification of
participation in innovation and entrepreneurship. The evaluation plan will
measure outcomes and provide data related to the participants and
activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
