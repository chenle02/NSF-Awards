9355481 Duerst "Hands-on, Minds-on, Hearts-on" is the theme of three years of
3-week Science Institutes for primary (K-3) teachers, with extensive academic
year follow-up. Three groups of thirty-six lead teachers from 15-19 schools in
rural school districts in east-central Minnesota and west-central Wisconsin will
each be involved for a two-year period. Initially, each group will participate
in a Summer Institute led collaboratively by two instructors from the University
of Wisconsin River Fall (UW-RF)with extensive outreach experience, one from the
College of Education and one from the College of Arts and Sciences. The teachers
will receive instruction in presenting hands-on activities and, even more
importantly, they will experience science learning and teaching from an inquiry
and conceptual change perspective as they explore, field-test, critique and
compare nationally recognized instructional materials. During the following
academic year, these lead teachers will field test selected modules in their own
classrooms, with support from the PIs. A Science Curriculum Lending Library will
be established for use by participating districts. The second summer the same
group will meet again for a week on the UW-RF campus to share experiences and
plan inservice workshops which they will conduct for the rest of the K-3
teachers in their own schools during the second academic year. Since most of the
targeted districts are in the transition state from traditional science teaching
to hands-on instruction, the teacher-participants will be prepared to play an
important role in the shaping of science education in this region. The cost
sharing for the project will be 23% of the NSF award. ***
