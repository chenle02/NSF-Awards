9632349 BRINK Physical and physical/biological measurements will investigate the
sources, retention and losses of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton over Georges
Bank during the U.S.GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies Phase 2 program.
This project will focus on issues involving retention (in the form of
recirculation around the inner part of the Bank), losses from the southern flank
of the Bank into the Slope Water, and losses westward into the Middle Atlantic
Bight. A year-long, 9-element moored array will be placed along the southeastern
end of the Bank to measure the local kinematics and dynamics of recirculation
and to observe properties of the shelf break front (which is in effect the
southern boundary of the Bank). Three highly resolved (1 km or better
resolution) SeaSoar surveys are proposed along the southern flank to investigate
losses due to warm-core rings, wind events, and shelf break eddies. SeaSoar
surveys will measure normal physical variables (currents, temperature and
salinity), and will include zooplankton observations made with a Video Plankton
Recorder (VPR) and the Tracor Acoustic Profiling System (TAPS). ***
