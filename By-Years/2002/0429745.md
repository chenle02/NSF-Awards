Proposal No: 429745 &lt;br/&gt;Prinipal Investigator: Niraj Jha (Princeton U)
and Pinaki Mazumder (U Michigan)&lt;br/&gt;Title: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:
Modeling, Simulation, Circuit Design, Logic Synthesis, Testing and Defect
Tolerance of Resonant Tunneling Device based
Nanotechnology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnologies, such
as resonant-tunneling devices (RTDs), quantum cellular automata, single electron
transistors, atom relays, refined molecular relays, carbon nanotube transistors,
etc., have seen significant advances in the last few years. They offer orders of
magnitude improvements in chip density, performance and power consumption,
making many as-yet undreamed-of applications feasible. However, comprehensive
circuit analysis/synthesis methodologies and tools have not yet been developed
for any nanotechnology. Such tools are urgently needed in order to realize their
potential. In this proposal, the investigators will target RTD-based
nanotechnology, which has already shown industrial promise. Specifically, we
will develop an electronic circuit design optimization environment, and
techniques for circuit design, logic synthesis, testing and fault tolerance for
this nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
