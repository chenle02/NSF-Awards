The objective of this proposed research is to develop micro- and
nanotechnologies that will enable precise engineering of cellular environments
and allow correlation of subcellular signaling with cellular function. Genomics
has greatly advanced our knowledge concerning how biological systems are
programmed. This "software", however, is embedded in the "hardware" of a cell,
which interacts with its environment to compute its specific outputs such as
growth, differentiation, or death. The micro- and nanotechnology developed in
this project will enable control over configuration of the cellular hardware
such as receptor clustering and cell shape. The technology will then be used to
study how different hardware configurations affect subcellular signaling and
cell function. Specifically, multiple laminar flow technology will be used to
stimulate subcellular microdomains with growth factors and soft lithographic
three-dimensional protein nanopatterning technology will be developed to perform
nanoscale extracellular matrix engineering. The two technologies will provide,
with subcellular resolution, control of cross-talk between growth factor signals
and adhesive signals. This type of knowledge is specifically relevant to
understanding physiological processes such as embryonic development and wound
healing as well as pathological states such as fibrosis and cancer. The research
will be tightly coupled with the education and training of a work force that can
translate these scientific and engineering discoveries into tangible social and
economic improvements. A major component of the educational program is a
Biological Micro- and Nanotechnology course that will seamlessly integrate
micro- and nanotechnology with cell biology and provide both theoretical
training and hands-on laboratory experiences to students.
