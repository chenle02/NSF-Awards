There are several replica control algorithms for managing replicated files in
the face of network partitioning due to site or communication link failures.
Pessimistic algorithms ensure consistency at the price of reduced availability;
they permit at most one (distinguished) partition to process updates at any
given time. This project seeks to: 1) Identify the algorithm that yields optimal
availability under a model called the site model, and prove the optimality of
that algorithm; 2) Determine heuristics that provide near optimal availability
under other models in which the sites and links are modeled as heterogeneous
objects. The focus of this research is on dynamic algorithms, in which the
potential distinguised partitions cannot be listed in advance (i.e., the list
changes over time). Such algorithms have been shown to provide better
availability than the more traditional static algorithms. The issue of replica
control is of central importance in distributed databases. This research will
yield improved algorithms and establish limits on the best one can achieve in
this arena.
