This project will support the establishment of a computing laboratory for
undergraduate majors in mathematics and computer science in conjunction with
courses in combinatorics and applied logic. It is being funded under the
Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of
supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate
laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or engineering. The Instrumentation
and Laboratory Improvement Program provides matching support for the
instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements
at U.S. colleges and universities. In particular, the main objectives of this
project are to 1) provide a computing environment which supports the fast,
large- scale computations of the type regularly encountered in numerical
analysis and which allows the use of symbolic algebra and functional language
packages; and 2) to acquaint students with the tools and methods used regularly
by professionals in the world of real research and applications.
