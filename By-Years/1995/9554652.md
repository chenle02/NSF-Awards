This project focuses on a 1-week summer follow-up workshop on UG faculty
enhancement in the area of computer networks. Twenty computer science and
mathematics faculty from small colleges/universities, who participated in a
2-week workshop at MSU during the summer of 1994, will be invited back to MSU
during the 1996 summer, for additional training and experiences. The proposed
5-day follow-up will involve: sessions for assembling and fine- tuning
courseware materials (especially laboratory assignments), sessions for sharing
experiences relative teaching computer networks, intensive laboratory training
on using software packages designed to enhance teaching computer networks. The
courseware material will be placed on the WWW for easy access by both
participants, and the CS community. Experts in computer networks will be
available during the workshop to assist and talk with participants. As a follow-
up of the proposed project, a quarterly newsletter will be available to
participants via the WWW. Some of the participants will attend the SIGCSE
conference to report on their evaluations and "lessons learned".
