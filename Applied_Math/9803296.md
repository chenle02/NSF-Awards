The research under this award is devoted to the study of solutions of nonlinear
partial differential equations which model the propagation of waves such as
light waves and sound waves. These phenomena do not have viscous effects which
means that the differential equations are of hyperbolic type. The mathematical
analysis provides new rigorous error estimates for exact solutions and
approximate solutions that are valid in the limit of short wavelengths.
Particular emphasis is placed on problems of nonlinear optics. Four main problem
areas are addressed. The first is the investigation of qualitative properties of
three nonlinear models. The basic question is whether these models predict
singularity formation or not. In the second area, reliable approximate solutions
for nonlinear optics problems will be constructed that are valid for larger
amplitudes than previously possible. To do so requires hypotheses for the
nonlinear interaction terms which are verified in many practical models. The
third problem is to investigate the effects of strong nonlinearity at focal
points. The fourth problem area is to construct approximate solutions with error
estimates for equations that describe ultra short laser propagation.

The research that is supported by this award focuses on mathematical models for
wave propagation phenomena, specifically on high frequency phenomena such as
light waves and acoustic waves. The results from this research can be used to
validate current models for such phenomena, predict new effects, and help in the
design of new equipment. Much of this work is motivated by problems for ultra
intense lasers and optical parametric oscillators where difficulties with
modeling and design have been encountered. The mathematical investigations will
allow to predict situations in which optical devices become unstable or are
damaged.
