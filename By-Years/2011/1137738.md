This is an award to support the Space Weather Enterprise Forum (SWEF), which
brings together members of government at all levels, the private sector and
academia, to raise awareness, improve understanding, and to educate all
participants on opportunities, needs and priorities related to space weather.
The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of
improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the
user community from 2011 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers
seek to better understand and serve society's needs for space weather
information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved
space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad
user community.
