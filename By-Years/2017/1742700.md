This project supports students at U.S. institutions to attend meetings of the
Networking Networking Women (N^2Women) organization. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of
the N^2 Women meetings and workshops is to foster connections among women in the
communications and networking&lt;br/&gt;research fields. Each meeting will be
co-located with a premier networking conference in 2017:&lt;br/&gt;IEEE INFOCOM
2017 in Atlanta, GA, ICCCN 2017 in Vancouver, Canada, and ACM SIGCOMM 2017 in
Los Angeles, CA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this activity
resides in the contributions that the student participants will make
to&lt;br/&gt;(1) the N^2Women meetings, (2) the premier co-located conferences,
and (3) the future scientific progress of the student's
research.&lt;br/&gt;Participant support funds will allow these graduate students
to attend high-quality technical presentations,&lt;br/&gt;be exposed to state-
of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate
students.
