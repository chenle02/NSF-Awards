This proposal is to investigate the functional biology of Sonoran Desert winter
annual plants in order to provide insights into their population and community
dynamics. Annual plants are a major component of arid land plant communities.
Ecologists are interested in the mechanisms that allow species to coexist and
hence maintain species diversity. We have previously documented long-term
population and community dynamics of a community of Sonoran Desert annuals. This
ecosystem has highly variable precipitation. Plants respond to this variability
in species-specific ways that result in the idiosyncratic schedules of
reproductive success. This partially uncorrelated reproduction contributes to
these species coexistence in ways that are now understood mathematically. The
goal for this proposal is to understand how this variation in performance among
species, which contributes to their coexistence, is a function of their
physiology and morphology. We will collect various types of physiological,
morphological and stable isotope data on plants growing in their natural
habitats. This will uncover variation in functional biology that determines how
different co-occurring species experience environmental variation and hence
coexist. The previously collected long-term population dynamic data on this
community have given us a unique window on how environmental variation can
contribute to biodiversity by decoupling the temporal pattern of reproductive
success. This project allows us to explain the underlying biology that creates
the differential response to variation that is in turn responsible for two
important ecological phenomena: species coexistence and diversity. The results
of the work are also germane to management plans for desert systems.
