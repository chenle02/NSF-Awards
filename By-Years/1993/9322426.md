9322426 Weidner The Center for High Pressure Research, an NSF Science and
Technology Center, was founded in 1991 as a research program to probe the
physical and chemical properties of materials with a particular emphasis on the
use of high pressure. University at Stony Brook, joined by Princeton University,
and the Geophysical Laboratory form the core institutions in the Center. With
this application, the Stony Brook arm of the Center (the Mineral Physics
Institute) is proposing to expand and formalize an existing summer program which
enables selected undergraduates to participate in the excitement of the advances
made in this environment. While the research program will be housed at Stony
Brook, we will provide an opportunity for the students to visit the other
laboratories and institutions involved in the Science and Technology Center. Our
goal with the proposed program is to expose a limited number of undergraduates
to frontier science with the hope that they will be stimulated to the point of
pursuing a career in research science.
