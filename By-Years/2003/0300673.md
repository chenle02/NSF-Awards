Atomic nuclei are known to exist in a variety of shapes which&lt;br/&gt;include
spherical, prolate (like a football), oblate (like a doorknob), and
&lt;br/&gt;octupole (like a pear). Although these are different shapes,
they&lt;br/&gt;all have one common factor: they are all symmetric about at least
one axis. &lt;br/&gt;Somewhat surprisingly, the most difficult nuclear shape to
identify is one in&lt;br/&gt;which there is no symmetry axis, which would look
like a kiwi fruit. A&lt;br/&gt;nucleus with this asymmetric shape is often said
to possess ``triaxial&lt;br/&gt;deformation'' or have ``triaxiality.'' In fact,
only a few nuclei have&lt;br/&gt;established cases of triaxial deformation.
However, this shape only occurs in these&lt;br/&gt;nuclei when it is in a highly
excited state. Here, the nucleus is&lt;br/&gt;significantly more elongated or
more deformed than when in a less excited state. &lt;br/&gt;This phenomenon is
known as ``superdeformation,'' and therefore when the&lt;br/&gt;nucleus is also
triaxial it is said to have triaxial superdeformation. It&lt;br/&gt;was once
thought triaxial superdeformation would only occur in nuclei
with&lt;br/&gt;neutron numbers near N = 94, but recently we discovered possible
triaxial&lt;br/&gt;deformation in an isotope of hafnium having N = 102. In order
to confirm this&lt;br/&gt;shape, we must perform another experiment with higher
statistics than the&lt;br/&gt;first, to search for the presence of wobbling
excitations. These are the&lt;br/&gt;quantum equivalent to an asymmetric top
being spun which would display a&lt;br/&gt;wobbling motion. We will also begin a
search for evidence of triaxial &lt;br/&gt;superdeformation in the neighboring
tantalum nuclei with neutron&lt;br/&gt;numbers near N = 100. Therefore, it is
our intent to firmly establish this&lt;br/&gt;region of nuclei as having stable
triaxial deformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will also participate and possibly
lead experiments utilizing&lt;br/&gt;neutron-rich radioactive beams at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. Until recently,&lt;br/&gt;these species of isotopes could
not be studied easily as few methods&lt;br/&gt;existed for exciting the neutron-
rich nuclei. However, Oak Ridge can now&lt;br/&gt;produce beams of these rare
isotopes for further analysis. Participation in&lt;br/&gt;these experiments will
better prepare the principal investigator to&lt;br/&gt;propose future
experiments at this facility and eventually at the Rare
Isotope&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator. In addition, a make-shift radioactive beam can be
used at the&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University laboratory to study select
neutron-rich nuclei.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate involvement will be
vital in all of these projects. &lt;br/&gt;Students will learn basic nuclear
physics techniques at the Naval Academy,&lt;br/&gt;and then apply this knowledge
at the laboratories where this work will be&lt;br/&gt;completed. The opportunity
to use world-class facilities will hopefully propel&lt;br/&gt;these students
into scientific careers.&lt;br/&gt;
