Speth Under the direction of Dr. John Speth, Mr. Renato Kipnis will collect data
for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological excavation at two
sites - Grande Abrigo de Santana do Riacho and Lapa do Boquete - both located in
eastern Central Brazil. Primr excavations at both indicate that they have
excellent organic preservation, including rich botanical and animal remains,
perishable wooden and reed artifacts and human burials. They have several
occupation levels that span most of the last 12,000 years. Through his
excavation, Mr Kipnis will increase the samples of floral and faunal remains as
well as cultural artifacts such as ceramics and stone tools. Excavation will be
specifically aimed at recovering controlled samples which will permit
quantitative analysis and intra- and inter-site comparison. Sediment column
samples will be collected for pollen analysis. On this basis it will be possible
to reconstruct detailed changes in environment and document human response to
these. The goal of this research is to investigate how human societies at a
simple level of cultural and technological organization adapt to severe
environmental change. Over the last 12,000 years such variation has occurred in
Central Brazil and these two archaeological sites with excellently preserved
remains offer Mr. Kipnis to address this question. Archaeologists have posited
different adaptational strategies. One involves resource diversification and
intensification where the focus is on change in local use of the environment.
Another is primarily social and involves the establishment of networks among
groups and the increased movement of goods and individuals. The work which Mr.
Kipnis will conduct should help to determine which of these alternatives is most
likely. This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of
interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light on how societies
interact with their environment and assist in the training of a promising young
scientist.
