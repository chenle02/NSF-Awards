A general approach will be used for probabilistic optimal design (POD) of
mechanical and structural systems. The idea represents a novel approach to
optimize design in conjunction with failure estimates, which avoids
computationally expensive simulations. A concept linking robustness of design to
low sensitivity will be developed. Based on this concept, a method is developed
which can identify critical parameters that affect the reliability of a
mechanical or structural system. This methodology can be incorporated in various
simulation programs. Further, the POD approach is readily applicable to
probabilistic design and tolerance synthesis of constrained dynamic systems.
