Current techniques for a software engineer to change a computer program are
limited to static activities - once the application begins executing, there are
few reliable ways to reconfigure it. Having a sound method for managing changes
in a running program will allow developers to perform maintenance activities
without loss of the overall system's service. The objective of this project is
to study how to reconfigurate application software dynamically. This project
will create an environment for organizing and effecting software reconfiguration
activities dynamically, develop a formal approach for programmers to capture the
state of a process abstractly, and investigate methods for adapting software to
be reconfigurable.
