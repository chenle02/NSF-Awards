Numerical computations are to be performed on various aspects of vortex dynamics
in shear layers bounded by a solid surface. The configurations to be studied ar
three-dimensional and unsteady. They represent idealized prototype
configurations of vortex loops, and vortex bursting, which have been
experimentally observed in both fully turbulent boundary layers and boundary
layers in process of transition to turbulence.
