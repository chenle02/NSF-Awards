NOX control include: Selective NonCatalytic Reduction (SNCR), Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR), and reburning. SNCR and SCR reduce NOX by non-
catalytic or catalytic reactions with N-agents (ammonia or urea). There are
several problems with SCR, such as high capital cost, limited catalyst life,
catalyst poisoning and disposal. SNCR is less expensive, but capabilities of
SNCR are limited by the narrow temperature window of NOX control, ammonia slip,
low utilization of N-agents, and formation of N2O with urea injection.
Conventional natural gas reburning is currently a mature technology for NOX
control. Reburning has been successfully demonstrated at full scale by EER and
others on numerous occasions. However, reburning alone provides about 60% NOz
reduction and cannot achieve 80% required by ozone attainment regulations in
certain geographic areas. The proposed project is directed towards improving
performance of the reburning process by injection of air in the reburning zone
under specific conditions. The goal of the project is to achieve 80% NOX removal
by the Air Promoted Reburning (ARP) process. In a combination with other
inexpensive NOX control methods (such as low NOz burners and SNCR), the APR
process will make it possible to reduce NOX by 90+%. ***
