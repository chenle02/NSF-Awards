9400946 Ding This award funds the research of Professor Guoli Ding in graph
theory. Prof. Ding works on the Graph Minors Project. He uses the techniques of
this project to study infinite antichains of graphs relative to graph
containment, topological minors, and induced subgraphs. The research is in the
general area of combinatorics, in particular graph theory. Combinatorics
attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections can be
organized. Graphs are arrangements of points connected by lines. The behavior of
discrete collections like graphs is extremely important in modeling systems and
plays a role in modern computing, communications and operations. For example,
the design of large networks, as in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science all use graphs in their development, and make use
of combinatorial research.
