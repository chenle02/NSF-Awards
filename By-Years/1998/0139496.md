Clemson supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in its
Chemical Engineering Department with an experimental materials studies theme.
Eight students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer
research experience, with a recruitment focus on the Southeastern United States.
Undergraduates with a chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science
background are especially targeted. Students participate in a variety of
research projects within three major categories: polymeric, catalytic and bio-
inspired materials. Undergraduates also participate in oral and written
communication workshops and in tours of chemical and manufacturing companies
nearby.
