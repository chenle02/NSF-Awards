Nerve cells extend highly polarized processes, called dendrites and axons,
through which they communicate with each other. Repeated physiological
stimulation of a neuron may result in long-term changes at the synapse, the site
where connections are made. A new theory suggests that nerve cells may
synthesize proteins close to the synaptic site, depending on synaptic activity;
the majority of proteins in most cells is made by the protein synthetic
machinery in the cell body (the soma). The goal of this research project is to
assess the extent to which neurons employ extrasomatic protein synthesis.
Associate components of the protein synthetic machinery will be identified in
extrasomatic domains of neurons, and the accumulation of such components in
those domains will be correlated with physiological activity at the synapse.
Primary cultures of neurons from both the central and the peripheral nervous
system will be used in this approach. In summary, this project seeks to
establish the functional significance of decentralized protein synthesis as a
potential basis for long-term modulations of protein repertoires in extrasomatic
domains of nerve cells.
