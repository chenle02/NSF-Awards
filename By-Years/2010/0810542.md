This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate
a new method of thermographic imaging to improve the manufacturing yield and
energy conversion efficiency of silicon photovoltaic solar cells. Although
thermographic imaging is an ideal method for locating the defects and shunts in
solar cells which compromise their efficiency, conventional infrared cameras do
not have sufficient spatial resolution to be effective as a production tool for
NDE (Non-Destructive Evaluation). The proposed technology will produce 100X
higher spatial resolution with 1 mK thermal resolution at much lower system cost
than infrared cameras.
