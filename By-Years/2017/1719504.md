Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive
institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate
degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance
the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research.
The project at Virginia State University seeks to build on previous successful
efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM
disciplines. The goal of this project is to significantly improve recruitment,
retention and graduation rates for STEM undergraduate students, as well as to
establish a framework for developing the skills and attributes needed for a
successful career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will utilize evidence-based, high-impact
pedagogical practices to improve student learning and outcomes. Activities
include: the Summer Engineering Institute to help high school students
transition to college, a job shadowing program, undergraduate research
experiences, student participation in local and national conferences, the
establishment of an Advanced Digital Manufacturing System Lab, and study abroad
experiences. The project will identify the competencies that local industries
desire STEM students to have upon graduation and study the factors that
influence persistence in STEM undergraduate students at the university. The
project will be advised and evaluated for effectiveness by internal and external
advisory boards and an evaluator.
