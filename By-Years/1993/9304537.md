9304537 Sercel The formation of nanometer-scale III-V quantum dots by the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) growth mechanism will be investigated. The basic goal of the
research is to establish the feasibility of the process. Unlike previous
approaches, the technique will produce quantum dots by mask-free epitaxy on the
surface of a semiconductor substrate. Nanometer-scale group-III liquid metal
droplets deposited on semiconductor substrates will be supersaturated with
arsenic in a UHV deposition chamber, driving VLS growth of III-V quantum dots.
The metal droplets will be placed on the growth substrate by two methods: (1)
deposition of nanometer-scale metal clusters, and (2) melting of arrays of
nanometer-scale metal dots formed by patterning thin metal films using electron-
beam lithography. The latter method in particular will permit fabrication of
regular arrays of GaAs and InAs quantum dots for production of periodic optical
gain media. The absence of surface rnasking material will permit epitaxial
growth of a wider band-gap encapsulation layer, and therefore, ultimate
application of the technique to fabrication of devices such as the quantum dot
semiconductor lasers. %%% The ability to directly synthesize three-dimensional
semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum dots, would enable realization of
a number of predicted benefits. Applications which have been proposed for
semiconductor quantum dot materials include use as an optical gain medium in
semiconductor lasers, as a nonlinear medium for optical switching applications
and in novel synthetic doping schemes. If the approach is successful, it will
represent a new form of epitaxy with potentially great impact on optoelectronics
technology. ***
