0339310&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I
project seeks to develop an ultrasensitive, real-time, laser-based explosives
sensor. The novel, all solid state, laser-based system can be configured in
numerous embodiments for use in walk-through, baggage, and cargo screening
portals and can potentially be manufactured in man-portable versions for mine
sweeping applications. The proposed sensor&lt;br/&gt;will combine a new laser
technology with a new detection method to exceed the detection limits of
presently employed ion mobility mass spectrometry based systems by orders of
magnitude. The proposed sensor will be capable of rapidly detecting and
discriminating among ultratrace levels of different explosives in real time with
unparalleled sensitivity. The sensor will be capable of detecting common
explosives such as TNT, RDX,&lt;br/&gt;and PETN at parts-per-trillion
concentration level with high chemical specificity in less than 10
seconds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial markets for such a sensor system
are enormous and the need immediate. The proposed instrument will enable
explosives to be detected in real-time with unparalelled sensitivity and
selectivity. The same instrument can also be used for the trace detection of
chemical warfare and potentially biological warfare agents. In addition to
security applications, the same sensor can be used for applications in
industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and natural gas sensing.
