Research on the ecological factors favouring andromonoecy in Zigadenus lilies
(Liliaceae) is proposed. Andromonoecy is an uncommon type of plant breeding
system that has received little attention and whose adaptive significance is
poorly understood. Individual plants of andromonoecious species possess both
male and hermaphrodite flowers, so it is necessary to explain (1) why female
function has been eliminated in some flowers, and (2) why male flowers have been
retained. These are questions of how resources should be allocated to, and
packaged within, male and female reproductive structures. Thus, crucial to an
understanding of the system is precise knowledge of how male and female
fitnesses increase with increased allocation to each sexual function,
particularly with increases in flower number. To determine the shapes of these
fitness gain curves a combination of experimental manipulations of flower
number, nutrient supplementations, pollinator observations, fluorescent dyes to
track pollen movement, and genetic markers for determining paternity will be
used. This will be one of the first studies to test predictions about the
adaptive significance of a plant breeding system by measuring male and female
gain curves in a natural population.
