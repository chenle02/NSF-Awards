This award provides resources to procure equipment to support research in four
areas, including peg in hole insertion in compliant assembly using industrial
robots, bearing fault detection, mechanisms of segregation in vibratory
particulate motion, and mechanical structural responses. The equipment comprises
a vibration exciter system, several accelerometers and displacement sensors, a
stroboscope, an IBM PC-AT based data acquisition system, and an X-Y plotter. The
assembly task focuses on vibration assisted compliant insertion, and includes
analysis of the kinematics and dynamics of the insertion process as well as an
experimental study to investigate the effects of various process parameters
including vibration frequency, vibration amplitude, compliance, and tolerance.
The fault detection research is an alternative machine diagnostics approach to
the classical detection scheme which uses experimental results. The method's
effectiveness is tested experimentally for bearing systems. The particle
dynamics research attempts to understand the mechanisms of particle-particle and
particle-wall collisions which are characteristic of many processes involving
powdered and granular materials. The mechanical responses study focuses on
machine subsystems including machine supports and gear trains.
