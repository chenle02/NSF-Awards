9720146 DRAAYER This award will provide funds for the planning and conducting
of the 13th Annual NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR) Conference to be held 1-4 December 1997 at the Fairmont Hotel in New
Orleans, Louisiana. This regular conference is a very important forum in which
participants from all 19 EPSCoR jurisdictions (there are 18 EPSCoR states plus
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) can come together to exchange information and
ideas critical to research and development (R&D) in EPSCoR states. The award
will provide travel, subsistence, and conference registration support for five
participants from each EPSCoR state and for a number of additional important
invited speakers and guests. For the 1997 conference teams from each state will
be featured with prominent representatives from their academic, industrial, and
state governmental communities. These teams will present success stories along
with strategies for addressing changing R&D funding scenarios. Such sharing can
provide very valuable insights for participants because a success story in one
realm for a particular state may suggest a promising strategy for another state
to pursue. Conference proceedings will be produced for distribution to all
participants.
