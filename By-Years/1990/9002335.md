How the monsoon system in tropical Africa has reacted to changes in climate
boundary conditions can be answered by reconstructing its history on 106-year
time scales. But the logistics of study in this region are difficult: any
concerted research strategy must involve international cooperation. This
proposal requests support to organize and conduct a workshop with the following
goals: 1) to evaluate the relationship between sediment characteristics and
climate in East African rift lakes; 2) to develop a strategy for recovering long
sediment records in the rift lakes; and 3) to use them to reconstruct the 5 to
10 million year record of climate in tropical Africa. The PIs envision a decade-
long research program that will involve US and international participants. The
PIs will use the support from this grant to develop such a research strategy.
This research is important because east Africa boasts a large portion of the
world's population, dependent on an agrarian economy, so changes in the monsoon
affect the lives of many people.
