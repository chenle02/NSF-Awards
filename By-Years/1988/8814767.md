This grant provides funds to acquire a high intensity heavy-ion source that
will be used in conjunction with the University of Notre Dame/University of
Michigan Radioactive Beam Facility. The equipment will increase the intensity of
the radioactive beams by a factor of ten or more, making possible new research
in the study of nuclei far from stability and in the study of nuclear reactions
of astrophysical interest.
