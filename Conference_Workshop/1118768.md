The 2011 Maine/Quebec Number Theory Conference will take place on October 1 & 2
at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference is held annually, at
l'Universite Laval in Quebec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd
years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Quebec, and
beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes
interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.

This year the featured topic at the conference is Arithmetic and p-adic
Dynamics. This is a relatively new line of research in number theory that brings
ideas from the classical theory of dynamical systems to the setting of algebraic
varieties over number fields and local fields. Several of the architects of this
field will lecture on the broad themes of the subject, the latest results, and
possibilities for future development. There will also be invited speakers
addressing other important areas of number theory, with 25-30 speakers in all.
The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees) makes this a good
opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with
leading researchers.
