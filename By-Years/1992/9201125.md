Over the last 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of
women participating in the paid work force, but the change in the proportion of
women in senior positions has been very slow. This doctoral dissertation project
utilizes a theory of organizational learning to explain the selection of women
and men for senior positions and how that selection procedure contributes to the
low frequency and type of women in senior management positions. Based on
interviews of ninety-seven women and men randomly sampled at three levels of
management in two companies, beliefs of organizational members who are promoted
and those who are not promoted are compared to beliefs about appropriate
managerial behavior and about proper gender behavior that are imbedded in the
organizational code. This project will contribute to a broader sociological
understanding of what characterizes women who have been promoted to senior
positions by elucidating how their behavior is different than some other women
in the organization and how organizational inertia is supported through this
selection process. This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
