This is an equipment grant to provide a video digitization and display system
that will allow video data to be sampled and stored in a computer memory and
later played back after digital processing. This equipment will allow research
in the Digital Signal Processing Laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology
to be extended to the processing of video imagery. The specific research
projects that will use this equipment extensively include the following:
iterative methods for blur removal from video imagery; applications of
mathematical morphology in image analysis; digital coding of video signals;
multiprocessor architectures for digital signal processing; low bit-rate video
coding for deaf communication; and computer vision. Research conducted with this
equipment could contribute to video communications, industrial robotics, and
defense systems.
