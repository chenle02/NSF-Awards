The proposed research will examine basic processes in forest tree ecology:
dispersal (seeds), and survival of seedlings (as affected by fire). By
investigating these life history traits in longleaf pine populations, this
research will provide a number of new insights. First, this research will
provide important information about dispersal abilities of forest tree species.
There is a gap in knowledge of the amount of seeds that trees produce and how
far seeds are dispersed. Second, how patterns of dispersal; reflect
establishment and growth of seedlings will be elucidated. It is important to
determine what factors play a role in the success of forest species from seeds
to juveniles to adults. Finally, because some forest species, such as longleaf
pine, can grow better in the presence of fire, it is important to see if fire
plays a role in survival of seedlings. This research has many silvicultural
applications. From this study, the optimum distance of seed dispersal can be
predicted. This information will be helpful in management of pine populations.
Second, the factors influencing survival can be determined. This information
will be beneficial in increasing yields. Third, the study will shed light on how
juvenile patterns reflect optimum forest structure, important in the thinning
and spacing of trees. Finally, this research will provide information about fire
effects and growth of forest species.
