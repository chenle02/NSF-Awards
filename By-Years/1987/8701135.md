Narrative: Aseptic processing involves continuous food sterilization by heating
and packaging that may be sterilized by various methods, including heat. Besides
the convenience of continuous sterilization other possible advantages resulting
from this strategy include lower cost product packaging and the potential
improvement of product quality via ultra-high temperature/short time treatment.
Mathematical models with experimental verification will be developed to
represent fine and course particle velocity distributions in holding tubes
designed for aseptic food sterilization. This work has been proposed because no
reliable technique presently exists for continuous in-situ measurement of
temperatures within individual particles flowing through tubes. Therefore, the
detection of particle "cold spots" would be essentially impossible without
predictive theoretical models. Important process parameters that will be
investigated include; Reynolds number, particle-to-pipe diameter ratio, radii
and orientation of bends, pipe inclination, and particle concentration.
