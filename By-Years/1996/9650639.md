The primary objective of this project is to provide funding for equipment to
update molecular biology laboratory courses. The proposed project is also
expected to improve other courses using molecular-based techniques, the ability
to introduce molecular-based concepts and experimentation to biology majors and
nonmajors, and the training of future elementary science teachers. Pedagogic
issues addressed by the updated laboratory courses include learning essential
techniques of molecular biology, introducing the scientific method of doing
research, and learning how to write scientifically and effectively. In
particular, students will be introduced to important molecular techniques, such
as preparing recombinant DNA plasmids, DNA analysis using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based techniques and sequencing, and analyses of protein
expression. Other innovative aspects of the project include an emphasis on a
research-like laboratory experience and an increased use of computers to enhance
learning. The use of this equipment is also being integrated into a new
Education/Natural Science major that utilizes novel, inquiry-based techniques to
train the next generation of elementary science teachers.
