CBET 1438569/1438567&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Particulate and Multiphase
Processes (PMP) program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering,
Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET, Engineering Directorate), is co-
funded by the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in
the Division of Biological Infrastructure (BIO
Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measuring the physical and mechanical
properties of biological materials and other complex fluids such as polymeric
liquids poses special challenges for scientists and engineers. The properties of
these materials can change owing to the contact between the material and solid
walls, such as the walls of a container holding the material. This collaborative
project involves the development of a new device and new method to measure the
rheological properties of fluids or solids that avoid contact between the sample
and solid walls. The method is called acoustic tweezing rheometry, and it uses
acoustic levitation to hold a small sample freely suspended in air or water
while applying a force on the material that causes it to deform. The device then
reads the response of the material by recording changes in the shape of the
sample as a function of time. By comparing the shape of the sample with computer
simulations carried out as part of the project, the rheological properties of
the material can be deduced. This new instrument will find applications in a
diverse array of science and engineering
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acoustic tweezing rheometry will be used to
measure properties of active polymeric and biological fluids and soft tissue
without artifacts such as contamination, biological activation or gelation due
to contact with solid walls. A model will be developed for noncontact
measurement of material constants through analytical studies and computational
simulation. The acoustic tweezing technique will be developed and validated for
measurement of material properties of viscoelastic fluids. The method will be
applied to biological fluids and soft tissue, including whole blood during
coagulation and collagen gel. Results will be disseminated broadly, including
outreach to the biological communities that could benefit from the new method.
