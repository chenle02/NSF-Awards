Resolving the topology and relative timing of the deepest branches remains one
of the most significant challenges in Assembling the Tree of Life. Knowledge of
this deep phylogeny, however, is critical for understanding foundational
questions in biology such as how the complex networks that underlie modern life
arose, and how they have been shaped by co-evolution with the Earth. This
research project will develop new algorithms to infer a Tree of Life that is
based on the thousands of complete genome sequences currently available rather
than a single gene or small set of genes. Accurately identifying and accounting
for horizontal gene transfer, a process in which genes are exchanged between
unrelated species, potentially obscuring phylogenetic relationships, is a key
challenge that will be addressed. Calibrating the timing of the deepest branches
on the Tree of Life with the geological record will be done in collaboration
with experts in early Earth history and geochronology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a better understanding of the
origin and history of life on Earth, and new algorithms for inferring the
evolutionary history of genes and species across billions of years of
evolutionary time. The project will bring together expertise from diverse fields
of study, and expose graduate, undergraduate, and postdoctoral students to
interdisciplinary research. In addition, museum partnerships and podcasts will
enable dissemination of research results to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;
