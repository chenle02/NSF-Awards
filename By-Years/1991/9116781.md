This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research project
between Professor Lane Hemachandra, Department of Computer Science, University
of Rochester, and Professor Osamu Watanabe, Department of Computer Science,
Tokyo Institute of Technology. Other investigators involved in the project are
Professor Juris Hartmanis, Department of Computer Science, Cornell University,
Professor Kojiro Kobayashi, Department of Information Sciences, Tokyo Institute
of Technology, and Professors Mitsunori Ogiwara and Seinosuke Toda, both of the
Department of Computer Science and Information Mathematics, University of
Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan. The project is focused on closure
properties of some natural intermediate complexity classes such as The
investigators will focus on two areas in complexity theory: (1) the realtive
complexity of seemingly "intermediate" closure properties of key function
classes--properties that seem neither to be possessed by the classes nor to be
hard for the classes, and (2) the question of whether all infinite NP sets have
infinite sparse subsets that are (relatively) siimple, a question that springs
from the study of perfect hash functions.
