In this project, a new paradigm--system with set-partitioned dynamics is
introduced. This paradigm encompasses a broad class of control formulations
motivated by applications to systems such as industrial process, energy systems,
and transportation vehicles. In this new paradigm, continuous but often
uncertain dynamics of the system interacts with logical, although usually fuzzy
structure imposed by component limits and design constraints. The research
effort is devoted through analysis, design and experimental case studies, the
formulation of an overall problem of controlling a plant whose behavior is
determined not only by dynamics, but also by sharp or fuzzy boundaries on which
these dynamics abruptly change. Design methods are developed for sharp and fuzzy
partitioned observers, and for interior and transitional controls. Estimation
and control parts of the design are integrated into an overall numerical-logical
feedback control loop.***//
