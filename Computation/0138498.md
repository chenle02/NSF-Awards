Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique in which
low levels of current are applied through electrodes on the surface of the body,
the resulting voltage is measured on the electrodes, and an inverse problem is
solved computationally to determine the conductivity distribution in the
interior. In EIT the imaged region is often a cross-section of the body, such as
a patient's chest. The tissues and organs in the body have different
conductivities, a fact which enables one to form an image from the conductivity
distribution. There is an essential interplay in EIT between engineering and
mathematics. The design of a fast and accurate EIT system poses many engineering
challenges. Mathematics has helped solve design issues such as what are the
optimal current patterns to apply, what number and size of electrodes should be
used, and what measurement precision is need to distinguish inhomogeneities. In
order to image human processes in real time, the reconstruction algorithms that
solve the inverse problem must be very efficient. Furthermore, for certain
applications, such as distinguishing a breast tumor from a cyst, the
reconstructed conductivity values must be accurate. The design of reconstruction
algorithms draws on many areas of mathematics including partial differential
equations, analysis and complex variables, mathematical modeling, numerical
analysis, and scientific computation.

The goal of the Mummy Range Workshop in Electrical Impedance Tomography is to
bring together mathematicians, engineers, and physicians working in EIT to
increase the communication between the groups and address current problems in
design issues, applications, and reconstruction algorithms. To the organizers'
knowledge, this is the first conference in EIT specifically designed to bring
together these groups. The workshop will be held at the Pingree Park Campus of
Colorado State University, a conference center located in the Mummy Range of the
Rocky Mountains. By bringing these groups together, we hope to expand the
clinical applications of EIT and push the technology forward in terms of system
design and reconstruction algorithms. Several important existing clinical
applications of EIT include monitoring heart and lung function, diagnosis of
pulmonary embolis (a blood clot in the lung), diagnosis of pulmonary edema,
monitoring for internal bleeding, and the early detection of breast cancer.
Groups attending the workshop will be presenting work on these applications and
others such as imaging changes in the brain during epilepsy and stroke and
monitoring of cancer tissue during hyperthermia by impedance spectroscopy.
Several groups are presenting work on the design of new systems for specific
applications such as breast cancer detection, and novel reconstruction
algorithms will be presented. The workshop website is
