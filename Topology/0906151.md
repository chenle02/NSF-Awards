Motivated by analogies with geometrically minimal surfaces, the PI recently
introduced the notion of a topologically minimal surface in a 3-manifold. Such a
surface has an associated disk complex that is either empty, or is non-
contractible. Topologically minimal surfaces generalize other well known
classes, such as incompressible surfaces and strongly irreducible Heegaard
splittings. They also generalize critical surfaces, a class that was
instrumental in the PI's solutions to a conjecture of Gordon's and to the
Stabilization Conjecture. Future work concerns the application of topologically
minimal surfaces to understand the persistence of the set of Heegaard surfaces
after Dehn filling. A second project is to apply a relative version of the
theory to study knots and links with multiple bridge presentations. Finally, the
study of topologically minimal surfaces has itself generated many natural
questions that reveal information about the topology of 3-manifolds.

Just as the surface of the Earth seems like a plane to those confined to local
observations, a 3-manifold is an object that is locally indistinguishable from
3-dimensional Euclidean space, such as our universe. A classical way to study
3-manifolds is to utilize surfaces they contain that are non-trivial in some
suitable sense. Topological minimality is a very general notion of non-
triviality for such surfaces that was introduced by the PI to solve several
problems in topology. These surfaces are the analogue of geometrically minimal
surfaces, such as soap films. The PI will both develop the theory of
topologically minimal surfaces further and use it to study the ambiguity
inherent in various common constructions of 3-manifolds.
