This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Predicting the
consequences of selecting nature reserves based on poor biological data."
Computerized reserve selection algorithms represent significant improvements
over ad-hoc selection methods; however, they are extremely data-intensive. Most
regions lack the resources necessary to obtain the extensive data these
algorithms require. This research quantifies the impact of poor data on the
results of reserve selection algorithms by subsampling well-known species
distributions to reflect realistic sampling in data-poor areas.

The complexity and scale of conservation planning necessitates use of
informatics approaches. This research develops the Fellow's skills in large-
scale data management, processing, analysis, programming, geographic information
systems, and modeling. Collaborating with academic and NGO scientists will
enhance the relevance of these computer-intensive methods for both basic science
and society through application to conservation.
