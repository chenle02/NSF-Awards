The scientific component of this proposal has two main parts. The first part is
a program to understand relatively hyperbolic groups and CAT(0) spaces with
isolated flats. Previous NSF funded work of the PI (including joint work with
Bruce Kleiner) establishes a tight connection between these two subjects. The PI
plans to continue a (single-authored) project that should substantially clarify
and extend the foundations of relatively hyperbolic groups. The PI plans to
continue a joint project with Kim Ruane to study the topology at infinity of a
space with isolated flats.The PI also plans to continue a long term work in
progress with Daniel Wise on the structure of groups acting on CAT(0) cube
complexes. Their work on this project uses relatively hyperbolic groups in
several ways and has already resulted in one NSF funded publication. They plan
to cubulate many classes of relatively hyperbolic groups. In the second part of
the research component, the PI plans to continue a program to study the lattice
theory of the automorphism group of a CAT(0) simplicial complex. The PI has
published NSF funded work on this subject (joint with Benson Farb), and plans to
continue ongoing work with Christopher Connell. Additionally, the PI plans to
publish an article, joint with Farb and Anne Thomas, surveying known results and
open problems in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is interested in the
large scale geometry of spaces with nonpositive curvature. That is, they have a
nontrivial mixture of negative curvature (like a saddle) and zero curvature
(flat like a piece of paper), but no positive curvature (like the surface of a
ball). More specifically, his research has focused on nonpositively curved
spaces with isolated flats. These spaces are almost negatively curved in the
sense that the flat, zero curvature, parts do not interact with each other. Thus
techniques from the elegant theory of negatively curved spaces can sometimes be
adapted to hold for spaces with isolated flats. In a separate project (joint
with Benson Farb), the PI is studying the symmetries admitted by nonpositively
curved spaces built by gluing together polygons along their edges. This project
is an attempt to bridge the gap between the mathematical fields of geometric
group theory and linear algebraic groups.
