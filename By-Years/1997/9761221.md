*** 9761221 Withers This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will
produce a detailed design of a high-temperature-superconductive (HTS) nuclear-
magnetic-resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) probe for operation in a 21-T (900-MHz)
magnet. High-sensitivity probes have recently been commercially introduced at
proton frequencies of 400, 500, and 600 MHz. The highest specified proton
sensitivity is the 3000:1 of the 600-MHz probe. The probe designed during Phase
1 will be built during Phase 2 and evaluated in the 21-T magnet at the National
High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. This probe will have a proton
sensitivity of 6000:1, twice that now available. In Phase 1, RF test coils will
be fabricated, ready for in-field characterization as soon as a high-field
magnet is available. This will be the highest field at which RF properties of
HTS materials have been measured. Approximately 1500 high-resolution NMRS probes
are sold per year. High-sensitivity superconductive probes are expected to reach
20% of this unit volume. At an end-user price of $80,000 per unit, this is a
$24,000,000 market. Extension of this product line to the highest available
field strengths will provide the ultimate in NMR sensitivity. ***
