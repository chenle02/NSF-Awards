9623038 Griess This grant supports the research of Professor R. Griess to work
on three different areas. The first area is that of embedding finite simple
groups into certain exceptional Lie groups. Next he will study the automorphism
groups of infinite dimensional vertex operator algebras. Finally he hopes to
come up with methods that will give a more uniform method of generating the
finite simple groups through the study of automorphisms of certain lattices.
This is research in the field of algebra. Algebra can be thought of as the study
of symmetry in the abstract. As such algebra has direct applications to areas of
physics and chemistry. In particular the modern theory of gauge fields in
physics uses this area of algebra extensively. There are also connections to
coding theory and the transmission of data across communication lines.
