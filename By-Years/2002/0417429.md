Acculturation is broadly defined as the consequences of two cultures coming
into contact. Originally conceived by anthropologists as a way to explain the
similarities of traits between cultures, acculturation is now used to explain
phenomena of interest to policy-makers, such as civic participation or risky and
illegal behaviors of migrants from developing countries. Recent migration
patterns have changed so that many migrants from developing countries move back
and forth between their origin and host countries. This project will develop
ways to measure adjustment to a host culture that transcends individual cultural
differences and captures influences from both origin and host countries.
Personal network research is suited for this because it quantifies who a migrant
knows, how they know them and how network members interact. &lt;br/&gt;The
project will test whether there are regularities across cultures and geography
in personal network composition and structure, and whether personal network
composition and structure explain a significant fraction of variance in the
behavioral and attitudinal outcomes of acculturation that are not accounted for
by acculturation scales alone. A total of 700 interviews will be conducted, 100
from each of seven different migrant groups: Cuban, Nicaraguan, Puerto Rican and
Brazilian migrants to South Florida, USA and Berber, Equatorial Guinean and
Gambian migrants to Catalonia, Spain. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of advances in
understanding of the compositional and structural basis of the personal networks
of migrants, and how they relate to acculturation strategies, are that this
understanding will help policymakers identify potential social intervention
points. Interventions could be designed for specific problems known to exist in
migrant communities, such as risky behavior related to illegal activities, or
access to social services such as health and child care. &lt;br/&gt;
