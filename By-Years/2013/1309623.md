Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to investigate the
scientific and technological foundations on time, location and integrity of
sensor recordings, by exploiting novel intrinsic fingerprints in the
environment. An example is the small random-like fluctuations of the electricity
frequency known as the Electric Network Frequency (ENF). These environmental
fingerprints reflect the attributes and conditions of the power grid and become
naturally "embedded" into video, audio or other types of sensor signals at the
time of recording. They carry time and location information and may facilitate
integrity verification of the primary sensing data. Answering questions about
the time, location, and integrity of sensor recordings find important
applications in crime solving, counter-terrorism, journalism, infrastructure
monitoring, smart grid management, and other commercial
operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit lies on exploring the nearly unchartered research area of forensic
evidences in the environment, by drawing synergy across multiple disciplines
including signal processing, machine learning, sensor circuits and systems,
power engineering, and information forensics/security. The research exploration
and technology development of this project are transformative and
interdisciplinary in nature.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:
&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are two folds: through engaging students,
especially female and under-represented ones, in exploratory research, the
project's seamless integration of research with education and outreach will
prepare the future generation of engineering workforce with interdisciplinary
strength; through new technologies and tools developed to advance information
forensics, the project has a high potential to benefit a number of applications
of global and societal importance.
