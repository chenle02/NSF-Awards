Probabilistic and Statistical Analysis of Population Evolution
Data&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed
at developing probabilistic and statistical theory for population evolution
data. These data possess features that can broadly be described as variants of
the branching phenomenon. Specific scientific questions that drive this project
are motivated towards understanding the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
dynamics. Specifically, this project develops statistical models (linear and
generalized linear models) after initially modeling the amplification process as
a variant of a general branching process. Due to the non-standard nature of the
problem, novel methodologies and techniques are necessary to understand the
inferential aspects stemming from these statistical models. These in turn lead
to interesting probabilistic questions about large deviations, conditional limit
laws, and central limit theorems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last two decades have
seen an explosion of novel ideas in the areas of biotechnology and information
technology. These discoveries are being felt in such diverse areas as finance,
e-commerce, biology, and network traffic. The scientific experiments carried out
using these modern technologies are yielding data that possess various
intricacies and complexities. This research is aimed at providing concrete
solutions to some of these complexities. An immediate application of the results
of this project would be in accurately quantifying the HIV-1 viral load in HIV-1
infected patients. Other areas of applications include cancer biology, Internet
congestion and its impact on e-commerce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
