The terrain shaped by former ice sheets provides clues about important, poorly
understood conditions and processes at the base of ice masses. These conditions
control how fast ice sheets build up, move, and store water, and how they
respond to, and participate in, global climate change. Areas that were formerly
under ice sheets tend to be strikingly scoured in the direction of ice flow and
often feature highly streamlined hills (drumlins). This research project studies
the spontaneous emergence of such distinctive landforms from the dynamic
interaction of moving ice, water, and sediment over large spatial and temporal
scales. The goal of the project is to develop a detailed mathematical model as a
tool to better understand the spontaneous production of drumlins and other
characteristic landforms produced by ice sheets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research project, an example of mathematical modeling of large, complex
geosystems, promises to advance understanding of basal processes and conditions
that affect ice sheet response to, and participation in, global climate. This
response has direct practical consequences, ranging from changes in sea level to
changes in hydrology, with worldwide effects on the large segments of humanity
residing in coastal areas or relying on alpine glaciers for fresh water sources.
The work will improve our understanding of glacially produced terrain, of basal
processes and conditions, and more generally, of the interdependence of ice
sheets and the earth climate system.&lt;br/&gt;
