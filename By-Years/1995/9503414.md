Abstact/Breidenthal Laboratory experiments are proposed to measure the
entrainment and mixing characteristics of buoyant flows involving shear and
buoyance reversal. Experiments will be performed in water tanks, using pH
indicators in conjunction with acid-base reactions to determine optically the
location and amount of mixing.
