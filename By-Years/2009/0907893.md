This research involves high-frequency, high-resolution radio imaging (VLBA,
ALMA) of quasar jets in order to measure the Doppler beaming, Lorentz factor,
and angle to the line of sight of jet flow using theoretical methods that have
been developed by the investigators. Drs. Marscher and Jorstad will also measure
polarization at millimeter wavelengths to try to determine whether jets are
scale invariant. The main goal of the study is to provide observational tests of
the prevailing theoretical model for quasar jets, involving a rotating black
hole that twists magnetic fields into an outflowing helical pattern.

The broader impacts include dissemination of data on the group's website,
training of students (some from a minority program), a textbook on extragalactic
astronomy, and public presentations.
