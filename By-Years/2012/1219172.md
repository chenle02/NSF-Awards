The compiler is a tool that is central to the development of software. Its role
is to translate the human-readable code written by a programmer into machine
code that a computer can understand. Because the compiler creates the actual
machine code that runs on the computer, a faulty compiler can lead to
catastrophic failures, including errors in medical devices, in fly-by-wire
aviation software, and in automotive systems. This research will lead to more
reliable compilers, which in the end will increase our confidence in the
software that has now become ubiquitous and safety-critical in our daily
lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new techniques for
building compilers to ensure the utmost level of rigor and reliability, so that
we can know with certainty that the machine code running on the computer does
exactly what the programmer intended it to do. To achieve this goal, the
principal investigator will investigate ways of using proof assistants to
implement formally verified compilers. More specifically, the research will
explore techniques for making formally verified compilers like Compcert generate
better code, so that they can be more competitive with mainstream compilers like
GCC and LLVM. Furthermore, the research will also investigate ways of decreasing
the proof burden, so that verified compilers like Compcert can be developed and
updated more easily. In the end, this research will enable formally verified
compilers to become more mainstream, so that they can used more broadly by
programmers.
