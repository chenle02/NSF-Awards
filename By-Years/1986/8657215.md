Dr. Howe has been selected as a Presidential Young Investigator. He is active
in fundamental research using high resolution, quantitative electron microscopy.
A major interest is characterizing the interface between precipitates and the
matrix. In the research program for NSF he will pursue studies on interface
structure in metals, composites, and polymers. He will employ atomic resolution
electron microscopy and analytical electron microscopy in the program to
describe interfacial structure and theoretically interpret his observations.
