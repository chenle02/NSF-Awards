A primary goal of modern biodiversity research is to identify the genes
underlying adaptation and diversification. Despite the intense interest in this
topic, relatively few such genes have been characterized from natural
populations, and fewer still have been compared between species. Butterfly wing
patterns represent an exceptional opportunity for identifying and studying
adaptation genes. Indeed, for over a century wing patterns have been a favorite
system for studying adaptation, primarily because the links between variation
and adaptive value are so easy to understand - especially in cases such as
mimicry, camouflage, startle response, and mate-choice. In this particular
project the investigators will work to identify the major genes controlling
mimicry-related color pattern variation in Heliconius butterflies. Remarkably,
over the last 20 millions years it appears that only three major genes have been
responsible for much of the dramatic color pattern variation in this genus. The
investigators will apply modern genetic and developmental methods to
characterize these genes and assess their functions across different species. By
understanding these genes at a molecular level biologists will be better poised
to understand why some genes tend to facilitate biological diversification more
than others.

The investigators of this project have strong records of involving students,
including undergraduates, in laboratory research. The Reed Lab will continue to
participate in the Bridges to the Baccalaureate program, which allows
prospective community college transfer students from underserved populations to
participate in summer research experiences, and W.O. McMillan and R. Papa will
help develop and enhance Latin American Internship Programs at the Smithsonian
Tropical Research Institute at the University of Puerto Rico, respectively. This
project will support the training of one graduate student and one postdoctoral
researcher in the fields of genomics and developmental biology.
