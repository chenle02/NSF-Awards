Northwest Vista College (NVC) is implementing Project ION (Improving
Opportunities in Nanotechnology) to support the educational preparation of
technicians for our nation's nanotechnology fields. The project is helping NVC
use innovative linkages with high schools, four-year institutions, and industry
partners to increase the number of technicians with current knowledge and skills
entering the nanotechnology workforce. Project ION's activities are being guided
by the objectives of innovation, implementation and regional adaptation. Project
ION is demonstrating effective ways that two-year institutions can creatively
lead partnerships with four-year institutions, research organizations, and
industry partners to provide nanotechnology-related learning, research, and
career development activities for STEM students. It is also creating new models
for nanotechnology-focused workforce development activities for underserved
populations.
