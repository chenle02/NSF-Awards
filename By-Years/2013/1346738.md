The objective of this EArly Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to
develop a method of automatically designing manipulators using as many as eight
bars in their linkage to perform a particular specified motion. The approach
combines techniques of computational design with those of robotic systems to
assist organization of the expanding options for both the design algorithm and
the user. This approach forms the basis for a design system for eight-bar
linkages, and may be extendable to 10 and 12-bar linkages. It is a high-risk
high-reward effort that can yield the first systematic design methodology for
eight-bar linkages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact resulting from this
work is the ability to design new and innovative complex linkage systems that
are currently beyond our capabilities. This research also provides effective
tools for the design of a new range of devices useful for automation, assistive
technology, and a range of applications in aerospace and automotive vehicles.
