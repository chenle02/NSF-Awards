An existing course in scientific computer interfacing will be updated to
utilize modern hardware and software, and will be expanded to include students
from several scientific disciplines. The course will cover the basic principles
of computer interfacing and data acquisition, the physics of transducers, and
signal processing, culminating in a project designed and constructed by each
student. Five state-of-the art interfacing workstations designed around the VME
bus, and a logic analyzer to facilitate hardware debugging will be acquired, as
well as two software/hardware packages which will be used as examples of a
commercial data acquisition system. These workstations will be the foundation of
the project- oriented course. Students will use them every week to perform
experiments in basic computer interfacing, the design and construction of ADC
and DAC converters, signal processing techniques, optical and mechanical sensors
and motors, high- speed data acquisition and nuclear counting techniques.
