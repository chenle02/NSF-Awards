Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving learning in
statics, a fundamental engineering course, through further development and
refinement of a web-based repository of concept- and skill-specific interactive
classroom activities. The project is transforming the statics learning
experience so that it is student-centered, by drawing together the potential of
computer technology and an interactive classroom in a synergistic way. The web-
based materials are being used in a wide variety of learning environments to
test their effectiveness within a broad spectrum of faculty and students. The
materials are being developed to provide students with instantaneous feedback on
their learning and to provide faculty with comprehensive feedback on their
students' progress. The tools being developed will allow faculty to create an
interactive classroom where routine instruction takes place outside the
classroom followed by stimulating, targeted activities inside the classroom. The
project is being rigorously assessed to determine its impact on student learning
and motivation through formative and summative means. The results from the
project are being broadly disseminated through multiple venues, include online
resources.
