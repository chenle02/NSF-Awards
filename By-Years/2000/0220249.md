The goal of this project is to control Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Features of
the AO systems will be modeled in the usual control framework to allow existing
control analysis, design and adaptation methodologies to be applied. New
methodologies will be developed as needed. This research will examine the use of
previously developed Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) designs in both open loop
and closed loop adaptive control architectures. The research will also determine
the important modeling uncertainties of AO systems and apply or develop robust
stability and performance analyses to AO systems. Finally, the research will
extend LQG based designs and robustness analyses to Multi-Conjugate Adaptive
Optics (MCAO) systems. This research will use data from the Max-Planck Instiut
fur Astronomie (MPIA) telescope at Calar Alto, Spain, and simulations developed
for the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
