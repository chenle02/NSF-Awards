Implicit surfaces are shapes described by the points where a function is zero.
Sphere tracing is a recently developed method for rendering implicit surfaces
that operates on implicit functions that indicate the distance to the implicit
surface. Such implicit functions are developed for common modeling primitives,
CSG operations, some blends, and some domain transformations which deform
objects, but many other surfaces, such as offset surfaces, and other operations,
blends and deformation remain. Sphere tracing is a robust efficient implicit
surface rendering algorithm. It ray traces implicit surfaces by tracking along
each ray by the distance to the implicit surface, as reported by the implicit
function. This iteration converges on the first ray-surface intersection. Sphere
tracing also provides an area sampling method for antialiasing. Enhancements to
sphere tracing include the sphere buffer which allows sphere tracing to
capitalize on spatial coherence, spatial partition, and a method for eliminating
all iteration from implicit surface rendering. Also addressed are the problems
of animating implicit surfaces, particularly the consistent texturing of an
implicit surface as it deforms, possibly changing genus.
