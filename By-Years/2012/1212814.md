Funds are awarded to continue support for Ship Operations of Research Vessel
Atlantic Explorer in 2012. This award covers year 1 of 5 of the cooperative
agreement. The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned
and operated by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S.
501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution
incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island
of Bermuda. The Atlantic Explorer is in compliance with USCG, University
National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and American Bureau of
Shipping (ABS) regulations. Funding will be re-negotiated each year and will be
dependent upon the number of days at sea in support of NSF funded research
programs. The vessel is scheduled for 167 days at sea in 2012 with 32 individual
cruises. All days are in support of National Science Foundation funded science.
