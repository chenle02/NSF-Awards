General Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF INCLUDES Launch Pilot project,
STEPs to STEM, will create a statewide STEM pipeline within an integrated
program of community college education throughout the state prisons of New
Jersey. The Pilot leverages a long-standing collaboration among
education,&lt;br/&gt;government, and volunteer sectors including NJ-Scholarship
and Transformative Education in Prisons (STEP), all of whom commit to work
together to accredit and ensure articulation (transferability) of the required
STEM courses. The broadening participation challenge that will be addressed by
this Pilot is to extend college-level STEM education to incarcerated persons,
who are overwhelmingly minorities from the lowest socioeconomic levels of
American society. Education in general and STEM education in particular equips
students for high-level workforce readiness, offering improved quality of life
for formerly incarcerated persons and their families and contributing to
American economic success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Four major goals of the Pilot are: 1. consolidate and ensure
articulation of STEM A.A. courses in NJ state prisons with a seamless path to
B.A. study at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey; 2. begin teaching new
accredited STEM courses and offering REU and&lt;br/&gt;internship opportunities
to released students; 3. implement tracking of students in STEM courses while
incarcerated and beyond, enabling a supplementary research goal to evaluate
student and teacher performance in comparison with mainstream educational
settings; 4. work&lt;br/&gt;with partners in business, government, non-profit,
development, and public sectors to build a complete STEM pipeline with a long-
term goal of enabling formerly incarcerated students to clear their records
through education and workforce participation in STEM. Implementation of the
goals will proceed as follows. Senior personnel from each of the cooperating
institutions and a jointly-supervised postdoctoral trainee will negotiate the
terms of accreditation and articulation across the state system with our
partner, the lead accreditation institution, Raritan Valley Community College.
Teaching of STEM courses by our established team of volunteers
will&lt;br/&gt;commence as each course is accredited. Our industry and research
partners will begin offering REU and training internships in the first summer.
Educational research professional on the team will guide the design,
implementation, and analysis of student and teacher performance. New partners
will be brought in to the collective from the non-profit, business, and public
sectors to extend the reach and impact of this initiative.
