To understand how axons of nerve cells navigate in particular directions along
defined pathways, the substratum for axonal growth is being examined in the
simple system. Growth of axons can easily be studied in an insect wing where
neurons form a simple, two- dimensional network nestled in the space between two
monolayers of epithelial cells. Transposition of grafts from the upper monolayer
suggests that growing axons are guided in a distal to proximal direction by
graded cues in their epithelial substratum. Using scanning electron microscopy,
the topography of this substratum has been viewed in its entirety. Axons
encounter an increasing density of basal cellular processes as they grow
proximally. The distribution of surface molecules along the neural pathway can
be modulated by extension and retraction of these basal processes. A novel
protein (2F5) found on surfaces of the substratum at the time of axonal
outgrowth is thought to be involved in the interaction of axons with substrata.
This protein has been purified and its ability to promote outgrowth of axons
will be studied using functional assays in situ and scanning electron
microscopy. In addition, an immunosuppression technique will be used to generate
antibodies to other surface proteins that may be involved in axonal pathfinding.
These studies promise to identify novel molecules that play a role in neuronal
development and regeneration, not only in the insect, but in other species, as
well.
