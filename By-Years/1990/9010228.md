One of the most sensational biological phenomena of this century has been the
rapid spread of the so called "Africanized" or "Killer bees" in the Americas. In
the 33 years since their establishment as a feral population in southern Brazil,
African derived bees have colonized all the tropical and subtropical regions of
South and Central America. Tropical North America (Mexico) is now being
colonized and this expanding population will reach the United States in 1990.
Arrival of African honey bees is followed by rapid build-up of a feral
population, numerous stinging incidents involving people and animals,
"Africanization" of apiaries with eventual disappearance of beeswith traits
characteristic of "native" European subspecies, and a decline in beekeeping and
honey production. Movement of feral African bees into areas previously dominated
by European bees provides a unique opportunity to obtain quantitative data on
the changes that occur as these two genetically distinct populations interact.
This research will focus on the population level and within colony processes
that contribute to genetic changes in managed European and feral African
populations. The investigators combine analytical and experimental approaches to
assess "Europeanization" and "Africanization" by measuring the rates of genetic
change with the use of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers. These two
types of genetic information will allow them to establish the relative
contributions of maternal and paternal gene flow to these processes and to
determine where selection is acting most intensely in the system. The results of
this study will provide a comprehensive view of the genetic interactions between
feral and managed honey bee populations. Information obtained in this study also
will be valuable to decision makers charged with development of public policies
and methodologies to control African bees.
