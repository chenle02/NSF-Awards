&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant synthetic biology uses
enabling approaches from engineering and plants as platforms to produce self-
sustaining and photosynthetic driven bioproducts. The emerging field requires
computational modeling and mathematical analysis for designing predictable
biological function. Applications include biofuels, agriculture, bio-materials,
biopharmaceuticals, sustainability and others. There are no forums, however,
whose primary goal is to bring together biologists, scientists and engineers
from the plant synthetic biology and plant bioengineering field to discuss ways
in which their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions in such
fields ad health, environment and energy. In response to this need, a Plant
Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering (ICPSBB) conference is being organized with
the aims to provide a venue for: developing the scientific exchange among plant
synthetic biology and bioengineering researchers, interactions between academic
and industry researchers, active participation and networking of graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers, and bringing scientists and engineers
together for providing an venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and
to motivate new research into barriers limiting the development of engineered
plant-based technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Plant
Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering has emerged as an important
multidisciplinary area of research, that require engineering approaches for
producing self-sustaining and photosynthetic-driven bio-production. The field
relies on several engineering tools such as computational modeling, mathematical
analysis to design predictable biological function and sustainable traits.
Conference technical sessions will bring together scientists of various
disciplines and engineers for examining applications in agriculture,
biopharmaceuticals, biofuels and others.
