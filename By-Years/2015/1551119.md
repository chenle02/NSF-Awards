The proposed work seeks to design a metal organic framework (MOF) that is
oxygen-selective over nitrogen at near ambient temperatures. The combined
studies will assess the feasibility of using a gas-selective, structural
transformation as a means for separations of gases, with a specific focus on
developing a material that retains oxygen selectivity at near-ambient
temperatures.

Oxygen, nitrogen, and air interaction with the oxygen-selective MOF will be
investigated using a combination of in situ FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, as well
as gas diffusivity and adsorption measurements. The spectroscopy studies will
aim to understand which specific gas-substrate chemical interactions lead to an
extended induction period to delay opening of the flexible framework. The
diffusivity and adsorption measurements will elucidate how this is influenced by
a secondary component that drastically differs in affinity to open the
structure. Developing a chemical understanding of the specific gas-surface
interaction that leads to rapid opening will enable the incorporation of
chemical specificity into future material design.
