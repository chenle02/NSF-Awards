9622652 Messac This research planning grant (RPG) project develops a general
method for Real-Time hardware-in-the-loop Controller Design (R Co D) for both
linear and nonlinear plants. The method offers various advantages over
conventional system design approaches since it integrates several system design
activities as well as a physical programming-based computational control method.
The physical programming method is a highly-effective domain independent design
optimization method. The ultimate objectives of this project include the
development of a theoretical basis for R Co D method, its formulation of a
mathematical infrastructure for its application, and an experimental
verification to demonstrate its effectiveness. The effort in this planning grant
project lays the necessary ground work toward this ultimate goal.***
