9409619 McClure With this Career Advancement Award, the Division of Chemistry is
supporting the research of Dr. Cynthia K. McClure of the Department of Chemistry
at Montana State University. Professor McClure will use the award to learn the
background, theory and application of high-level calculations on comlex
molecules. The knowledge gained will then be put to use to design improved
syntheses in the area of organophosphorus chemistry. She will also spend time
learning the best methods of accomplishing and/or increasing the bio-
availability of these types of compounds.
