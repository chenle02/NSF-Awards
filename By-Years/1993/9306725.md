This is a research planning grant to study the interaction of human central
nervous system neurons with rat glia in defined medium in culture. The effects
of cellular interaction in these co-cultures will be studied by monitoring glial
proliferation and differentiation when neurons are added to mixed glial
cultures. This will be assayed by immunocytochemistry with cell-specific
monoclonal antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy will be used to document
the extent of the glial-neuronal interaction in the co-cultures and to document
the presence of myelin. Antibodies against a neuronal protein which acts as a
glial mitogen will be added to the co-cultures to document perturbations in the
glial- neuronal interactions. This work is important because little is known
about the development of myelin in the human brain. Myelin is a fatty covering
around axon; without myelin, animals have difficulty in moving, in sensory
perception, and ultimately in living. It has been hard to study the development
of human brains because until now there has not been available sufficient
numbers of mature human neurons for investigation. These co-cultures use human
neurons derived from a brain tumor along with other brain cells, called glia,
from immature rats. In this way, we can study how human neurons interact with
glia to set up normal brain cellular interactions by examining at a molecular
level the process of myelination.
