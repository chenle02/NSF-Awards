This proposal provides undergraduate student training and support in Documentary
or Field Linguistics for the academic year and summer of 2010-2011. The planned
workshops and training sessions will expose students to a rapidly growing
subfield of linguistics, and provide a means for us to train students in basic
field techniques which are not currently covered in the
curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two workshops will be held during the spring
term, in early January and mid-March after spring break. Workshops will be open
to undergraduates at University of Rochester and advertized through electronic
means to other institutions in the Western NY area. The workshops are in
response to an increasing demand and strong interest in the subfield of Field
Linguistics.
