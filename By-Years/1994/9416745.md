approximately 20 U.S. scientists to attend the 17th Texas Symposium on
Relativistic Astrophysics to be held in Munich, Germany, on December 12-16,
1994. The Texas Symposia take place every other year and serve as an
international summary of recent developments at the interface of astrophysics,
cosmology, relativity, and particle astrophysics. The biannual meetings are held
in different cities in the U.S., and every third (or second) meeting is held in
a foreign country. The meeting is open to all qualified scientists. ***
