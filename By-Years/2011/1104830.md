This research develops theory for random forests specifically for the purpose of
better facilitating its use in practical settings. Theoretical considerations
include balancedness, subtrees, node distributions, node splitting, depth of
variables, and other novel tree concepts. These concepts are used to improve
prediction and variable selection for random forests in both high and low-
dimensional problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the simplest techniques for
improving the performance of a statistical method such as a tree is to take its
average over multiple instances of the data. This averaging process is often
referred to as ensemble learning and has attracted considerable attention as it
has been widely observed that combining elementary learners can yield a
predictor with superior prediction performance. One of the most successful tree
ensemble learners is random forests. Random forests has met with considerable
empirical success, yet much is still unknown about it. This research seeks to
improve our understanding of random forests and utilize this knowledge to
enhance its application in practical settings. This research focuses on
cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death in the developed world,
cancer staging and prognostication for cancer patients, and identifying and
developing genotype signatures for myelodsyplastic syndromes, a heterogeneous
diseases of blood stem cells having no current curative medical therapy.
