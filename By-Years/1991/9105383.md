A central property of living systems is rhythmic periodic activity,
particularly circadian rhythms which are daily cycles. It is not yet clear what
mechanisms entrain and regulate the occurrence and timing of these oscillations.
The primary environmental signal for circadian rhythms is the change in light
intensity associated with dawn and dusk, but the "circadian photoreceptors" that
mediate these responses are still poorly understood. This project is pilot work
to try to get information on this mechanism by using a new marking technique
that labels pathways in the brain. This marker will allow visualizing the
circuit that connects the cells that receive the important light stimulus to the
cells in the brain that regulate the circadian rhythm. One particular strain of
mutant mice has been found to be missing key cellular elements in the eye, yet
still showing a photically driven rhythm. The pathway in this mutant will be
compared to that in normal mice to clarify how the light information gets to the
brain. If this novel marking technique can be made to work well, the results
will be very important to visual science, chronobiology, and neuroscience in
general.
