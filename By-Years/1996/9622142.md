ABSTRACT CTS-9622142 A state-of-the-art, solid-state, three-channel nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is assembled from existing superconducting
magnets and a computer workstation and component parts acquired from this award.
The spectrometer is intended for research on mechanisms of chemical reactions in
solid acids, including adsorption complexes formed in industrially important
reactions in zeolites.
