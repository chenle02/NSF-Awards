The immunologically coupled microelectrode will utilize antibody- mediated
detection of a range of substances. These include toxins and viruses. The
chemical event of antibody-antigen binding is tranduced to an electrical signal
by the microelectrode and the signal is amplified. Rapidity of response will be
greater than in any presently available immunoassay system. The phase of
development which will be supported is the area of detection through chemical
coupling.
