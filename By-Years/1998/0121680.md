EIA-0121680&lt;br/&gt;Warnow, Tandy J&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Research: ITR/AP: Reconstructing
Complex Evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reconstruction of the
evolutionary history of a group of organisms has changed the face of biology and
is being used increasingly in drug discovery, epidemiology, and genetic
engineering. Unfortunately, such reconstructions typically involve solving
difficult optimization problems, so that even moderately large datasets can
require months to years of computation. In addition, almost all evolutionary
reconstructions presently assume that the historical pattern is one of strict
divergence that can be represented by a binary tree. This assumption is
frequently violated, especially by plants which often hybridize readily and thus
produce networks of relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings
together computer scientists and biologists from two institutions to develop new
models and algorithms to address these two problems. Successful completion of
this project will have an enormous impact by providing tools for reconstructing
phylogenies of large datasets, and the first tools for inferring network models
of evolution appropriate to hybridizing speciation. Such network models will
alter how biologists think about speciation, while the development of methods
for large-scale analyses will strongly benefit medical and pharmaceutical
practice. &lt;br/&gt;Information technology will be advanced in fundamental ways
as well, as the project will demonstrate how algorithm design and high-
performance algorithm engineering can jointly solve very difficult discrete
optimization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
