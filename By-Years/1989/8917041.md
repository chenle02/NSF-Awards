This award provides funds to continue CALCRUST (California Consortium for
Crustal Studies) activities for one year. CALCRUST is a regional consortium of
earth scientists from California with a common interest in crustal structure and
evolution. CALCRUST provides a common focus for a multifaceted, crustal-studies
team with expertise ranging from geology to reflection seismology and seismic
data processing. The CALCRUST scientific program is addressing important
questions regarding continental accretionary tectonics, the mechanics of crustal
extension and compression, modes of deformation in the seismogenic regions of
southwestern U.S., the structure of batholiths, and basement tectonics of the
petroliferous basins of coastal California. An important focus is on low-angle
structures -- their geometry and continuity in the subsurface. CALCRUST seeks to
extend to the third dimension our reasonably complete understanding of the
surface geology, and begin the process of establishing relationships between the
apparent diversity of geologic terranes in southwestern U.S. During the period
of this award, the focus will be on completing the analysis and interpretation
of data in hand, both the reprocessing of donated industry data and data
gathered under CALCRUST contract, and the publication of results.
