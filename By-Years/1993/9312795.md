9312795 Dwoskin The purpose of this program is to support an interdisciplinary
team of young American and Polish scientists who will conduct research and
develop models related to energy demand forecasting and conservation assessment,
and their applications for policy development. The investigators' joint analyses
should contribute to an assessment of energy intensity trends and potential
reductions in Polish energy demand by sector, and structural changes in the
Polish economy and associate implications for energy demand. Poland offers
unique opportunities to examine a variety of energy conservation regimes and
technologies tailored to the transition from a command to market economy, with
potential applicability to the entire region. The United States, concerned about
unstable energy prices, uncertain oil supply, and adverse impacts on the
environment from fossil fuel use, has also been compelled to reexamine its
energy and environmental policies.
