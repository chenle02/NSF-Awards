Kanoglu 9705797 This award supports a 12 month Japan Society for the Promotion
of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Utku Kanoglu at Tohoku
University, Sendai, Japan. Dr. Kanoglu will work with Dr. Fumihiko Imamura,
Professor at the Disaster Research Control Center, on a research project
entitled, "Mitigation of Tsunami Disaster Using Numerical Simulation." The
proposed research will investigate the behavior of tsunamis (large oceanic
waves) as they approach and come in contact with coastlines. As questions
relating to patterns of wave accumulation, resonant amplification, and so on
currently remain unanswered and understudied, computational models that simulate
and analyze these processes represent the best method for understanding tsunami
activity. The proposed research will utilize numerical algorithms to analyze the
development, evolution, and conclusion of tsunami activity in three-dimensions,
with the main goal of the research being to create predictive models that will
aid in tsunami forecasting and, thus, mitigate the destruction they cause. ***
