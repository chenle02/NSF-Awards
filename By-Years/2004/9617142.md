Woodbury College requests support from NSF to connect it's campus to the
Internet. Woodbury College, located in Montpelier, VT has approximately 143 non-
traditional adult students. This independent institution offers degrees and
certificates in several social works areas. The college intends to connect
through Plainfield Bypass, a local Internet service provider. The campus needs
the Internet connection to be able to access information resources throughout
the state, the nation and the world. The connection will benefit the faculty,
staff students of this institution as well as the community in general. The
award provides partial support of the project for two years.
