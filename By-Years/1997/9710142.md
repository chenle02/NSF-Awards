Du 9710142 This award supports a two-year collaborative research project between
Dr. Honghua Du of the Stevens Institute of Technology and Dr. Soo Lee of Sun
Moon University in Korea on "Alteration of the Effects of Sintering Additives on
the Oxidation and Tribological Behavior of Silicon Nitride." The study will
investigate the effects of aluminum ion implantation and the addition of alumina
to silicon nitride products sintered with magnesia. Experimentation with surface
and grain boundary chemical characteristics should lead to a better
understanding of their relationship to oxidation and wear properties and to such
basic phenomena as surface or interface reactions, diffusion, and tribochemical
interactions in the silicon nitride ceramic system. This project will combine
the expertise of the Korean team in the processing and sintering of ceramics
with Dr. Du's extensive work on the corrosion resistance of these materials.
Silicon nitride ceramics are used extensively in advanced engines and for other
structural applications. Thus, the oxidation and wear of these ceramics presents
important engineering issues. ***
