9322607 Nowak The objective of the program is to review the current methods and
technology in bridge evaluation, repair and rehabilitation used in Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovak Republic and Hungary. The major areas include: (1) analytical
evaluation of bridges (loads, system identification methods, damage accumulation
models, time history models), (2) bridge management systems (optimization
models, decision making strategy, BMS data set, bridge expert systems, strategic
long range planning, (3) diagnostic procedures (bridge tests, weigh-9n-motion,
performance monitors, nondestructive techniques, signal processing, integrated
sensor systems, microwave, acoustic and optical techniques), (4) materials and
techniques for repair and rehabilitation of bridges (steel, reinforced and
prestressed concrete, masonry arches, timber, new materials). Accordingly the
Bridge Study tour will attempt to review state of the art summary of main topics
as reviewed on one hand in the U. S. and, on the other hand, in Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovak Republic and Hungary, identify the research needs, in
particular topics for cooperative projects; and derive some recommendations that
reflect the need in manpower, technology transfer and education for the near
future. The Study Tour will involve the US group of bridge researchers,
consultants and representatives of bridge authorities, visiting Poland, Czech
Republic, Slovak Republic and Hungary. the local organizers will organize
special conferences, meetings and field trips to the construction sites. The
results will be presented in the report. ***
