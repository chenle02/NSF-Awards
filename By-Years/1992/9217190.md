A cooperative program combining experimental ionospheric observations with
mathematical theory and modeling is proposed involving the Atmospheric Sciences
research group at the MIT Haystack Observatory and Russian scientists at Moscow
State University and the Polar Geophysical Institute in Murmansk. The Russian
participants have developed the theoretical methods and radio receiving
equipment for phase-difference ionospheric tomography and have performed
preliminary experiments in Russia which have provided an initial verification of
these techniques. In order to calibrate the resolution and accuracy of the
method, however, experiments done in conjunction with simultaneous direct
ionospheric observations are needed. A cooperative research program between
scientists and engineers in the US and Russia is proposed to carry out a series
of tomographic experiments in 1993 along the N-S meridian through Millstone
Hill, Massachusetts. In conjunction with direct ionospheric observations made by
the US participants with the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar, an array
of Russian-built ground-base satellite receivers will be deployed to investigate
ionospheric structure using tomographic techniques. The joint research will
serve to both calibrate and improve the tomographic deconvolution using the
phase-difference technique and will address the ability of radio tomography to
image small-scale ionospheric structures, beyond the resolution capability of
the radar.
