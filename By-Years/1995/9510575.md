ABSTRACT CTS-9510575 This joint effort between the University of California at
Berkeley, Exxon Corporation and the Metropolitan Autonomous University at
Iztapalapa, Mexico, involves the synthesis and characterization of solid
"superacids" based on tungsten oxide dispersed as isolated species, clusters, or
films on the surface of zirconia or titania. Previous work has shown that
tungsten oxide on zirconia has catalytic activity for isomerization of higher
alkanes without the cracking caused by other "superacids". In order to improve
the catalytic activity, higher surface areas are desirable. This work includes
detailed study of the solid-state processes involved in the precipitation of
high-surface-area zirconium and titanium oxides and in the dispersion of
tungstate groups on their surfaces. Structural studies are performed using X-ray
diffraction and absorption techniques, electron microscopy, and infrared and
Raman spectroscopies; acid-site densities and chemistry are probed using site
titrations and catalytic reactions of propylene and dimethylcyclohexane. These
studies are complemented with mechanistic studies using in-situ infrared
spectroscopy and isotope jump techniques. Branched alkanes have great value as
octane enhancers in gasoline, lubricant components, and chemical feedstocks.
Traditionally, these have been made using one of several processes employing
liquid acids, but it is generally accepted that these processes will soon be
replaced by new processes using solid acids. Among the advantages sought in this
move are easier containment, less corrosiveness, environmental benignity, and
improved selectivity. This effort is supported jointly by the Chemical Reaction
Processes Program (CTS), the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program (DMR),
and the Americans Program (INT). ***
