The primary goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the first laser
device that operates without population inversion, thereby resolving the ongoing
discussion regarding the necessity of inversion. The system considered here is
based on intersubband transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. If
successful, the proposed device will present a breakthrough in the search for
coherent optical devices in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Due to the difficulty of inverting the subband populations, laser
devices in this region- with important applications in atmospheric sensing and
pollution monitoring- have so far been elusive. Therefore, the class of
inversionless laser amplifiers and oscillators that we propose to demonstrate
will provide a new perspective on how to make infrared lasers that are
compatible with the semiconductor technology. The implications of the proposed
research is therefore twofold: 1) The first experimental demonstration of a new
principle that alters the way we think about lasers; and 2) A novel approach to
the realization of lasers and nonlinear infrared sources with wavelengths in the
2 micrometers to 100 micrometers region.
