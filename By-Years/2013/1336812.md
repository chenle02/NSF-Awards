Objective: The objective of this program is to build institutional terahertz
research capacity and capabilities through the acquisition of a terahertz vector
network analyzer. The proposed instrument measures network parameters of the
electrical circuit and provides information regarding S-parameters, noise
figure, gain compression, intermodulation, harmonic distortion, conversion
gain/loss, and signal integrity information of the device, components, and
materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of
the program is enabling terahertz research and research training in various
areas including high power terahertz device, terahertz tunable components and
materials, terahertz magnetic nanostructures, terahertz antiferromagnetic
material, bio tissue characterization, terahertz imaging, and terahertz active
materials research. Promising basic research concepts in terahertz area can be
experimentally demonstrated which will lead to innovations and advancement of
terahertz technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The broader impacts
of the program include enabling research and education in terahertz frequency
range and bringing community together through the increased access to the
instrument from various entities. By engaging five major universities in
Colorado, research collaboration in terahertz technology will lead to a new area
of multidisciplinary basic research and education. Through instrument share,
educational and research opportunities for southern Colorado residents including
ethnic minority and women can be increased where there is a large educational
achievement gap between different ethnicity.
