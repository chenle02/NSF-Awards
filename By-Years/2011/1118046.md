Portable storage devices such as USB flash drives have become virtually
ubiquitous in daily life. They are as useful to students in college as to a
soldier transferring data in a combat theater. However, the security risks posed
by using these devices are all too real: after malicious code on a flash drive
infected operational networks, allowing a mass exfiltration of classified data
subsequently posted to Wikileaks, the Department of Defense banned these
devices. The security vulnerabilities exposed by these events are of concern far
beyond the military and extend to any user of portable storage. While numerous
attempts have been made to secure hosts from malicious devices, very little
research has considered the symmetrical problem of ensuring the protection of
sensitive data from potentially compromised hosts, nor the security of the USB
bus itself.

This project examines the factors contributing to the vulnerability of portable
storage devices and consider a new framework for modeling and evaluating the
security of these devices. We will consider the security of the storage devices
themselves, the hosts they attach to, and the USB interface that transports the
data. We consider methods of monitoring the integrity of attached hosts, and
examine how to establish and manage host identity. We propose applications based
on these devices, such as maintaining provenance and forensic information on
stored data, and new frameworks supporting information flow for further
enforcing finer-grained access protections. Such advances will ensure that flash
drives and hosts they attach to remain safe and secure.
