The condensed matter physics project will focus on self-assembly methods for
fabricating nanostructures with one-dimensional order. Particular emphasis is
placed on achieving atomically-precise structures, such as a chain of atoms as
the ultimate nanowire. Silicon surfaces are chosen as templates because silicon
is the natural interface for connecting nanodevices to microdevices and because
of the wealth of processing methods developed for silicon technology. The
following goals will be pursued: (1) Produce atomic chains on silicon with
tailored properties, such as dimensionality, metallicity, and magnetism; (2) Map
energy bands and Fermi surfaces of atomic chains by angle-resolved photoemission
and search for predicted exotic states in one dimension; and (3) Explore
fundamental limits of data storage at the atomic scale, using self-assembled
tracks at surfaces. The budget is primarily devoted to the education of graduate
students. They will gain expertise in the field of nanotechnology that will
serve them well for careers in academia, industry, and government. A course on
nanoscience and technology is under development that aims at a web-based, up-to-
date introduction to new and exciting developments in this rapidly-evolving
field. This project can be expected to have impact on the fabrication methods
for new materials in microelectronics, particularly in self-assembled storage
media.

The goal of this project is the design of artificial materials with one-
dimensional character, for example chains of metal atoms at silicon surfaces. An
atom chain represents the ultimate nanowire. The wave functions of the electrons
in atomic wires will be determined in order to explain conductivity in one
dimension, where exotic phenomena are predicted. This project can be expected to
have impact on the fabrication methods for new materials in microelectronics,
particularly in data storage. The self-assembly methods developed during this
project enable mass-production of nanowires and patterned storage media on
silicon and extend silicon technology down to the single nanometer regime. By
going all the way to the atomic limit it is possible to achieve structures with
atomic perfection, such as a memory with tracks exactly 5 atoms wide and a
single atom storing one bit. The proposed budget is primarily for the support of
graduate students, including summer projects for beginning graduate students,
undergraduates, and high school students. They will gain expertise in the field
of nanotechnology that will serve them well for careers in academia, industry,
and government.
