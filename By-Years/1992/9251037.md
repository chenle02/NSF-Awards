The Interactive Mathematics Text Project (IMTP) of the Mathematics Association
of America has as its goal the increased use of interactive texts in mathematics
education. To this end, the IMTP provides instruction to potential authors of
texts and provides support to selected developers of these texts. The IMTP has
established six sites located throughout the country at two and four year
colleges. Individuals will be selected from the IMTP workshop attendees during
the summer of 1992 and again during the summer of 1993 to continue work on their
text. Proposed are three conferences to bring together text developers, experts
on the various authoring platforms, and IMTP Advisory Board members. At these
conferences the developers will have the opportunity of collaborating with each
other. The goal of this project is the completion of a minimum of ten texts and
an increase in the pool of potential interactive text authors.
