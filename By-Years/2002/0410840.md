Engineering-Engineering Technology (58) Infusion of Flexible Manufacturing
System (FMS) technology is improving the undergraduate education curricula in
the area of Manufacturing Technology, Electrical/Electronics Technology and
Computer Aided Design &amp; Graphics in the Department of Industrial and
Engineering Technology at Morehead State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
project is adapting Purdue's Flexible Manufacturing System by using a MiniCIM
3.2 Flexible Manufacturing System from Amatrol. The project is (1) using a
systematic approach for planning, developing and evaluating the courses related
to Flexible Manufacturing Systems, with a focus on demonstrations, class and
senior projects, and laboratory exercises; and (2) incorporating Computer
Integrated Manufacturing Technology laboratory strategy into class and senior
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student assessment and project evaluations are
being conducted at each stage of the project to ensure that student-learning is
improving by demonstrating that (1) students are becoming more proficient in
fundamental concepts and applications of robotics and automation in Flexible
Manufacturing Systems; (2) students are gaining technical skills and knowledge
using innovative software within Flexible Manufacturing Systems; and (3) a
hands-on approach is addressing the diversity of students' learning styles,
including women and underrepresented students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
is having a broad impact on undergraduate students within Morehead State
University's service region by increasing the availability of highly trained
engineering and technology graduates. Two-year community and technical colleges
are using the equipment in scheduled laboratory classes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
