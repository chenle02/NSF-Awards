This action funds core support for the Board on Life Sciences of the National
Academy of Sciences. The Board provides advice to government and the scientific
community on the biological sciences and their impact on society. Its work
encompasses all of the life sciences, from molecular genetics to ecology. With
the help of hundreds of biologists and other experts, the Board serves as a
focal point for examining a wide range of technical and policy issues, from
maintaining progress in individual life science disciplines to fostering
interactions among disciplines to promote synergistic advances, and from
improving training and career retention in the biological sciences to assessing
the societal implications of developments in biological science and technology.
Three current areas of emphasis for the Board are the health of the biological
sciences and biology education, biotechnology and genetics, and biodiversity and
ecology. Core funding from NSF makes it possible for the Board on Life Sciences
to pursue the development of ideas for new studies, particularly in the areas of
ecology, environmental biology, and biodiversity conservation.
