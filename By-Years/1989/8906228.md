Many kinds of mites and insects, including numerous pests of crops and
livestock, feed on only a single kind of plant or animal, or a few closely
related kinds. Sometimes genetic changes, including the origination of new
species, produce a shift in the diet of these mites and insects, creating new
pest problems. The proposed work will investigate how a group of mite species
that feed on particular plants originated from ancestors that fed on different
kinds of plants. In addition, the question of why these mites are so specific in
their feeding habits will be studied. Because a great deal is already known
about the ecology and behavior of this group of mites, a study of their genetic
history is likely to be especially valuable to our understanding of basic
principles of how mites and insects become specialized in their feeding habits,
and how these habits may change.
