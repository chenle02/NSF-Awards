This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
low cost, multifunctional energy harvesting and storage device. The single
device can harvest both light and RF (radio frequency) into electricity and
store the energy in the same device with 3-D architecture. Due to the single
substrate and simplified, low cost processes, the cost of ownership will be
reduced largely. The implementation of a low cost process of inkjet printers
will further reduce the cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project includes applications in wireless sensor network,
RFIDs, industrial process monitoring, supply chain management, security, medical
monitoring, remote and hazardous environment monitoring, and wearable
electronics. The success of this project will enable the above applications to
gain greater market acceptance, reduce energy demand from non-renewable sources,
and hence help establishing the leadership of the U.S. in the area.
