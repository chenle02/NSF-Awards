Ying The research develops statistical models, methodologies and related theory
to address issues arising from design, modeling and analysis of survival data,
which are often subject to censoring, truncation and/or other types of
missingness. It introduces new hazard-based regression models for survival data
that extend and complement the standard proportional hazards regression, and yet
still possess essential good features that the latter has. Besides the usual
right-censored data, it also provides solutions to such important and difficult
problems as interval censoring, random effects and multivariate survival times
by exploiting model variation and developing suitable analytic tools. It
involves finding computationally convenient representations and establishing
sharp theoretical properties for the analysis of discrete (survival) data,
particularly of those that can be summarized by two-by-two or more general
contingency tables. New methods and theory tailored to retrospective studies,
which are often summarized as the case-control and case-cohort regression
problems, are also developed. Survival data are collected in many scientific
investigations, including biomedical follow-up studies, industrial life tests,
study of economic durations, astronomy, demography among others. Development of
suitable statistical methods is crucial to handling of such data so that valid
scientific conclusions can be derived. This project develops several novel
approaches, some of which are suitable for identification of health related risk
factors, such as exposure to hazardous environment, consumption of certain foods
etc., and others are applicable to evaluation of therapeutic effects as well
cost effectiveness of medical treatments. These new methods may impact other
areas of public and scientific interests, an example of which is the study of
factors influencing unemployment duration.
