During June 1987 the NOAA research vessels OCEANOGRAPHER and RESEARCHER will
complete a zonal section across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to Custralia at
about 15 S. The cruises are part of the Transport of Equatorial Waters (TEW)
experiment, a component of ongoing EPOCS and TOGA programs, and will provide
data to determine the fluxes of water and heat across the section. This grant
will provide funds to make shipboard analysis phosphate, nitrite, nitrite, and
silicate during these cruises. The nutrients will be used to trace the general
ocean circulation to determine the zonal extent of nitrogen deficient waters in
the South Pacific and answer specific questions on the gnobal also provide
ground coverage for future studies of the circulation and ocean fluxes, like
WOCE and GOFS. The principal investigators are eminently qualified to carry out
this task. Codispoti and Barber have long records of work on the nitrogen and
carbon cycles in the ocean.
