This research concerns the development of mathematical models integrating
demographic and genetic mechanisms affecting the ecological and evolutionary
dynamics of biological communities, including speciation, extinction, and
phenotypic differentiation among populations and species. Research on these
processes is usually pursued by independent investigators and relatively little
effort has been made to understand their interactions. Integrating population
demography with population genetic theory will be performed by employing
established mathematical methods for describing and analyzing processes
incorporating both deterministic and random components. The models will be
applied to analyze data on several different groups of animals and plants using
a variety of statistical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improved knowledge of
community dynamics and diversification is increasingly important as human
population increases, with concomitant destruction and fragmentation of natural
habitats, and consequent loss of biodiversity. The ability of societies to
preserve and restore mechanisms generating and maintaining biological diversity
will significantly impact quality of both human and animal life in the coming
decades and centuries. This research includes a substantial training component
for graduate students, and a network of national and international
collaborators. Results of the research will be widely disseminated in public
lectures, peer-reviewed scientific publications, and educational materials for
undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;
