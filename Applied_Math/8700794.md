This project is concerned with mathematical methods in the studies of acoustic
waves. Wave propagation is a means of moving energy from one region to another.
When the wave amplitudes are sufficiently small, as occurs in many problems,
then the motion is adequately described by a linearized theory of wave
propagation. Thus, the classical theories of wave propagation in
acoustics,optics, electromagnetics, elastic solids, etc. are linearized
theories. When the geometry, material properties and source structures are
simple it may then be possible to solve wave propagation problems explicitly.
However, for realistic situations and hence more complicated problems it is
necessary to employ asymptotic, perturbation, numerical and other approximate
methods to solve wave propagation problems. The purposes of this research
project are to develop and apply asymptotic, perturbation and numerical methods
to wave propagation problems of scientific and engineering significance, and to
study specific physical problems that are basic to future progress in wave
propagation. Some of the present effort represents a continuation and
elaboration on past work. Professor Reiss is a well known authority on wave
propagation and Professor Kriegsmann is his younger talented partner. They
constitute an excellent, very productive team. This research falls into the
general area of asymptotic methods and perturbation theory in applied
mathematics, which constitute an active and practical trend in applied
mathematics research. Many of the results obtained by these researchers have
direct engineering applications in acoustics, radar, sonar and in the studies of
electromagnetic wave propagation.
