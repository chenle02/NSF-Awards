This award, funded jointly the Biological Sciences Division of Molecular and
Cellular Biosciences and the Engineering Division of Chemical, Biological,
Environmental, and Transport Systems Division, will bring together leading
scientists and bioengineers from the US and India to develop an optimize
cellular systems for the productions of industrially relevant chemicals and
products using approaches derived from theoretical principles of biology and
engineering. One of the anticipated outcomes will be the development of parallel
strategic partnerships for research collaborations and student and postdoctoral
exchange opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held March
18-20, 2016 at the India Institute of Technology in Mumbai, India. Approximately
30 senior researchers with expertise in the fields of systems and synthetic
biology from the US and India will be in attendance in addition to researchers
from select Asian countries. The outcomes of this workshop is to develop
strategic collaborative and educational opportunities in addition to creating an
infrastructure that will be necessary to realize the overarching goals of this
workshop.
