9304849 Cox Polysphondylium pallidum forms distinctive spatial patterns during
its life cycle. One of these patterns, the radial arrangement of spore bearing
arms, arises from a spheroidal mass of cells at the base of the developing
organism. The emergence of the radial pattern form a spheroidal one is a true
symmetry breaking event which Dr. Cox studies by examining the structure and
function of the genes involved. The genes coding for patterning elements are
isolated by a gene trapping method and used to study the timing and regulation
of their transcripts during development. The long range goal of this research is
an understanding of morphogenesis in a simple system with a view to relating the
various contributions made by cell-cell interactions, the roles played by
diffusible chemical signals and their receptors, and the contributions of
intercellular adhesion and cell movement. ***
