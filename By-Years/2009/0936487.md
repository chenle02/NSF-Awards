Instinctive computing is a computational simulation of biological and cognitive
instincts.&lt;br/&gt;Instincts profoundly influence how we see, feel, appear,
think, and act. If as society we want a computer to be genuinely secure,
intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the
ability to recognize, understand, and even to have primitive instincts. In this
crosscut workshop, the PI will explore transformational developments in this
area, including&lt;br/&gt;the building blocks for instinctive computing systems
and potential applications such as security, privacy, human-computer
interaction, next generation networks, and product design. The funding will
cover the costs for invited outstanding students to present their prototypes and
to interact with leading researchers in this area. This workshop will have
broader impacts on many disciplines including philosophy, robotics, computer
science, cognition science, computer networks, security, information privacy,
cybernetics and electrical and computer engineering. It transforms isolated
applications into an academic field. It serves as an incubator for young
students to explore new approaches from diverse fields. The Program Committee
will encourage outstanding undergraduates, especially women and minority
students, to participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;
