Northern Essex Community College (NECC) is developing a new science curriculum
to enable students to enter the workforce as skilled laboratory technicians or
to transfer to a four-year college or university. The new science curriculum
includes a core that focuses on data analysis skills, basic and analytical
chemistry techniques, troubleshooting skills, and discipline related molecular
biology, chemistry, and field analysis techniques. Students then build on this
foundation to pursue a specific discipline; either analytical chemistry,
biotechnology, or environmental sciences. The intellectual merit of this project
lies in the creation of a number of new science courses that use the latest
techniques in biotechnology, environmental sciences, and analytical chemistry to
form a new Associate's Degree in Applied Science. The broader impact of the
project is found in its targeting the large and growing population of Hispanic
students in the area and addressing the particular needs thse ESL students. In
doing so it prepares underrepresented students for technical jobs in local
industries, provides alternative pathways for student transfer, and serves
regional industries by providing them with skilled technical workers.
