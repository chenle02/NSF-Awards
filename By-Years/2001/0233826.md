This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will support Dr. Nicole Bennett in
developing a research program in efficient organo-metallic synthesis at Hope
College. The specific objective of this research will be to develop little used
synthetic procedures to prepare taxane diterpenes, a class of compounds that
have found use as anticancer agents. This project will allow Dr. Bennett to
expand the repertory of undergraduate research projects at Hope, especially in
the areas of synthetic organometallic chemistry, stereochemistry and structure
interpretation by magnetic resonance. The project will also support Dr.
Bennett's efforts to incorporate modern synthetic chemical techniques in the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Hope College and will provide chemistry
undergraduates at the college with experience in specialized synthetic chemical
procedures, advanced chemical structural concepts, use of the chemical
literature, presentation of research results, etc. that will better prepare them
for graduate training in the field.
