Dr. Bixby will examine the molecular basis of neuronal process growth by
addressing two questions: First, what cell surface and extracellular matrix
molecules act as growth and guidance cues for axons? Second, what are the
intracellular (second messenger-related) events induced by these extracellular
molecules that influence axonal growth? To answer the first question, a tissue
culture system will be employed in which axons grow on sections of embryonic
limb. Antibodies to extracellular matrix and cell surface adhesion molecules
will be added to the cultures to determine which molecules specifically affect
axonal growth. To answer the second question, neurons will be grown on artficial
substrates consisting of certain purified substrate molecules. Axon growth will
be assayed in the presence and absence of pharmacological agents that
specifically affect the function of particular intracellular message systems.
These experiments will provide evidence relating to the cascade of events
stimulated by the binding of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules to
their neuronal receptors. The results will enhance knowledge of both the
extrinsic regulatory molecules that influence growth during development, and the
intracellular signaling systems triggered by these regulatory molecules.
