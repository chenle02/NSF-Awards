This project is designed to enhance the curriculum in the undergraduate physical
chemistry laboratory which is largely populated by chemistry majors and other
pre-professional students in the sciences and engineering. The focus is on
upgrading infrared (IR) spectroscopic and laser instrumentation of the type
widely used in modern research, testing, and quality control laboratories. This
ILI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas to acquire Fourier Transform
IR and laser instrumentation that will be used to enhance undergraduate
laboratory instruction.
