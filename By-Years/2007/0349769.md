This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
nanocrystalline diamond coatings on tungsten-carbide cutting tools with
technical attributes that surpass the current generation of chemical vapor
deposited (CVD) diamond coatings as well as tools made from polycrystalline
diamond (PCD) wafers. The problem with CVD diamond coatings for cutting tools is
poor surface finish and weak adhesion. Nanocrystalline CVD diamond deposited
using microwave plasma (MP) techniques overcomes these problems with a smooth
finish that is well adhered. This makes the nanocrystalline diamond a potential
competitor to PCD diamond by lowering the price and increasing productivity. The
research proposed for Phase II will use a 30kW MP-CVD reactor to investigate the
relationships between nanocrystalline structure and technical performance. The
structure will be controlled by process variables. Technical performance will be
measured by mechanical testing and field testing on the proposed target
application of machining cast aluminum-silicon alloy. The anticipated technical
result will be direct correlations between structure, properties and performance
that can be used to optimize nanocrystalline diamond coatings for machining
automotive drive-train components.

Commercial applications of nanocrystalline diamond coatings are far reaching due
to applications in the cutting tool industry that promote the use of hard-to-
finish advanced materials; applications in pulp and paper for cutting and
guides, applications in textiles for guides and applications in various bearing
surface applications such as deep-well oil drill-head bearings. The National
Institute of Health is also sponsoring research on nanocrystalline diamond
applications in biomedical hardware surfaces subject to wear. Additionally,
environmental impact of cutting fluid and related waste from machining processes
are driving manufacturers to implement dry machining processes. MP-CVD
nanocrystalline diamond tooling is the ideal tool for dry machining nonferrous
materials.
