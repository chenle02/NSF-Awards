An extremely sensitive, low power, high durability solid state sensor system
for field analysis of groundwater pollution is proposed. When successfully
developed, it will result in an important new capability for locating and
monitoring trace organic species in the groundwater environment. The objective
of the proposed program is to build on ongoing sensor and surface chemistry
research at TPL so that the proposed sensor system can yield practical results
in several areas, including: an improved understanding of the levels of organic
chemicals at a pollution site, an automated mechanism for monitoring the
migration of pollutants, a rapid and accurate assessment technique to assess the
effects of purification technologies employed to mitigate hazardous waste
problems. The proposed research should result in a new sensor system with
significant capabilities necessary for enhanced understanding of the causes and
effects of groundwater pollution and the efficacy of treatments to repair the
damage.
