The principal investigator will study actions of groups on noncommutative rings
in various settings. In particular, he will investigate actions of tori and
other algebraic groups on polynomial identity algebras. This research is in the
general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic object having both an
addition and a multiplication defined on it. Although the additive operation
satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is not required to
do so. An example of a ring for which multiplication is not commutative is the
collection of nxn matrices over the integers. The study of noncommutative rings
has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing significance
to other branches of mathematics and physics.
