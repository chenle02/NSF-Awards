With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Romsted will
investigate the chemical environment inside a matrix of polypeptides which have
been assembled on a surfactant surface. In this endeavor, a molecular
probe(benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate salt) will be coalesced as part of the
assembly. When activated, the probe molecule will decompose to form covalent
bonds with its nearest neighbors. In so doing, the chemical components near the
probe molecule will be irreversibly trapped and can be measured quantitatively.
Results of these experiments should provide, for the first time, quantitative
concentrations of counterions, alcohols and waters of hydration inside
polypeptide matrices. This is significant in that the chemical environment
inside an assembly differs from that in the bulk solution. Since these cavities
are where reactions occur, a better understanding of reactive region should
benefit researchers who design new drugs and need to understand how reactions
occur. These types of matrices are models for biological reaction assemblies
such as membranes and micelles. Biological systems assemble molecular arrays to
form cavities where reactions occur with ease. That is , the reactants and the
charge distributions are prearranged so as to facilitate the reaction processes.
Thus, a more thorough understanding of these reaction zones, which this project
addresses, should provide scientists with the knowledge to make better drugs, to
build artificial reaction zones and better cope with diseases. This proposed
project has considerable potential and significance.
