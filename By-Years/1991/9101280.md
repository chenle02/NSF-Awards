Funds are provided for updated computing resources for the Woods Hole
Oeanographic Institution's Ocean Bottom Seismology group. OBSs are used for a
broad range of studies, including tomographic experiments, microearthquakes
measurements, deep.towed explosive seismology, etc. The new resources will allow
the group to transition between a VAX.based to SUN.based system, effecting many
users of this facility.
