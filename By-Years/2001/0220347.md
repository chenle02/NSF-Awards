Simulation and visualization technologies that have become fundamental to
contemporary science, engineering, design, and medicine have made possible new
ways of seeing and knowing and thereby can change the way practitioners think.
This project will explore these processes as they are experienced by scientific
and engineering professionals and the ways in which these new technologies
reconfigure their professional identities. Five professional fields in which
practitioners use simulation and visualization technologies will be examined:
archaeologists working telerobotically in deep water; weapons scientists running
simulations; neuroscientists imaging the brain; physical chemists analyzing
nanoparticles with atomic force microscopy; and architects building in the
virtual world. The methods include field interviews, oral histories, and
workshops. Fundamental questions, approaches and techniques will be developed
for further research and teaching. It is also expected that professional
practice will be illuminated in a way that is helpful to researchers and
designers in the development of ever more appropriate technologies.
