This Collections project provides peer reviewed high-quality resources to
support the community of undergraduate statistics teachers. Organizational
leadership for the effort rests with the Consortium for the Advancement of
Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE), involving thirty diverse
institutions and a large diverse group of reviewers and associate editors.
Emphasis is placed on resources that have been shown through evidence-based
research to improve student learning. CAUSEweb is collaborating with MERLOT
(Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching) to develop a
consistent and informative review process and with the Eisenhower National
Clearinghouse to develop federated searching capabilities and other bridges to
the full set of NSDL projects.
