The project is to use remote technology in real-time to enhance nanotechnology
education and training, with a goal to accelerate exposure of students in grades
10-14 to the nanotechnology field and to potential careers as nanotechnicians.
The project promotes the use of remote technology and nanotechnology education
in community colleges and high schools throughout Illinois by focusing on the
following key activities: 1) training faculty to use lab and remote technology
that permits real-time experimentation when they return to their own
institutions, 2) developing and implementing new nanotechnology curriculum and
labs in existing STEM courses, 3) encouraging the formation of nanotechnology
2+2 partnerships across the state, and 4) evaluating the effects of the new
curriculum and labs on the outcomes of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The remote
technology has the potential to be transformative in bringing previously
unavailable pedagogy into more classrooms. Exposure to nanotechnology at the
high school and community college level encourages more students to explore the
field in subsequent post-secondary education. The program design is based on
proven models and involves participants in a statewide partnership that enhances
collaboration and scientific inquiry. Collaboration with the Illinois Science
and Technology Coalition and IL STEM Learning Exchange ensures outreach to
traditionally underserved institutions and the program design makes it easily
accessible to colleges and schools throughout the region.
