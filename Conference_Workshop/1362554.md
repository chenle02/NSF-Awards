This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of US participants in
the international conference "Perspectives of Modern Complex Analysis" that will
be held July 21-25, 2014, at the Mathematical Research and Conference Center
(MRCC) in Bedlewo, Poland.

The overarching theme of this event is the celebration of the many contributions
of Alexandre Eremenko to mathematical analysis in general and to complex
analysis in particular. The scientific program will cover a large number of
topics, including the following: classical complex analysis and potential
theory; iteration theory of real, rational, and entire functions; real algebraic
geometry. There will be three plenary speakers: Mario Bonk, Misha Sodin, and
Alexander Volberg. The conference program provides ample opportunity for
graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
