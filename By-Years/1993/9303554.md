This research will focus on martingales and related classes of stochastic
processes and their applications, including applications to other parts of
mathematics. Concrete problems will be studied whose solutions will be
applicable in statistical and mathematical analysis. At the same time, general
methods will be sought that may help to solve some of the concrete problems that
will arise in the study of stochastic integrals, singular integral operators,
and the geometry of Banach spaces. The goal of the proposed research is to solve
specific problems in mathematical and statistical analysis, and to develop
general methods that will aid in the solution of similar problems, not yet
foreseen, that will arise in the future. The work supported by previous grants
has led to new mathematical tools that have applications in industry, science,
and technology. In all likelihood, the proposed research will yield more new
tools as well as sharpen old ones.
