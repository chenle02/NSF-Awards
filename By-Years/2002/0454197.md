Abstract: The investigators will conduct a planning activity for a corpus
supporting research on authorship attribution. Planning activities include
surveying existing resources and determining what practitioners need; assessing
the costs of obtaining, cleaning, annotating, distributing and maintaining a
test corpus, conducting a workshop to assess the plans. The workshop builds on
the activities of a Working Group that is already discussing research in this
area. Applications of reliable and valid authorship attribution include literary
scholarship, intelligence, criminal law, civil law, and computer security.
