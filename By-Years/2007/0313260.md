This project aims to build a MetaIntegrator for integrating databases on the
Internet. To realize large-scale integration over this "deep Web," the research
pursues the "shallow integration" philosophy, which does not rely on deep
semantic annotations or deep probing of sources. In particular, it takes a
holistic approach, which essentially leverages the challenge of large-scale
itself as an opportunity, by resorting to hidden statistical regularities for
enabling shallow integration. Specifically, this project focuses on three tasks:
(1) Deep Web survey: To characterize the nature of the deep Web (as pertinent to
semantic integration), this project extensively surveys databases on the Web.
(2) Source selection: Since there are so many potential sources, "what sources
should be involved in answering a given query?" This project thus develops the
dynamic selection of sources for matching a query. (3) Schema integration: Since
sources are heterogeneous, in querying the problem "how does an attribute in one
source correspond to that in another?" Needs to be resolved. This project thus
studies the matching and unification of schemas across myriad sources.
Information on this project will be posted on the Web
(http://eagle.cs.uiuc.edu/metaquerier) and the results are expected to have
broad impact by advancing the understanding of dynamic, large-scale integration
and develop a set of general techniques, and constructing a MetaIntegrator for
providing access to (selected domains of) the deep Web. These fundamental
results are likely to have technology transfer into a broad spectrum of Web
applications.
