The PI proposes to study Planar Flow Casting and Melt-spinning processes for the
manufacture of rapidly-solidified metal foils. The major heat transfer, fluid
mechanics, and phase change phenomena governing these processes will be
investigated via both experiments and numerical modelling. In parallel, the
corresponding solidification kinetics and the resulting microstructure and
mechanical properties of the foils will be analyzed.
