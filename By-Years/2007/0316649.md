Ferman Chavez, Department of Chemistry, Oakland University, is supported by the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his research
program in modeling the active site of iron-dependent superoxide dismutase. The
metal-binding site typically contains three nitrogen donors and one oxygen donor
derived from the amino acid side chain along with a hydroxide ligand to afford a
trigonal bipyramidal geometry. He will design and synthesize organic ligands
that mimic this binding site, and then add iron and study the coordination
structure and reactivity of the resultant complexes. By studying small molecule
models, we can gain insight into metalloenzyme
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Superoxide dismutase enzymes are ubiquitous in
biological systems and protect living systems from the oxidative damage of
superoxide by rapidly converting it into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Different
metals can be involved in this class of enzymes: mammalian enzymes require
copper and zinc or manganese while iron-containing superoxide dismutases are
found in anaerobic prokaryotes. This award is made under the &lt;br/&gt;Minority
Research Planning Grant Program and is intended to strengthen the proposal
writing and planning capabilities of new investigators and to facilitate
preliminary studies and other planning activities related to the research.
