This project provides resources for the procurement of equipment to support
robotics research at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Current research is
directed toward the application of optimal and adaptive control to robotics.
Additional work in learning control and cooperating robots is also in progress.
Continued progress in this project requires the availability of robot hardware,
comprising two arms with two joints each and a computerized control system for
each arm. Research requirements dictate that the arms should be fast and fairly
massive. The "Berkeley" arm developed at the University of California at
Berkeley meets these requirements, and is much less costly than similar
commercially available arms. A major part of the resources provided herein is
for funding to purchase the necessary parts to construct two "Berkeley" arms.
Also provided are a computer and support equipment to enable testing of robot
controllers.
