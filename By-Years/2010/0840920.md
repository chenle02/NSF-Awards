This small request from Landau, to fund students and young researchers to attend
the Conference on Computational Physics and the associated satellite meeting in
Ouro Preto, Brazil this August, is very worth of funding by NSF. This is the
major meeting in computational physics, held every year here or abroad. It
contains the right mix of people for scientists interested in this
interdisciplinary field to become educated on what is happening in omputational
physics. I recommend that the Division proceed with the funding of the proposal
at the requested level of $17,000 and without external review. The PAM states
that, Proposals for conferences, symposia, and workshops, subject to the
following guidelines:proposals up to $50,000 do not require external merit
review, but rather are subject to the judgment and recommendation of the Program
Officer. Note that all of the funds for this are coming from from CCF in CISE
and DMS in MPS. The funding profile is $7,000 from DMS, code 03040100-1271 and
$10,000 from CCF code 05010000-2865.
