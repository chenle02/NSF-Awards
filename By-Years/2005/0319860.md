This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop the initial component of a cognitive structure for a robotic scrub
technician in the operating room. The scrub technician will maintain a tray of
instruments, handing an instrument to the surgeon when requested and retrieving
the instrument when the surgeon is finished with it. The opportunity is to
reduce hospital personnel costs and alleviate a critical nursing shortage
problem. The problem is to provide the robot with situational awareness
comparable to an experienced human scrub technician, particularly in the ability
to anticipate the surgeon's next request. The objective of the project is to
determine the feasibility of using artificial intelligence and statistical
techniques to provide this ability. The research method will compare selected
techniques for time series prediction and classification, using data sets from
actual surgeries. The candidate techniques will include first to third order
Markov methods, N-sequence matching, neural networks and fuzzy set based
inference. The end product is expected to be a prediction engine that will
enable the clinical version of the robot to perform as well or better than an
experienced human scrub technician.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices
and instrumentation.
