Research with objectives of obtaining a better understanding than now exists of
mechanisms by which phenolic compounds are chemically oxidized by manganese and
iron oxides in aqueous solutions will be performed. Results of this research are
likely to be applicable to engineering design of systems to manage the quality
of groundwater that has been subjected to pollution from phenolic compounds.
