This U.S.-Belarus Joint Workshop, to be held by Dr. Andy R. Magid of the
University of Oklahoma at Norman and Dr. Vladimir P. Platonov of the Belarus
Academy of Science, will be on "Representation Varieties," in particular on the
Platonov Conjecture. Four researchers from Belarus and four from the University
of Oklahoma will participate in a 14 day workshop at the University of Oklahoma
in late summer 1992 to identify joint scientific priorities and developing
concrete proposals for future joint projects. Representation Varieties, or
Character Varieties, are geometric objects whose points parameterize the
isomorphism classes of complex matrix representations of a fixed size of a given
finitely generated group. One basic question for these objects is to determine
for which groups they are all finite sets. The Platonov Conjecture speculates
that the only linear groups for which this happens are those of arithmetic type.
By bringing together those researchers from Belarus (including Platonov) who
have been most deeply involved in this study, and U.S. counterparts who have
been deeply involved with related representation variety theory, the workshop
should be able to effectively identify the most promising directions for future
joint research in the area. This project in mathematics fulfills the program
objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the
United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool
resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
