University&lt;br/&gt;Mukherjee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this
three-year project entitled: Dynamical Response of Carbon Nanotubes," are: (1)
dynamic response modeling of ~1-2nm diameter size carbon nanotubes using a
hierarchical approach of standard continuum mechanics, enriched continuum
mechanics, molecular dynamics, and ab initio electronic calculations: (2)
experimental research utilizing the remarkable mechanical, thermal, and
electrical properties of carbon nanotubes to create nanometer-scale
electromechanical devices (NEMs); and (3) investigate the unique properties of
carbon nanotubes for the innovation of a series of novel devices. The research
plan includes five tasks: (1) simulations using continuum mechanics; (2)
simulations using enriched continuum mechanics; (3) calculations of first
principles; (4) experiments of nanotubes for device applications; and (5)
comparison of theory and experiments. Three faculty members including the
principal investigator from three departments will form the research
team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Nanoscale Science and
Engineering Initiative NSF 02-148.&lt;br/&gt;
