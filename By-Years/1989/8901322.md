Issues regarding the design of complete, yet efficient, theorem proving methods
for first-order theories with equality will be studied. Two new proof
techniques-proof orderings and transfinite semantic trees- based on the paradigm
of simplification orderings and used to establish the completeness of a variety
of theorem proving methods, including refinements of resolution, paramodulation
(without the functional reflexivity axioms), and Knuth-Bendix type methods.
These meta-level techniques form the basis for a rigorous treatment of rewrite-
based equational reasoning and of theorem proving strategies with deletion rules
such as simplification (demodulation), in general. These techniques will be
further refined and elaborated to apply them to larger problem domains, and to
build a programming environment for quickly prototyping theorem provers. This
theorem proving environment will provide facilities for effectively describing
inference rules and search plans, and observing and controlling the run-time
environment of provers. It will include efficiently coded versions and primitive
operations such as unification, matching and reduction, as well as different
built-in abstract theorem-proving machines. Two special cases of abstract
machines being studied are a reduction machine for simplification and
normalization, and a linear abstract machine for stack-based strategies.
