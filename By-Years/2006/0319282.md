This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR)Phase I project will
design an all-fiber optic 589nm guidestar laser. The use of guidestar lasers in
conjunction with adaptive optics can provide for near diffraction-limited
performance of large aperture telescopes. A compact and efficient fiber laser
based device that emits a nearly diffraction limited, 10W beam at 589nm for
sodium guide star applications will be demonstrated. This laser can be mounted
directly behind the secondary of any major telescope eliminating issues with
complex coupling optics and attendant stability requirements. Telescope
resolution is limited by atmospheric distortion to that of a 23 cm telescope 1.
Using adaptive optics schemes, atmospheric distortions can be removed allowing
for up to a 4 m diffraction limited telescope. The key component to this system
is the guide star laser.

The next generation 589 nm Sodium laser proposed in Phase I would have
significant applications to the astronomy community. Currently, argon-ion pumped
dye lasers or sum frequency generation lasers are used. The 589 nm laser
presented in this proposal is a cost-effective, turnkey solution that has a long
lifetime. There are approximately 10 observatories throughout the world that
could benefit from the proposed device. For optimal compensation five 10 W laser
systems are required. A secondary market is for the laser trapping and cooling
of sodium for atomic clocks.
