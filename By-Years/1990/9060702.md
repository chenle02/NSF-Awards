The need for new materials with improved properties is apparent from the
substantial amount of time and money devoted to this research. However, it is
impossible using current technologies to produce materials with many
combinations of properties that would have high commercial value. However,
organic/inorganic hybrid (OIH) materials offer a unique alternative to
conventional multiphase materials. OIH materials involve the combination of
organic and inorganic materials on a molecular level, avoiding the limitations
of conventional multicomponent materials (i.e., problems with uneven dispersion,
limited molecular mixing, and weak interfaces between phases). The goal of this
program is to develop polymeric OIH materials with superior thermal and
mechanical properties by combining an organic and an inorganic precursor. To
achieve our goal we will examine how reaction variable can be varied to control
the morphology and the thermal and mechanical properties of the OIH materials.
In Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of preparing two types of OIH
materials with superior properties: 1) polymers that combine high permeability,
and 2) ceramics that are less brittle and easier to process than conventional
ceramics. The most promising of these materials will be optimized in Phase II,
in preparation for Phase III commercialization.
