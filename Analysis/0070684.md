ABSTRACT

A major goal of this proposal is to understand the role of fixed and free
boundaries in rigorous nonlinear geometric optics. The central importance of
boundaries is indicated, for example, by the fact that multidimensional shock
and vortex sheet problems can be formulated as nonlinear hyperbolic free
boundary problems. The author proposes to continue his work on geometric optics
for quasilinear boundary problems and multidimensional strong shocks, and to
extend it to weak shocks; to study the evolution of boundary layers in
quasilinear fixed and free boundary problems, especially the role of glancing
boundary layers in a new mechanism for shock instability; to construct Rayleigh
waves in nonlinear elasticity as propagating elliptic boundary layers and to
investigate their nonlinear (resonant) interactions with other waves.

The construction of formal, asymptotic solutions to nonlinear PDEs (nonlinear
geometric optics) has long been an important tool of applied mathematics. Formal
solutions yield qualititive information about many complex wave phenomena such
as resonance, shocks, Mach stems, and vortex sheets, and can be used to predict
and explain the results of physical or numerical experiments. An important task
for pure mathematicians is to rigorously justify such expansions, that is, to
show that they are close to genuine exact solutions. Rigorous analysis also
leads to the discovery of unexpected phenomena, such as new blow-up mechanisms,
for example.
