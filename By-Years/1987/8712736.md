The University of Minnesota is being supported to establish a Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to
provide meaningful hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for
outstanding undergraduate students under the supervision of experienced research
chemists. The program will support students for the summer of 1987, of which
almost half will be recruited from other institutions. Research activities will
include the following: o Synthesis of perfluoroalkylated cyclopentadienes o
Preparation of solid state materials o Nitrogen Heteocycles: Synthetic Problems
o Reactivity of Gold and New Gold Alloy Phosphine Compounds
