The proposal concerns the investigation of nonlinear wave phenomena in shallow
water waves, nonlinear optics, plasma and other areas of nonlinear physics. A
comprehensive characterization of the solitary waves resulting from such
phenomena is an important problem, which is far from complete. Therefore an
objective of this research project is to conduct an extensive study of the
nonlinear equations describing such localized wave-forms and wave-patterns by
analyzing the underlying mathematical structures of the relevant solution
spaces. Since the theory is shared by various physical systems, it is
anticipated that the results from the proposed work would provide insights into
other areas such as light waves in nonlinear optics, and spin waves in magnetic
thin films. A second objective is to apply the theoretical results of this
project to investigate possible mechanisms generating "rogue" waves of extremely
high elevations frequently observed in open seas, and surface wave patterns in
shallow water. Understanding the nature and dynamics of such extreme waves, and
ultimately predicting such wave phenomena in oceans near highly populated
coastal areas or at harbor entrances with heavy shipping traffic, are extremely
important tasks. The proposed research activities will involve several
undergraduate students over the course of this project since it will be carried
out in an undergraduate institution. The students will gain firsthand research
experience in applied mathematics, which may motivate them to pursue graduate
studies or other career opportunities in mathematical sciences.
