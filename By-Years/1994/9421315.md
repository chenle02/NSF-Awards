Shupert 9421315 In order to understand how the brain controls movement, it is
necessary to understand how different components of the body are maintained in a
given posture, or changed in a coordinated fashion. With this award, Dr.
Charlotte Shupert will conduct detailed studies of how the stability of the head
and the eyes are maintained when a person makes postural adjustments. This
stability is important so that visual and inner ear feedback can be used
effectively during such postural adjustments -- but how that stability is
achieved has not been clear. The insights gained from this study will advance
the understanding of biological motor control generally, and will provide
specific information to enhance work on human motor performance and perhaps the
design of robotic agents. ***
