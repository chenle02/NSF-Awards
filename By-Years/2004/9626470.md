Dr. Alexander R. Muci has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
in Chemistry. Dr. Muci received the doctoral degree from Harvard University
under the supervision of Professor David A. Evans. Dr. Muci will continue
research at the California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of
Professor John E. Bercaw. The postdoctoral research will focus on the synthesis
and study of enantiomerically pure polymerization catalysts. In particular, work
includes the synthesis of an yttrocene complex where chirality installed in the
silicon linker controls the rotational orientation of the substituted Cp rings.
Longterm research goals target the development of synthetically useful catalytic
carbon-carbon bond activation reactions. Heterogeneous, metal-catalyzed carbon-
carbon bond cleavage is an important process for the cracking of crude petroleum
hydrocarbons into more useful, lower molecular weight chemicals and fuels. The
Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
