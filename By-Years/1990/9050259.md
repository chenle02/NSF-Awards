By the end of the century, technology could allow all Americans access to the
organized information and knowledge of our civilization. The television set cum
computer chip could be linked by broadband networks or in other ways to
archieves of digitized information, including text, sound and moving images.
Such a development would hold profound educational and unique educational
opportunity; examine the educational and social benefits of this development for
new and existing learners; and conduct and disseminate the results of this
inquiry in a way that alerts public and private decision-makers to actions that
can affect this unique opportunity. Specifically, this activity will: o
synthesize what is presently known about factors affecting the development and
cost of the digital home terminal; switched broadband communications to the
home, school and work place; and public and commercial digital databases; o
assess the educational and social benefits of a national information
infrastructure for use in and outside of school; and describe new options for
public and private financing of this infrastructure for educational use; o
develop descriptions of a series of contingent options for getting from here to
there; o assess the effect on the direction and rate of development of the
national information infrastructure, if public and private decision- makers were
to take into account the educational needs that electronic information services
could serve; o assess the reaction of affected educational constituencies,
including reformist movements, to this new educational opportunity, and to
effects on publicly-financed schooling; and strive actively during and at the
onclusion of the study to disseminate the concept and results of this inquiry.
