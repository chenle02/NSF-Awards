PI: Prather, Larry A.&lt;br/&gt;DBI-0424109&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
workshop will be held in September in East Lansing, MI. The workshop will
provide the opportunity for the hebarium community to establish and support a
series of networks that will facilitate communication and resources among the
collections. Hebarium collections, and the curatorial staff associated with
them, appear to be disproportionately at risk during constrained budgetary
times. The P.I. and the individuals identified to lead the workshop activities
have demonstrated success in sustaining herbaria and will be able to share
strategies with others.
