The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between two
activities of a protein encoded by a group I intron. The protein facilitates a
splicing reaction that excises the intron from its precursor RNA and also acts
as a DNA endonuclease, cleaving DNA at a specific sequence. It is commonly
believed that the RNA splicing activity evolved from a protein that originally
functioned solely as a DNA endonuclease. However it is unlikely that this new
function arose simply by fusion of an additional gene sequence. Preliminary
evidence indicates that the DNA and RNA substrates bind to distinct or partially
overlapping sites on the protein. The question then arises as to how a protein
acquires a new function and how easily this can be detected. This is
particularly relevant to annotating genomes. Attributing a single function to a
gene may constitute only partial characterization of the sequence since an
unknown number of proteins may "moonlight" and perform a second, unrelated and
unforeseen task. Group I introns can catalyze their own excision from RNA
precursors. An intron-encoded protein, called a maturase, significantly
facilitates removal of such an intron in Aspergillus nidulans. It also has DNA
endonuclease activity. The three-dimensional structure of the protein has been
obtained with the help of a collaborator and the region which binds the
cleavable DNA sequence has been identified. Guided by this model, the
relationship between the binding sites of the RNA and DNA substrates will be
studied biochemically and genetically. Current diffraction data from crystals of
group I introns are of insufficient quality to reveal structural details at the
atomic level. Co-crystallizing RNA with a protein can often solve this problem.
A collaboration will be performed to obtain a high-resolution structure of the
intron-maturase complex. This will not only reveal the RNA binding site on the
protein and help to determine how the RNA binding site arose, but also provide a
wealth of structural information about the group I intron RNA itself.
