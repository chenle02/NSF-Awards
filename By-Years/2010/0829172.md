The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) is the recipient of
an award for summer internship support. HACU, a national, non-profit
organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship
opportunities through the organization?s National Internship Program (NIP).
Through the NIP academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico
have received quality internship assignments with various federal government
agencies. Students who participate in the NIP are exposed to various career
options in the Federal sector that serve to assist them in making informed
career choices and solidify career objectives. By partnering with the Federal
government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 7,000 students in
internships since NIP commenced in 1992. In an effort to continue its
collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating
government agency for the last six years, will offer challenging assignments
that will broaden the exposure of students pursuing careers in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). These internships create a
unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of goals aligned with the
America Competes Act, and allow the Foundation to actively participate in
developing the intellectual capital needed to achieve excellence in STEM
education.
