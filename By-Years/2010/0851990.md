People must often make decisions while being subjected to multiple stressors
such as time pressure, performance pressure, or competition for attentional
resources from secondary or non-relevant tasks. These circumstances are
ubiquitous in both trivial decisions as well as those with significant
consequences. The proposed research undertakes a comprehensive examination at
how different stressors affect decision making by looking at: 1) how different
stressors affect the decision process in addition to decision outcomes, 2) how
individual differences in working memory interact with different stressors in
decision making, 3) the impact of changes in task complexity, and 4) how
alternative theoretical explanations for decision behavior compare. These tasks
will be performed using improved eye tracking methodology and metrics

This research will generate prescriptive recommendations to benefit diverse
fields. First, direct applications of this project extend beyond basic research
to interesting applied settings where the stressors under investigation are
omnipresent, including situations requiring executive policy, military, and
financial investment decisions. Additionally, this research will produce more
diagnostic and accurate techniques for measuring attention allocation,
information search, and information utilization in decision making. These
techniques can then be applied to investigate many other phenomena, such as
online instruction environments, consumer behavior research, and human-computer
usability.
