With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Diane Brentari will conduct five
years of linguistic research on the handshapes used in well-established sign
languages and in the invented systems used by deaf individuals who have not been
exposed to a signed or spoken languages, called 'homesign' systems. Three
different deaf populations that use a visual-gestural system as their primary
means of communication will be studied: native signers of Italian Sign Language
(adults and children); Italian homesigning children, and Nicaraguan
homesigners(adults and children). The populations are all from environments
where gesture is also a strong part of the language environment. The data will
come from descriptions of events of motion and
location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific questions addressed by this
project are the following. First, how do grammatical properties in syntax,
phonology, and morphology emerge in the case of children acquiring a language
from their parents vs. when children are inventing their own systems of gestures
without language input from their families? Second, what aspects of grammar are
more or less robust in the case of acquisition case vs. the case of invention
and at what age? Third, do homesign systems become more sophisticated when they
are used as the primary means of communication over the course of a lifetime, as
is the case in homesigning adults in Nicaragua? Finally, this research will
contribute to our understanding of the evolution of language because homesigners
are inventing communication anew in a way that is not possible to observe in the
realm of spoken languages; this particlar moment of spoken language history was
not recorded in a way that it can be studied with contemporary means. In
addition to its scientific merit, this project will recruit native-signing Deaf
undergraduate and graduate students to help analyze data, and so provide an
opportunity for these students to engage in first-hand scientific research on
sign languages.
