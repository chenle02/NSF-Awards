This grant supports participants to attend the Big Data in Software Engineering
track of the Midwest Big Data Summer School. The Midwest Big Data Summer School
series is a 5-day training activity for Early Career Researchers. The 2017
edition of the event will be held on July 10-14, 2017 in Ames, Iowa. This summer
school is a one-week, intensive curriculum aimed at early career researchers to
get them started in data-driven research. The school includes full-day lectures
on topics ranging from data acquisition, data preprocessing, exploratory data
analysis, descriptive data analysis, data analysis tools and techniques,
visualization and communication, ethical issues in data science, reproducibility
and repeatability, and understanding of domain/context.

In the field of Software Engineering, big data analytics for empirical research
has expanded as a research area. The Big Data in Software Engineering track at
the Summer School will train researchers on the skills, tools and techniques to
perform this research. Overall, it is a community building activity that may
stimulate research collaborations.
