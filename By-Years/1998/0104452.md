0104452&lt;br/&gt;Hannaford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award will
support a dissertation enhancement project of Jesse Dosher, a student in the
Biorobotics Lab of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of
Washington. He will work with Prof. Massimo Bergamasco at the PERCRO lab at
Scuola Superiore Santa Anna in Pisa, Italy. The objective of Mr. Dosher's
research is to improve the design of the Biorobotics Lab's new control method
for haptic devices. While at PERCRO, one of the world's leading laboratories in
haptic device mechanization, Mr. Dosher will learn state of the art materials,
mechanization, and fabrication techniques for haptic device design. While at
PERCRO, Mr. Dosher will offer seminars on the Biorobotics Lab's new control
method for haptic devices. &lt;br/&gt;
