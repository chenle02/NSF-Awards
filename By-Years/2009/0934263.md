The University of New Mexico Sevilleta Field Station is awarded a grant for the
acquisition of major equipment items in support of teaching and research efforts
in ecophysiology and molecular ecology, including a portable system for field
analysis of photosynthesis and numerous equipment items required for molecular
microbial ecology. The award will have a major impact on our summer REU program
as well as summer courses that employ physiological and molecular-genetic
approaches to ecology. It will enable the first offering of a summer course in
microbial ecology during the summer of 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sevilleta
Field Station is nearing the end of a five-year plan of program development that
includes expansion of undergraduate and graduate research and the addition of 20
course-weeks per year of college-level teaching. The Field Station is located at
the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, less than an hour from Albuquerque (city
of &gt;500,000) and the University of New Mexico, less than a half hour from
Socorro and New Mexico Tech, and minutes from several small rural communities
encompassing tremendous social, ethnic and economic diversity. The station
therefore provides access to educational and outreach opportunities for UNM
students; K-12 students, teachers and citizens from Albuquerque and surrounding
communities; and visiting scientists from institutions within and outside New
Mexico. UNM is a minority serving institution, and the Sevilleta Field Station
and Sevilleta LTER Program are dedicated to enhancing minority participation in
field-based research. This award will contribute to a moderately sized, state-
of-the-art teaching and research program at the Sevilleta Field
Station.&lt;br/&gt;
