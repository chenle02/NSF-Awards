The Principal Investigators (PIs) seek to address the issue of micromixing
(mixing on the scale of the biological cell) and micro-segregation of reactants.
Do these factors produce a biological response in a growing cell? Do they cause
changes in cell yield and the production of secondary metabolites? The ultimate
objective is to advance engineering science to the stage where micromixing can
be used as a design parameter in the design of fermenters.
