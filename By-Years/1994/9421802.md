9421802 Theopold University of Delaware Dr. Klaus H. Theopold, Chemistry
Department, University of Delaware, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to study the
reaction chemistry of paramagnetic organometallic compounds. The project
concentrates on chromium and is directed, in part, toward understanding and
developing Cr based catalysts. A series of Cr(III) alkyls, higher oxidation
state oxochromium alkyls, and chromium alkylidenes in which the Cr oxidation
state is greater than (III) will be prepared. The goals of this phase of the
investigation will be to obtain cationic, catalytically active species, ones
which indicate the existence of agostic ligand-chromium interactions, and
species which will serve as oxidants in organic reactions. In order to explore
the interactions between paramagnetic Cr ions, a series of chromium-hydride
clusters which may behave as molecular magnets will be sought. Uniting the oxo-
complex and cluster themes, a series of complexes with an oxo-cubane or related
core will be prepared. These will model several important commercial olefin
polymerization catalysts. Electrons behave like little magnets. In many metal
compounds there are an even numbers of electrons which align so that the
magnetism of one is canceled by another. However, there are a few compounds
which have an odd number of electrons and, consequently, these compounds behave
as small magnets. In addition, an odd number of electrons often leads to
increased chemical reactivity. The object of this project is to prepare a number
of different types of these "paramagnetic" complexes. These species will then be
evaluated as new reagents, as catalysts for important industrial processes, and
as magnetic materials.
