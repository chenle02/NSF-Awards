The Chicago Children's Museum (CCM) will develop CityScape, a 2,500 sq ft
permanent exhibition based on design strategies for researching and promoting
adult-child collaborative learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT:
This project will develop and test culturally-sensitive exhibit and program
design approaches for increasing adult involvement in children's learning;
explore the potential of visual documentation of learning through play to make
children's progress more visible as well as build caregiver confidence and
skills; and demonstrate exhibition design as an experimental platform for a
museum-learning researcher partnership. Project partners include the Chicago
Metropolitan YMCA, Dept. of Psychology at Northeastern Illinois University and
the Erikson Institute of Chicago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The
exhibition and accompanying materials have the potential to serve 1.8 million
people over three years. In addition, CCM also will create a partnership of 20
museums and science centers based on parent involvement in children's museum
experiences. The Informal Science Education field will be advanced through
exploration of this model for integrating exhibition and program development
with basic and applied educational research, accompanied by the application of
visual documentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
