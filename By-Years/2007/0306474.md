The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications (COMAP) is continuing for
eighteen months the work of the Alternatives for Rebuilding Curricula (ARC)
Center. The project will maintain its current institutional organization with a
national center at COMAP and satellite centers at TERC, the University of
Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The role of the national
center is to oversee the entire project and to guide efforts that reflect common
visions across the three curriculum projects (Investigations in Number, Data,
and Space; Everyday Mathematics and Math Trailblazers). Satellite centers focus
their resources on school and districts that are using their curricula and they
collaborate with one another and the national center on projects that advance
the common objectives of all ARC sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the
ARC Center are the following.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*To complete the development
and testing of a Building Capacity for Change program that is intended to
introduce a range of improvement options to school districts in underserved
areas of the country.&lt;br/&gt;*To augment the findings of the Tri-State
Student Achievement Study (Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington) in order to
probe the findings in greater depth.&lt;br/&gt;*To conclude the individual pilot
projects at each satellite. Two satellite centers are seeking alternative ways
to provide staff development to large numbers of teachers. The third satellite
is identifying critical factors in urban implementations.&lt;br/&gt;
