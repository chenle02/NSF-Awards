The Synthetic Organic Program and the Biological Oceanography Program are co-
supporting the research of Dr. William H. Fenical of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography at the University of California-San Diego. This interdisciplinary
research program will explore the natural products chemistry of marine chemical
defense. The program is based upon collaborative investigations of both the
biological and chemical components of this significant, but poorly known,
adaptation in marine habitats. Chemical studies of bioactive natural products,
involving the use of new methods in separation science and organic structure
determination, are combined with experimental ecological studies to illustrate
the functions of secondary metabolites in competitive marine habitats. The
overall goals of this program are to derive new classes of natural products from
marine organisms, to comprehend the specific roles these compounds play in
survival, and to understand how they influence community composition and
structure in tropical marine environments.
