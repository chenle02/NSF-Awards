The College of Engineering at the University of Hartford will initiate a six-
week, residential Young Scholars project in Engineering for 30 students entering
grades 10,11. During the summer a non-credit program of lectures and labs in
basic engineering principles, independent study computer projects, and design
project research will occur under the supervision of engineers from the College
of Engineering faculty and local industry who will serve as role models.
Academic year follow-up activities will include: a computer conferencing system
on the CONFER network which also serves YOUNG SCHOLARS in Montana, peer
conferences, and independent home and school based events.
