Tetrahymena thermophila, a freshwater ciliated protist, is uniquely well suited
for ana-lysis of nuclear and chromosomal events associated with both the cell
division cycle and conjugation (sexual reproduction). Ciliates exhibit an
unparalleled richness of developmental landmarks during mitosis by virtue of the
precisely controlled proliferation and patterning of basal bodies that form the
ciliated oral apparatus in the cell cortex. This cortical program is coupled to
both nuclear division and cytokinesis and provides an easily visualized, richly
detailed "clock" of developmental events during cell division. This
developmental program offers unique opportunities for understanding the genetic
control of nuclear-cortical interactions that regulate a cell's progress through
this cell-cycle dominated landscape. Three features recommend this system for
developmental analysis: a wealth of developmental landmarks, the ability to
carry and express mutations with lethal phenotypes, and the ability to study
mutations that target both mitotic and meiotic mechanisms without affecting cell
viability. The goals of this project are three fold: 1) Build and screen an
"antisense" library to search for genes involved in conjugal development, 2)
Launch a biochemical investigation into "fenestrin" and other proteins
associated with the pronuclear exchange junction, 3) Uncover the cytogenetic
basis of the developmental "checkpoint" associated with conjugal arrest in
"star"-cell lines that abort normal conjugal development. &lt;br/&gt;Work
involving these 3 methods of analysis will shed light on the genetic basis of
sexual development in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and its integration
with the cell division cycle. This project will also help to link events
occurring at the cell surface with events occurring within the cell's nucleus
during the cell division cycle while providing a superior research training
experience for undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;
