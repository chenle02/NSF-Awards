Rapid advances in high-performance computing and widespread availability of
massive datasets are bringing about a paradigm shift in the theory and practice
of signal representations, geared towards inference and learning. A signal
representation is a compressed summary that only retains those features of the
signal that are salient for a class of inference tasks. This project provides a
comprehensive theoretical and algorithmic framework for signal representations,
which is sufficiently broad to cover both the traditional types of signal
representations, such as vector quantization and sparse codes, and the more
modern types, inspired by recent advances in machine learning and signal
processing for Big Data.

Under this framework, the statistical performance and the computational
complexity of signal representations are addressed in a unified manner by
imposing structural constraints on the encoding map, the decoding map, and the
model space of the representation, while simultaneously tailoring these objects
to the class of tasks of interest. This unification leads to new theoretical and
algorithmic insights into highly structured internal representations that are a
key factor in recent spectacular success of deep neural networks on challenging
tasks in visual, audio, and speech analytics.
