Dr. Hecht and his colleagues at the Aerospace Corporation will provide new
laboratory data on small clusters of molecular species which are relevant to
various models of interstellar material. The primary species to be studied are
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) monomers and clusters. Until the 1980s
models for interstellar and circumstellar dust did not need to include
individual grains smaller than 50 Angstroms. This changed due to a series of
excellent observations in the infrared. These measurements revealed emission
whose origin has only been explained to date by postulation of a significant
amount of interstellar material with radii from 3 to 50 Angstroms. Laboratory
instrumentation has also been developed where, for the first time, clusters of
from 2 to 1000 atoms formed from a variety of materials can be produced as a
molecular beam. Experiments using such an apparatus have shown that for some
materials certain sized clusters are unusually stable. Dr. Hecht will use
laboratory instrumentation that incorporates the latest in technological
advances to produce and study small particles of potential astronomical
importance.
