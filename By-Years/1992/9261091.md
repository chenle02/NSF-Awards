With the increase in atmospheric pollution and a new, growing public awareness
of resulting environmental damage, there is a need for new technology to measure
the concentration of trace species in the atmosphere. Extractive methods, in
which a sealed sample of air is analyzed in a laboratory, are expensive and are
inapplicable to continuous, in situ monitoring of concentrations. Science
Research Laboratory proposes the development of an instrument called a Pulsed
Absorption Diffractometer (PAD) to fill this need. The basis of this instrument
is the detection of a transient, volumetric diffraction grating that is formed
after a pulsed laser beam is absorbed by trace species present in the
illuminated region. The PAD will be sensitive to parts-per-trillion trace-gas
concentrations, 2-3 orders of magnitude better than instruments based on other
approaches to monitor trace species in the field.
