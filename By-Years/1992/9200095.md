This is a three year grant for the renewal of regional undergraduate
participation in ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics, Florida
State University. Applications for ten Summer Junior Fellowship positions are
solicited from 160 colleges and universities throughout the southeastern region
of the United States. Applicants' interests are matched with the research
programs and extra attention is given to applications from women and minorities.
The main focus of the program is to provide research experience for
undergraduate physics majors in the southeast region, with usually 9 out of 10
fellowships going to students outside of FSU. The laboratories include a S-FN
Tandem Van de Graaff, a superconducting LINAC, four smaller accelerators used
for environmental and implantation studies, and a particle physics detector
laboratory as well as active programs at Brookhaven, Fermilab and CERN, an
ultra-high resolution infrared spectrometer, a helium atom scattering
spectrometer, a liquid crystal laboratory, and a number of low temperature solid
state research facilities. Approximately 15 to 20 faculty members will be
directly involved with Summer Junior Fellows. In addition to joint research
activities, all Fellows will attend a seminar designed for the program and will
present papers and talks on their summer research near the end of the
appointment. Each summer two or three of the Fellows will work with the host
group (nuclear physics), with the seminar series, short courses in computer
programming and machine shop techniques, and the student talks providing the
common links between the different areas of physics.
