The goal of this research is to examine the dynamics and flow behavior of
Polymeric Liquid Crystals (PLCs) in terms of the underlying polymer and domain
microstructure. PLCs are highly ordered polymer solutions and melts with useful
anisotropic optical and mechanical properties strongly influenced by processing.
This coupling between flow processing and the microstructure, which itself
determines the final mechanical and optical properties, is to be elucidated and
quantified. To better understand the relationships between the nonequilibrium
microstructure and the macroscopic rheology in transient flows, three techniques
will be used to examine and model the behavior of these complex fluids: (a)
Rheometry; (b) Dichroism and birefringence; (c) Nonequilibrium molecular dynamic
simulations on massive parallel computers, to model and understand the
experiments. The dynamical behavior of PLC systems under transient flow is of
interest in most PLC product fabrication processes.
