Research will be conducted on the modeling and least squares parameter
identification of nonlinear differential and differential-delay systems using
projected equation error methods. The projections are designed to obviate the
necessity of dealing with unknown initial or boundary conditions for time
limited input-output data. Special emphasis is given to a projection method
based on Fourier-type modulating functions which facilitates utilizing well
known Fast Fourier Transform techniques at each stage of the least squares
identification. Topics include delineating and extending the class of nonlinear
systems that are amenable to the projection methods, structure determination
procedures for the various classes of models, methods for handling modeling
errors, determining optimal inputs for the projected equation error
identification, and incorporating controller parameter update rules for
adaptation in certain nonlinear control systems.
