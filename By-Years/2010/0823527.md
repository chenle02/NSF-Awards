This award will provide funds to refine a Rayleigh-based geochemical thermometer
(RBGT) for coral biomineralization based on high-precision analyses of multiple
elemental ratios (e.g. Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca) and experimentally determined
partition coefficients so that it can be broadly applied across coral species in
a wide range of warm and cold-water environments. Three main objectives of this
research include a description of element partitioning during aragonite
precipitation as a function of temperature and crystal growth rate,
determination of the accuracy of the RBGT by analyzing short sections of coral
skeletons that have matching in-situ temperature records and application of the
RBGT to construct a continuous, seasonally resolved record of Atlantic sea
surface temperatures during the peak of the Little Ice Age ~1640-1670 AD. The
Broader Impacts include research to improve interpretation of the geochemical
archive in corals to better reconstruct past ocean temperatures for model input
and future global change predictions. This project also includes a young PI who
has recently started a new faculty position.
