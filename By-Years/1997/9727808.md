9727808 Barbosa-Canovas This proposal requests $7,500 to provide partial support
for travel for academic speakers at the 1997 Conference of Food Engineering
(CoFE `97). CoFE `97 will be a Topical Conference within the Annual Meeting of
the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICHE) and will be focused on
identifying Food Engineering Research Priorities for the 21st Century. Among the
16 oral sessions of specific interest to BES are meetings on protein
functionality in foods, sensors in food processing, advances in fermentation
technology, aseptic processing, and food engineering education. A number of BES
grantees, reviewers, and other members of the BES "community" are active
participants in the meeting. ***
