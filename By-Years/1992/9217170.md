This project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will support a
fundamental investigation of the processes that control the sensitivity,
precision and accuracy of multielement analysis via inductively coupled plasma
optical emission and mass spectrometry. Desolvation of sample aerosols, particle
vaporization, analyte ionization and excitation of atoms and ions will all be
studied; however, the particular focus of the investigation will be plasma-
sample interactions. Measurements of sample aerosol characteristics, atom and
ion concentrations in the plasma, excitation and ionization will be carried out
in a systematic attempt to separately investigate the complex mechanisms of
signal generation in a plasma. %%% This project involves a basic investigation
of the factors controlling the generation of analytically useful signals from
atoms and ions in a plasma. The goal is to improve multielement analytical
capabilities for the analysis of geological, environmental, biological,
material, and agricultural samples.
