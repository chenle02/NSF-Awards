This short-term research project will address the challenge of achieving near
PetaOps scale performance within a decade through innovative systems that
exhibit wide applicability and ease of use. The objective of the proposed
research is to determine the feasibility and detailed structure of a parallel
architecture integrating the combined capabilities of semiconductor,
superconductor, and optical technologies. This hybrid architecture approach is
motivated by the realization that a mix of technologies may yield superior
operational attributes to those possible based solely on semiconductor
technology in the same time frame. An interdisciplinary team of collaborators
has been assembled to conduct the required point-design study in order to devise
a complete system structure and evaluate its performance characteristics using a
small set of scientific application kernels. The proposed hybrid technology
approach exploits critical opportunities enabled by key emerging devices.
Specifically computational performance can be dramatically improved through
recent advances in Superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum logic which will
make 100 Ghz clock rates feasible in the next two years. Memory capacity may be
drastically increased through a new memory hierarchy, merging advanced
semiconductor high density memory and future (admittedly more speculative)
optical 3-D holographic storage capable of storing 0.1 Petabits or more.
Interconnection bandwidth will be greatly enhanced by means of optical networks
with 100 Gbps channels.
