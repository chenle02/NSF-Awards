TITLE: Design, Implementation, &amp; Application of a Framework Formal deductive
systems play a central role in the areas of programming languages and logics.
First, they are used to define languages and their semantics at a very high-
level of abstraction (e.g., type systems or operational semantics). Second, they
form the basis for the implementation of algorithms pertaining to languages
(e.g., type inference or interpretation). Third, they provide a common basis for
the study of meta-theory of programming languages and logics (e.g., preservation
of types under evaluation). Motivated by the tremendous variety of deductive
systems of interest in computer science and logic, general meta-languages for
their specification have been investigated. These meta-languages are often
referred to as logical frameworks. The objective of this effort is to further
the theory and practice of logic-independent, computer-assisted formal reasoning
and meta-reasoning. This research addresses definitional, operational, and meta-
theoretical aspects of logical frameworks comprising work on further design,
implementation, and application of such frameworks.
