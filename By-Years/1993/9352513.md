Computing Equipment to Enhance Inquiry-Oriented Laboratory Instruction in
Biology at a 2-year College The goals of this project are to facilitate the
acquisition of biology concepts and cognitive skills in beginning biology
students. Inquiry-oriented laboratory instruction of nonmajor, introductory
biology students to include weekly computer applications are featured. The
course is based on a 3-phase sequence of instruction including exploration, term
introduction, and application. Traditional hands-on exploration activities, are
supplemented with computer simulations.
