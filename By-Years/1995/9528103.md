9528103 Binder The IETF is a part of the successful evolution of the Internet
and its fundamental role in the evolving National Information Infrastructure.
The IETF activities are an outgrowth of efforts started by the US Government
during the late 1970s to manage the evolution of the Internet. Under a
Cooperative Agreement with the National Science Foundation, the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives created and provided a functioning IETF
Secretariat, and has been helping to organize and support these activities which
involve thousands of individual participants and contributors from the US and
abroad. To ensure the continued evolution of the Internet and its contribution
to the emerging NII, CNRI proposes to provide the IETF Secretariat for a period
of three years. The continuation of the Secretariat with US Government funding
will provide stability and continuity to the IETF during important transitions
of the Internet involving significant architectural change and increased
commercial activity. CNRI also proposes to create a Planning Group, inclose
consultation with the Government and the IESG (IETF Steering Group), to develop
a plan for generating long-term IETF Secretariat funding.
