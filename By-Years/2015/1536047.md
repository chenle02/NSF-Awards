ACM MOBISYS is the premier forum to showcase the latest research outcomes that
cover a wide range of topics in mobile computing and wireless networks.
Researchers attend this forum to identify methods of improving their work, and
seek feedback from fellow researchers on their work. For students, this is a
valuable avenue to interact with other top-tier researchers. This award will
support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 2015 ACM MOBISYS Conference
which will be held in Florence, Italy, May 18-22, 2015. Priority will be given
to students who will benefit from attending this workshop but are unlikely to
attend due to the unavailability of travel funds. In addition, applications from
female and underrepresented groups in higher education are greatly encouraged.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested travel funds will allow graduate students
conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations,
be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers
and fellow graduate students. The impact to the students' careers from attending
ACM MOBISYS 2015 is expected to be substantial, since they would be unable to
attend this event without the support of this grant.
