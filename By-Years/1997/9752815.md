The Shodor computational Science Institute is a series of workshops, seminars,
and support activities to introduce the authentic use of numerical models across
the undergraduate curriculum. The SCSI project will enable teams of mathematics,
science, and computer science faculty at small to medium sized colleges to work
together, to enhance their professional standing through the use of technology
and the wider use of mathematical modeling and the tools of computations science
within a truly interdisciplinary approach. This focus on modeling will enable
these faculty to learn how to do computational science and how to teach
computational science in engaging and enriching interactive environments
incorporating the same tools, techniques, and technologies which characterize
the modern practice of science and engineering. During a series of workshops and
follow-on activities, participants progress from finding and assessing models,
to running other people's models, to modifying these models, to ultimately
writing their own. At each stage, the faculty grow to understand the importance
of challenging the model and its numerical implementations, asking themselves
and their students, "How do we know if it is right?" The project includes a
series of campus visits, a series of three, intensive, one-week,
interdisciplinary summer workshops which cover the principles and practices of
computational science at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels,
and seminars and modeling-based activities back at the home institutions.
continuous support and follow-up, materials development, access to HPCC and
visualization resources, and evaluation are coordinated and enabled by using
collaborative tools and electronic networks.
