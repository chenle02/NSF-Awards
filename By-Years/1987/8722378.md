Measurement of water vapor concentration or humidity is important in many areas
of atmospheric research. Most existing instrumentation does not have adequate
sensitivity or time response for measurements at high altitudes or in cold
regions, or for flux measurements in the surface layer. The purpose of this
research is to study the development of a high resolution infrared absorption
sensor for fast-response measurement of water vapor, utilizing a liquid
nitrogen-cooled lead-salt diode laser. In Phase I of this SBIR program, a
multiple pass absorption cell design which has excellent alignment stability was
demonstrated for application to water vapor measurements. A set of absorption
lines was identified which can be used to achieve a very wide dynamic range
sufficient to accommodate measurements of humidity under all expected conditions
in the troposphere or lower stratosphere. Accurate measurements of the
integrated line strengths for these lines were made in Phase I. The major
objectives of the Phase II SBIR research are to study methods for simplifying
the instrument design using infrared fiber optics and to enhance measurement
accuracy by using a dual-beam method. A prototype humidity sensor will be
assembled for laboratory and local field tests. These tests will include
detailed evaluations of sensitivity, accuracy, and time response, including
intercomparison with other instrumentation used for water vapor measurements in
atmospheric or meteorological research.
