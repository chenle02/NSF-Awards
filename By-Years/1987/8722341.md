Supramolecular assemblies, such as monolayers, vesicles, bilayers, and tubules,
are two-dimensional arrays of amphiphiles. The recent introduction of methods to
polymerize these assemblies provides a means to modify their chemical and
physical properties. The nature of these two-dimensional polymerizations and the
effect of the assembly structure on the polymerization reaction are poorly
understood. The objective of this research is to enhance the understanding of
the fundamentals of two-dimensional polymerizations. Specifically, this initial
research will emphasize the following: a) the factors that control the size of
linear polymers formed from assemblies of homolipid assemblies; b) the rate of
two- dimensional polymerization in homo- and mixed-lipid assemblies; and c)
evaluation of the effect of the frequency of crosslinks in the polymerization of
the assemblies on both the rate of lipid diffusion, and the solvent stability of
the polymerized assembly. These data, to be determined primarily for extended
bilayer, cast bilayer, and vesicle assemblies, are expected to provide a basis
to evaluate how two-dimensional polymerizations parallel or deviate from the
established principles of isotropic polymerizations. Consequently, they will
provide a basis for the use of two-dimensional polymerizations for the formation
of new materials.
