ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0237951&lt;br/&gt;F. Mashayek, Univ. of IL -
Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the revised proposal in on development
of DNS and RANS methods for simulation of particle laden gas flow, dispersed
two-phase flows. The results will have broad applications to environmental
combustion in turbulent flows with either solid powder or droplet sprays, and
the plan is to include heat transfer and compressible flow effects in the
simulations. This project will build on the recent work by the PI for LES models
of turbulent two-phase flows and should provide engineering tools for the
prediction of turbulent particulate flows that are more reliable than at
present. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key element of the project is to use the
probability density function (PDF) for particle phase space and to use the
Louiville equation as the starting point for deriving the LES and RANS
models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
