This award is for support for a program to measure the stable isotope (deuterium
to hydrogen and oxygen-18 to oxygen-16) concentrations of ice cores retrieved
from Siple Dome as part of the West Antarctic ice sheet program. In addition,
the deuterium excess of samples from the Taylor Dome ice core will be
determined. This project will approach the question of rapid climate change
using ice cores to determine the history of temperature changes, moisture source
changes, and elevational changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet. Results from
ice cores taken to date in the interior of Antarctica (East and West) are
surprisingly lacking in indications of abrupt climate changes, such as those
that have been observed in the GISP2 ice core from Summit, Greenland. This work
will address the question of whether rapid climate changes, which are known to
have occurred in other parts of the southern hemi-sphere, may have also occurred
in the coastal regions of West Antarctica. There is some indication from
existing records of isotopes in ice cores that the West Antarctic ice sheet may
have flushed ice in the past (as evidenced by large changes in elevation of the
ice sheet).
