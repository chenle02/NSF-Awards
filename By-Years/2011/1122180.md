To attract females, male birds perform spectacular songs and dances. Studies of
song have influenced our thinking about how brains adapt for vocal learning,
and, because songs are a part of courtship, have taught us how gonadal hormones
regulate vocal signals. However, the dances that elevate bird songs to elegant
courtship displays have been neglected by scientists. Given the exciting
implications of hormone regulated neuroplasticity in brain-motor systems
involved in dance, it is surprising that more research has not been done in this
this area. This project will use a comparative approach employing
neuroanatomical and molecular techniques to determine if the complexity of
neural architecture and hormone sensitivity in motor brain regions, like the
cerebellum, are positively associated with dance complexity in birds. Thirteen
species of the manakin family (Pipridae) that have a range of dance complexities
will be compared. Males of a species with one of the most complex displays
announce the breeding season with firecracker-like snaps of the wings that
punctuate flips performed so fast that high-speed cameras are required to see
them. Males of a species with the simplest displays perform a vocal display but
have no dance. Imagine how the brains of the former and latter species must
differ. The major impact of this study will be to reveal capabilities of the
cerebellum and other motor regions to flexibly adapt to demands for motor
complexity and to be responsive to hormones in a way not thought possible of
motor brain regions. This project will train several graduate and undergraduate
students and offers learning opportunities in Central and South America while
involving locals in fieldwork. The project will provide tissue samples to
museums, create a bank of virtual brain sections, and share DNA sequences for
hormone receptors via NCBI websites.
