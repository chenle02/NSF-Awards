EEC-9523373 McLaren Packing of products must be controlled and reduced to
minimize its impact upon land fills. Similarly resource recovery must be
improved for the same reason. The nation's land fills are filling up and the
current operations are not feasible for the future. A new Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Packaging and Resource Recovery at Rutgers
University is being established to address these problems. Eleven companies have
become members of the new Center. The research of the new Center will address
the following: 1) Accelerated Shelf-Life Testing; 2) Micro-disperse, Immiscible
Polymer Mixtures in Post Consumer Commingled Plastics; and 3) Gaseous
Degredation of Polyolefins; 4) A Feasibility Study of Recycled Commingled
Plastics; 5) Resource Recovery Technologies; and 6) Economic and Thermodynamic
Viability of Refined Commingled Plastics. The Center has been coordinated with
Farley Fisher in the Division of Chemical and Thermal Systems.
