Members of the Dioptinae, a tropical subgroup of the Notodontidae or "Prominent
moths," exhibit many unique features. First, dioptines are the only prominents
with brightly-colored wing patterns, and whose members fly in the day rather
than at night. Second, the caterpillars of many dioptines feed on toxic plants
such as "passion vine" and "pipevine." In contrast, the larvae of other
prominents feed on trees, most of which do not contain toxins. Recent work has
shown that dioptines are highly specialized notodontids. Parallels can therefore
be drawn between the Dioptinae and the butterflies, which are also thought to
have evolved from a drab, nocturnal, moth-like ancestor. The major goal of this
proposal is to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Dioptinae based on
comparative morphology of adult and larval stages. The dioptine phylogeny will
then serve as a framework for a new classification, and will also be used to
examine two questions: First, when did toxic plant-feeding evolve in the
Dioptinae? Second, when did day-flying behavior evolve?
