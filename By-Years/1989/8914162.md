Description: This project supports participation by 17 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-India workshop on enviromental risk analysis to be held at the Indian
Institute of Technology in New Delhi, December 11-15, 1989. The objectives of
the workshop include: review of the state-of-the-art methods in risk assessment
and emergency preparedness related to the use of hazardous materials in large
quantities by the chemical and petroleum industries; improve quantification
aspects of risk assessment dealing with engineering failures, health effects and
dispersion modeling; and develop strategies for emergency preparedness related
to accidents involving toxic/inflammable materials. It is expected that a
transfer of knowledge to various user agencies will be accomplished. Four
technical sessions will deal with: engineering aspects of risk assessment;
health effects aspects of risk assessment; transfer and fate of toxic air
pollutants vis-a-vis dispersion modeling and risk management. The Indian co-
director is Dr. M.P. Singh, Head, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian
Institute of Technology, (IIT), New Delhi. Scope: The idea of this topic for a
workshop was one of the recommendations of a workshop on risk assessment
techniques and management held at IIT Delhi in October 1987. The idea was later
endorsed by the Indo-U.S. Subcommission on Science and Technology in its
November 1987 meeting. The topic is clearly of great interest to heavily
industrialized countries such as the U.S. and also to countries with large
populations and increasing industries such as India as evidenced by the
incidents in Bhopal, Chernobyl and Mexico City. The workshop is likely to
provide better scientific basis for decision-making to prevent major disasters
and to deal with situations after accidents. The workshop is likely to benefit
scientists in the U.S. and India
