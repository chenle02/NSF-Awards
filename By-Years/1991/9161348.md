Significant research and development is being conducted in near infrared and
infrared lasers with an emphasis on Q-switched pulsed lasers. This presents an
opportunity to investigate the feasibility of three new Q-switch devices for
lasers operating in the one to three micron region. Specifically, we propose
three new devices. First, is a new Brewster window "Zig Zag" acousto-optic Q-
switch device suitable for multi- wavelength laser operation which can be
inserted in to the laser cavity without requiring major realignment. The second
Q-switch device also works in the Zig Zag configuration, but utilizes the
grating electro-optic effect for ultra fast (up to a few nanoseconds) switching
at a much lower drive voltage than conventional electro-optic Q- switches. The
third Q-switch device allows a very simple single frequency laser cavity, and
this new laser will produce an extremely stable and low noise output beam. NEOS
has teamed with two laser manufacturers to assist in testing, product planning
and commercialization of these products.
