The proposed research aims at developing new mathematical and statistical
results needed to efficiently analyze biochemical network models based on data
arriving from the new molecular technology of "deep" DNA sequencing. The project
will focus on developing likelihood-based estimates of the biochemical network
parameters and structure from the data consisting of longitudinal species
counts. With respect to parameter estimation, we shall (i) derive conditions on
the data process which guarantee identifiability and estimators consistency as
well as (ii) consider ways of approximating the likelihood of a partially
observed biochemical network with certain other likelihoods (e.g., Gaussian) for
which inference problem is simplified. With respect to network structure
discovery, we shall develop methods of analyzing algebraic varieties associated
with the geometry of chemical reaction networks in order to find stoichometry
structure most consistent with given data. The theoretical results obtained will
be used to develop a flexible framework for statistical analysis of deep
sequencing data. The resulting algorithms will be implemented with software and
their performance tested in real DNA sequencing
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The deep (or next-gen) sequencing technology
is a revolutionary, up-and-coming tool of modern molecular biology, allowing for
very precise high-throughput measuring of DNA and RNA molecular counts in
cellular systems. The next-gen technology will make it possible for biologists
to formulate and test very specific hypothesis about biochemical interactions of
various molecular species, provided that the proper mathematical modeling and
statistical analysis tools (and their software implementations) will be broadly
available. Due to his scientific background and an interdisciplinary nature of
his work, the proposer is in a unique position to develop and then test such
tools on data of biological relevance, ensuring that the mathematical results of
this research are broadly disseminated to the scientific community of
experimental biologists. By transforming the methodology for data analysis in
DNA-sequencing, the proposed mathematical research will have broad influence on
experimental high-throughput methodology in many different areas of modern
genetics, ecology, and population studies. The project will also result in
further promotion, both statewide and nationally, of the fields of mathematics
and statistics in the context of biological research and the interdisciplinary
training of young researchers.
