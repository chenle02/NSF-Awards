The Pierre Auger Observatory is the world's largest experiment to measure the
properties of cosmic rays with energies above 10^20 eV. The origin of these
cosmic rays remains a profound and compelling mystery in particle astrophysics.
Auger is a hybrid detector consisting of two coincident but distinct detector
systems: (1) an array of 1,660 water-Cherenkov Surface Detector stations spread
over an area of 3,000 square kilometers for detecting air shower particles on
the ground; and (2) a set of four Fluorescence Detector telescopes which provide
calorimetric measurements of the development of cosmic ray showers as they
propagate through the atmosphere. During the past few years, Auger has reported
several important results that place significant constraints on theory and
provide essential clues as to the origin and nature of the highest energy cosmic
rays. This award will support the research activities of the High Energy
Particle Astrophysics (HEA) group at Case Western Reserve University. The group
has central responsibility for GPS event timing and calibration, and for
monitoring the performance of the telecommunications system on a daily basis.
The PI also serves on the Auger Observatory Technical Board as Task Leader for
telecommunications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The group's
expertise in custom wireless communication systems, non-imaging optical systems,
and precise nanosecond GPS timing has led to several methods and instrumentation
that may have applications to other scientific, technical and industrial fields.
The group has worked with approximately 30 undergraduate research assistants
over the past nine years. The PI is also active in a variety of education and
outreach programs such as after school programs.
