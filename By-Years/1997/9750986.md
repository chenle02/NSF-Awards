Support is sought for a multimedia equipped computer classroom to integrate
laboratory exercises throughout the major curriculum and for a courseware
development platform which can be used by department faculty to develop
software. The multimedia classroom and the software developed by department
faculty will 1) serve to integrate the relationship between collecting,
analyzing, and interpreting psychological data; 2) add instruction on computer
based instrumentation to existing courses, 3) expand the range of research
paradigms students experience and work with and 4) make it possible to add
instruction on the use of CD-ROM based research abstract data bases. Support for
this proposal will result in the development of a Website providing access to
laboratory exercises in psychology which take advantage of cutting edge
developments in multimedia presentation. This in turn should enhance the
educational experience of the 1400 students who take psychology courses each
year at Gustavus Adolpus College, resulting a population of citizens better able
to evaluate scientific claims about human behavior. The number and types of
research problems selected and the degree of sophistication of student research
projects, presentations, and publications will be closely monitored to chart the
impact of the strengthened curriculum on student learning.
