Polymer science in this century has focused on the linear chain and its
derivatives such as star polymers, rings, combs, ladders, as well as nonlinear
extensions such as branched polymers and three dimensional networks. This is a
proposal to explore the conversion of molecules making up "bulk" polymers to
two-dimensional forms analogous to sheets with thicknesses of "oligomeric"
dimension. The principal investigators has already identified a possible
synthetic pathway to achieve this goal but the methodology involves the use of
fairly complex precursors. The work proposed here is aimed primarily at the
synthetic simplification of pathways for two-dimensional polymers. Specifically
it is proposed to follow several approaches with different levels of complexity.
One approach involves the use of smectogens with biphenylic cores, and another
the use of living polymerization to construct the necessary reactive oligomers.
Other synthetic pathways are similar to those already developed in the principal
investigator's laboratory using enantiomerically enriched chiral precursors. In
the new approach, the requirement of enantiomeric purity is relaxed and
substituted for the presence of several stereogenic centers. This is a Small
Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).
