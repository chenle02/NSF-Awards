Stochastic models of complex networks with dynamic interactions arise in a wide
variety of applications in science and engineering. Specific instances include
biochemical reaction networks, high-tech manufacturing, computer systems,
telecommunications, transportation, and business service systems. This project
addresses mathematical questions stemming from the challenges of analyzing and
controlling such stochastic networks. The research involves the development of
general theory for some broad classes of stochastic networks and the study of
questions directly motivated by specific applications. Since the complexity of
stochastic networks usually precludes exact analysis of detailed ?microscopic?
models, the focus here is on approximate models. Two levels of approximation are
considered: first-order approximations called fluid models, and second-order
approximations, which frequently are diffusion models. New techniques and
results will be developed with an eye toward application areas. The investigator
will help train a diverse mathematics research workforce through collaboration
with early career researchers and women researchers. The project also provides
training opportunities for graduate students. This project will address
mathematical questions associated with the analysis and control of stochastic
network dynamics. Topics to be addressed include rigorous justification of
approximations, analyzing and controlling the behavior of the approximate
models, and interpreting the results for the original microscopic models. An
important subtheme is understanding the interplay between levels of
approximation. Five topics are to be studied: (i) Diffusion Approximations for
(Bio)Chemical Reaction Networks and Nearly Density-Dependent Markov Chains; (ii)
Analysis of Processor Sharing Networks; (iii) Congestion Control and Resource
Entrainment in Data Networks; (iv) Networks with Random Order of Service and
Reneging; and (v) Dynamic Control of Stochastic Processing Networks. Some
stochastic process aspects of these topics include error quantification in the
approximation of nearly density-dependent Markov chains by reflected diffusion
processes, analysis of measure-valued processes used to track residual job sizes
or patience times in stochastic networks with resource sharing and reneging,
singular diffusion control problems, foundational questions for reflected
processes, and numerical approximation of reflected diffusion processes in non-
smooth domains.
