Primates are highly social animals with large brains and advanced levels of
intelligence. Previous comparative studies of primate intelligence have
overlooked the social dimension of cognition, and have instead focused on highly
repetitive problem-solving tasks. Recently, some researchers have proposed that
certain forms of social intelligence, related to the attribution of intent and
purpose, may be limited to the great apes and humans. If these speculations turn
out to be correct, many ideas concerning the social function of intelligence and
the emergence of complex forms of social skills in the earliest humans will need
to be revised. In this study a series of experiments will evaluate the
proposition that chimpanzees use their own experiences to infer the experiences
of others and attribute intent and responsibility to others, whereas rhesus
monkeys do not. The research will offer important clues about cognitive
capacities linked to food sharing, complex social roles, and non-material
aspects of human culture. More importantly, it will provide a critical test of
the existing model which postulates that self-awareness exists, not in monkeys,
but only in humans and in the higher anthropoids most closely related to humans.
