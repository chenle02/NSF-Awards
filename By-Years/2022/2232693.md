Modern machine learning's success has brought with it a serious challenge for
privacy: it is now widely documented that the models currently in use encode
individual inputs in surprising ways. Understanding how to detect such
memorization, and training methods that avoid it, is a major topic of current
research. However, prior investigations have focused mostly on the batch model
of machine learning, in which training data are all drawn from a single
underlying population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the
privacy risks that arise when the training data from many populations are pooled
in order to take advantage of structure that is shared across populations. For
example, many individuals’ photos could be pooled to train better face
recognition algorithms (even though each person is interested in a different set
of faces). Such settings—called “model personalization”, “multitask learning” or
“meta-learning”—provide a powerful framework for combining insights from far-
flung, disparate data sources. However, their power raises fundamental questions
about the extent to which the results of joint analysis violate the privacy of
individual users' data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project looks both at attacks
on privacy—methods for extracting individual-level or dataset-level information
from the resulting predictions or models—as well as mitigation strategies based
on the now-standard, state-of-the-art framework, differential privacy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves both theoretical analysis and real-
world experimentation. It will inform the development of training algorithms for
these complex settings and provide tools for use by companies and other research
groups. This impact will be facilitated by the project team's existing
collaborations with industry researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
