Geological, geochemical, and isotopic studies indicate that Archean komatiites
at Kambalda, Western Australia, thermally eroded and assimilated crustal rocks
during ascent. Similar komatiites occur in the Chukotat Group of the early
Proterozoic Cape Smith belt in northern Quebec which are superbly exposed and
only slightly metamorphosed. This project is to establish stratigraphic and
petrogenetic relationships between the mineralized komatiitic peridotites and
associated gabbros and basalts of the Chukotat Group, and determine the
influence of thermal erosion and hybridization on the genesis of associated
nickel sulfide mineralization. The project will involve detailed field mapping,
relogging of selected diamond drill cores, whole- rock geochemical and Nd
isotopic analysis, and S isotopic analysis of sulfide ores and sulfide
sediments.
