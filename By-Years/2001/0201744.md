0201744&lt;br/&gt;Schmidt&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this Investigator
Initiated effort is to engineer improved therapies to aid peripheral nerve
repair, with the hypothesis that vascularization at the site of nerve injury is
a key step. The objectives of this project are to develop methods to modulate
angiogenesis in a nerve repair model and to assess the relationship between new
blood vessel growth and nerve fiber regeneration. Critical to the success of the
project is formulation of a degradation resistant hydrogel containing hyaluronic
acid (HA), a biological polymer that is known to promote angiogenesis but is
broken down very quickly in the body. Specific aims are: 1) develop and
characterize HA hydogels, 2) quantify and optimize the angiogenic potential of
HA hydrogels, and 3) use the HA hydrogels to study the effects of varying
vascularization on peripheral nerve regeneration via rat embryo dorsal root
ganglion assays and in vivo rat sciatic nerve regeneration analyses.
