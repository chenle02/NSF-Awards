This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
the feasibility of building networks that can adaptively adjust their cell
coverage (the geographic footprint of the radio signal) to optimize performance.
These adjustments may be in response to changing environmental conditions,
interference, changing traffic patterns, or failures in portions of the system.
The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to facilitate the deployment
of large scale broadband networks by developing technology that can
automatically adapt coverage and mitigate interference. As broadband wide-area
wireless networks (e.g., WiMAX and fourth generation cellular) become more
pervasive and cell sizes become smaller, it becomes increasingly difficult to
set up such networks so they efficiently share the finite RF spectrum. The
problem is exacerbated by the fact that these networks and the environment in
which they exist is changing all the time. This project will demonstrate that
cooperating phased array antennas can continuously adapt their coverage areas to
optimize total network performance using a combination of RF propagation models,
antenna pattern creation algorithms, and constrained optimization procedures
based on client feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial
potential of this project is to increase rate of rollout of the broadband
wireless data networks themselves by increasing their efficiency, improving
their reliability and lowering their cost. Cellular voice networks, which are
narrowband, have become ubiquitous, but broadband wireless data networks are
still emerging. One such example is the WiMax equipment market, which is
presently at $225M/year and is expected to grow to $4.9B by 2013. Such networks
have the potential to transform the way people live and work. They will make
possible the richer collaboration between people that the Internet is beginning
to demonstrate without being tethered to wired broadband networks at their
desks. &lt;br/&gt;
