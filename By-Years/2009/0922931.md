With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Benny
Chan and colleagues Heba Abourahma, Georgia M. Arvanitis, David Hunt and
Stephanie E. Sen from The College of New Jersey will acquire a single-crystal
X-ray diffractometer to support research that includes: 1) synthesis and
characterization of chalcogenide materials; 2) studies on copper hinokitiol and
its adducts; 3) asymmetric induction into Parham cyclizations; 4) polycycle
construction utilizing biomimetic polyene cyclization methods; 5) co-crystals as
active pharmaceutical ingredients, and 6) organic heterocycle chemistry.
Collaborations with Princeton University in solid state chemistry and physics
will also take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique of single-crystal X-ray
crystallography allows accurate and precise determination of the full three
dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it
provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of molecules
relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
number of areas ranging from synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry to
systems of biological interest. This instrument will be an integral part of
teaching as well as research.
