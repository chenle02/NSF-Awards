With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities:
Departmental Multi-User Instrumentation (CRIF:MU) Program, the Department of
Chemistry at the University of South Florida will acquire a high-resolution
electrospray time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometer with a high performance
liquid chromatogram (HPLC). This mass spectrometer will enhance a variety of
research projects including: (a) the isolation and characterization of marine
natural products; (b) the development of organic synthetic methodologies and
their application to the synthesis of biologically important natural products;
(c) characterization of constrained dipeptide units as beta-hairpin stabilizers;
(d) the biosynthesis of novel amide metabolites; (e) the design and synthesis of
novel N-thiolated beta-lactams; and (f) the study of novel, nano-scale, self-
assembled cages. The instrument will be incorporated into both a senior-level
"Methods" course and a graduate-level "Tools of Research" course. The high-
resolution mass spectrometer will also facilitate collaboration between other
USF departments and area industries and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass
spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and
to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
organometallic molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used
analytical instrumentation techniques. The instrument will impact research in
the areas of marine natural products, peptide chemistry, synthetic organic and
inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, materials chemistry, and
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;
