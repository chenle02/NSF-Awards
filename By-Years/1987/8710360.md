The polar grid is used to design a sensor similar to the human eye. The research
is a continuation of that on the design of a prototype charge coupled device;
work is scheduled to improve the prototype. A novel approach is undertaken to
improve the resistive gate and thus reduce the number of polysilicon layers
needed. The focus now is to expand the sensor's capabilities, especially into
new areas; three new areas are identified: the coupler, resistive gate, and
automatic data processing. This project is one supported under the Creativity
Awards for Undergraduate Engineering Students.
