The contraction of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles requires cyclic
interactions between the two main muscle proteins, myosin and actin. The
essential steps in these interactions include the activation of the myosin
ATPase activity by actin and, according to prevalent views, conformational
changes on one or both of these proteins. A major goal of the proposed research
is to clarify the molecular basis of these events. To achieve aim, actin sites
necessary for the activation of the myosin ATPase activity and the motility of
actin filaments will be mapped. The experimental materials to be used in the
mapping of functional sites on actin will include peptide antibodies, actin
mutants, and modified actins. These materials will be used in the in vitro
motility assays, and in biochemical and biophysical assays of actomyosin
interactions. In another part of this program, the structural determinants of
the essential steps in actomyosin interactions will be clarified by comparing
the properties of monomeric and polymeric complexes of actin and myosin.
Peptides, protein fragments, cross- linked protein complexes, peptide
antibodies, and actin mutants will be used in this project. The role of specific
sites on actin in actomyosin interactions will be assessed via chemical
modifications, proteolytic digestions, fluorescence and light scattering
measurements, and other measurements carried out on these materials. Additional
insight into actomyosin interactions will be obtained by clarifying the
mechanism of G-actin polymerization by myosin. %%% The proposed studies should
lead to the elucidation of the basic mechanism of actomyosin interactions and
thus, a better understanding of how the muscle functions and how chemical energy
is transduced into work in biological systems.
