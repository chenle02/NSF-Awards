In order to develop highly reproducible, highly selective, and miniaturized
sensitive electrical DNA sensing platform, it is important to develop and study
sensor-biological interface that is compatible with microfabrication processing
and also provide the requisite sensitivity and stability when exposed to
biological environments. Recent developments in Carbon-MicroElectroMechanical
Systems and Carbon-NanoElectroMechanical Systems have led to simple fabrication
techniques that result in novel micro/nano-scale carbon structures with high-
aspect-ratio and high surface area. The research objective of this award is to
advance fundamental research in the use of pyrolyzed carbon as a bio-sensing
electrode material by testing and engineering various types of carbon electrodes
with high surface areas and different arrangements, developing methods of
increasing the surface immobilization efficiency of bio molecules, engineering
techniques for bio molecules immobilization on polymer/carbon interfaces, and
further understanding fundamental chemical and electrochemical phenomena
occurring at or near bio/carbon or bio/polymer/carbon interfaces.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide
an opportunity to create next generation highly sensitive and highly selective
inexpensive portable biosensors. This research will broaden the participation of
women and minority students in science and engineering, and also foster
interdisciplinary interactions with students (especially Hispanic minority
students). The research results will be broadly disseminated to enhance
scientific and technological understanding through presentation at conferences
and publication in journals. In this project, we will effect graduate and
undergraduate education and try to raise the awareness in state-of-arts MEMS
device and biotechnology for elementary and high school students in local area.
Newly developed technique will be highlighted in graduate courses. &lt;br/&gt;
