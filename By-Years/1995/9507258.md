A new type of polarized target based on frozen hydrogen- deuterium molecules
will be developed. The techniques will be adapted from the technology developed
for producing pellets used in laser-driven fusion studies. With nuclear spins
aligned, these targets will be used to explore the spin-dependent structure of
the nucleon. Specifically, a theoretical sum rule (the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum
rule) will be tested which relates, on one side, the difference in the
integrated total photo-absorption cross-section between measurements with photon
spin aligned and opposed to the nuclear spin direction, to, on the other side,
the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon. This is a very high priority
experiment within nuclear physics which relates to our fundamental understanding
of the structure of the nucleon. The new technology will permit an order of
magnitude increase in precision of such measurements. Education is also integral
to this activity. The state-of-the-art technology developed will involve many
skills including low temperature techniques. Graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows will be involved in all phases of the work. The training will be useful
in many other settings.
