In this project, undergraduate computer science faculty interact with senior
industrial software project managers and other industrial software
practitioners. Activities include discussion of current literature and
construction of solution approaches to proposed software development and project
management scenarios. Participants observe current software engineering
practices and tools in action at industrial sites and discuss with industry
practitioners the standards and procedures used. The first phase of the project
is a six day session during which participants will interact with the
individuals from industry. Then the participants will develop an academic
project to incorporate material into their classroom. Following this development
there will be a two day session to share the results of this development.
Finally the ideas will be actually be used in the classroom.//
