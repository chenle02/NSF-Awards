Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (OCTech), a minority-serving institution,
is addressing South Carolina's growing need for renewable energy technicians by
developing renewable energy curriculum modules for infusion into class-based,
online, and hybrid energy education programs in community colleges and
universities that serve students, as well as secondary in-service and pre-
service teachers. The Curriculum Infusion project is (1) developing a 15-module
Renewable Energy curriculum, (2) infusing renewable energy content into 20
existing courses and 12 programs at the college and South Carolina State
University, (3) providing professional development on renewable energy to 180
secondary teachers, 20 community college and university faculty, and 25 teaching
assistants, (4) defining a 2+2+2 Renewable Energy educational pathway from high
school to community college to university, and (5) disseminating the modules
electronically to South Carolina's 16 technical colleges and their service area
high schools.
