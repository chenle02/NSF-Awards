9311496 Hutchins This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
award. Culture is a process that makes available to humans resources for the
organization of behavior. This organization is accomplished via both learned
internal cognitive structures and created social and material structures in the
environment. Until recently, the cognitive sciences have not had very good
conceptual tools for describing the interaction of individual behavior and
culturalprocess. The P.I. is engaged in a project which uses computer
simulations to complement theories of culture and cognition via modelling the
properties of groups of interacting learning agents. By taking the group as a
unit of analysis-both here and in the real-world study of cognition-the
investigator has made important progress toward a theory which reunites social
and material mediators of individual behavior with traditional individual
cognitive properties. The P.I. proposes establishing a dedicated research
project centered on simulations of cultural process for the purpose of
elaborating this theory.
