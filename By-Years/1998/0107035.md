Over the past five years, the Principal Ivestigator and student assistants have
developed a series of Internet-based courses in a related set of undergraduate
mathematics courses utilizing locally developed software for geometric
visualization and for communication betwee students and instructors and among
students. These new models for teaching and learning change the timing and the
level of interactivity for instructors and students, and increase the ability of
students to handle complex geometric phenomena. These innovations provide new
models for teaching and learning which will be further developed, tested, and
evaluated during the period of the proposal. The aim is to produce effective
software that can be used in a wide variety of institutions with students at
different levels, for mathematics and for its applications to physical science,
computer science, and engineering. (Areas of concentration: quadrats 2 and 3.)
