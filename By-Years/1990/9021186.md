Spalangia cameroni is a small wasp which lays its eggs in the pupal stage of
house flies. This research focuses on the ability of female S. cameroni to
manipulate the offspring sex ratios (the proportion of sons) they produce in
response to the size of the host (fly) in which the offspring is laid. Females
lay a greater proportion of sons on small hosts than on large hosts. An effect
of host size on wasp offspring sex ratios has now been found in more than forty
species of parasitoid wasps in thirteen different families. This research will
address two areas for which there is currently very little information: how
manipulation of sex ratio in response to host size affects a mother's success at
reproducing and how mothers assess host size. Species of Spalangia have been
released in poultry houses and stables to control pest flies, especially house
flies. Use of such "biological controls" is becoming increasingly important as
the flies become resistant to more and more insecticides. Research on sex ratios
is important in terms of being able successfully to rear large numbers of wasps
for release.
