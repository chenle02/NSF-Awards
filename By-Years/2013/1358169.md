This award will provide renewed funding of the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory (NRAO) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU
program will be offered annually to fifteen qualified applicants in three
locations: Socorro, NM; Green Bank, WV; and Charlottesville, VA. These sites are
the headquarters for the operations of the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA), Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), respectively. Students will perform
cutting-edge research in several areas, including all fields of astronomy
(cosmology, extragalactic, galactic, stellar, solar system, astrochemistry,
pulsars, etc.), as well as astronomical engineering and computing. In addition
to their assigned research project, all students participate in a hands-on
observing experience using the NRAO GBT, VLA, and/or
VLBA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will enable a pipeline of skilled
scientists and engineers to be developed in the field of radio astronomy, which
is critical for the infrastructure of NSF-funded facilities. The program has
also demonstrated its effectiveness in retaining students in STEM fields:
indeed, over 300 past participants remain in the field of astronomy. Finally,
participants also receive instruction and experience with communicating their
scientific research through oral and written presentation of their research
project results, including the opportunity to present their research at a
professional meeting following their appointment.
