This award supports a three-year collaborative research project between
Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Pennsylvania State University and Dr. Yuji
Hasemi, Building Research Institute, Ministry of Construction, Tsukuba, Japan.
In addition, a graduate student from Dr. Kulkarni's laboratory will conduct
research at the Building Research Institute for this project. The objective of
the project is to understand the fundamentals of the behavior of materials
burning in an upward flame spread configuration under a simulated surrounding
fire condition and to develop a mathematical model to predict upward flame
spread and fire growth. Upward flame spread is the most hazardous mode of flame
spread; and in a room fire situation where surrounding walls impart radiant flux
to each other, upward flame spread rates are significantly enhanced. The U.S.
and Japanese groups will approach the problem from different directions. At Penn
State, intermediate scale and small scale experimental facilities have been
constructed to study flame spread as well as to measure relevant material
properties, and a numerical upward flame spread model has been developed. At BRI
there are extensive experimental facilities, large enough for full scale
testing. The different approaches to investigation of upward flame spread will
allow the groups to benefit from each other's resources and experience and will
provide a cohesive research plan to enhance progress toward understanding the
upward flame spread process.
