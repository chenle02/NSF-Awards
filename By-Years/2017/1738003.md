The research presented in this project resides in threat detection and disaster
management. Significant mathematical contributions to this field are still
needed, due in part to the ongoing revolution with complex data problems, known
as the Big Data paradigm. This project aims to bridge the big data gap,
providing added value to the field while simultaneously expanding the impact of
modern mathematics. With this point of view, this project studies potentially
predictive disaster scenarios, from radioactive leaks, to modern battlefield
issues, to natural disasters. However, the notion of threat in this project is
not limited to an earthquake, flood, or nuclear explosion, but rather what
impedes the people affected by disasters. The project research intends to
provide efficient ways of disaster aftermath
management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic Threat Detection (ATD) is a
predictive concept that must be quantified and effectively designed to address
major defense problems. After analysis of recent disaster scenarios, a suite of
technologies have been formulated that use mathematics to help mitigate disaster
impacts. Machine learning and deep learning are major techniques in this suite,
and involve data processing, spectral graph analysis, Schroedinger eigenmap
technology with customized non-linear potentials, transport models, and recent
innovations, ideas, and results dealing with Fourier scattering transforms,
pooling operators, and convolutional neural networks. Essentially, this work
develops a toolkit from modern applied harmonic analysis and machine learning.
The mathematical rigor in this work will enable us to construct fast and
efficient disaster mitigation implementations. The ideas and results proposed
here are new and innovative, and the applications to threat detection are timely
and relevant. These methods may also impact other areas of science.
