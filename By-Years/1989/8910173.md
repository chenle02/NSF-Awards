This Research Initiation Award will help Dr. Abramson develop his ideas on
probabilistic state-space planning for robotic applications. Traditional AI
planning assumes that agents are in known states and have access to easily
characterized inputs. Robotic planners must deal with incomplete and uncertain
information about unpredictable environments. Dr. Abramson intends to develop
probabilistic planning methods for use in assembly plants and other robotic
domains.
