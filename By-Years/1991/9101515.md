This award is for a series of three workshops in Geometric Topology to be held
in 1991, 1992 and 1993. The workshops will be advertised nationally, and support
will be extended primarily to active research mathematicians without other NSF
support and to graduate students. Most of the participants are expected to come
from the Midwest and Western United States. One goal of these workshops is to
provide participants an opportunity to discuss their work with others in the
field. Another goal is to expand the interests of the participants by having a
nationally recognized expert discuss an area of topology which is related to but
outside the focus of their current work. The first workshop will be held during
a four day period at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in June 1991. Andrew
Casson of the University of California at Berkeley has agreed to be the
principal speaker at this workshop. Similar four day workshops will be held in
the summers of 1992 and 1993 at Colorado College and at Oregon State University.
