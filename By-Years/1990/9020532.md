This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
the work of Drs. Scot E. Wherland, John P. Hunt, and Harold W. Dodgen of the
Chemistry Department, Washington State University, for the study of the effect
of pressure on electron transfer reactions in nonaqueous solutions. Specific
systems chosen for study include metallocenes, a series of chromium isonitriles,
and substitution-proof clathrochelates. The primary methods of investigation
will be stopped-flow and NMR. In addition to pressure, temperature dependence,
solvent variation, and ionic strength will be studied. Rate control by solvents
or electron tunneling at low temperatures may be observed. %%% This project may
increase understanding of the fundamental nature of oxidation-reduction
reactions in nonaqueous media and influence theoretical development in this
area. The results would also be useful for organometallic chemistry, catalytic
reactions, and some biological processes involving cell membranes. An
understanding of the role of solvents could lead to some control of reaction
rates by solvent variation.
