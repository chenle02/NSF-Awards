Intellectual Merit: The MEMS community comes together annually at a few high-
quality conferences. IEEE MEMS is one of these conferences. Now in its 24th
year, it has the reputation to attract the best new results research and the top
scientists in the field. For a recent or soon-to-be Ph.D. graduate, it is one of
the best opportunities to disseminate one?s work, to network, and to position
oneself in the job market. Presenting a paper or poster at IEEE MEMS is a
valuable experience; giving a talk to the 700+ attendees in a large lecture hall
is a unique event in one?s career. This grant will help maximizing the number of
students that can have this experience.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The IEEE MEMS
11 program consists of single-track oral presentations and poster sessions. In
addition, group lunches and dinners will provide ample opportunities for
attendees to network and socialize. In addition, we are introducing several
innovations to the format and organization of IEEE MEMS that are intended to
strengthen its impact.&lt;br/&gt;The support for this conference will enable and
enhance graduate student participation.
