9633447 Walcoff This project requests funds over 4 months to conduct planning
activities in support of an effort to communicate science and mathematics reform
to educators and the public. The planning period will conduct research in
preparation of what could be a larger initiative. Specifically, the project will
identify: 1) issues and concerns of the public regarding math and science
reform; 2) issues and concerns of professional educators about math and science
reform; 3) current misconceptions and biases regarding science and math reform;
and 4) strategies for reaching the public with needed information about these
issues.
