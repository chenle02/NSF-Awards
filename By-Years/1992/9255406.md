The workshop will focus on procedures for collection and analysis of geologic
data required to evaluate subsurface conditions for environmental studies. The
unique criteria for and limitation of groundwater monitoring, soil sampling, and
development of sampling plans to meet regulatory criteria will be stressed. With
its emphasis on practical considerations, the workshop will provide geology
faculty with the necessary background in environmental science to introduce
their students to the current practices in this area.
