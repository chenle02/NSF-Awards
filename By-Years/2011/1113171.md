This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
potential of creating a free consumer medical financial management portal. The
portal will pull in health care financial data and organize it in a fashion that
allows consumers to understand and act on their health care data. The research
will also explore the possibility of funding the product by providing value-
added solutions to the healthcare industry through innovative software
engineering algorithms. The rising costs of health care, the growing popularity
of Consumer-driven Health Care plans, and the aging of America?s population have
all increased the need for more consumer control over health care finances.
Consumers currently have no easy way to reconcile paper statements from payers
and providers and are forced to manage it with spreadsheets, notebooks, and
sticky notes. Although data for managing medical finances is starting to become
available, consumers do not yet have the tools to do it.

The 250 million Americans with health insurance are known to be frustrated by
the overwhelming volume and complexity of health care financial paperwork. They
don't understand if they are being charged correctly, if doctors are filing
claims correctly, or if their insurance company is correctly passing costs to
them. This confusion causes extra cost to the health care system. Consumers pay
bills they do not owe and delay paying bills they do owe. Health Insurance and
provider call centers are inundated with customer calls about arcane billing and
coding messages on Explanation of Benefits letters. Criminals exploit consumer
confusion to defraud payers for hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These
frictions all increase health care costs and ultimately result in lower care.
The proposed solution will allow use of data mining, analytic rules engines,
pattern matching, and other tools to provide consumers with a free health care
financial management engine and a fraud detection system for health care payers.
If successful, the proposed solution will help consumers become healthier, save
money, and help reduce the drag fraud creates on our national competitiveness.
