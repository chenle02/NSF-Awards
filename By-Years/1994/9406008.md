9406008 Kovash Radiative pion and kaon capture experiments will be performed on
hydrogen and deuterium targets at TRIUMF and the Brookhaven National Lab's AGS
facility, respectively. The goals are to obtain low energy properties of the
neutron-neutron interaction and the hyperon-nucleon interactions. In addition,
pion capture followed by electron-positron emission will be measured. This will
provide information of the pion and nucleon form factors, both of fundamental
interest. ***
