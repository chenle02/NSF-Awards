This award will support a two-day conference on climate change and species
interactions. Changing climatic conditions threaten some species with declines
and extinctions, can induce pests and pathogens to spread, and can disrupt local
communities of interacting species. These changes present major challenges for
ecologists, including: (1) predicting how individual species will change in
their traits, abundance, and distribution; (2) understanding how communities of
interacting species will change in their structure and function; and (3)
forecasting how the anticipated changes in these species and communities will
influence their abilities to provide ecosystem services such as air and water
filtration, carbon sequestration, erosion prevention, and protection against
disease. Scientists need new models, experimental approaches, and statistical
tools to address these challenges, and specifically to project where individual
species will move, how species will evolve, how entire ecological communities
will change, and how those species and communities will change in their
abilities to perform ecosystem services. Conference sessions will include:
Beyond traditional models of climate change and species responses; Neglected
issues in climate change/species interactions research; Ways forward: Concepts;
and Ways forward: Approaches. Presentations and discussions will be summarized
in an edited book and white paper. Mitigating the negative effects of climate
change on ecological communities and the ecosystem services they provide
requires advances in basic science and strategies to guide future efforts. In
addition to fostering critical networking of a diverse set of ecologists and
evolutionary biologists working on impacts of climate change, the conference and
book will provide the materials for both established and student ecologists,
policy experts, and natural resource managers to pose creative and effective
solutions to the environmental and societal problems caused by climate change.
