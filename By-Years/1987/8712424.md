This award supports cooperative research in mathematics, focusing on three areas
of approximation theory and its applications, between Dr. Charles Chui of Texas
A&amp;M University and Dr. Charles Micchelli, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center,
and Hu Yingsheng and Chen Hanlin, Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. This project will bring together two specialists in spline functions
from the US and two from China to work together on developing further the theory
of spline functions, to construct algorithms, to improve existing computational
methods and to explore other applications to science and engineering problems.
The work supported under this grant will draw on an earlier collaboration among
the PI's which has proven very productive. This project is supported under the
US-China Agreement in Basic Sciences by the National Science Foundation and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
