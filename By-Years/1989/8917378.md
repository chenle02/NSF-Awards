Studies directed at understanding those processes by which plants control the
level of the phytohormone, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), are complicated by
multiple problems associated with experimental designs using terrestrial plants
as study organisms. To avoid many of the difficulties, a system using the
aquatic plant Lemna gibba has been developed for the selection of metabolic
mutants and their subsequent biochemical evaluation. Studies of IAA metabolism
will be continued using these techniques and a previously generated unique
germplasm. Specifically, inbred lines of Lemna will be mutagenized to obtain
additional mutants. Various screening procudures will be used on the resulting
mutant population to obtain lines altered in several different aspects of IAA
metabolism. Furthermore, the biochemical and genetic characteristics of mutants
already in hand and those recently selected will be defined. Indole-3-acetic
acid occurs in minute amounts in higher plants where it is thought to function
hormonally to control a variety of events during plant development. By acting
through hormone messengers, a plant is able to control its orderly growth and
development. It is implicit that if hormones are to regulate plant processes,
then the concentration of the bioactive compound must itself be requlated. This
research provides an in-depth study of the events that regulate the synthesis
and activity of the enzymes or other regulators involved in the metabolism of
IAA.
