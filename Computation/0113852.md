This project aims to advance the state of the art in fast iterative algorithms
for large-scale semidefinite programming and eigenvalue optimization, guided by
applications to first-principles computation of properties of systems of many
electrons. Semidefinite optimization codes will be rewritten to replace dense
linear algebra and direct matrix factorizations by iterative solution processes
suited to large and sparse problems. Numerical experiments will be carried out
with different mathematical formulations and implementations of the sparse
optimization procedures. The guiding application is a variational formulation of
the electronic structure ground state problem in which the unknowns are the one-
body and two-body reduced density matrices of a many electron system. This
application gives rise to a large semidefinite program having sparse solution
matrices and an extremely sparse constraint set. The codes that are developed
under this grant will be written and documented with the intent of wide
dissemination.

Semidefinite programming is a valuable framework for many scientific and
engineering applications, including systems control, structural analysis,
combinatorial optimization, statistical estimation and VLSI design, just to name
a few well-established ones besides electronic structure theory. This project
aims to increase our ability to compute solutions to problem instances whose
size places them beyond the reach of current numerical methods. As to the
specific application in this project, the computation of properties of many-body
systems on the basis of quantum mechanics is fundamental to the understanding of
molecular and solid state structure, chemical and elementary biochemical
processes, and mechanical and electromagnetic properties of condensed matter.
Potential benefits to technology and society from advances in the accuracy and
scale of many-body quantum mechanical computations include, for example, better
design of semiconductors, magnetic storage materials, high-temperature
superconductors and chemical catalysts, as well as improvements in the emerging
areas of rational drug design and the design of carbon nanostructures.
