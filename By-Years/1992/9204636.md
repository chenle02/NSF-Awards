The principal investigator will test the hypothesis that partial melting in
association with caldera collapse, and especially resurgent uplift, has a
profound effect on the chemical evolution of silicic magma chambers. To do so
she will study the Minarets caldera complex in the central Sierra Nevada, which
is ideally suited to the goals of the study.
