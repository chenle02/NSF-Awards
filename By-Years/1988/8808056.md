The project addresses some of the factors limiting the current density of the
new, high-temperature ceramic oxide superconducting materials. It is known that
critical current density is much higher along the basal plane of the
orthorhomlic structure of the YBa2Cu3O7- material than along the C-axis
perpendicular to the basal plane. This project will investigate the effect of
precursors, mixing and heat treatment, grinding and separation of
superconducting ceramic oxide powder. Emphasis will be on developing schemes for
separation of YBa2Cu3O7- powder based on its morphological, compositional and
size differences. This may enable orientation of the grains of bulk material
preferentially along the direction of current flow.
