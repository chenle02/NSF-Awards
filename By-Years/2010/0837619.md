Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;Polymers and polymer-based composites
are rapidly replacing metals as the material of choice in many engineering
applications and characterizing the behavior of polymeric materials demands
concepts and tools that are different from those that describe the response of
metals. In contrast, the fundamental strength of materials course on most
campuses has remained unchanged for decades. Through this project, the mechanics
of materials course is being transformed to include modern topics and new
pedagogies. The focus of the course is on the fundamental behavior of materials
in terms of loading and failure with attention to the general case of non-linear
materials and their practical applications. Linear materials response, which
constitutes the traditional educational approach to mechanics of materials
instruction, is included in the course as a specific case that extends from the
general case. The course is being taught using a problem-based-learning approach
with seven challenges selected to highlight both traditional and modern
materials as well as linear and non-linear behavior. Student learning through
this new approach is being rigorously assessed and compared to learning through
traditional courses.
