Modulating the level of protein biosynthetic machinery in response to growth
conditions is of utmost importance to every living cell. In E. coli, two
different regulatory systems couple the rate of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis
to growth rate. However, the actual mechanism(s) linking the central metabolism
of the cell to the rate of rRNA synthesis remain completely unknown. The
observation that increased amounts of fructose 1,6 biphosphate (FbP)
preferentially inhibits in connecting central metabolism regulation of rRNA
synthesis. The development of a crude transcription-translation system in which
FbP specially inhibits rRNA synthesis provides an experimental system for
dissecting this effect. Experiments to determine whether RNA polymerase alone or
additional factors in the crude extract are needed for inhibition will determine
the target of FbP action. Genetic analysis of this interaction will establish
the growth conditions under which the regulatory circuit involving FbP is
operative. %%% This project offers a chance to understand a molecular circuit
that couples rRNA synthesis to carbon metabolism, a problem of central
importance to every living organism that has not been elucidated in any
experimental system.
