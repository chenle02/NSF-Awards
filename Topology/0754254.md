The Department of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee will host the Forty-second Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical
Systems Conference from March 13 through 15, 2008.

The Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conferences (STDC) have been among the
most successful annual topological conferences in the nation, attracting an
international audience. Over the years the STDC has broadened its scope,
encompassing most areas of topology and topological approaches to dynamical
systems. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in this broad and
deep interaction among adjacent research areas. It is expected that the
conference will attract approximately 200 participants, nationally and
internationally.
