The mathematical field of combinatorics and graph theory studies patterns of
relationships between objects, and has applications throughout the mathematical,
physical, biological, and social sciences and engineering. This makes it an
ideal area in which to train interdisciplinary scientists with strong
computational skills. This Research Training Group (RTG) in Combinatorics,
Computation, and Applications builds on and expands the Iowa State University
Mathematics Department's nationally recognized work in recruitment, retention,
graduation and placement of groups underrepresented in mathematics; the RTG
faculty team provides mathematical role models for women, minorities, and
veterans. This program will use computation, experimentation, and applications
to facilitate the transition from student to research mathematician, using teams
of undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and
faculty to prepare junior personnel for successful careers in academia or
industry. Research projects in Combinatorics in Algebra and Geometry, Extremal
and Probabilistic Combinatorics, and Applied Combinatorics will foster a
bidirectional flow of ideas between combinatorics and applications. A rotation
model will be adapted from the bench sciences to provide broad training for both
graduate and undergraduate students on a variety of different topics through the
use of research teams; leadership of the teams will be provided by postdoctoral
associates. The RTG will collaborate with the Graduate Research Workshop in
Combinatorics (GRWC), with RTG trainees participating and the establishment of a
pre-GRWC mini-course providing training in tools of computational combinatorics.
Mentoring is a key component: the RTG faculty will mentor all participants and
postdoctoral associates and graduate students will mentor those junior to
themselves.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
