Numerous symbiotic associations between chemotrophic bacteria and marine
bivalves have been identified over the last three decades. Most are associations
with thiotrophic (sulfur-oxidizing) bacteria, but methanotrophic (methane-
oxidizing) and dual symbiosis of thiotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria have
also been reported from deep-water bivalves. This laboratory has recently found
bacterial endosymbionts in lucinid bivalves from shallow seagrass beds of
Florida and the Bahamas that indicate a dual system in Phacoides pectinatus
hosts. This project will take advantage of the availability of these bivalves to
(1) resolve the phylogeny of genes associated with thiotrophic and
methanotrophic bacterial metabolism from P. pectinatus hosts, and (2) use this
genomic information to develop a combination of fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) technologies, microautoradiography and secondary ion mass
spectroscopy to assess endosymbiont abundance and sulfide and methane
utilization in the same animals. The multidisciplinary findings will not only
provide insight into this novel bivalve symbiosis, but will have the potential
to transform the field of symbiosis biology. Because lucinids substantially
impact the productivity and diversity of seagrass beds and other nearshore
marine environments, with abundances of up to 1500 individuals/m2, this research
will improve understanding of methane cycling in climatically sensitive,
nearshore marine systems, and should have broad implications for coastal
resource management decisions in threatened coastal settings. The research will
directly contribute to an enriching research and educational opportunity for
women and minority students that are underrepresented in STEM areas. The
findings will be used to develop online grade-appropriate science-education
modules on 'animal-bacterial partnerships' for the K-12 science-education
community.
