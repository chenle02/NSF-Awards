MRI: Acquisition of Research Computational Equipment

This proposal from an EPCoR state, aiming at performing collaborative research
on computational and visualization aspects of various application areas, targets
interactive computational environments and intelligent systems; more
specifically, parallel processing, scientific visualization, and intelligent
systems. The work, requiring a high performance infrastructure, supports complex
computing and the ability to visualize, store, and easily retrieve large data
sets. The advancement of research techniques again requires significantly
improved distributed computing and visualization capabilities. The computational
steering tools require analysis involving consistency, latency, scalability, and
perturbation costs. Research activities in an Interactive Computational
Environment (ICE) involve: 1. Seamless Monitoring and Steering of High-
Performance Distributed Computations, 2. Realistic Simulators, and 3.
Computational models. The intelligent systems component explores information
systems (new techniques and applications for machine learning, e.g., user
profiles), information relevance and retrieval, efficient methods for human-
computer interaction, and multi-agent research.
