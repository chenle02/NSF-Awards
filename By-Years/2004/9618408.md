Hankins, Timothy AST 96-18408 Drs. Hankins, Eilek, and Weatherall will carry
out an observational and theoretical program of study into the mechanisms for
radio emission from pulsars. The investigators combine an observational program
which includes ultra-high time resolution pulsar observations with theoretical
and numerical analysis and simulations that is driven by specific tests with
observations. Ultra-high time resolution sampling of several bright pulsars
allows them to discriminate between specific models for radio emission. They
will also determine the physical conditions in the radio-loud region, through
analysis of the plasma dynamics of the polar cap. ***
