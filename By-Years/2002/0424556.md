MII: Holistic Model for Minority Education and Research
(HOMMER)&lt;br/&gt;Deidre W. Evans, Principal Investigator, Florida A&amp;M
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to increase the number of
minority students pursuing M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science by
enhancing the research infrastructure of the Department of Computer and
Information Sciences. The holistic approach reflects a commitment to enhancing
all aspects of the student experience that have an impact on the ability to
produce highly qualified graduates capable of pursuing graduate degrees in
computing: strong academic programs and instruction, career mentoring, diverse
faculty research, mentored student research, and computing resources for
education and research. The Student Success Assurance component promotes
graduate study as a desirable and achievable option for capable students, and it
supports students through workshops, mentoring, advisement, and paid positions
for research or instructional support. The Research Productivity Enhancement
component seeks to evolve four strong, sustainable research programs through
strategic collaboration across disciplines and institutions: Software
Engineering (specification-based testing); Security and Information Assurance
(intrusion detection, privacy and accountability); Intelligent Computing (HCI
assistive technology, knowledge/agent based computing and informatics);
Scientific Computing (parallel and high performance computing architectures and
algorithms for scientific research and computing, e.g., nano-technology). The
Computer Facilities Enhancement component will upgrade computing resources for
instruction and research, including establishing a Security and Robotics
Laboratory. The broader impacts of this project include increased participation
of minorities in graduate study in computing and the dissemination of a model
for attracting and preparing students for graduate study.&lt;br/&gt;
