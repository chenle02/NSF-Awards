Circadian rhythms are cyclic biological activities that recur at the same time
every day. In mammals, a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN) is important for these rhythms, and constitutes part of the biological
clock mechanism. These rhythms continue to run under constant conditions, but
environmental cues such as timing of daylight can set, or entrain, the timing or
phase-shifting of the cycles. Sex differences have been described in the
entrained circadian rhythms of most mammals that have been examined, and recent
data suggest that steroid hormones can influence the function of the circadian
clock biochemistry in the SCN. Most animals used for circadian research are
nocturnal rodents, but there are some data on two diurnal species, the human and
a rodent called the degu. In the degu, sexually dimorphic circadian effects are
seen in responses to free-running periods, light stimuli, and modulation by
hormones, among other factors. The sexual dimorphism develops just after
puberty, and appears to require changes in both sexes. This project uses
biochemical, molecular and behavioral approaches to determine whether sexual
differentiation occurs when molecular receptors for estrogen and/or androgen are
up-regulated in the SCN, and whether sexual differentiation of circadian rhythms
is reflected in changed cycles of the gene expression of key cellular proteins
(PER and CRY) that generate the cycles. &lt;br/&gt; Results from this project
will be important for general biology and psychology as well as
neuroendocrinology, for understanding hormonal and genetic mechanisms of
circadian rhythms in mammals, for evolutionary comparisons with nocturnal
mammals, and potentially for better understanding of how human circadian rhythms
develop during adolescence. This project is also in a laboratory with an
excellent record of research mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
