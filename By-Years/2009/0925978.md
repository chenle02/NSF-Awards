Dr. Peter Whiteley (Anthropology) and Dr. Ward Wheeler (Invertebrate
Zoology/Scientific Computing) of the American Museum of Natural History, New
York, will adapt software designed for phylogenetic research (the study of
evolutionary relatedness among various groups of biological organisms), to
develop and apply an innovative anthro-informatics approach to cross-cultural
data on human kinship and social systems. Using data drawn from published
ethnographies and ethnographic databases, the researchers will use the software
to compare social, cultural, and ecological features associated with a
historically critical system of reckoning kinship and family relations
worldwide. Kinship systems once organized all social systems, prior to the
emergence of the state, and, therefore, explaining kinship systems is key to
understanding patterns of human social evolution.

The software to be used (POY4) allows for testing likelihoods of feature
transmission horizontally through space (i.e., via diffusion of learned
behavior) as well as vertically through time (via simple inheritance). This is
important because human behavior is learned between cultures as well as passed
down within single cultures. The focal kinship systems, which appear to be
evolutionarily transitional, are known collectively as Crow-Omaha systems by
specialists. The hypotheses to be tested include whether they have distinctive
associations with other features of social organization, whether they evolve
from other known systems, and whether certain economic and ecological conditions
favor their rise and spread.

The research will enable scientists to better explain the associations of
particular kinship systems and other behavioral phenomena, resulting in
significant implications for the understanding human social organization over
time and space. Funding this research also supports graduate student education.
