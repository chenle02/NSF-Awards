Dr. Bird is organizing a one and one-half day conference/workshop to be held in
conjunction with the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS) in February 1993 in Boston Massachusetts. The aim
of the program is to assist educators and administrators in the development of
undergraduate and graduate level programs that address the wide range of ethical
concerns associated with professions in the sciences and engineering. The
workshop consists of lectures, symposia, discussion groups, demonstrations wand
worships designed to provide educators with theoretical foundations and
practical tools for addressing issues of professional ethics. The sessions
identify the ethical concerns of science professionals in a wide range of
sciences including the physical, biological, social and information sciences and
engineering. Sessions are also to facilitate discussion within and across
disciplines, and provide the opportunity both to clarify issues and to learn
about teaching strategies, techniques and tools that have been developed.
