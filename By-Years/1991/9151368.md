Students are learning calculus in an integrated computational environment that
supports full student and faculty use of a Computer Algebra System (we plan to
use DRIVE) and other relevant software in classrooms and in a dedicated
mathematics laboratory. The project is to fostering "learning by discovery",
enlivening the teaching of calculus, and making students active participants
rather than passive observers by providing guided learning experiences that both
challenges and engages them.
