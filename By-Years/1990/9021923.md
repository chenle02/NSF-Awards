In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of
the Chemistry Division, Gladfelter will study how certain catalysts promote the
conversion of nitroaromatic compounds into isocyanates. A possible outcome of
the project is a safer and more environmentally benign method for the production
of isocyanates, an important class of commercial chemicals. Attempts will be
made to elucidate the mechanism of the homogeneous catalytic carbonylation of
nitroaromatics, a reaction that may be capable of replacing the current
phosgene- based technology for the production of isocyanates. The methods
involve kinetic studies of the catalysis, in situ FTIR and NMR spectroscopies
conducted at high temperature and pressure, and isolation and characterization
of catalytic intermediates. Three ruthenium carbonyl catalysts will be studied:
a monomer containing the bis(diphenylphosphino)methane ligand, the recently
discovered binuclear species containing two bis(dimethylphosphino)methane
ligands, and triruthenium dodecacarbonyl.
