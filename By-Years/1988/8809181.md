The objective of this work is to evaluate and compare under field conditions,
two new methods with conventional ones for stabilizing collapsible soils
profiles for small building construction. Small footings constructed on soil
plots stabilized by: 1) no treatment; 2) pre-wettings; 3) pre-wetting with 2%
sodium silicate solution; 4) excavation and replacement; 5) dynamic compaction
on dry soil; and 6) dynamic compaction on pre-wet soil will be compared in their
behavior and cost. Prevention of small structures collapse and economical
mitigation measures especially in large portions of the U.S., together with the
collection of needed data are some of the benefits stemming from this project.
