This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the
design of a steam modulated water jet that can be used for surface cleaning or
material machining operations. The collapse of a steam bubble in subcooled water
is known to result in pressure waves of very large magnitude. These pressure
waves can be used to fracture and/or remove material from a surface if directed.
A water nozzle which periodically injects steam bubbles into subcooled water
will be studied. The pressure from the collapsing steam bubbles is directed
through an acoustically designed nozzle to the work surface. It is anticipated
that the device, when perfected, could be used to remove any affixed material
safely and efficiently without degrading the properties of the substrate surface
(wood, steel, concrete, or composite) or otherwise fatiguing or damaging the
surface. All of the removed material is carried away in a filtered water stream
and produces minimum waste and no dust. The successful development of a steam
modulated water jet cleaner would result in a new cleaning tool which has no
moving parts and the potential for achieving material removal rates heretofore
not attainable, with minimum waste, no dust, substantially lower cost, enhanced
operator safety, and surface integrity maintained.
