The present grant is devoted to the study of interactions among a few atoms and
possible ways one can achieve quantum control in the regime of ultracold
temperatures relevant for quantum gases. Few-atom systems pose some of the
greatest challenges facing theorists in atomic physics because of the extremely
nonperturbative nature of the interactions. The goal of the proposal is to
develop the theoretical tools and explore the basic capabilities and
implications of new types of resonances. The investigation will center on
controlling the complex multichannel collision dynamics with electromagnetic or
static external fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A specific aim of the present
project is to explore the viability of using a laser field to change the
interactions among three or four atoms. The work could potentially have
unprecedented impact with far-reaching scientific and technological
ramifications. The ability to change atomic behaviors and interactions will have
key impact in the quantum control of chemical reaction dynamics. A deep
understanding of the ultracold atom interactions will find applications in
atomic clocks, quantum information science and for the exploration of many novel
phases of matter. The work has an important educational impact as it provides
training to graduate and undergraduate students in forefront computational and
theoretical research techniques.
