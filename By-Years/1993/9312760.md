ATM-9312760 Haupt, Sue Ellen University of Colorado, Boulder Title: Inverse
Models and Orthogonal Decompositions in Geophysical Flow The purpose of this
project is to simultaneously apply proper orthogonal decomposition and linear
inverse methods to produce simple, easy-to-run, fast models which reproduce the
statistics of more complicated models. First, a linear inverse model based on
the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of a series of runs of the Shallow
Water Equations (SWE) will be developed. The SWE were chosen for ease of
comparison with previous and ongoing studies. This simple inverse model will
include the EOFs, their tendencies, and statistical noise. EOFs will then be
used to construct an inverse model of the Community Climate Model of NCAR. Such
an inverse model has not yet been applied to climate models to our knowledge.
Thus a simple (fast, easy-to-run) climate model with statistics identical to the
full climate model on which it was based will be constructed. Such a model will
be useful for instances where the statistics need be to reproduced, but for
which the exact time development is not essential. Various sensitivity analyses
will be performed to determine the best methods to construct these models. This
line of research will lead to a new method to decrease the number of degrees of
freedom necessary to obtain adequate resolution in some geophysical models. In
addition, it will give new insight into the interactions of the empirical modes
of motion. This work is preliminary to developing s fully nonlinear climate
model based on orthogonal projections. It is important because it would
facilitate the testing of climate hypotheses which require credible but simple
(computationally cheap) climate models. This research is funded under the NSF
USGCRP CMAP program.
