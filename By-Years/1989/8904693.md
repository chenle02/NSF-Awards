This proposal seeks funding for an integrated field, geochemical and
petrographic study of a granite-diorite-gabbro association on the island of Isle
au Haut, Maine. These rocks are part of the more extensive Bays-of-Maine Igneous
Complex. A major concern of this research will be to document and understand a
spectacularly exposed sequence of layered gabbro and diorite units which we
believe to be the frozen relics of a sequence of coexisting melts. Field
relationships show clearly that several of these layers were gravitationally
unstable, and were in the process of overturning and mixing. Recent theoretical
studies applying fluid dynamics to magma chamber models predict that
compositionally zone magma chambers, stratified magmatic layers, and mixing of
distinct magma types play important roles in the petrogenesis of igneous rocks.
On Isle au Haut we have, perhaps for the first time, an unprecedented
opportunity to obtain systematic petrographic and geochemical data on coexisting
magmas within a stratified magma chamber. From this data we will be able to
evaluate many of the magmatic processes predicted to occur in magma reservoirs
by recent fluid dynamics and experimental studies.
