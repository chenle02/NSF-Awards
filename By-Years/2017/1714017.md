This project will collect social network survey data to analyze the community
structure of an American group in Japan. The award will support research to
assess how American minorities maintain connections among themselves, form bonds
outside the group, and establish bilateral relationships. African-Americans and
the Japanese have interacted socially and politically across American and
Japanese national borders for over a century, particularly during crucial
periods of U.S.-Japan relations and internal national social and political
movements. This study will contribute to discussions of American migration and
international interaction, as well as interdisciplinary work on global
migration, social networks, and minoritization. This project will be conducted
under the mentorship of Dr. John G. Russell of Gifu University. As a prominent
scholar, whose work focuses of the representation and history of Blacks in
Japan, Dr. Russell's contribution to this project will be invaluable. In
addition to data on community structure, the researcher will gather interviews
and ethnographic data to elaborate and enrich the findings of more quantitative
research methods.

Using social network and cultural consensus analyses, this project will outline
the structure of the African-Americans' social network in Japan and the
ideological barriers that appear within and influence this structure.
Ethnographic data will be collected on issues surrounding the reminoritization
of this population in a nation that has a national narrative of homogeneity.
Cultural consensus analysis will provide access to these boundaries within the
community allowing for a richer description of why individuals are connecting,
clustering, or distancing from each other in a way that social network data
cannot.

This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the
Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
