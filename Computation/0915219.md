The investigator, collaborators and students will develop new models for image
processing, show the models are mathematically sound, determine geometric
properties of their solutions, develop accurate and efficient numerical schemes,
and directly apply these models to problems in the sciences. The models will
address four fundamental problems in image processing: edge-preserving
denoising, decomposition, deblurring, and image fusion. The proposed
formulations will be based on variational methods and partial differential
equations, which provide an appropriate framework for studying the mathematical
foundations and physical interpretation of the models. These include models
involving convex linear growth functionals, the Besov semi-norm, and negative
Sobolov norms, which can retain desirable geometric image properties such as
edges and textures, while avoiding the introduction of false artifacts. One of
the challenges addressed here will be finding appropriate discrete
representations of the continuous problem that retain desirable geometric
features and are tractable.

Digital images are now used in almost every area of science and technology. The
models developed in this project will be used to solve real world problems in
areas such as medical imaging and material science. However, the models will be
formulated in enough generality to potentially be applied to a wide array of
applications in the sciences. Software developed in this grant will be made
publicly available. The investigator regularly teaches courses on image
processing, and leads workshops on image processing for middle school students
and high school women and minorities. This project will also support
undergraduate researchers. Thus this work will promote the training of young
scientists, as well as provide educational opportunities to underrepresented
groups.
