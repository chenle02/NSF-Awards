The history of geology is little developed, and within that history knowledge
about igneous geology is especially scant. As part of a comprehensive survey of
the history of igneous geography, this project will examine Norman L. Bowen's
theory of fractional crystallization. Of particular concern in this case is how
Bowen constructed his theory from the ruins of older ideas, using such diverse
materials as field geology, petrography, solution theory, and experimental
petrology. To accomplish this a variety of materials will be examined, including
primary geologic literature on petrogenetic theory, field geology, physical
chemistry, and petrography; secondary literature on the same topics; and
biographical material.
