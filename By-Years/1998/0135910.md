Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0135910&lt;br/&gt;Fernando Torres-Gil, UCLA
&lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support and conference preparation costs are requested
for the participants at the workshop "Nanotechnology: Opportunities and
Challenges for Industry" to be held at UCLA on September 10, 2001. The
California NanoSystems Institute and the UCLA School of Public Policy and Social
Research organize the workshop. The sponsors are the Department of Commerce, the
Federal Aviation Administration, the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office
(NNCO), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The workshop will bring
together 70-80 leaders from industry, government, academia and financial
community to explore the future of nanotechnology, the industry opportunities,
and the ways to increase the pace of taking advantage of the new technology.
This workshop is part of a series of workshops over the next 18 months in
various regions of the country. The UCLA workshop will draw attendees from the
Western U.S. predominantly with focus on importance of nanotechnology in three
areas of application: aerospace, information technology/electronics, and
biotechnology/medicine. The main objectives are: identifying the major technical
challenges for application of nanotechnology in industry, scientific
developments that could be exploited by industry, major obstacles in this
developments, and networking among experts and organizations from various areas.
