This project will study cost-efficient ways of building and utilizing
educational infrastructure in underserved communities. Using a case study
approach, and multi-sited ethnography, the PI will focus on three communities to
determine who infrastructure affects student performance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in a dissertation and a trained
professional who is dedicated to advancing applied research.
