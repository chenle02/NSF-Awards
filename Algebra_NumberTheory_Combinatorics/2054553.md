Patterns in the world can be described both by geometric spaces and by algebraic
equations. It is a challenge to find how to read off the geometric properties of
a space from its defining equations. The project will make new advances on the
problem, in both conceptual and computational ways. As part of the project,
graduate students will be introduced to mathematical research.

The Hilbert scheme of points classifies all zero-dimensional closed sub-schemes
of a given algebraic variety. The principal investigator and collaborators will
prove the first systematic results about the topology of the Hilbert scheme of
points on a high-dimensional variety. In another part of the project, the
principal investigator and graduate students will explore the classification of
Fano varieties by a new exploratory, computational method, using computer
calculations on a K3 surface.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
