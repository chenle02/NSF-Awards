This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in parallel
computing between research teams at the University of Tennessee and at INRIA's
Rhone/Alps campus (French National Institute for Research in Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics). The teams include Jack Dongarra on the U.S. side and
Jean-Pierre Verjus, Yves Robert and Bernard Tourancheau in France. The objective
of their research is to provide a software environment for the development of
portable parallel programs on multicomputers and heterogeneous networks. They
propose to develop efficient algorithms for library routines on distributed-
memory multicomputers. This effort will involve implementation and experiment of
codes and tools, and complexity analysis. The project takes advantage of U.S.
and French complementary expertise and will benefit from French advances in
software for parallel processing. The project may result in a set of tools for
the development of portable data parallel programs.
