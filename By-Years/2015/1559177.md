GENERAL SUMMARY

This project examines the effect of political connections on firm behavior. Both
theory and previous research suggest that political connections confer greater
profitability in such environments, but the extent to which such connections
have real (as opposed to merely distributional) effects is an open question. To
explore this question, the project utilizes a firm-level panel dataset that
spans two periods of profound and largely unanticipated disruptions to political
connections (the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Euromaidan Revolution in 2013
and 2014. Contemporary Ukraine is the case of interest. Ukraine provides an
environment in which there are weak political institutions and substantial
oligarchic control of the economy. The results of this study will provide
evidence on the channels through which political connections affect firms and
will shed light on the real, as opposed to monetary, consequences of these
connections.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY

This project examines the effect of political connections on firm behavior and
productivity, with an empirical focus on contemporary Ukraine. The research
utilizes a firm-level panel dataset with many unusual variables (not just
profitability, but also productivity, employment, wages, investment, R&D and IT
investment, and energy inputs), supplemented with new data on oligarchic
ownership. The data span two periods of profound and largely unanticipated
disruptions to political connections the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the
Euromaidan Revolution in 2013-14. Using new methods developed for this work and
leveraging a natural experiment, the analysis will examine not only the direct
effect of these shocks on connected firms, but also the indirect effects of
spillovers on competitors (which may feed back to political outcomes) and on
industry dynamics and productivity. The results of this study will provide
evidence on the channels through which political connections affect firms and
shed light on the consequences of these connections.
