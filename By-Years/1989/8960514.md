The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in rare- earth copper oxide
ceramic systems has led to considerable research directed toward the development
of electromagnetic components and devices. However, the application of high
critical temperature superconductors has been limited because of crystal
anisotropy of the randomly oriented grains in polycrystalline materials, grain
boundary segregated phases and microcracking at the grain boundaries. These
factors have resulted in low critical current densities and high residual
resistivity. To address this problem, this research suggests laser-driven
directional solidification of polycrystalline unsintered extrusions of high
temperature superconducting materials under a controlled thermal gradient to
produce highly anisotropic superconducting fibers having critical current
densities. The innovation contained in this work is the use of laser heating to
minimized phase segregation by heating very rapidly through the two-phase
incongruent melt region. The technical objectives include developing a fiber
extruder and a thermal gradient furnace, finding extruder operating conditions,
evaluating laser melt parameters, fabricating and characterizing superconducting
fibers and optimization of a proof-of-concept system. The significance of the
laser driven direction solidification technique lies in the cost-effective
production of high critical current density superconducting polycrystalline
fibers.
