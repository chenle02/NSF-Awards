Abstract Bleher 9623214 The project is devoted to the semiclassical trace
formulae for the Schrodinger operator on compact manifolds, limiting probability
distributions of quantum energy levels, and related problems in the theory of
random matrices. Topics of investigation include: (i) Asymptotics of the
oscillatory part in the Weyl spectral formula and periodic geodesics, statistics
of eigenvalues of the Schrodinger operator, and mathematical problems of the
theory of quantum chaos. (ii) The problem of the uniform semiclassical
quantization near unstable invariant manifolds. (iii) Universality of the
spacing distribution and double scaling limit in the matrix model. The principal
investigator has been working in this area for several years in collaboration
with Freeman Dyson and Jean Bourgain (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton),
Joel Lebowitz (Rutgers University), Yakov Sinai (Princeton University), and
others. Among his important contributions are the proof of almost periodicity of
the Weyl spectral error function for integrable quantum systems, limit theorems
for the distribution of eigenvalues, the proof of the Berry saturation
conjecture for the eigenvalue statistics, and several other results. In the
project the principal investigator is going to study the statistics of energy
levels and eigenstates in quantum systems, and the universality of the
eigenvalue distribution and double scaling limit in the matrix model. These
problems are very important for numerous applications in the theory of quantum
chaos, bosonic strings and quantum gravity, mesoscopic systems, and multivariate
statistical analysis, and the project is directed to the applications. The tools
include the methods of the theory of integrable systems, semiclassical
asymptotics, the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, and other methods of modern
mathematics. The proposed study is heavily based on computer experiments.
