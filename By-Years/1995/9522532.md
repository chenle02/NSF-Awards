This is a Research Planning Grant for women who have nt had prior independent
Federal research. The award is allowing the PI to develop a research program in
the area of multicast communications for highly parallel computing systems. The
planning activities are concentrated on the investigation of routing contronl
strategies for multicast networks from the following aspects: 1) designing new
routing control strategies which can more effectively reduce the non-uniformity
of multicast connections; 2) developing a network simulator to simulate the
multicast networks under these routing control strategies, and gather a large
amount of statistical performance data to compare different control strategies
and guide the theoretical analysis in the later phase of the research systems.
