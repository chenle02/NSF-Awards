This project provides equipment to enhance the research experience of the
approximately 85 students who take courses or do independent research in
biopsychology each year. Acquisition of sufficient laboratory equipment enables
Bates students to gain the hands-on experience that is essential for a thorough
understanding of this rapidly growing field. Through the new laboratory
equipment, students develop new research techniques, perfect previously acquired
skills and, equally importantly, discover for themselves the major principles of
biopsychology. Stereotaxes, a microtome, electrical stimulators, and
oscilloscopes facilitate the acquisition of physiological skills associated with
small animal (rat) neurosurgery, histology, and electrical self-stimulation. To
enhance students' capacity to do sophisticated animal behavioral research,
operant chambers and microprocessors with which the chambers can be interfaced
are being installed in the teaching laboratory.
