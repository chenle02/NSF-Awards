The synthetic and reaction chemistry of several classes of transition metal
halomethyl compounds will be investigated by John L. Hubbard of Utah State
University in this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
Chemistry Program. These compounds are valuable new members of the family of
alpha-substituted alkyl derivatives of transition metals which are known to be
important intermediates in processes such as carbon monoxide reduction,
hydroformylation and other catalytic syntheses. The compounds to be employed in
the study include cyclopentadienyl (or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) nitrosyl
metal alpha-haloalkyls of chromium, molybdenum and tungsten as well as
cyclopentadienyl nitrosyl haloalkyl metal halides of iron and ruthenium and the
di(haloalkyl)derivatives of the latter metals. The compounds have been made
readily accessable by recent impvovements in their synthesis via the reaction of
diazoalkanes with precursor metal halides. Some reaction types to be studied are
photolytic and thermal decompositions or rearrangements and simple air
oxidations.
