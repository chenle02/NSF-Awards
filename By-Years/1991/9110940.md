The objective of this research is the development of a theoretical framework
based on which a software tool can be developed to program and design
systematically bit-level processor arrays. The resulting software tool should be
portable and explore fully the parallelism at bit-level and word-level which
current system software of bit level systems lacks or does not fully explore. It
can reduce significantly the programming burdens on users and improve the
situation that only a low percentage of the performance offered by hardware is
utilized because of the insufficient support of system software. The class of
algorithms for which the theoretical framework is developed are frequently used
in digital signal processing, image processing and other scientific
computations. This project is divided into three steps: (1) expanding the
conventional algorithm at word-level into bit-level to explore the parallelism
at bit-level; (2) analyzing the parallelism and dependence structure of these
n-dimensional (often four or five dimensional) bit-level algorithms (algorithms
with n nested loops); (3) finding time-optimal mapping into (k-l) dimensional
(often two dimensional) bit-level processor arrays without computational
conflicts based on the dependence structure.
