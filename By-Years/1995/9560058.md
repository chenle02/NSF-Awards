This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on a new and
innovative approach for formation evaluation at the drill bit. Radioactive
Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) tools are currently in use for measuring
formation density and neutron porosity. However, these have limited capabilities
and involve safety and environmental risks. A project is proposed with the
objective of developing an electrical Neutron/X-ray (N/X) tool which will
replace both of the existing radioactive tools. This novel instrument is
expected to offer: (1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower costs and
(3) greatly reduced safety and environmental hazards. The objective of Phase I
is to demonstrate proof-of-principle for the N/X MWD tool concept by: (1)
designing and assembling an N/X source experiment; (2) operating the experiment
to demonstrate high neutron output; (3) developing the conceptual design for an
N/X tool integrated into a 17 cm (6.75 inch) drill collar and (4) performing
computer modeling studies to assess and maximize tool performance. A leading MWD
company will participate in the Phase I project, thereby initiating the
commercialization process. Success in Phase I will form a firm foundation for
demonstration of a laboratory prototype N/X logging system in Phase II. This
project will provide an advanced non-radioactive MWD logging tool with numerous
advantages relative to existing tools. It will provide for measurement of: (1)
density and lithology; (2) thermal neutron capture cross section; (3) neutron
porosity through temporal and spatial measurements of the epithermal neutron
population; and (4) neutron induced spectral gamma-rays. This will be valuable
for safe and economical development of oil and gas wells, and for research.
