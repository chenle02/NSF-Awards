This project will investigate whether association with particular scholarship
programs generates negative reputational consequences for labor market outcomes.
It also will examine if and how employer characteristics are related to the
potentially stigmatizing effects of such awards. In recent decades, many
universities and companies have used scholarships, fellowships, and pipeline
programs to achieve organizational goals. These programs offer members of some
groups additional opportunities and resources but in doing so may label the
recipients. Prior research has found that beneficiaries may be seen as less warm
and less competent. The findings from this project will provide greater
understanding of how opportunity-enhancing programs and awards may have
unintended negative effects on their beneficiaries’
outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a survey experiment to measure
employer perceptions of scholarship winners. The sample consists of hiring
managers and other professionals with recruiting and hiring experience.
Respondents are randomly assigned resumés to review and are asked to answer
questions about their perceptions of the job applicants represented by the
resumés. The resumés experimentally manipulate the demographic group of the
applicant and kind of scholarship received. The survey experiment will be
complemented by a field experiment with similar experimental
manipulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
