The diffusion of solvents in polymers is a controlling process in many product
development and process engineering problems. When the polymer is in or near the
glassy state, "non-Fickian" diffusion is often seen. At present, there is no
widely accepted description of non-Fickian diffusion offering reliable
calculations for process or product development. The broad goal of the proposed
research, therefore, is to provide such a description. In previous work a theory
was developed, for non-Fickian diffusion in the "linear" limit, where the
disturbance from equilibrium is very small. A modicum of data was collected
which strongly supports the description. In the proposed work, a more
comprehensive set of linear diffusion data will be collected using the
differential sorption technique. The data will be compared quantitatively with
the theory to define its strengths and weaknesses and to enable refinements, if
necessary. With a sound linear theory in hand, a reliable nonlinear theory will
then follow.
