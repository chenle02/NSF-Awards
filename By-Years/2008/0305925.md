0305925 Sowers This research will attempt to understand the effect of small
noisy perturbations on certain types of complicated dynamical systems. The
systems under study exhibit oscillations and bifurcations. For asymptotically
small noise, one can in general find a stochastic process (via stochastic
averaging) which encapsulates the evolution in the quotient space defined by the
periodic oscillations; at the bifurcations, gluing conditions need to be added.
The goal of the proposed research is to look at certain complicated systems with
the above features. The investigation is roughly divided into three components.
One part of the investigation will focus on the interaction of discontinuities
with the above ideas. Another will focus on higher-dimensional systems arising
from stability studies of simpler systems (i.e., tangent flows). A third will be
the effect of noise upon certain systems for which the deterministic dynamics
are commonly said to be "stochastic". This research attempts to better
understand the effects of small noise upon certain complicated types of
oscillatory systems. The systems under study all are important in various
physical models. The above-mentioned investigation into discontinuities is
motivated by certain vibro-impact systems, electrical networks with switches,
and hybrid systems. Stability studies are crucial for design and engineering
analyses. And deterministic "stochasticity" is intrinsic in many models of the
climate, oceanic flow, and other important phenomena. In reality, noise is
present in all of these systems, and a better understanding of its effect is
clearly necessary.
