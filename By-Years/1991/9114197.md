Real-time database systems are needed in many important applications such as
program trading in the stock market, telecommunications, computer integrated
manufacturing, advanced process control, intelligent highway systems, and
various multimedia applications. Most current real-time database technology
consists of fairly simple extensions to basic database protocols and is only
applicable to soft real-time applications. This work extends real-time database
technology to more sophisticated levels by utilizing an abstract data type
model, nested transactions, distributed systems, and both soft and hard real-
time constraints. The work compares the use of an active database paradigm with
the more traditional approach. Integrated solutions across concurrency control,
commit protocols, cpu scheduling, I/O, deadlock resolution, and communication
are stressed. The research approach is largely experimental and uses testbeds
built with prior NSF awards. Results from this project can create more
efficient, profitable, and safer real-time database applications.
