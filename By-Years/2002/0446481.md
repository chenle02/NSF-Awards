HRD 04-46481&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federation of American Societies for
Experimental Biology (FASEB) proposes to host a workshop for postdoctoral
fellows as part of a series of FASEB Career Developmental Seminars and
Workshops. The workshop goal is to support postdoctoral fellows in career
development planning through their learning best practices for developing an
Individual Development Plan (IDP). FASEB targets the IDP as the framework to
allow a structured planning process to identify professional development needs,
focus career objectives and facilitate the realization of goals (long- and
short-term). This activity is intended to engage both the post-doctoral fellow
and the PI/scientist in the mentoring process, with phases including self-
assessment, an exploration of career opportunities (suitable to the fellow), and
writing and implementing the plan. The activity is intended to build career
success through ensuring satisfactory project progress and engaging effective
mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;
