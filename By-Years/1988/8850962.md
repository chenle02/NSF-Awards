Building upon a previous NSF award, this one-year project will promote the
teaching of discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics in high schools in
the region near Edwardsville, Illinois. Twenty-eight well-qualified high school
mathematics teachers will participate in a six-week summer session that includes
courses in discrete mathematics and probability and statistics and a seminar to
discuss related methodology. Academic-year follow-up activities include visits
by project staff to the participants' classrooms and monthly meetings. The
university is contributing in cost-sharing an amount equal to 7% of the NSF
award.
