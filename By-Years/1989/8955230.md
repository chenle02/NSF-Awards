Operation Chemistry will be a national elementary and middle school (grades
4-8) teacher training project directed by the American Chemical Society,
modelled after Operation Physics of the American Institute of Physics. The
latter project developed materials and worked with teams of teachers, university
professors and science supervisors to improve the teaching of physics (physical
science) at these grade levels. This first phase of Operation Chemistry will
develop the teaching materials for the chemistry component of middle grade
physical science to be used in the later phases of teacher training. The
materials will be developed by teams of experienced teachers and professors at
the school and university levels. Dr. Paul Kelter of the University of Wisconsin
at Oshkosh in conjunction with Dr. Ann Benbow of the American Chemical Society
(manager of the Pre High School Program) will direct the preparation of twelve
modular teacher workshop books. The chemistry content of the physical science
which is taught in these grade levels has not, as yet, been well-defined in the
available texts or literature. A very knowledgable group of chemists and
teachers have been selected to accomplish this task. These materials will be
field-tested in schools at the above- mentioned grades to determine their
appropriateness in terms of level and implementability. They will be hands-on
experiential activities based on the philosophy of inquiry and discovery. These
materials will subsequently be used in the second phase of the project to
"train" teams of teachers, administrators, science supervisors and industrial
chemists to disseminate the materials and lead workshops for other teachers.
This projects funds the first phase of the project, the development and field-
testing of the materials. About 49% of the NSF request for funds has been cost-
shared by the American Chemical Society and the University of Wisconsin at
Oshkosh.
