The PI will develop several numerical formulations for the purpose of studying
fault-like behavior in viscous flow calculations, specifically applied to
understanding the dynamics of subduction zones. he will compare formulations,
including the formulations currently used in plate calculations, using
observables such a gravity and topography profiles, stress distributions (in the
plate and slab), compressional and extensional tectonic environments (e.g.,
formation of back arc basins or mountain belts), plate velocity and slab dip.
This systematic comparison will not only highlight strengths and weaknesses of
the various methods, it will call attention to features which are unique to one
particular methods and may be an artifact of that method, not a robust
characteristic of faulting. On the other hand, since each method is built on
different set of assumptions, a comparison of approaches may lead to an
understanding of unique signatures in the observables (e.g., topography and
geoid profiles, slab dip, tectonic environment) which could be used to predict
the dominance or absence of physical processes in specific subduction zones.
