This award supports participation in the "Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory
Conference" hosted by the Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama
at Birmingham, May 18 - 20, 2015. Dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and
probability are important fields of modern mathematics dealing with complicated
systems and their development over time. By noticing and analyzing patterns of
such developments, dynamical systems and ergodic theory often allow one to
describe stable states of a system, predict changes in a system, and assess
their likelihood. The connection to probabilistic models often aids in these
goals. The conference will bring together senior and junior researchers who will
be exposed to the most recent results in the field and will participate in
fruitful scientific exchanges. This will create a true synergy, push the bounds
of our understanding of mathematics further, and lead to new discoveries.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features presentations by leaders in dynamical
systems, ergodic theory, and their interface with probability theory. This
conference will advance knowledge through communication of recent results to a
wide audience that includes graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, as
well as members of groups that are not well represented in the mathematical
sciences. An important contribution of the conference is the special
opportunities afforded to junior participants to present their work to the
international leaders in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:
