The absorption of SO2 across charged droplet interfaces by gas absorption
reagents such as NaOH, Ca(OH)2, and Na2SO3 solutions and CaCO3 slurries are
being studied. During phase I, the influence of positive or negative interfacial
electronic or ionic charge on the equilibrium solubilities of SO2, SO2 in N2,
and SO2 in N2 and O2 are determined in the above adsorbents with and without the
presence of an imposed electric field. In phase II, gas absorption rates are
determined in a droplet column for various surface charge densities at various
SO2 concentrations in the gas phase and ionic concentrations in the liquid
phase. This research will contribute knowledge which can be used to
realistically evaluate the effect of droplet charging on the SO2 absorption
processes for flue gas desulfurization.
