The New Jersey Institute of Technology will initiate a three- week, commuter
Young Scholars project in Environmental Waste Management for 30 students (15
entering grade 8; 15 entering grade 9). These students will be introduced to the
current problems, available solutions and research involving the critical issues
associated with substances management. The participating students will work with
faculty of the NJIT Hazardous Substance Management Center on research projects
related to this theme. Students will be instructed in the scientific method and
the engineering science associated with hazardous substance management and
motivated to pursue careers in science and engineering. The program will include
classroom and laboratory activities, seminars and field trips.
