The object of this research is the analysis and interpretation of existing
meteorological observations of microbursts, deep convection, and a unique
tornado. These topics will also be pursued in a field experiment - Convection
and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CAPE) - to be held near Cape
Kennedy during July and August 1990.
