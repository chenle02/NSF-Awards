This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site hosted by New Jersey
Institute of Technology (NJIT) focuses on engaging undergraduate students from
underrepresented populations and from institutions with limited research
opportunities, such as community colleges, in research in the key emerging
topics of optics and photonics technologies, systems and devices and inspiring
them to consider continuing graduate education in electrical and computer
engineering and related areas. Optical and photonic technologies, devices and
systems are enablers for modern communication systems, sensors and computing. By
focusing on next generation optical and photonics technologies and systems, this
program seeks to increase the number of students entering the workforce with
skills in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities
for undergraduate students to engage in optics and photonics research, with
faculty mentors and their research teams, during an intensive and unique 10-week
summer program in three focus areas: 1) optical communication and networking; 2)
optical and photonic devices; and 3) optical systems. The REU students'
laboratory experience will be enhanced by technical seminars and workshops on
non-technical topics, such as presentation skills and ethics. Each student will
prepare a final report and give a presentation on his or her project at the end
of the program at NJIT's International Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium.
