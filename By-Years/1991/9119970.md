This group of five senior investigators, research associates and students will
continue their research in elementary particle physics. They are involved in
experiments at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring to study the properties of the
b-quark, the heaviest quark detected to date and the c- quark, the next heaviest
quark. The new particle detector and upgrades to the storage ring, perform as
designed. High precision data will provide new tests of the standard model of
the elementary particles.
