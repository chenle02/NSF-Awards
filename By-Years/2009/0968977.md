IIP 0968977&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson
University&lt;br/&gt;Shuckers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson University (CU) is
planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC)
entitled "Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR)" which currently
is a multi- university center comprised of West Virginia University (lead
institution) and the University of Arizona. CITeR focuses on research in
identification which includes iris, fingerprint, and face recognition and helps
enhance the research database available for the disciplines involved with
security biometrics technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CU requests funding for
becoming a site of the NSF Center for Identification Technology Research under
the leadership of Professor Stephanie Shuckers. Clarkson University will help
expand CiTER's focus on identity management to include a core of expertise that
marries human identification with intelligence and cybersecurity. Emerging areas
of research include how to contextualize the identity information with other
information collected which includes people, places, patterns of activities,
relationships, geospatial mapping, events, and signal intelligence.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITeR's research will assist industry and governmental
agencies in advancing biometric technology which has broad impacts on stopping
terrorism. This center will also have an impact on the participating students,
and faculty through involvement with industrial members. Students will obtain
hands on training to prepare them for high-tech jobs in the industry upon
graduation. Faculty will get an exposure to industry-oriented research problems.
The Clarkson site plans to work with McNair and CSTEP programs to encourage
students to be active in this vibrant area.
