Effective weed management requires an understanding of the general mechanisms
underlying plant invasiveness. The proposed research will investigate
interspecific gene flow through sexual hybridization (i.e., introgression) as a
mechanism behind invasiveness in sunflowers. The common weed sunflower
(Helianthus annuus) is postulated to have colonized Texas by acquiring genes
from a Texas native, H. debilis. To evaluate this hypothesis, a) hybrids between
the two species will be planted in Texas to identify traits conferring
advantages in nature, b) genes underlying these traits will be mapped, and c)
the frequencies of H. debilis-derived genes in natural populations of Texan H.
annuus (ssp. texanus) will be assayed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
experiments will help to answer a long-standing question about the role of
introgression in the origin of invasive taxa, and will also allow identification
of the particular trait(s)/genes that enable invasions by weedy sunflowers. The
genetic materials created in this grant will be made freely available to other
researchers. Sunflower is the only major crop plant domesticated in the U.S.,
and the traits chosen for study are important both to the diversification of
wild sunflower species and to the domestication and continued improvement of the
cultivated sunflower. This research will also facilitate the training of young
women and minority scientists.&lt;br/&gt;
