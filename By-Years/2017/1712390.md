This award provides support for students to participate in the Sixteenth Summer
School on Exotic Beam (EBSS) Physics at the Argonne National Laboratory, July 23
- 29, 2017. The school is designed for graduate students, senior undergraduate
students who are actively involved in research and postdocs (within 2 years of
their degree). The school will consist of morning lectures and hands-on
activities in the afternoons. Students will also have an opportunity to present
their research. The aim of the summer school is to educate the next generation
of scientists that will drive the research at the Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams (FRIB) when it comes online and other existing rare isotope facilities. In
years to come, substantial progress in low-energy nuclear physics will have a
broad impact on society, ranging from our understanding of the origin of the
elements to the enhancement of national security.

Previous sessions of these summer schools have had broad participation of under-
represented minorities, with slightly more than 30% of the participants of the
Fifteenth EBSS being female. The organizers of the Sixteenth EBSS will continue
the use of accepted best practices to increase diversity and have an inclusive
summer school.
