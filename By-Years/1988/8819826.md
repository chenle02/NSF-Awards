ABSTRACT This project will investigate the morphology and syntax of Nalik, an
Austronesian language of Central New Ireland in Papua New Guinea. The findings
will form the basis for a doctoral dissertation in the Department of Linguistics
at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa which will both provide the first detailed
grammatical description of Nalik, and examine the question of syntactic
variation in a language community which is undergoing rapid cultural change.
