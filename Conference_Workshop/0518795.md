bstract:

This conference will focus on recent advances in operator-related function
theory and will be held October 6-8, 2005, in El Escorial, Spain. In particular,
the conference will focus on the topics of geometric function theory, invariant
subspaces, and composition operators which, although distinct topics, have
significant common ground.

Our purpose is to unite researchers in these areas at one meeting, as well as to
bring together people from different areas of the globe. The program features
talks by both senior mathematicians, and graduate students and young PhDs.
