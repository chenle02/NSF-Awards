ATM-9320778 McElroy This research project is aimed at addressing key issues in
stratospheric and tropospheric chemistry. For the stratosphere, (1) field
observations will be used to test and refine our understanding of the role of
heterogenous processes on the chemistry of the lower stratosphere; (2)
diagnostic models will be developed and applied to elucidate the chemical and
dynamical mechanisms responsible for long-term trends in the ozone, with
particular attention to global effects of volcanic aerosols; and (3) the role of
denitrification will be examined as the controlling influence on loss of ozone
in polar regions, as part of a strategy to clarify differences between ozone
loss in the Arctic and Antarctic. For the troposphere, the PI proposes to: (1)
data for short-lived species from recent field expeditions will be used to test
and improve photochemical mechanisms; (2) to test the distribution of hydroxyl
radical in a global three-dimensional Chemical Tracer Model (CTM) will be tested
using observations of carbon 14 labeled carbon monoxide; (3) the CTM will be
used to test inventory of sources for carbon monoxide, a key species regulating
hydroxyl radical concentrations, taking advantage of new data for carbon 13
labeled carbon monoxide and carbon 18 labeled carbon monoxide and including
additional studies of ethylene and acetylene and (4) the CTM will also be used
to investigate changes in the oxidizing power of the troposphere from 1950 to
the present.
