The transformation and distribution of water substance in natural clouds play a
crucial role in both the atmosphere's heat budget and its capacity for motion.
The transformations between vapor liquid and ice account for about 20% of the
heat budget in the mid-troposphere (15,000 - 20,000 feet), while the
distribution of water and ice essentially defines a crucial ingredient of the
radiation field. Further, melting and evaporation of cloud particles can produce
hazardous downward motions such as downbursts. The objective of this work is the
experimental examination of melting and evaporation of ice particles under
various atmospheric conditions as simulated in a dynamical diffusion chamber;
particle breakup, scavenging and electrification will be examined. The results
will be compared with cognate measurements obtained in recent field experiments.
Dr. John Hallett is well qualified to pursue this work; he is readily
acknowledged by his peers to be one of the best cloud physicists.
