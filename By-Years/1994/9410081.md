ABSTRACT CTS-9410081 Colorado School of Mines P.I.: John R. Dorgan An initiative
in the computer simulation of polymeric materials is pursued. Monte Carlo (MC)
simulation of copolymer chains at inorganic interfaces is developed as a basis
for the rational design of surface active polymeric agents. The specific MC
technique used is the cooperative-motion algorithm of Pakula; significant
advantages over other simulation methods are demonstrated. The simulations
provide detailed structural information (chain conformations, absorbed amounts,
chain segment profiles, etc.) about the absorbed copolymer layer under
equilibrium conditions. This structural information can be calculated based on
the strength of the copolymer segment/substrate interaction, the specific block
sequencing of the copolymer, solvent quality, and surface heterogeneity.
Comparison of simulation results with well defined experimental data allows the
determination of model parameters. Upon verification, the MC algorithm may be
used for predictive purposes allowing the apriori design of copolymer layers for
specific purposes.
