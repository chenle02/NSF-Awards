The decay rate of a particular mRNA can greatly influence the amount of protein
produced from that message and can thereby play an important role in the overall
regulation of gene expression. The goal of this project is to elucidate the
mechanisms by which cells degrade messenger RNA molecules and are able to
regulate this decay process. The proposed experiments will determine the
mechanism by which the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) message
is degraded and how the stability of this message is regulated in response to
culture growth conditions. Three cleavage sites have been detected within the
cat message that may be involved in initiating the decay process. These cleavage
sites will be mapped, and the importance of these cleavages to the decay process
will be determined by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis and by gene fusion
analyses. An in vitro message degradation assay will be used to study the decay
process and to eventually purify the ribonucleases involved in these degradative
events. Changes in the stability of the cat message in response to non-steady
state growth conditions and medium composition will also be measured and
compared to other messages such as ompA, bla, lpp, lac, and trxA. The results of
these experiments will define the important components of the cat message decay
pathway, which should be broadly applicable to other messages in E. coli, and
will be lend insight into how message stability is regulated in response to
culture growth conditions.
