This research project considers how local cultures influence the application of
laws such that the same legal issue can acquire very different meanings across
even similar jurisdictions. Specifically, it examines the relationship of legal
regimes to popular constructions of identity and the manner by which existing
hierachies are re-inforced or re-constructed through legal processes. The
research plan involves statistical analysis, content analysis of court
documents, and interviews with attorneys. It considers these differences across
divergent legal regimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research could
facilitate a better understanding of the way that legal institutions shape, and
are shaped, by everyday social meanings. As such, these results could help
identify the comprehensive relationship of legal processes to the popular
understandings displayed by local cultures.
