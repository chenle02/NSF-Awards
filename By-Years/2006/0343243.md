This grant will develop a plan for a multidisciplinary undergraduate program in
Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), which represents an emerging technology.
The program will employ a unique web-based learning approach that accommodates
different learning styles. In this system, students can select the order in
which they encounter a topic in different forms (visual, verbal, mathematical,
etc), but will learn all of them. The program will integrate MEMS into lower
division courses by using web-based instructional modules alongside courses such
as Statics, Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, and Electric Circuits. Unique
content will be introduced by integrating our research in non-silicon materials
for MEMS, such as quartz, into the curriculum. A sequence of courses will be
planned as a degree option in the departments of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Aerospace and Engineering Mechanics, and
Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. The program will include two core
courses covering MEMS materials and fabrication, and a laboratory experience, in
which students design, fabricate and test a MEMS sensor. Elective courses in
MEMS are also proposed. Teaming and cooperative learning will be used in the two
core courses, which will increase interaction between students from different
disciplines. An industrial advisory board will be established to help guide the
program. The use of web-based multi-path learning should improve student
achievement, and aid in recruitment and retention of women and minority
students. In addition, the plane includes a summer program, which will involve
students from Prairie View A&amp;M, a HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
