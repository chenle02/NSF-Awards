The T2Me project will study teachers' capabilities for creating and using
meaniningful assessment instruments in mathematics. This project will bring
together mathematicsteachers, assessment experts, mathematicians, and educators
in a collaborative effort to improve assessment in mathematics. Eight teams of
elementary and middle school teachers, with prior experience in integrating
technology into the math curriculum, will receive extensive training in
developing assessment procedures that emphasize higher- order thinking
processes. The teams will learn how to develop dynamic assessment materials;
create assessment materials that incorporate innovative instructional
technology; and field-test and evaluate the developed materials in their
classrooms. Evidence of teachers' capabilities and accomplishments will be
collected through interviews, observations, and analysis of field-notes. Case
studies will be developed to characterize teachers' efforts.
