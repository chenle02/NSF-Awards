A laboratory study of smoke from controlled combustion of a sample of Kuwait
crude oil will measure cloud condensation nucleus/condensation nucleus
concentrations and ratios; composition, particle size and fractal dimensions.
Similiar analysis will also be undertaken of field samples of smoke collected by
the Meteorological Research Flight in early April. Results will be applied to
possible cloud interactions of the soot to provide a basis to estimate the
removal rate by cloud and precipitation and radiation changes. This study will
suggest priorities for flight measurements to assess the climatic aspects of the
Kuwait oil fires.
