Group theoretic constructions have traditionally been part of the arsenal of an
algebraic topologist . On the most basic level, tools from (finite) group theory
have been used to construct topological tools: Steenrod squares, characteristic
classes, spaces with A(n)-free cohomology, etc. On a more subtle level, many
basic topological structures seem to be determined by group theoretic structures
- for example, infinite loop space structures are determined by the
combinatorics of the symmetric groups, and the theorem of Atiyah that calculates
K(BG), says that group theory determines this ring. Nicholas J. Kuhn's recent
and current research continues this tradition of using group theory to guide
one's study of topological questions. In particular, in his ongoing
collaboration with M. Hopkins and D. Ravenel, a combination of group theory,
equivariant homotopy, and number theory is being used to gain greater
understanding of the "geometry" underlying complex oriented cohomology theories.
These include, in particular, the Morava K-theories - known by the work of E.
Devinatz, Hopkins, and J. Smith to be of central importance in stable homotopy
theory.
