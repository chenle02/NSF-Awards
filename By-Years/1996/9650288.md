The School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of
Technology has recently initiated a B.S. degree to provide a technically
rigorous education for the next generation of earth and atmospheric scientists.
One major goal of this program is to prepare majors for careers in a variety of
environmental fields. We have designed a core and capstone course, Environmental
Field Study, around the following criteria: (1) it will deal directly with the
natural world and real environmental problems; (2) it will demonstrate and
reinforce scientific principles learned in formal course work; (3) it will
stress individual and/or team investigations; (4) equipment and procedures will
be comparable to those likely to be encountered by students during their
careers; (5) it will utilize the expertise of professionals in the field; and
(6) students will take initiative in all aspects of the projects, from problem
recognition to publication of findings. Funds will be used to purchase a ground
penetrating radar system and a terrain conductivity system to be used in
undergraduate laboratory and field courses which will enable us to fulfill these
goals.
