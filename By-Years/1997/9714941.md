9712658 Holzer After the 1989 Loma Prieta, California earthquake, Congress
appropriated funds through a special supplement that included money to support
research and documentation on the effects of that event. This money was awarded
to investigators through joint NSF/USGS peer review panels. A stipulation in
each award was that investigators contribute to a special report on the
earthquake that would serve as the definitive report on the earthquake. Thus
this report should serve as the major reference on the earthquake for future
generations of scientists, engineers, and social scientists. This award provides
funding for publishing that part of the report focusing on the performance of
the built environment, which is the portion of the research supported primarily
through NSF's Earthquake Hazard Mitigation Program. This is a collaborative
effort between NSF and the U.S. Geological Survey. ***
