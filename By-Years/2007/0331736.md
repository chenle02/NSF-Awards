New technology for capturing shape data from the real world requires new
algorithms to interpret and use it. Building on new ideas about reconstructing a
surface from a set of points in three-dimensional space, we consider algorithms
for computing different shape representations, and for aligning point sets to
each other. We look for simple, effective yet provably correct algorithms, using
tools from computational geometry but drawing on the huge body of previous work
in computer vision and graphics. This work complements our teaching in graphics
and algorithms, and helps us train graduate students in research.
