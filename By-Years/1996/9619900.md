Distributed Applications This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
project supports 6 students in the first year and 12 students in the second and
third years in programs carried out during the summers and the academic years,
for three years. The students will work on projects involving 1) programming
tools for parallel and distributed systems, 2) high-performance solutions for
scientific and engineering problems, and 3) high-performance solutions for
medical sciences. Substantial effort is placed on recruiting minority students
and students from non-research institutions with at least 50% of the students
from undergraduate institutions or community colleges in the Detroit
Metropolitan area. A special feature of the project is that the students work
with industrial research mentors during their second year. Student growth and
the fostering of independence in research is encouraged through regular
guidance, including weekly discussions and thorough evaluations of objectives
and summaries of work accomplished. A cooperative learning system, whereby
students provide constructive criticism to improve work of other students, is
also employed.
