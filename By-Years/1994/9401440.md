9401440 Baum The BC (= Baum-Connes) conjecture is an extremely general equality
relating topology, i.e. continuous geometry, and analysis, i.e. the branch of
mathematics based on multi-variable calculus. This conjecture is unusual in that
it cuts across several different areas of mathematics and thus reveals an
underlying unity which previously was completely unknown. The research pursued
here centers on proving this conjecture for certain classes of examples and then
obtaining corollaries. More precisely, let G be a topological group which is
Hausdorff, locally compact and second countable. The main examples are Lie
groups, p-adic groups and discrete groups. C*G denotes the reduced C*-algebra of
G, and KC*G is its K-theory. The BC conjecture, if true, gives an answer to the
problem of calculating KC*G. Validity of the conjecture has applications to
well-known problems in geometry-topology and representation theory. ***
