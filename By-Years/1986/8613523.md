The objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a
robotic-system to manufacture steel orthotropic panels for bridge decks. Bridge
decks in all regions of the country are being replaced by various methods, one
of which is the use of prefabricated steel panels. These steel panels are
expensive to fabricate and can only be used if the economy studies indicate a
cost-benefit. This project will evaluate the development and costs encountered
when a robotic system is designed to produce the panels economically and at a
faster rate.
