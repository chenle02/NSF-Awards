9529833 Lilley-Kelley Title: Volatiles in mid-ocean ridge environments The gases
carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor are transported from the mantle to the
atmosphere in volcanic eruptions. Some of these gases are trapped in veins and
minerals at various stages in the evolution of magmas as they form the ocean
crust. The PIs wish to determine the abundance and isotopic composition of these
gases which they think will tell us about the evolution of the formation of the
ocean crust. These gases will also help us understand how much carbon is
transported from the interior of the Earth to the surface.
