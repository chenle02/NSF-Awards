This project is an exploratory research on some basic problems in earthquake
engineering which require considerations departing from conventional approaches.
The conventional approaches have so far failed to produce satisfactory results.
These basic problems under consideration are (1) establishment of a
damageability index as a function of earthquake and structural parameters, (2)
mathematical analysis of the effects of system uncertainty on the response
prediction, and (3) comparison of new hysteretic models with and without non-
physical drift or loading i.d., to study the effect of initial loading or "back
bone" characteristic on the prediction of system response using the new models.
