This unique laser-based instrumentation will enable resonance- enhanced
multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy to be used for the first time for
the mass selective in situ detection of several key reaction intermediates in
high temperature combustion. REMPI techniques enable the detection of several
important intermediate species that are not easily monitored by other laser-
based noninstrusive methods. This instrumentation, not yet available at any
other laboratory, will provide a unique opportunity for the direct monitoring of
such key reaction intermediates as CH3, CH2, C2O, C2H, and HCO in high
temperature flames at sub part-per-million sensitivity levels. Such methods for
efficient, controlled combustion, without contamination of environment from
harmful by-products, are urgently needed to meet increasing demands for energy
and for the safe disposal of hazardous wastes.
