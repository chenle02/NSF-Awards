9455526 Cooper Most traditional organic chemistry laboratories tend to be of the
cookbook type. That is students learn laboratory techniques and then use them to
synthesize a given compound in a prescribed manner with a recipe. There is
growing unease within the chemical education community about the pedagogical
value of such laboratories. The organic laboratory course proposed here will
build on the strengths of our general chemistry laboratory courses. Students
will work in groups on open ended projects instead of one lab period exercises.
Instead of learning a technique as an end in itself, techniques will be learned
as a means to an end. Over the course of the semester, students will apply their
problem solving skills to projects approximating the research process as closely
as possible. The students will also use both their written and oral
communication skills to plan, critique, and evaluate their experiments. A number
of resource materials will be developed including a multimedia program that
incorporates video and text so that students can access information in the
laboratory, and a laboratory manual that will contain a database of typical
experimental conditions and work-up procedures in addition to descriptions of
techniques. This new lab format will have a significant impact on how our
students learn organic chemistry and will be particularly beneficial to women.
The principal value of this project lies in its application to ALL organic
students, in the expected improved performance and higher retention rates for
women and in its adaptability to other situations.
