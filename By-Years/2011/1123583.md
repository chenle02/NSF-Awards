Doctoral candidate Faith R. Kares (Northwestern University), supervised by Dr.
Micaela di Leonardo, will undertake research in Metro-Manila, Philippines, where
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO), such as Gawad Kalinga (GK), partner with
poor and working class residents to create affordable housing. GK is an ideal
case study with which to examine two deeply intertwined phenomena - the way that
governments delegate and NGOs assume responsibility for certain social services,
and how these NGOs then use nationalist discourse in their attempts to obtain
support from members of the Filipino diaspora. By focusing on the particulars of
GK's practices and the ways that these practices are embedded within a
particular historical political-economic context, the research will investigate
growing transnational linkages, shedding light on the nature of NGO functions in
economic contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will use participant
observation, oral histories, and semi-structured interviews to document how
local residents, GK staff, and foreign youth volunteers understand their
involvement in the organizations development efforts. She will examine how the
organization measures efficacy and success, and will pay special attention to
interactions between residents and foreign youth volunteers. She will also
conduct discourse/conversation analysis, and collect and analyze material
evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address the social significance
and characteristics of the increasing role of NGOs in development discourse and
action, and the ways that different groups of people strategically engage with
these institutions. Research findings may also be useful in policy
considerations.
