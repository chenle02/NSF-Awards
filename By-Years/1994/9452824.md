9452824 Rosa The University of Denver seeks to intimate a 3-week, summer
residential and commuter Young Scholars project in engineering for 58 students
entering grades 10, 11 and 12. This national program is particularly interested
in the recruitment of women, African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians
students. The program includes instructional and research activities in all
engineering disciplines but emphasizes electrical and mechanical engineering.
Students are provided opportunities to discuss engineering careers and
professional ethics; visit with engineers in industry, private practice,
university research and government; use the computer as engineering tool; and do
individual and team engineering analysis and design.
