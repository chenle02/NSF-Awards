Algebraic geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations
(algebraic varieties) and has many applications in areas within mathematics and
beyond, including physics, computer science, and engineering. The research
supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques,
especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces
from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming
questions about algebraic varieties into questions about polyhedral complexes. A
process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic
variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the
geometry of the original algebraic variety. The research develops further tools
for the study of algebraic varieties in terms of their so called "nonarchimedean
analytification". Overall this project will refine, abstract, and generalize
these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic
geometry. In conjunction with this research program, the PI will continue to
direct the SUMRY program for undergraduate research in mathematics at Yale,
providing not only research opportunities for the undergraduate participants,
but also mentorship opportunities for the graduate students and postdocs leading
small group projects.

The PI will extend the tropical independence methods developed in proofs of the
Gieseker-Petri theorem and the maximal rank conjecture for quadrics, developing
new notions of tropicalization of linear series and combining piecewise linear
methods with reduction of rational functions to pursue further progress toward
the maximal rank conjecture and strong maximal rank conjecture. He will continue
his work using the combinatorial topology of moduli spaces of stable
tropical curves to extract information about the top weight cohomology of moduli
spaces of curves, looking for additional structures such as hidden filtrations
whose graded pieces are representation stable with respect to the action induced
by permutation of the marked points. The PI also aims to develop foundations for
a tropical theory of vector bundles, by generalizing the theory of convergence
Newton polygons for vector bundles with connection on algebraic curves to
vector bundles with integrable connections on higher dimensional varieties,
using toric vector bundles as a test case.
