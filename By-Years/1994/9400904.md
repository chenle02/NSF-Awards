9400904 Phillips The project will involve four lines of research. (1) A
continuing investigation of the notion of exponential rank in C*- algebras. In
particular, an attempt will be made to obtain a better understanding of the
exponential rank of homogeneous C*- algebras and stable C*-algebras. (2)
Investigation of related work involving multiplicative commutators. (3)
Continuation of work on the K-theory of smooth crossed products. (4) A study of
spectra of elements of the reduced C*-algebras of free groups. Operators are
infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices. There is a natural
multiplication and addition of operators and, consequently, some collections of
operators can be considered as mathematical structures called operator algebras.
There is an involution on operators much like the transposition involution on
matrices. An operator algebra that is closed under the action of this involution
is called a star algebra. A C*- algebra is a star operator algebra that has
additional topological properties. In many commutative algebras, elements that
have multiplicative inverses have logarithms or, equivalently, can be written as
an exponential. This is not the case in non-commutative C*-algebras. A portion
of this project is aimed at determining the number of exponential factors
required to write invertible elements as products of exponential. ***
