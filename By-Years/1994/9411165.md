This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the research
efforts of Professor Hussey and his graduate students on the electrodeposition
of alloys from room-temperature, chloroaluminate molten salts. The deposition
process will be characterized using electrochemical methods, scanning electron
microscopy and light microscopy. Through these studies, the attendant nucleation
mechanisms for thin film growth will be characterized. Professor Hussey will
collaborate with Dr. Gery Stafford at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology on the metallurgical aspects of this research. This work is focussed
on the synthesis and characterization of novel thin films of metal alloys that
could provide materials with enhanced properties for a variety of technological
applications. These films are produced by the electrodeposition of metals from
aluminum containing salts that are liquids at room temperature. This approach
should result in alloy films with a much lower degree of contamination than was
previously possible to achieve.
