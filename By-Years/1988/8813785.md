Oregon State University will work with Hewlett Packard to develop and implement
a calculus curriculum which makes essential use of the HP28S- symbolic/graphical
calculator. The objectives are to identify: calculus topics pedagogically suited
for use on symbolic/graphical calculators; roles of symbolic/graphical
calculators in calculus; production of curriculum/calculator materials to be
tested during the academic year. Charles Patton, a developer of the HP28, who is
writing a calculus book based on the HP28 will provide both technical advice
regrading the calculator as well as allow adaptation of his calculus text
materials, which are appropriate for the pilot classes at OSU. In addition, the
principal investigator and exemplary high school teachers from the Title II HP28
calculator project will present a series of workshops at the Northwest
Conference on utilizing the HP-28 in mathematics classes. Oregon State and HP
will share costs of this project.
