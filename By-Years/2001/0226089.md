Lay abstract

This proposal will support the construction of large-scale computer models of
the mammalian cerebellar cortex. The models constructed will be realistic in the
sense that they will include what is currently known of the anatomy and
physiology of the neurons and networks of this structure. Because the models are
realistic, modeling results can be used to guide experimental investigations and
help in the interpretation of new experimental results. Although no funds are
requested to support animal research in this grant, the results will be
invaluable for making animal research more efficient and effective. This
modeling effort will also take place in the context of a fundamentally new
theory of cerebellar cortical function recently proposed y the P.I., which has
grown out of previous basic research efforts, funded in part by NSF. Although
the work to be performed in this study is basic science, the theory that has
been proposed has already generating new ways to look at cerebellar dysfunction
in human patients, and will shortly result in clinical trials for new means of
detecting cerebellar deficits. The modeling efforts to be supported here will
almost certainly continue to produce new ways of thinking about the function of
this important structure.
