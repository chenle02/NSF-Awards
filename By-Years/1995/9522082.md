9522082 Lau The purpose of this project is to investigate novel nitrogen sources
for Group-III nitride growth by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE).
Emphasis will be on the identification of (a) viable source(s) which will allow
high quality nitride growth at lower temperatures than what are required using
ammonia. A close collaborative effort has been established between the
University of Massachusetts/Amherst and Morton Advanced Materials (a division of
Morton International, Inc.), a major supplier of metalorganic sources of OMVPE.
With sources developed by Morton, GaN will be grown with various growth
parameters. Promising sources will be identified and thoroughly investigated via
optimization growth experiments. Grown layers are characterized by microscopic,
structural (double crystal X-ray diffraction and TEM), electrical (CV and Hall),
and optical (transmission, photoluminescence) measurements. Feedback of growth
results to Morton allows further refinement of the sources. Suitable p- and
n-type dopant source compatible with the new nitrogen sources will also be
identified through doping experiments. Investigations of the effects of the
nitrogen source on dopant incorporation will be included. Finally, this
information will be applied to the growth and fabrication of simple devices such
as LEDs and MESFETs, allowing further evaluation of the layer quality pertinent
to device applications. ***
