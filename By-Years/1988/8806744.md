The primary goal of this project is the assessment of the magnitude, location
and significance of the conformational changes that produce NMR spectral changes
upon introduction of point mutations in the active site of Staphylococcal
nuclease (Snase). The study will allow investigation of how single site amino
acid changes affect the inhibitor-enzyme interaction as well as the conformation
of the protein and how the conformational changes induced by amino acid
replacement are related to changes in enzyme activity. In addition, there will
be continued efforts on the development of novel NMR experiments to probe with
more reliability the interactions of interest and on the development of computer
aided means of analysing NMR data. The conformation of molecules bound to the
active sites of enzymes is of importance in determining how enzymes catalyze
reactions, which interactions are important in determining enzyme specificity
and in the design of new inhibitors of enzymes. This program is the only one in
the Wesleyan Chemistry Department concerned with questions of mutagenesis as
well as with determinations of protein structure and function. This allows
undergraduate students to partake in a broad and viable research effort.
