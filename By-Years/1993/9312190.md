9312190 Bernstein In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, Prof. E. Bernstein of the Colorado State University will
study cold, isolated and solvated aromatic carbene molecules created by laser
photolysis and supersonic jet cooling using several methods of laser
spectroscopy. These include fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission
spectroscopies on the nanosecond time scale; mass resolved excitation
spectroscopy; picosecond correlated single photon counting; and various
picosecond time-resolved pump/probe spectroscopies. Similar work will also be
done on clusters. Complementary ab initio and semi-empirical calculations will
be used to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data. %%% Carbenes
are radicals known to be important intermediates in many condensed-phase
chemical reactions. To understand, and ultimately be able to control such
reactions, it is necessary to know the properties of the participating carbene
species. Direct determination of some of their critical properties from studies
of the condensed phase is impractical and they are therefore determined for the
most part indirectly from kinetic measurements. This research serves to provide
these properties directly from measurements on gas phase carbene systems. The
compounds to be investigated should provide information on the relationships
between their geometrical structure, electronic structure, and reactivity. ***
