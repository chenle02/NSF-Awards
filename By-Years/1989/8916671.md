The objective of this study is to determine in detail the 3-D attenuation
structure of the shallow Long Valley, California, magmatic system using
3-component, digital seismograms and analyzing the amplitude decay of seismic
waves from local earthquakes to a local seismic array. Both the S/P amplitude
ratio and other spectral ratio techniques will be used to determine the
attenuation factors for S and P waves. The use of tomographic techniques with
the dense ray coverage should give basic new resolution of the shallow structure
of an active magmatic system. The results of this research will impact upon
problems of magma location and movement, detailed melt distribution, magma
differentiation, crustal growth, earthquake hazards, volcanic hazards, and
geothermal energy development. Because this work is in an area of high seismic
activity, it has direct application to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction
Program.
