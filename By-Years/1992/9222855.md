This research involves the investigation of a new king of reactor system which
employs a bed of coal char (pyrolytic carbon) and microwave (radio frequency -
RF) energy to cause a variety of gas phase reactions to occur catalytically at
low temperatures. In preliminary work, it has been demonstrated that such a
reactor will produce high purity hydrogen from methane, isopropyl alcohol from
methane and steam, and can decompose NO, SO2, and H2S. The system thus shows
potential to produce high-value products from natural gas, and to clean up hot
combustion flue gases and synfuel process gases before their discharge to the
environment. The overall objective is to understand the phenomena involved in
gas phase chemical reactions in the presence of microwave and pyrolytic carbon.
A series of experiments will be performed to determine reaction products,
reaction mechanisms, reaction rates, and energy effects (absorption and heating)
when a variety of reactions occur in the presence of microwave energy. This is a
Small Grant for Exploratory Research and is meant to determine the feasibility
of the process before funds are committed for an extensive, in-depth study.
