This research involves determination of the structure of the lower crust and
upper mantle beneath the southern High Sierra of California. The arrival times
of four hundred teleseisms recorded by a temporary network of 17 stations
deployed in the area and the permanent stations of the Southern California
Seismic Network will be inverted for velocity structure. Further analysis will
involve the possible identification of converted phases generated at interfaces
within the lithosphere and the combination of Pn with teleseismic arrival times
to separate anomalies in the crust and mantle. Constraining the lithospheric
structure of the Sierra may resolve the cause of the Neogene uplift of the High
Sierra and improve our understanding of the tectonics of mountain ranges in
extending, seismically active regions. This work is a component of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
