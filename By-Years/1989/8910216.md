The Materials Research Group carries out basic research on thin film and bulk
magnetic materials. The thin film work includes research that can be utilized
for magnetic recording as well as magneto-optic recording. The program involves
synthesis and characterization of new materials, theoretical studies of magnetic
phase diagrams, studies using characterization techniques such as x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetic viscosity and electron microscopy, and
development of new processing techniques for permanent magnetic materials.
