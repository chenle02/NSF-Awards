The Committee on Radio Frequencies (CORF) has been a standing committee of the
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) since 1961. It
is comprised of a changing roster of prominent scientists and engineers who
carry out studies and provide advice to the Academy on issues that involve the
scientific uses of the radio spectrum. CORF has a long history of working with
NSF. CORF also engages in significant outreach and education efforts, providing
a crucial avenue for informing policymakers about special needs involved in
scientific uses of the radio spectrum. CORF furthers these efforts through
outreach to the private sector, encouraging win/win solutions to spectrum
challenges. This award will allow CORF to continue this important
work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CORF plays a crucial role in maintaining the
availability of spectrum for the scientific community. Their activities include
overview of international treaty conference topics and their impacts on passive
service use of the spectrum, the production of educational materials, and
submission of comments to FCC proceedings. CORF has conducted, and will continue
to conduct, extensive technical analyses that carry significant weight in these
proceedings thanks to the process they employ, the quality of work, and the
prestige of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and
Medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
