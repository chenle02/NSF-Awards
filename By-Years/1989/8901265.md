This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of interfacial electrochemistry. The SIXTH INTERNATIONAL MEETING ON
NONTRADITIONAL METHODS FOR THE STUDY OF ELECTRIFIED INTERFACES will be held at
Asilomar, California in September, 1990. The purpose of this meeting is to bring
together a group of scientists interested in interfacial science from both
fundamental and applied viewpoints. The meeting will focus on the following
topics: 1) Theory of the structure of the electrochemical interface; 2)
Characterization of the interface (in situ and ex situ); 3) Redox and
interfacial electron transfer; 4) Colloids. This conference focuses on physical
aspects of electrochemistry and attracts investigators from other disciplines
with nontraditional and stimulating approaches to the study of interfaces.
