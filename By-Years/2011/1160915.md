This award provides funding for the development and analysis of practical exact
and approximation algorithms for general submodular optimization problems, by
generalizing and extending mathematical-optimization and approximation methods
that have been successful in specific application areas. Important application
areas include redesigning environmental monitoring networks and Boolean
quadratic optimization. Thus far, general techniques for submodular optimization
have been developed with the aim of providing provably good worst-case behavior.
On the other hand, practical algorithms, not encumbered by theoretical
requirements, have been developed and implemented for several special cases.
This project is aimed at extending such success to the general
case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithms will be instantiated and distributed as
open-source software thus providing practical, general-purpose tools for
attacking this ubiquitous problem class. With particular special cases defined
through a black box (i.e., a function-evaluation subroutine), such software will
have broad applicability across a variety of application areas, such as
economics, machine learning, biodiversity conservation and statics. Moreover,
the project is within the broader area of nonlinear discrete optimization, and
it is natural to expect to have a broader influence within this important
current topic.
