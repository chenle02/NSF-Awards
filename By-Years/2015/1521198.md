The award supports a three day Regenerative Medicine Workshop at Hilton Head. It
brings together national and international regenerative medicine experts from a
variety of engineering and scientific disciplines in a small conference setting
to effectively convey knowledge, stimulate new ideas critical to advancing the
development of regenerative medicine applications and therapies.

The main goal of the workshop is to share new research in the developing field
of regenerative medicine that will accelerate science and engineering
discoveries applicable to the field of biomedicine and promote research
collaborations. The topics will include stem cell biology and regeneration,
immunological responses to engineered cellular systems, applications and
advances in wound healing, regeneration of cardiovascular tissues, regenerative
medicine and the pediatric population, bone regeneration to combat
osteoarthritis, and bio-inspired materials and their clinical applications.
