9321117 Schott Scientists have collegial circles that influence their research.
This dissertation will examine how these circles differ between men and women
scientists and how the circles differ between the United States and other
countries. Scientists have been surveyed in a dozen other countries but at only
one U.S. university, where the number of women scientists is too small to enable
inference. This grant will support interviews with 80 or more scientists at four
other U.S. universities. Preliminary analyses suggest that gender does affect
the composition of scientists' circles of colleagues. Notably, at least for
scientists in other countries, there is a tendency for same-sex selection. The
dissertation will contribute to the understanding of how gender affects informal
communication and organization in science and how national contexts shape these
gender effects. ***
