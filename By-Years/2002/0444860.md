The coordination of organismal growth involves the integration of many external
and internal cues that result in the production of numerous hormones and growth
factors, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I).
An understanding of how the various cues are integrated and how the interplay of
hormones modulate growth is far from complete. &lt;br/&gt;In this project,
rainbow trout will be used as a model organism to evaluate the effects of
somatostatins (SSs), a multi-functional family of peptide hormones, on the
growth control network. Research will reveal the influence of SSs on GH
responsiveness in selected cell types (e.g., liver). This will involve the
characterization of GH receptors (GHR) and an analysis of the effects of SSs on
GHR expression. Research also will elucidate the influence of SSs on IGF-I
synthesis and secretion. In addition, the effects of SS on IGF-I responsiveness
in selected cell types (e.g., muscle) will be determined. This will involve an
analysis of IGF-I binding characteristics and of IGF-I receptor expression.
Lastly, the mechanisms of SS action will be characterized by identifying signal
pathways through which SSs operate and by establishing which SS receptor subtype
activates which signal pathway. The results of this project will advance our
understanding of normal growth control processes and have application to efforts
to improve growth efficiency of fish (e.g., aquaculture), poultry and domestic
livestock, as well as to the detection and treatment of growth disorders in
animals and humans. In addition, the project will expand critical research
infrastructure in North Dakota, serving to diversify the nation's scientific
enterprise, and afford research education and training opportunities to
undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented
groups. &lt;br/&gt;
