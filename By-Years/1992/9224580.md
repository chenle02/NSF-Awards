PROGRAM: Oceanographic Instrumentation The University of Rhode Island (URI)
requests funding to purchase shipboard instrumentation in support of NSF-funded
research. The instruments will be used aboard the research vessel ENDEAVOR, a
177 foot vessel, that is owned by NSF and operated by URI. All of the
instruments are for shared-use by a wide variety of scientists. The PI will use
the funds to puchase a fume hood, equipment racks, thermal recorders, a data
wiring system, and upgrades for the CTD's.
