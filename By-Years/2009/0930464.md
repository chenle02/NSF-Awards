The 2009 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Photosynthesis, will be held June
28-July 3 at Bryant University in Rhode Island and will bring together a broad
spectrum of scientists, both junior and senior, from a wide range of
disciplines, who will discuss (1) understanding the major natural way of solar
energy capture and conversion into chemical energy, and (2) utilizing this
knowledge to contribute to developing natural and bioinspired systems for
improved solar energy utilization mechanisms in society. The focus on the
development of sustainable global energy solutions will be promoted by having
world leading international researchers in alternative energy speak at the
meeting. These include Prof. Dr. Klaus Lips (Helmholz institute, Germany) who is
a leading international researcher in thin film photovoltaic science and
Professor Fraser Armstrong (Oxford University, UK) who heads a very large and
influential laboratory focused on hydrogen production and bio-based fuel cell
technology. The conference offers a unique opportunity to forge new
international collaborations between experts in Nature's solar energy converter
and experts in sustainable alternative energy technologies. The conference will
also emphasize participation of junior investigators. In addition to a large
number of poster presentations by students and postdocs, 6 of the 24 invited
speakers qualify as junior investigators. The 2009 photosynthesis GRC will be an
exciting and important event for scientists from many different backgrounds, and
will offer a unique opportunity for synergy between researchers in two critical
research areas that offer so much promise in our search for global energy
solutions.
