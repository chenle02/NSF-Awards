This award supports students attending the Frontier in Optics Conference to be
held in San Jose, CA, October 11-15, 2009. Frontiers in Optics is the longest
standing meeting in optics and photonics. Presenting over 150 sessions and
nearly 800 technical presentations, Frontiers in Optics hones some of the most
innovative research in the field. The 2009 conference will offer a number of
Short Courses designed to increase knowledge on specific
subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One broader impact is the opportunity for young
students to attend a national meeting and experience the excitement of the field
of Optics. They will also learn about this field by attending the sessions, or
by taking some of the short courses. A secondary benefit arises because
collaborations among students are often formed at these meetings. In addition,
they can meet some of the established researchers in the field, who could help
them get established in their careers.
