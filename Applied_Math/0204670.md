The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena governed by partial
differential equations with several disparate scales is a formidable
computational challenge. Modern algorithms should be able to resolve fine scales
for certain physical quantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing
the computational effort and making realistic 3d simulations feasible. Epitaxial
and crystal growth in materials science, and viscous incompressible fluids are
typical yet quite distinct examples addressed in this proposal. The goal of this
project is to design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite
element methods for such problems, with space-time error control and based on
refinement/coarsening mesh modification. This project blends quite delicate
analytical and computational issues, and applies them to free boundary problems,
constrained problems, geometric PDE and the Navier-Stokes equations of
incompressible fluids. Scientific computing has joined theory and experiment to
form together the three central aspects of scientific inquiry. The current
strengths in computational mathematics draw on the widespread acceptance of
computational modeling as a complement to, and even a replacement for, physical
tests in a broad number of fields. In this vein, the investigator develops
reliable and efficient computational tools that may be useful in several areas
of strategic importance such as nanotechnology, materials science, and high-
performance computing. This project is a collaborative endeavor, involving a
number of scientists in the US and abroad, as well as several students and
postdocs. A substantial effort is devoted to education and human resource
development.
