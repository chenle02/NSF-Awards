The purpose of this project is to find new algorithms for partitioning a
geographic region into smaller sub-regions for distributing a workload among
multiple agents, such as mobile robots or other autonomous vehicles. Dividing a
territory into sub-regions is a fundamental problem in many different domains,
such as vehicle routing, congressional zoning, air traffic control, facility
location, and supply chain management. Often, some ways of partitioning a
territory are better than others along one or more criteria; we refer to the
problem of optimally partitioning a region as a "map segmentation" problem. A
map segmentation problem is usually formulated as an infinite-dimensional
optimization problem because the objective is to design continuous boundaries
between sub-regions; for this reason, optimally constructing such a partition
remains a difficult and (often) intractable problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed research problems can be applied to a variety of problems across many
disciplines, including geographic analysis, transportation theory, and location
science. This project includes an extensive education and outreach program to
complement the research agenda. Students will study various map segmentation
problems and consider the impacts and implications of solutions to these
problems by means of simulation-based experiments. Finally, collaborators in
industry and state-level government will provide an added value to the project
by balancing the theoretical work of the researchers with the concerns of
practitioners, ensuring that the work will have both an intellectual and social
benefit.
