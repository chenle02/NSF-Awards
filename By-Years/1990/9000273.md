The high latitude plasma structure campaigns (HLPS) are aimed at the
understanding of the general morphology of ionization structures that are
observed in the high latitude polar cap thermosphere. Many of the different
phenomena that are studied are solar cycle dependent with some of the key
processes apparent only at solar maximum. Since the next few years are at the
peak of one of the largest solar activity cycles a unique opportunity exists to
study these phenomena with extensive coordinated observations at many different
polar locations with many different diagnostic instruments. This proposed
project is for conducting observations and performing analysis of incoherent
scatter radar, all sky imaging photometer, total electron content, scintillation
and satellite in-situ measurements. In addition the PI has a major role in the
coordination, organization and direction of the overall multi- station
instrument campaign activity.*** //
