The PI will construct detailed three dimensional models of flow in subduction
zone for comparison with seismic determi- nations of the flow, deformation and
stress in subducted litho- spheric slabs. Adequate resolution will be obtained
by solving for 3D flow in a limited region around the subduction zone (a few
thousand kilometers) and superposing this small scale solution on the large
scale flow resulting from global plate motions and large scale convection. Flow
driven by tomograph- ically inferred density anomalies will be included. The
analysis of the models will trace the flow of subducted material, deter- mine
stress and deformation associated with deeep seismicity, and constrain mantle
viscosity and structure. The models will allow a quantitative understanding of
the dynamics and mechanics of subduction processes.
