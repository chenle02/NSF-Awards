This proposal will fund a two day workshop to bring together an
interdisciplinary group of scholars who study human rights law. The workshop
will present and discuss several mechanisms in which human rights law is
codified and employed. It is designed to bring together human rights scholars
from a variety of disciplines, areas of expertise, and methodological
orientations to develop a richer understanding of human rights
law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will assemble a diverse array of
scholars who will consider theoretical and practical applications of human
rights law in several contexts. As participants stem from numerous and disparate
disciplines, areas of expertise, and methodological orientations, a goal of the
workshop will be to develop a more complex understanding of the ways in which
human rights law functions in moments of duress. The workshop will facilitate
discussions of theoretically based and empirically grounded aspects of the
multidisciplinary human rights field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
