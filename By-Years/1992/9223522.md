This project will improve the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting
by helping auditors, regulators, and corporate management to better assess an
organization's control environment (CE). The CE is made up of various abstract,
non-financial factors such as management's integrity, attitudes, and practices.
Specifically, this project investigates how the experienced auditor represents
and processes information about the CE. The project blends theory and practice
by incorporating a cognitive science approach into the assessment of an audit
judgment task. The project will improve CE evaluations by: (a) accumulating a
database of expert knowledge regarding factors critical to CE evaluation; (b)
creating structured representations of the auditor's mental model of relations
among CE factors and audit risk factors; (c) relating information-gathering
techniques to relevant CE factors; (d) elucidating how information framing and
the auditor's perspective influence CE evaluation and memory; and (e) developing
a CE decision aid for systematic assessment and documentation of the CE.
Improving the assessment of the CE will not only increase the reliability of the
financial reporting process, but will also improve the validity and accuracy of
financial reports. This, in turn, will promote increased confidence in the
securities markets, benefiting not only corporations and their investors, but
the economy and society as well.
