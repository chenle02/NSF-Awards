Funds are requested for a U.S.-EC Biotechnology Research Task Force, Workshop
on Communicating Biotechnology with the Public, March 22-25, 1992 in Dublin,
Ireland. The purpose of the workshop is to generate a set of practical
recommendations on how the United States Government (USG) and the Commission of
the European Communities (EC) can improve their dialogues with the public about
biotechnology. The forty professional science communicators (20 U.S. and 20 EC)
selected as participants all have first-hand experience in communicating with
the public on biotechnology issues. Drawing on the experience of the experts,
the workshop will generate recommendations on (1) how to accurately assess
public opinion, (2) how to establish a flow of information between (to and from)
governmental entities and the public, (3) the role of government institutions,
scientists, public interest groups, educators and the media in science
communications, and (4) how to evaluate the success or failure of communication
efforts. The recommendations of the workshop will be presented to the U.S.-EC
Task Force on Biotechnology Research in October 1982.
