This award supports research by Professor Richard R. Shrock of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology concerning the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of
asymmetric olefin metathesis and the organometallic chemistry of the early
transition metals involving triamidoamine and diamidoamine ligands. Olefin
metathesis involves the 2+2 addition of two olefins to yield two new olefins in
an economically efficient manner. The catalysts under study are the only known
efficient catalysts for asymmetric metathesis reactions and are of interest for
preparing chiral pharmaceuticals. Early transition metal complexes with new
triamidoamine and diamidoamine ligands will be investigated in order to
delineate how such complexes can facilitate both stoichiometric and catalytic
reactions.

Organometallic complexes will be investigated in order to improve their ability
to catalyze organic transformations, particularly those needed for the synthesis
of chiral drugs.
