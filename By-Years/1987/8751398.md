There is now a significant body of literature documenting misconceptions
harbored by science students which are quite widespread and which are
surprisingly resistant to change during instruction. For many students, such
misconceptions are critical barriers which prevent the attainment of conceptual
understanding. This project will investigate some promising strategies for
overcoming misconceptions in high school physics courses. The project will: (1)
conduct research on students' misconceptions and potentially useful physical
intuitions; (2) develop innovative lessons for dealing with several specific
misconceptions in mechanics; (3) evaluate their effectiveness in high school
classrooms; (4) conduct tutoring experiments in order to study student learning
processes in detail and to compare alternative teaching methods; (5) formulate
general principles of instruction for dealing with misconceptions in physics
with possible applications to other areas of science and mathematics. Research
that leads to such principles for instruction is seen as essential for guiding
the national development of effective new course materials and software for
students and teachers. The project will be carried out by a team of high school
teachers and researchers who have worked together to produce innovative lessons
and research studies. Thus, the project will be working directly at the
interface between the science education research community and the classroom.
