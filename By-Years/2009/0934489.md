The Fisher SCHolars for Rural Schools (FISCHRS) Project involves Saint John
Fisher College (SJFC), community colleges, and rural K12 school districts in
western New York State. This project seeks to increase the number of middle and
high school mathematics teachers in western New York State. FISCHRS provides
Robert Noyce Scholarships to SJFC students who have three years to complete both
their undergraduate mathematics degree and mathematics certification
requirements. Students who receive this support are obligated to spend six years
teaching in a high-needs school district. Students, transferring to SJFC from
partner community colleges and intending to teach in one of the partner K12
school districts, are given priority in receiving awards. A total of ten
students are to be trained over five years.
