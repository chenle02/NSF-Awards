This three-year project proposes to utilize digital image processing of NASA -
supplied planetary images as a medium for a 4-week teacher enhancement project
for 72 science teachers from Arizona and New Mexico. Modern digital image
processing, developed largely by the planetary exploration program, offers
revolutionary new ways to interact with visual information, and recent advances
make this capability available at moderate cost. A summer program for secondary
and middle school teachers, run through the Regional Planetary Imaging Facility,
will introduce them to the technology, to related cognitive issues, and to
advances in planetary science. Participants will return to their schools with a
hardware and software package, with skills, and with sample activity units ,
that will enable them to incorporate digital image processing into their
students' programs. The project's staff will support that implementation through
on- site follow-up visits and continual communication to maintain the systems,
to help with program development, and to assess progress for incorporation of
new ideas into subsequent summers' courses. This program is expected to promote
through budgetary structure, recruitment of teacher participants, and the
cognitive thrust of the program itself. It will support visual modes of learning
that can complement verbal communication. An amount equivalent to 66.4% of the
NSF award is being contributed as cost-sharing.
