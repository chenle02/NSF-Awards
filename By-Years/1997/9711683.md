John M Harrison University of Florida The doctoral dissertation research will
examine the occurrence and intensity of rainfall in the Meso-American region,
using Costa Rica as a case study. A transect containing the majority of the
meteorological stations will be constructed such that temporal and spatial
variations in the precipitation patterns can be evaluated. The occurrence
processes will be modeled as a Markov chain model, while the rainfall
intensities will be evaluated by fitting probability distributions to the daily
data. The effects of ENSO will be determined by correlating the parameters
associated with the occurrence and intensity models with atmospheric indices
such as the SOI and the NAO. The study will extend our knowledge of tropical
rainfall processes.
