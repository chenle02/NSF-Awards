This proposal outlines an ambitious set of activities designed to extend a
theoretical model linking risk perceptions with risk mitigation behaviors. At
the heart of the proposed work is the detailed analysis of a comprehensive data
set on people's perceptions of the risks of radon gas in their homes, largely
collected under EPA auspices but subject only to initial interpretation. The
proposed research would test a number of hypotheses regarding the nature of
individual's risk perceptions, their understanding of health implications and
mitigation options, and the relation of their behavior to expressed attitudes
and the availability of risk information. The three-person study team, composed
of two economists and a behavioral psychologist, also will collect additional
data using structured interviews in order to develop stronger tests of key
hypotheses. The project will build on the earlier, influential work of the
investigators and its results are expected to be important for theoretical
reasons, as a framework to link risk perceptions and mitigative actions, and as
a guide for risk communication and regulation activities to be undertaken by
government agencies.
