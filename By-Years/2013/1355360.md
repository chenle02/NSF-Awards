The research team proposed to develop a tool for field geologists, golf-mapping
industry and ecological monitoring, in which topography is mapped using cameras
mounted on an auto-piloted Kite Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These cameras
could be visual, near-infrared or thermal or a combination of all of them. The
system can generate high resolution (&lt; 1 m) textured Digital Elevation Models
(DEMs) that can be uploaded into Google Earth along with derived products such
as hillshade and slope maps, providing user-friendly ways of monitoring and
mapping. While there are currently a number of UAV technologies and 3D mapping
products, this solution has the following features 1) Use of a cost-effective
Kite platform that can be flown without any training 2) Multiple sensor
integration capability i.e., integrating visual cameras with near-infrared and
thermal cameras for enabling novel applications in the field of agricultural
monitoring, ecological mapping and pipeline mapping 3) Integration with Google
Earth and Maps for easy and effective planning and visualization. The tools that
will be developed as part of the proposal will be intuitive and end-user
oriented. This will enable UAVs to be used effectively for civilian purposes by
non-air-qualified personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cost-effective Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles could change the way large areas are monitored: from crop monitoring to
cattle monitoring to environmental protection. The tools that are developed as
part of this project may enable these UAVs to be used effectively for civilian
purposes. This could usher in a new era of inexpensive, cost-effective vehicles
that can be used by farmers, agribusinesses, and mapping professionals,
providing businesses with an unprecedented way of increasing the quality,
reliability, and amount of information available to them.
