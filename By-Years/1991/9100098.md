This is an award to support conduct of a conference to address issues of
importance to the education of environmental engineers, a significant component
of which involves conduct of research by university faculty with the assistance
of students primarily at the graduate level. Topics planned include
consideration of undergraduate environmental engineering education, inclusion of
hazardous waste topics and innovative technologies to deal with them in courses,
concerns relating to the role of research in graduate education and innovative
teaching concepts including use of computers in classrooms and research. This
conference will be conducted by the Association of Environmental Engineering
Professors under auspices of Oregon State University in joint sponsorship with
Stanford University and in cooperation with the American Academy of
Environmental Engineers and the Environmental Engineering Division of the
American Society of Engineering Education. Joint financial support is expected
from the Western Region Hazardous Substance Research Center at Oregon State
University. The results of this conference are expected to be utilized for
program planning.
