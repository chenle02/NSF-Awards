The PI and his coauthors will work on extremal problems for
set&lt;br/&gt;systems or hypergraphs using combinatorial,
algebraic,&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic, and topological methods. The basic problem
of&lt;br/&gt;extremal hypergraph theory is the so called Turan
problem:&lt;br/&gt;determine the maximum number of subsets a finite set can
have&lt;br/&gt;without containing some fixed forbidden configuration.
This&lt;br/&gt;question, in its full generality, is very difficult, and
certain&lt;br/&gt;special cases are famous problems that have been open for over
50&lt;br/&gt;years. Nevertheless, substantial work on closely related
issues&lt;br/&gt;has occurred recently, and the limits of this recent progress
will&lt;br/&gt;be explored. Although several different aspects are
considered&lt;br/&gt;(Ramsey-Turan problems, jumps in hypergraphs, degenerate
problems&lt;br/&gt;for simplices), the common theme is to obtain a
hypergraph&lt;br/&gt;analogue of the Erdos-Simonovits-Stone theorem, the
cornerstone of&lt;br/&gt;extremal graph theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general
topic of finite set systems has connections to diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas of
mathematics (combinatorial geometry, design theory,&lt;br/&gt;partially ordered
sets, additive number theory), and also to&lt;br/&gt;academic disciplines with
concrete applications in everyday life&lt;br/&gt;(coding theory, information
theory, optimization and scheduling&lt;br/&gt;problems, computer science).
Modern communication would be&lt;br/&gt;impossible without the existence of
codes, or objects designed to&lt;br/&gt;relay information faithfully even in the
face of distortion.&lt;br/&gt;Extremal problems for set systems play a role in
constructing&lt;br/&gt;codes for various situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
