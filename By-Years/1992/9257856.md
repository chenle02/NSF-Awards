This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award. The goal of Dr.
Henson's laboratory is to investigate the molecular mechanism of cell shape
changes and microfilament and microtubule based motility in an invertebrate
blood cell (the coelomocyte). Cytoskeletal associated proteins will be isolated,
characterized, and localized in the cells using light and electron microscopic
immunocytochemical methods. The regulation of shape changes by calcium will also
be addressed. %%% This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator
Award. Dr. Henson is interested in the fundamental and important question of how
cells change their shapes. Cellular shape changes are critical to cellular
functions (including movement) and organismal development. Dr. Henson is
currently using sea urchin coelomocytes as models for studying shape changes
associated with cellular motility. These cells are analogous to white blood
cells of higher animals, and their ability to change shape is critical to the
ability of sea urchins to defend themselves against microbial pathogens.
