The investigators will analyze data from an equatorial scintillation station at
Ancon, Peru, and conduct modeling studies associated with the electrodynamics of
the low latitude ionosphere under quiet and disturbed magnetic conditions. The
effort includes experimental campaigns in South America in the first and third
years. Other instruments to be operated during the campaigns are Fabry-Perot
interferometers, GPS receivers, digisondes, and the low power mode of the
Jicamarca Radar (JULIA). The primary goal of the study is to understand what
conditions determine the onset of equatorial scintillations. Merging different
data sets will allow the investigators to determine the background conditions of
the ionosphere during the onset of scintillation and expand our view of the
unstable plasma region. Specific areas of research include identifying the
spatial coherence of the zonal irregularity drifts, the relation between
scintillations and F-region irregularities, and the effect of geomagnetic
disturbances on irregularity growth. The results of the study will contribute to
the development of models for specifying and predicting scintillation conditions
that might cause disruptions in transionospheric communication and navigation
signals.
