This project investigates instances of convergent or translational research
within and across the natural, engineering and social sciences. Scientific
research increasingly relies on collaboration across many different areas of
expertise. When there is a need to do research that translates expertise, tools,
and analytic techniques across research areas or projects, it must be convergent
and presents challenges for scientists who are trying to collaborate in new
ways. This project aims to investigate new dynamics of collaboration emerging
around processes and goals for convergent research, which has become a central
plank of recent NSF efforts. This research will inform science policy and
regulatory environments to help develop sustainable and productive research
organizations, platforms, infrastructure, and convergent
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is on exemplary experts
who conduct translational research, their practices, organizational forms,
technical tools and architectures. It will study experts in ocean science, radio
astronomy, and data science among others. The goal is to understand and analyze
practices of convergence, recurrent challenges, and technological architectures,
in order to support and enhance activities that advance science. The methods
used are comparative, archival and ethnographic. The ethnographic work is both
multi-sited (operating across multiple research locales) and multi-scalar
(exploring phenomena nested at multiple scales). Both elements are crucial to
the comparative analysis of convergence activities. At a higher and more general
level, the research explores network-based dynamics and convergence actors
operating within and across the sites of investigation. At a lower and more
specific level, it drills down to consider in greater detail the local
convergence adopted in select network micro-sites. Findings will contribute to
the sociotechnical design of tools and infrastructure, the human-computer
interaction field of computer supported cooperative work and science and
technology studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
