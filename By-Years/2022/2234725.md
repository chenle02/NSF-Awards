A person’s spoken language variety affects many aspects of their life, one of
them being the educational experience and school trajectory. The variety a
student uses may affect their academic success, especially when the variety is
considered non-standard. For example, a student may fail a language test for
using non-standard expressions that are generally considered wrong in spite of
being valid dialectal variations of their language. Because Puerto Rican Spanish
often diverges from normative Spanish, US high school students who use this
variety as a heritage language may experience discrimination or be subject to
certain ideologies around their language. This doctoral dissertation project
examines and describes the language uses and ideologies of teen heritage
speakers of Puerto Rican Spanish, in order to understand how these practices are
tied to their educational experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gathering
linguistic data from sociolinguistic interviews and focus groups, this research
project has four overarching goals: 1.) to understand the extent to which teen
heritage speakers of Puerto Rican Spanish use well-documented features of this
language variety, a stigmatized dialect 2.) to understand their own language
ideologies and those of others around their Spanish 3.) to explore the teens’
perceived academic experiences related to Spanish, and 4.) to examine the
connections between the use of features, ideologies and perceived academic
experiences. The research provides an understanding of how students’ linguistic
practices may affect their educational experiences and success as well as
providing suggestions for practical applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
