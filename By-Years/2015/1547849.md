Solar cells are a cornerstone technology for generating clean and renewable
energy by harnessing the power of the sun. Advancements to existing solar cell
technology are presently limited to incremental improvements in power density.
The main challenge in achieving widespread adoption of solar energy generation
remains the high cost of power compared to traditional, non-renewable energy
sources. The proposed innovation enables manufacturers to produce solar cells
that are substantially more efficient in converting sunlight to electricity,
resulting in significantly improved energy density and reduced installation
costs relative to conventional commercial solar cells. Continued development of
solar energy technologies offers many economic and societal benefits, including:
(1) mitigating carbon emission levels by using clean, renewable energy; (2)
enhancing living standards through sustainable, low cost power; and (3)
strengthening national security by reducing dependence on energy imports.

This I-Corps team aims to address the market need for high energy density
photovoltaic cells by developing a tandem thin-film technology. The proposed
innovation utilizes two solar absorber materials with unique properties that
substantially increase the conversion efficiency of a solar cell, enabling a 40%
improvement in energy density in comparison to conventional cells. These new
materials can be integrated into existing photovoltaic technologies as well as
emerging production processes planned by solar cell manufacturers for the future
expansion of fabrication facilities. The scalability of the technology to
terawatt (TW) production levels using materials with unrestricted supplies, and
the manufacturability of the technology using an already installed equipment
base to minimize capital investments, are two differentiating features that may
drive rapid adoption in the marketplace. This I-Corps team seeks to explore and
evaluate the market need, the current competitive environment, and determine
feasible approaches for adapting the new solar absorber material technology to
meet customer requirements and satisfy market demand.
