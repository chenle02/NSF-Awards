This project involves several cultural anthropologists from Harvard University
in a study of the cultural psychology of mental illness in Indonesia. The
researchers will translate two standard instruments used in psychiatric
diagnosis and, working with local Indonesian personnel, will use the process of
translation to generate a lexicon of psychiatric symptoms, idioms of distress
and popular illness categories. The instruments will be used in a discovery
procedure to examine local conceptions and behavior. They will also analyze the
semantic networks relevant to mental illness. The researchers will examine
popular narrative forms for telling stories of illness and care-seeking in two
domains: depressive illnesses and psychoses. In addition the researchers will
examine how Indonesian psychiatry manages mental illness in the context of
Indonesian culture and society. This research is important because it will
provide a comparison for the US and western model of normal social behavior and
mental illness. Comparative studies such as this are important because they help
researchers understand which aspects of the western models are of fundamental
human and biological origin and which are of social and cultural origin.
