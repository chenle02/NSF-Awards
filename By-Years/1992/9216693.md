The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will use this award for the
purchase of an upgrade for two electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometers. Both
instruments are capable of acquiring ESR spectra in steady state operation and
in time-resolved ESR experiments. Fourier transform (FT) ESR methods will also
be implemented. Both instruments will be equipped with lasers capable of
providing nanosecond pulses for excitation of samples and the production of
paramagnetic transients. The instruments will be used by members of the
department for a wide range of work and will be used for a variety of state-of-
the-art experiments including: 1) Gas phase experiments employing time resolved
laser flash photolysis to investigate the possibility of employing circularly
polarized light to produce electron spin polarization of reaction products; 2)
Low temperature experiments which investigate the magnetic characteristics of
novel materials; 3) Room temperature solution experiments which employ time
resolved methods to investigate electron polarization transfer for organic
triplet states and radicals in order to elucidate the mechanism of electron
exchange between paramagnetic species; and 4) Low temperature electron spin echo
envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments to investigate photosynthetic reaction
centers. %%% An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is an instrument used
to obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules.
It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
chemical reactions.
