The Coalition to Increase Minority Doctorates is a sequenced, comprehensive
academic achievement program with the long-term objective to produce an
additional 100 minority Ph.D.'s per year in mathematics, science, and
engineering-related fields. Shorter-term objectives (through academic year
1995-1996) are to serve 43,000 precollegiate, 2,000 undergraduate, and 500
graduate students. The program operates at the secondary school level at four
broad sites (in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah). The program assists
minority students to achieve academic success at 38 participating colleges in
Arizona, Colorado New Mexico, Utah, and western Texas. At the graduate level,
through Project 1000, the students are admitted and academically supported at 55
participating graduate school around the nation. The coalition uses a variety of
proven instructional, academic, and support tools to increase minority student
performance. These include Algebra (pre-algebra preparation), Test Skills
(admission preparation), and Options for Excellence (Advanced Placement/Honors
program for minority students) at the secondary school level; summer bridge
programs, research institutes, student internships, and student-faculty research
projects at the undergraduate level; and a variety of academic and financial aid
advisement, consultation, and Graduate Record Examination preparation services
offered through Project 1000 at the graduate level.
