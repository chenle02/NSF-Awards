Under the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. David Barrington, Ms. Cathy Paris
will employ several modern molecular methods along with traditional
morphological and chromosomal analyses to assess genetic variability and trends
of evolution within the geographically widespread complex of Northern Hemisphere
maiden- hair ferns, Adiantum pedatum. The research will measure levels of gene
differences among the several taxonomic subspecies in this complex, and will
provide evidence on the likely origins of the doubled-chromosome races known in
Japan and in eastern North America, and suspected to represent independent,
parallel occurrences of polyploidy in these ferns. The research provides a
comprehensive integration of traditional taxonomic studies of fern characters
with new molecular databases, and focuses upon an interesting problem in plant
evolution.
