This SBIR Phase II award is for further research on a method to evaluate blood
flow in capillary beds using Doppler ultrasound and a contrast media. The Phase
I research verified the presence of flows in the capillary beds and that
relative changes in flow could be detected. The Phase II research will focus on
theoretical and experimental analyses of flow and perfusion and the construction
of a laboratory prototype. In addition, a method to determine perfusion without
the need for the contrast agent will be explored. The technique to make
noninvasive measurements of microcirculatory blood flow should have extensive
commercial potential in the medical imaging field for measuring myocardial
infarct, vessel occlusion, tissue perfusion, etc. In addition, the device should
have applications in the fields of chemical and materials engineering and
manufacturing.
