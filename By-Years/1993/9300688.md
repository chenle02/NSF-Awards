This instrumentation will be used to support the polymer synthesis effort in
the Polymers Program at Penn State University. The principal need is for
GPC/light scattering equipment which allows a complete characterization of the
molecular weight distribution of homopolymers and copolymers. Furthermore, this
instrumentation also provides fundamental information concerning the molecular
architecture of polymers. It is proposed to use the instrumentation as a central
facility for the department and several groups will utilize it in their
research. Amongst the projects that will be supported by this equipment are; a)
The synthesis of novel polymer materials using boron chemistry b) the synthesis
of cleavable linear, star, ring and cross-linked homopolymers and copolymers
using anionic chemistry c) the synthesis of homopolymers and copolymers
containing strongly interacting functional groups.
