9622285 Lempert The proposed research lies in the area of several complex
variables. The investigator wishes to study how the property of embeddability of
Cauchy-Riemann manifolds behaves when the Cauchy-Riemann structure is perturbed.
In addition, the investigator plans to study various properties of infinite
dimensional complex manifolds: the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations in
Hilbert spaces, the extension of the Newlander-Nirenberg theorem and the Oka
principle are among the topics pursued. Spaces based on complex numbers arise in
many natural settings. For example, polynomial equations in general can not be
solved unless one works in a (finite dimensional) complex space. The proposed
research deals with abstract complex spaces and infinite dimensional complex
spaces.
