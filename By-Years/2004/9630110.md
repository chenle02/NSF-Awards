This award is a Research Planning Grant in the Organic Dynamics Program of the
Chemistry Division. With these funds, Professor Cassandra Fraser of the
University of Virginia will study metal-centered star-shaped polymers and block
copolymers. Metal complexes will serve as the central cores of the polymers and
the polymer arms will be generated using living polymerization techniques.
Variation of the metal complex will allow for a wide variety of possible three
dimensional molecular structures, all unknown, with much flexibility in the
properties and in the domain structure. The work will explore the methodology
for preparation of such a class of materials and will develop characterization
protocols based on standard spectroscopic techniques and on multi-angle laser
light scattering. Systematic and predictable variation of the properties of
materials offers a prime strategy for optimization of their behavior. This work
will explore a new series of polymeric materials which are expected to exhibit
unusual properties and, in the long run, to lead to potential artificial enzymes
and to materials sensitive to heat, light, and electricity.
