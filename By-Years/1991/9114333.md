This project will investigate a variety of approaches, to improve the ability of
artificial neural networks (ANN) to learn classifications or general
mathematical functions. It will investigate alternative functional forms for
ANNs, building on the PI's prior work with radial basic functions and B-splines.
It will investigate methods for adapting learning rates, based on ideas about
stochastic gradient learning theory. It will investigate alternative error
functions, beyond the usual square error function, designed to yield better
generalization power. Such alterative error function, designed to yield better
generalization power. Such alternative error functions may also be used in
determining the topology of an ANN.
