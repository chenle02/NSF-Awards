This proposal focuses on two aspects of probabilistic methods in the design and
analysis of algorithms: the construction of randomized algorithms, which toss
coins in the course of their execution; and the probabilistic analysis of
algorithms, on the assumption that their input data is drawn from a specified
probability distribution. In the area of randomized algorithms, this study will
concentrate on four topics: competitive analysis of randomized on-line
algorithms, randomized algorithms for enumeration problems, randomized
scheduling of parallel computations and randomness as a computational resource.
In the area of probabilistic analysis, this study will emphasize the analysis of
fast and simple algorithms for the approximate solution of combinatorial
optimization problems.
