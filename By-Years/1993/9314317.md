In this Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR) proposal, the PI will continue his
modeling work on coastal flows, namely a study of the circulation on the
continental shelf and slope. A specific goal is to develop the capability to
support field experiments with applications of a validated, high-resolution
regional shelf- circulation model. Process studies will concentrate on the
nature of the cross-shelf transport in wind-driven systems.
