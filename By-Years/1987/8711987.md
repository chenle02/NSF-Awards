The Australian-Antarctic Discordance is a unique and enigmatic bathymetric and
geologic feature of the mid-oceanic ridge system whose origin is poorly
understood. The present award will support an integrated geophysical and
geochemical project to study the Discordance zone. The combination of a
comprehensive geochemical investigation with a SeaMARC II side-scan sonar survey
and detailed magnetic and gravity analyses will provide a unique data set which
will focus on two problems which are of fundamental significance, both on a
global scale and with respect to the nature of the Discordance itself: (1) the
geophysical and geochemical nature of the eastern boundary of the Discordance
which is one of the most pronounced geochemical and bathymetric discontinuities
in the global mid-ocean ridge system and (2) the interrelationships among axial
depth, axial morphology, ridge segmentation, and along axis petrologic
variations, all of which are unusually variable within and outside the
Discordance. The study is a cooperative project between scientists at Lamont-
Doherty Geological Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the
University of Hawaii. Field work will be done from the R.V. Moana Wave.
