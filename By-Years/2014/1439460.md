The proposed service provides risk assessment for catastrophic natural disasters
such as landslides, mudslides, volcanic avalanches, snow avalanche and related
mass flows systems. This will help insurance and reinsurance companies improve
their risk assessment by creating high-fidelity risk assessment of natural
hazards, and to be more competitive on the market by using products that will
incorporate innovative and recently developed methods. Such assessments are of
great use to many stakeholders, planners, large risk analysis providers,
government agencies (local, state, federal and international), trading.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economic costs of natural disasters in the United
States have been increasing in recent decades. The proposed work can help public
safety officials as well insurance companies and construction developers, by
delivering risk modeling and bring predictability to the outcome of these
natural disasters. Low probability events with potentially catastrophic
consequences such as mudslides, landslides, snow avalanches and pyroclastic
flows are among the extreme events that are the focus of the proposed service.
