In the first funding period of this project significant progress was made
towards the formation of novel hybrid molecules via interspecies cloning in
streptomycetes. Three novel compounds were produced and characterized, two new
genes associated with nosiheptide resistance and biosynthesis have been isolated
and sequenced, and we have learned much about polyketide biosynthesis. In the
continuation of this project we will develop and test further examples of
interspecies cloning in streptomycetes to produce novel natural products. The
focus will be experiments in which we can predict the formation of specific
hybrid molecules based on our knowledge of pathway biochemistry and genetics.
When novel products are observed, they will be isolated, purified, and their
structures will be determined using a variety of spectroscopic techniques.
