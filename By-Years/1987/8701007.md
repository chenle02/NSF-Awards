The research is important because of the many technological applications of
transition-metal chalcogenides such as superconducting materials, battery
materials and hydroprocessing catalysts. It is planned to investigate certain
aspects of soluble transition- metal chalcogenides (compounds of S, Se, Te) with
a view toward developing a chemistry that is complementary to the solid-state
efforts. In particular, it is proposed to concentrate on early transition metal
selenides and tellurides. Synthetic strategies for these unknown ions include,
for the case of Nb and Ta, solid-state reactions; these reactions may be
applicable to the synthesis of the corresponding tellurides. The reaction
chemistry to be studied includes acidification, heating, and interactions with
simple chalcogens as well as with inorganic and organic chalcogens. The use of
Se-77 NMR techniques for characterization of the selenides in solution and
diffraction methods for the characterization of species isolated from solution
is proposed. The compounds prepared from solution will provide interesting
chemical and structural contrasts to those compounds that have been prepared by
high-temperature solid-state reactions.
