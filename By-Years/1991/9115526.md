Proakis This is a collaborative research project with Chrysostomos L. Nikias
(University of Southern California). The research focuses on the development,
testing and mathematical analysis of adaptive signal processing algorithms based
on nonlinear performance criteria. Areas of research include: 1. blind
deconvolution algorithms based on criteria with memory nonlinearity; 2. decision
feedback equalizers using higher-order statistics; 3. joint estimation and
detection algorithms of the ML-type and MAP-type when the signals are Gaussian
distributed; 4. adaptive multichannel signal recovery algorithms when the
signals have gone through severe magnitude and phase distortion; and 5. blind
deconvolution algorithms based on neural networks and Volterra filters. Special
emphasis is placed on the investigation of the numerical properties and
performance of the algorithms. Performance metrics being considered include
probability of error in the restored sequence as a function of SNR, sensitivity
to signal statistics and data conditioning, rate of convergence, choice of
sliding windows and finite length effects. Applications of the new algorithms
are being considered in digital communications, speech, image processing and
geophysics.
