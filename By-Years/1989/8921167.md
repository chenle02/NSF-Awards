Globular clusters are well studied systems, because they offer the opportunity
to look on a large number of stars of different masses, all with pretty much the
same age and initial chemical composition. Much of our knowledge of stellar
evolution comes from the study of these systems. However, we can, as yet only
really look at individual stars in very nearby objects, those associated with
our own galaxy, or with the Magellanic Clouds. This program is an attempt to
enable us to obtain accurate information about the chemical composition and age
of much more distant globular clusters. The investigators combine
internationally recognized expertise in the fields of the theory of stellar
atmospheres, spectroscopy and the study of globular clusters. They will utilize
computation of model stellar atmospheres, stellar evolution calculations, and
various luminosity functions and ages to predict integrated spectra which can be
measured for distant objects. They will calibrate their model parameters with
data from nearby globular clusters for which these parameters have been
determined by other means.
