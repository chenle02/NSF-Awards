In this proposal, the proposer intends to study universal equations and other
properties of Gromov-Witten invariants of compact symplectic manifolds, as well
as their interaction with integrable systems. Gromov-Witten invariants are
defined by the intersection theory on moduli spaces of stable pseudo-holomorphic
maps from Riemann surfaces to compact symplectic manifolds. They have intuitive
interpretation of counting pseudo-holomorphic curves in compact symplectic
manifolds. Universal equations are partial differential equations which govern
fundamental behavior of Gromov-Witten invariants of all compact symplectic
manifolds, as well as for intersection numbers on moduli spaces of higher spin
curves. They provide powerful machineries in the computation of these invariants
and also play important roles in the study of the Virasoro conjecture of Eguchi-
Hori-Xiong and S. Katz. The Virasoro conjecture is a generalization of Witten's
KdV conjecture (proved by Kontsevich) and serves as a bridge between Gromov-
Witten theory and integrable systems. The study of universal equations also
helps the understanding of structures of tautological rings of moduli spaces of
curves.

The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants has important applications in symplectic
geometry, algebraic geometry, gauge theory, and integrable systems. The proposed
work concerns the fundamental structures of this theory. Besides its
applications in mathematics, the Gromov-Witten theory corresponds to topological
sigma models in string theory. Therefore the proposed project also has strong
connections with theoretic physics. Some of the deepest conjectures in this
field, including some conjectures in this proposal, actually came from
physicists. The resolution of problems proposed here will give a rigorous
support to intuitions of physicists and helps the understanding of the
topological sigma model in string theory.
