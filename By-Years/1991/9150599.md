Associated with the restructuring of the CSl and CS2 course sequence at UDC
according to the ACM task force recommendations for the Computer Science
curriculum, support is being given to create software modules and materials to
develop an integrated set of software modules and associated curricula material
that take advantage of the computer as a teaching tool, and to implement pilot
courses embodying this material. The approach taken is designed to be especially
effective in situations where students have minimal prior programming
experience. The material developed is flexible, topics-specific and highly
modular allowing its adaptation in other frameworks, including tutorials, varied
approaches to the first year of Computer Science, and lecture demonstrations.
