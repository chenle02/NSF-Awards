Professor Scoles is supported by a grant from the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program to study the structure and dynamics of molecules in clusters
using molecular beams and infrared lasers. These studies should enhance our
knowledge of interactions between molecules and their dependence on
intramolecular motion. There are several projects all using IR laser
spectroscopy and molecular beams. These are IR spectroscopy (1) of molecules
seeded in clusters, (2) of van der Waals molecules, (3) of polyatomic molecules
under high resolution, (4) by multiphoton excitation, and (5) of physisorbed
molecules on a single crystal surface. Professor Scoles will measure directly
the temperature of unsupported molecular clusters and take vibrational spectra
of neutral molecules imbedded in highly quantum clusters of para-hydrogen and
helium. The state-resolved intramolecular vibrational relaxation and IR
multiphoton excitation studies are aimed at improving our understanding of, and
control of, intramolecular motion and regioselective reactivity and clarifying
the influence of the coherence of the exciting light on this type of phenomena.
IR spectroscopy will also be used to study monolayers of gases physisorbed on
single crystal surfaces which have been structurally characterized using low
energy helium beam diffraction.
