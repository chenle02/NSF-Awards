Our understanding of eyewitness identification has increased considerably in the
last 20 years. There is now a long list of empirical results that have been
shown to be both reliable and illuminating with respect to the underlying
psychological mechanisms. This research builds upon this foundation to develop a
unified theory of the memory and decision processes that witnesses use when they
are presented with a lineup and must make an identification decision, including
the decision to not make an identification. This research will use a computer
simulation program, Witness, where the model's fundamental assumptions are
formalized mathematically. This model will be used to motivate and interpret the
results of several experiments that are designed to address the fundamental
question: How do witnesses make identification decisions? The experiments
specifically test the decision rule presently incorporated in the model. The
model will be fit to data from experiments that carefully covary suspect and
foil similarity; examine the relationship between suspect-matched and
description-matched lineups; compare showups to sequential and simultaneous
lineups; and examine how more specific witness instructions affect
identification.
