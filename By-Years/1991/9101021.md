This is a SBIR Phase II project. The goals of the phase II project are (1) to
complete the design and fabrication of a VLSI chip that incorporates a 3-D
binary cellular automator which the PI's company has developed jointly with
Visual Information Technologies (V Tech) based on the PI's patented
architecture. (2) To incorporate the chip-in Plug-in boards for personnel
computers. (3) to develop the necessary software for the system. (4) to continue
to research and develop the application for 3D cellular automatics.
