9452647 Royster A coalition will direct, facilitate, and organize a series of
activities designed to determine needs and strategies for systemic educational
reform in a geographically challenged, and economically depressed region. The
activities, which include collection of baseline data, expansion and networking
of local partnerships, and identification and testing of specific reform
strategies, will be accomplished by organizing the activities into four Study
Groups. These Study Groups will bring the concept of systemic reform to isolated
school districts while gathering the necessary information, identify resources
existing and those needed, and will provide recommendations to inform the
development of an overall plan for implementing systemic reform of science and
mathematics education throughout the rural region.
