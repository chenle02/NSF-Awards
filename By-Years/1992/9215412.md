The research will develop a strategy for damping of payload motion for various
kinds of cranes used in construction, i.e. mobile cranes, boom or tower cranes
etc. which can be easily implemented on existing equipment. There are several
factors which influence the dynamic behavior of the payload, such as velocity
and acceleration, vibrations, slipping of wheels or support, and wind. Most
research in this area concentrates on controlling the velocity and accelerations
to eliminate inertial forces. However, it is almost impossible to realistically
model the effects of wind, effects caused by slippage of tires, or settlement of
support, etc. The research uses a new approach to control the swaying the
payload, regardless of the cause. The control strategy will be based on applying
periodic balancing forces and moments to the cable to damp out oscillations as
when detected. A feedback control systems applied t the cable has the potential
of providing an inexpensive and easily implemented solution. This can be
achieved by the decoupling the payload and cable system from the structural
members of the crane during the development of the control strategy. Effective
control of the payload will improve safety, productivity and timeliness for a
number of material handling operations.
