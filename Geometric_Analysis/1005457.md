The PI proposed research focuses on several basic problems related to the
geometry of complex and symplectic manifolds, which can be studied using
nonlinear PDEs. In the first project the PI will study a recent conjecture of
Donaldson that aims at extending Yau's theorem in Kahler geometry to symplectic
four-manifolds, building on his work with Weinkove and Yau. If proved, this
conjecture would provide a powerful new tool to construct symplectic forms on
compact symplectic four-manifolds, and would have striking applications to
symplectic topology. The second project regards the geometry of compact Calabi-
Yau manifolds, and specifically the way in which Ricci-flat Kahler metrics on a
Calabi-Yau manifold can degenerate when their cohomology class approaches the
boundary of the Kahler cone. These degenerations have also been studied by
string theorists in connection with mirror symmetry. The PI proposes to continue
his study of these degenerations, as well as investigating Ricci-flat metrics on
a family of quintic threefolds near a large complex structure limit. The third
project falls in the area of canonical metrics on compact Kahler manifolds, such
as Kahler-Einstein or constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics. It is believed
that the existence of such canonical metrics should be equivalent to the
algebraic stability of the manifold. The PI will study this using two natural
evolution equations associated to these problems, the Kahler-Ricci flow and the
Calabi flow, with the aim of connecting the limiting behaviour of the flows to
algebraic stability through the use of natural energy functionals. The final
project also involves canonical Kahler metrics, and more specifically the
problem of existence of constant scalar curvature Kahler metrics on complex
surfaces with ample canonical bundle in cohomology classes that are known to be
stable.

Most of the problems that we will consider, for example the Einstein equations,
were originally discovered by physicists who were searching for models of the
fundamental laws of nature. More recently, geometric aspects closely related to
the proposed research have found applications in high energy physics, and are
being used to deepen our understanding of the Universe and of elementary
particles. The geometric ideas of the PI's research revolve around the problem
of finding the optimal shape of a geometric space, the one with the largest
possible symmetry, and understanding the possible singularities that form in
spaces where such an optimal shape does not exist. Any progress on these
questions will not only shed some light on some basic problems in mathematics,
but will also have applications in physics and other sciences.
