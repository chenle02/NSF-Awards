This award will support the development advanced software tools for
establishing a database containing information about the structural and dynamic
functional attributes of identified neurons, and the development of advanced
software tools for querying that database for information about the global
functional organization of neuronal ensembles. The visual format of the
databases developed with these tools will be multidimensional "atlases", which
preserve the spatial relationships between all objects within the nervous
systems. These project will be carried out as a collaborative effort between a
group of neurobiologists and computer scientists at the Berkeley and San Diego
campuses of the University of California. The major specific aims are to develop
a general database engine capable of representing information about the
functionally relevant neuronal attributes of the objects (such as their
biochemical, biophysical, genetic and developmental characteristics); the 3D
anatomical parameters of neural structures across multiple resolution scales;
the functional characteristics of these objects which determine their individual
"input/output" properties; and the functional relations between neuronal objects
which determine their dynamic interactions; to develop advanced software tools
for inserting the anatomical, functional and relational information into the
database and to develop advanced query tools for retrieving and analyzing the
data.
