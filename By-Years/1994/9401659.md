9401659 Carpenter The proposed research will design, develop, analyze, and apply
neural network architectures for stable recognition coding and prediction. One
set of projects will focus on new unsupervised ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory)
and supervised ARTMAP systems to support distributed recognition codes that are
stable under training regimes with either fast or slow learning. Typically, the
pattern of activity of a recognition code is distributed when there is little
reason to select one category over another, as might occur early in a learning
process. This pattern becomes more compressed as categories are more sharply
defined through experience. Generalization and storage capacity of the ART
neural networks will be greatly increased by the distributed coding capability.
Related work will focus on the computational requirements of distributed search
and on spatio-temporal recognition problems.
