A confocal imaging system will be purchased and coupled with a fluorescence
microscope. These instruments will be utilized by five investigators studying
(1) chemical signaling in developing and adult marine snails and worms; (2) the
dynamics associated with the process of colonization of a host squid by its
luminescent bacterial symbionts; (3) the structure and function of sensory
antennae of marine copepods; (4) the temporal and spatial gene expression
patterns of symbiotic luminous marine bacteria in their host' s tissues; and (5)
the molecular basis of interaction between spores of marine green algae and
microbial films on marine surfaces.
