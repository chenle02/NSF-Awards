The proposed research will elucidate the relationship between density and
coordination changes of Al3+, Fe3+ and Ti4+ in silicate melts. Experiments are
designed to obtain precise measurements of melt density using the double-bob
Archimedean method over a range of compositions and temperatures at a pressure
of one bar. The proposed density measurements will complement information on
melt structure obtained by NMR, Raman and IR spectroscopy. Properties such as
density, and the factors that affect them, are fundamental in studies of magma
evolution - - they affect melt segregration at the source region, magma ascent
through diapirs and fractures, and the processes that produce chemical
diversification in magmas.
