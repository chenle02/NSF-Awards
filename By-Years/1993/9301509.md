The research entails investigations of 2-dimensional discrete dynamical systems
using methods of topology and complex function theory. The dynamics of smooth
fractal curves, Julia sets and dynamics will also be investigated. Such research
has potential applications to a variety of physical models where two dimensional
dynamics and fractals are relevant.
