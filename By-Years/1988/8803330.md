The project is to analyze the 2000-3000 km scale geoid anomalies and the
corresponding sea floor topography in the central Pacific to determine their
source and determine the mode of convective motions in the mantle. The essence
of the problem is how to get temperature anomalies to shallow depths in the
mantle. The PI proposes to address this question by two- dimensional finite
difference numerical modeling of high Rayleigh number, infinite Prandtl number
Boussinesq fluid convection with temperature and pressure dependent viscosity.
%%% One of the fundamental problems in earth sciences today is to understand how
motion of the earth's mantle occurs and how that motion can be deduced from an
examination of things we can observe at the earth's surface. Seafloor bathymetry
and the earth's gravity field are observables that are related to mantle
motions. In this work models of a variety of types of mantle motions will be
developed and their gravity and bathymetric signals calculated and the results
compared to anomalous features of the observed field. These calculations should
help deduce which classes of mantle motions are most probable.
