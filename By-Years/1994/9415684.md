9415684 Cruz The goal of this project is to develop new methods to efficiently
predict and control the quality of service seen by heterogeneous users in an
integrated services network. This is critical to the development of efficient
and economically viable large scale high speed networks. Statistical sharing can
be used to gain efficiency, but it introduces uncertainties in the quality of
service seen by users of a network. Since the uncertainty that arises with
statistical sharing is primarily due to queueing phenomena, this will be our
main focus. Thus, one may view our project as a study on the behavior and
control of queueing networks. Viewed in this larger context, our work will have
an impact in other vitally important research areas, such as flexible
manufacturing networks and transportation networks. We will, however, be
primarily motivated by issues which arise in a communication context. We will
develop techniques for examining end-to-end performance issues, and examine
mechanisms for the allocation and scheduling of resources. One emphasis will be
on uncovering mathematical structure of sample paths. This will have an impact
on the utility of performance analyses involving both stochastic and non-
stochastic models. The issues being examined are critical to the design of
economical large scale high speed networks. ***
