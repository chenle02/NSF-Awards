The project will examine the nature of plasma fluctuations in various regions of
the magnetosphere using a new analytical method called rank-ordered multifractal
analysis (ROMA). The goal is to understand the nonlinear stochastic behavior of
space plasmas and in particular the phenomenon known as intermittent turbulence.
In parallel with the analytical analysis, the project will use a combination of
numerical and theoretical modeling called the Direct Simulation Renormalization
Group (DSRG), which is a dynamical invariant theory appropriate for the
quantitative study of crossover behavior of multifractals. Results from the
theoretical and numerical analyses will be compared with observations obtained
from satellite missions.

The analytical and numerical techniques that will be further developed by this
project have the potential to not only provide a transformative view of plasma
phenomena in Earth's magnetosphere, but have the potential to be widely used in
the analysis of a wide array of phenomena beyond plasma physics.
