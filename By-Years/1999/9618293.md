OCE 9618293 Klinck The objectives of the project are to obtain a dynamical
understanding of the circulation and water property variations within steep
sided canyons. Interaction of canyons with the coastal circulation will also be
investigated. A three-phase approach will be used, combining field observations,
numerical modeling, and laboratory experiments. Existing observations will be
further analyzed and used for initialization of model and lab simulations.
Simulations will concentrate on Astoria Canyon, where the most extensive data
exist. The principal issues to be addressed are the relative importance of
various flow regimes, the dependence of the flow on forcing mechanisms, and
tidal effects.
