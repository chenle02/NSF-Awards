9351533 Palmer This project supports the development of an undergraduate
laboratory in radio science. The radio science facility would join a night time
optical observatory and a student solar observatory (based on a heliostat) as
alternatives to the traditional physical science laboratories: as opportunities
for non-science majors to work with and master a piece of state of the art
instrumentation. The University has a radio antenna which was installed and
outfitted with low noise amplifiers and a continuum radiometer at Departmental
expense. With relatively modest additional expenditure, two major new areas of
activity are being opened up to students: radio frequency spectroscopy of
interstellar gas and radar and communications studies based on reflecting
signals from the moon. The radio facility furthers the teaching of non-science
majors in three important ways: first, in the laboratory situation, many
fundamental concepts such as wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum, black
body radiation, and absorption lines, become much more concrete because they
relate to things students can see and "play around with"; second, by
participating in the same type of activities as do modern astronomers, students
gain a clearer idea of how science is actually done; and, third, this type of
laboratory has proved to hold the interest of the students much better than do
the traditional laboratories. The spectrometer designed and built in this
project can be replicated at very modest cost. printed circuit boards, plans,
and software are being made available to other interested institutions. ***
