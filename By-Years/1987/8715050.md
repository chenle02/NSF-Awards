A series of measurements of nuclear electromagnetic structure will be carried
out using the :Nuclear Physics at SLAC" facility. The major new effort will be
to measure elastic electron scattering from the proton and neutron over a wide
range of beam energies and scattering angles to separate the nucleon charge and
magnetic form factors at large momentum transfer. The experiment will use the
high current electron beam from the Nuclear Physics Injector and the magnetic
spectrometer facilities of End Station A. Improved data on the nucleon
electromagnetic form factors at large momentum transfer is essential for
extending the knowledge of their internal structure: the charge and currents
carried by the quarks inside the nucleons. Analysis of the data from earlier
SLAC experiments will continue. Efforts will also be made on the design,
construction, and testing of instrumentation for future experiments at SLAC.
