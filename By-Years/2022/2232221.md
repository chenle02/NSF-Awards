Many activities of modern society and government depend on use of the
electromagnetic (radio-frequency) spectrum. Future growth in these activities
requires increased use of dynamic spectrum sharing – ways to enable diverse
spectrum users to safely operate closer together in space or frequency or to
trade spectrum access more rapidly than is possible with traditional spectrum
management approaches. The National Science Foundation National Radio Dynamic
Zones (SII-NRDZ) program seeks to advance the use of dynamic spectrum sharing
through conducting extended field trials of new sharing approaches. The SII-NRDZ
program intends to make a future award called the Engineering and Execution Lead
(SII-NRDZ-EEL). The SII-NRDZ-EEL will provide the professional engineering and
management required for success of SII-NRDZ program field trials. In this
project, the MITRE corporation conducts the initial planning, technical study,
regulatory study, and program and outreach interactions needed to prepare a
high-quality proposal to serve as the SII-NRDZ-EEL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
selected as the SII-NRDZ-EEL, the MITRE Corporation envisions building
infrastructure as a service that will accelerate the pace of research and field
trials in spectrum sharing. This infrastructure is called “NRDZ-as-a-Service”
(NaaS). NaaS will serve as the platform for maturing spectrum-sharing
researchers’ solutions, for transitioning implementations from laboratory
testing to large-scale field trials, and for rapidly conducting repeatable
experiments at multiple field trial sites. NaaS will provide researchers the
capability to construct custom dynamic spectrum sharing approaches that interact
with spectrum users through standard interfaces. In the technical study portion
of this project, MITRE performs initial design of NaaS services and interfaces,
prototypes a representative NaaS to demonstrate its capability, and investigates
architectural questions relevant for future spectrum sharing
deployments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
