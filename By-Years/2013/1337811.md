With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program that
is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, Professor Mark Grinstaff from Boston University (BU) will acquire a
micro-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (micro-MALDI-TOF). The proposal is aimed at
enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a)
electrochemistry of diheme cytochrome c peroxidases; (b) bacteriophobic coatings
for inhibition of pathogenic biofilms; (c) synthesis and reactivity of
polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) belts; (d) improvement of nanoparticle
functionalization strategies; and (e) studies of inhibitors and activators of
protein-protein interactions.

Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and
characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices.
In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they
are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are
measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of
the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. A critical gap exists in the
current mass spectrometric capabilities on the BU Charles River Campus because
there is no instrument of the type needed to support chemical research in the
life processes, chemistry and nanotechnology. The new instrument on the Charles
River Campus would directly and immediately impact and enhance the projects of
more than 40 graduate, 10 undergraduate, and 10 post-doctoral researchers. The
new instrument would be available to other scientists and educators at BU, as
well as outside institutions such as Emmanuel College, with whom BU has
partnered in advancing education and research.
