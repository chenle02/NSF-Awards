Two force control robots with interfaces and floating point accelerators will
be obtained for use in projects dealing with coordination of mobile
manipulators. In particular, for: * Environment exploration force and motion
control. * Locomotion and manipulation coordination. * Multiple mobile
manipulator coordination. These two compact six degree-of-freedom manipulators
will be mounted on existing mobile platforms so that mobile coordination may be
examined.
