This project addresses electrodynamic processes in the Earth's ionosphere at low
and mid-latitudes. These processes will be studied simultaneously in both
hemispheres in the American sector from locations along the same geomagnetic
field lines. Data from ground-based all-sky imagers and in-situ satellite
measurements will be analyzed. The results of this study will be made broadly
available, will help to understand how inter-hemispheric coupling occurs, and
can be incorporated in global scale models of ionospheric electrodynamics, which
are relevant to understanding Space Weather. This research will involve graduate
and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt; Specifically, this project will
investigate the behavior of ionospheric perturbations related to equatorial
Spread-F (ESF) and medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs).
Observations include all-sky imagers and Fabry-Perot interferometers at
magnetically conjugate locations in the American Sector. The generation
mechanism of MSTIDs will be investigated using the conjugate measurements as
well as data from the C/NOFS satellite.
