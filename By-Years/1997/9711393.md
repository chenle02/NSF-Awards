Jerry J Johnston Indiana University The doctoral dissertation research will
involve an analysis of the dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and the
terrestrial carbon cycle. A difficulty in creating models which provide a deeper
understanding of these systems has been the drastically different scale at which
measurements of carbon pool and flux sizes have been made and the scale to which
these must be extrapolated. Specifically the research will simulate these
interactions at a number of spatial and temporal scales using data from ground
based surveys and experiments, an above-canopy carbon-dioxide flux tower, and
two different remote sensing satellites. The result will be a spatially explicit
mathematical model of forest net productivity as it varies with respect to
biotic and abiotic gradients present in the forested landscape of southern
Indiana.
