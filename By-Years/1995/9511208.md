Kreps Stanford University SBR-9511208 This proposal consists of four related
projects. The first project is joint with Drew Fudenberg and involves the
completion of ongoing research on boundedly rational learning in games. The
second project aims to provide an axiomatic approach to uncertainty aversion --
the tendency of people to avoid situations in which the probabilities of
different outcomes are unknown-- and to link it with satisficing behavior. This
work could help account for such puzzles as the Ellsberg paradox. The third
project is joint with Bent Holmstrom and will seek to provide a theoretical
foundation to the prevalence of unsecured promises in social transactions. The
fourth project is a dynamic extension of previous work by the P.I. on unforeseen
contingencies. ; Oh +' 0 ( L p $ H l C:\WORDTEMP\NORMAL.DOT David Kreps Luis
