The Excellence in Science Education Learning (Project ExSEL) recruits, prepares
and supports 43 outstanding undergraduate science students who want to become
science teachers in high need secondary schools, primarily in the Guilford
County Schools. The project is preparing a sizeable, well-qualified, inspired
cohort of applicants to receive Noyce Scholarships, supporting them through
their Junior and Senior years, while obtaining licensure, and continuing to
support them through their first two years of teaching. This cohort is formed by
aggressive recruiting from three streams of students: undergraduates, especially
those involved in teaching activities such as tutors, lab assistants, and
supplemental instruction programs, SIP; Master's students; and Post
baccalaureate students. The cohesion of this group of students is encouraged by
a series of social and educational activities, awards and school experiences.
The constant support and encouragement of well qualified mentors from the
College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education ensures the
reinforcement and magnification of the students' love of teaching. The
activities of these cohorts are coordinated by a part-time Science Teachers
Coordinator, supported by departmental coordinators. Noyce Scholars are
guaranteed a minimum of two years post-licensure teaching with educational
support and continued participation in cohort activities.
