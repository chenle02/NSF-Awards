This proposal provides a plan for the creation of a model to improve the
quality and effectiveness of science education in multicultural settings. Over a
period of three years, a core of master teachers will be trained in the use of
integrated science curriculum. These master teachers will then train 100 of
their less well- prepared peers to use the new curricula. The target group is
minority and female students. In the process, the 100 teachers will learn the
content, teaching methods and interpersonal skills that the master teachers have
found to be effective in increasing the engagement of minority and female
students with science learning. Cost sharing is equivalent to 17% of the NSF
award.
