****Technical Abstract**** This award supports studies of intriguing emergent
quantum phases in two-dimensional electron systems. The striking electron liquid
phases occur in highest quality semiconductor hetero-structures in large
magnetic fields. This research employs measurements of low-lying modes to
uncover exciting physics that dictates the emergence of novel electron matter
from unique Coulomb interactions in two-dimensions. Here, partially populated
higher Landau levels are hosts to remarkable states like the fascinating even-
and odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall fluids that occur in the second
Landau level. Excitations in charge and/or spin degrees of freedom will be
measured by unique resonant inelastic light scattering methods at low
temperatures below 50milliKelvin degrees that are achieved in dilution
refrigerators. The award will support the PhD dissertation research of a
graduate student and enable the participation in these projects of highly
qualified undergraduate students. This research should uncover physics of
fundamental many-electron interactions that would greatly expand the frontiers
of studies of strongly interacting low-dimensional electron systems.

****Non-Technical Abstract**** When embedded in high magnetic fields electron
systems in artificial high quality semiconductor hetero-junctions display
intriguing phases that manifest the striking weirdness of quantum mechanics. Of
primary interest are the intriguing even- and odd-denominator fractional quantum
Hall effect states in the second Landau level. This project is a quest in which
measurements of low-lying excitation modes, by advanced light scattering methods
at very low temperatures, uncover exciting new electron physics that emanates
from quantum interactions in reduced dimensionality semiconductors. Novel low-
dimensional electron systems attract broad attention. Progress in understanding
their fundamental physics and their materials science advance the state-of-the-
art in technologies of contemporary and future electronics and optoelectronics.
In fundamental science the research appeals to world-class scientists working on
topics of interaction physics that seek answers to questions that are at current
frontiers. The project offers opportunities to highly qualified undergraduate
and graduate students, as well as postdocs interested in participation in
research at frontiers of condensed matter science.
