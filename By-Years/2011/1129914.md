Scalable Synthesis and Assembly of Novel Ordered Hybrid
Nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this project are
three-fold: (1) to fabricate novel ordered hybrid nanostructures; (2) to
understand the process-structure-property relationship of the novel hybrids; and
(3) to test the hypothesis that the novel hybrid nanostructures have great
potential for energy storage. The PI plans to investigate a novel scalable
process to fabricate such a new nanostructure through a creative combination of
chemical synthesis and self-assembly. The process-driven morphology evolution
will be explored. Particularly, the processing physics and chemistry will be
studied to understand process-structure-property relationship. The hydrogen
adsorption and electrochemical characterization of novel hybrids will also be
examined to understand the potential for hydrogen and electrical energy
storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will design and
fabricate novel nanostructured materials, and significantly advance fundamental
knowledge in scalable nanofabrication of new structures for high-efficiency
energy storage and lay a foundation for transport and utilization of clean
energy. The expected results will provide a fundamental understanding on the
relationship between novel nanostructure and bulk properties, and enable a
feasible way to bridge the gap between nanoscale building blocks and bulk
properties. The results of this project will be broadly disseminated through
annual reports, international conferences, and publications in high-profile
academic journals.
