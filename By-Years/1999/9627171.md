9627171 Sadler The Science Education Department of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics will produce and evaluate a pilot for a series of after
school television program targeted at youth aged 9 -12. The series, which is
based on the research into children's misperceptions about science conducted by
the applicant, will help viewers make sense of often poorly understood or
misunderstood science principles. The project will be highly interactive through
the use of the Internet and 800 numbers. In the television series, viewers will
see "evidence" for different ways to interpret basic science concepts and will
be called upon to make sense of the key evidence, conduct further investigation
on their own, and register their findings via the Internet and World Wide Web or
by calling an 800 number. In response to the viewer's verdict, local stations
will air either a "guilty" or "innocent" resolution -- both of which will
clarify the science concept being considered. The PI for the project will be
Philip Sadler, Director of the Science Education Department at the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The Project Manager will be Matthew
Schneps, Director of the Science Media Group. Education and science content will
be the responsibility of Hal Coyle, a science teacher and curriculum developer,
and Roy Gould, an Education Specialist at the Center. The principal science
advisor will be Irwin Shapiro, Director of the Center for Astrophysics, and the
chief educational advisor will be Charles Whitney, Prof. Emeritus Harvard
University. The video will be produced in cooperation with Terra Associates in
New York.
