This engineering education research project investigates students' ability to
generate ideas (ideation) as they learn engineering design. Ideation is a
critical skill for all engineers as they explore problem spaces and develop both
short-term and long-term solutions to societal problems. The project
investigates three key factors hypothesized to contribute to students' idea
generation capability, and explores the interrelation between the
factors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this
project arise from the potential to support ideation flexibility among
engineering practitioners, giving greater capabilities for engineering educators
to support and direct ideation in engineering degree programs. The investigators
have proposed an ambitious plan to ensure that the research results are broadly
disseminated to engineering faculty members. This project overlaps with NSF's
strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an
engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally NSF's
goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of
innovative learning systems.
