PI Name: Richard L. Weaver&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0201346&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title:
Statistical Elastodynamics of Large Structures&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract
&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the statistics of vibrational and acoustic
energy, its mean flow and its fluctuations, in complex irregular reverberant
structures. The work is conceived with a view towards improved statistical
energy theories for the mid-frequency range in such structures, and involves
numerical simulations, analytic theory and laboratory
measurements.&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of two complementary thrusts. A
method for efficient estimation of flow of mean energy will be extended to the
time dependent case, and tested by comparing with results from direct numerical
simulation and conventional Statistical Energy Analysis. Comparisons will be
carried out on models and structures from industrial applications. The l
variance of fluctuations away from that mean will be investigated using Random
Matrix Theory and compared with laboratory measurements and numerical
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;Technical impact will be in the creation of better
statistical energy models for the vibrations and acoustics of large structures,
with implications for noise and vibration design for consumer machinery, and
space and naval structures. Other applications will lie in reverberation room
acoustics, ultrasonics, stochastic seismic waves, mesoscopic electronics, and
diffuse optics for lidar and medical imaging. Broader impact is ensured by the
industrial collaborations that are envisioned, by collaborations with
seismologists and physicists, by archival publications, by the training of PhD
students, by the PI's participation in technical meetings, and by his
introduction of new material in advanced courses, with new software on
statistical energy analysis.&lt;br/&gt;
