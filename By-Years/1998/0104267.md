The goal of this project is to adapt recent advances in crystal engineering for
the preparation of covalently cross-linked coordination crystals, materials
potentially useful in separations and ion conduction. We use a template
methodology. We synthesize rigid nanoscale organic molecules which are then
initially assembled in the solid state via labile organic-ligand-to-metal
coordination-bonds. In the second step we introduce guest molecules without
altering the host crystal structure. These guest molecules cross-link the
original organic molecules to each other. In this way, we are able to access a
new regime of organic solids viz., crystalline multi-dimensional covalently
bonded organic solids. Such materials will be chemically and physically more
robust than existing organic materials. This research program is carried out
together with graduate and undergraduate students who receive state-of-the-art
training in crystal engineering. The fundamentals of two different fields,
organic reaction methodology and solid state chemistry, are applied in the
design of useful crystalline materials.

The next generation of solid state devices will require materials that combine
both the functional specificity of typical organic compounds plus the global
architecture of traditional inorganic solids. In this project methodologies are
developed for designing routes to these materials in which the organic and
inorganic portions are joined together at a molecular scale. An important
synergism is needed here between organic, inorganic and solid state chemistry, a
synergism which is vital to the successful design of useful devices.
