IMACS Applied Computer Algebra Meeting, Albuquerque, NM, May 16-19, l995. This
meeting focused on the applications of computer algebra systems (CAS) in
engineering, applied mathematics, pure mathematics, and education. It was the
first international meeting of this type. This meeting was particularly timely
because of the great strides made in using deep computer algebra results like
the Grobner Basis and quantifier- elimination algorithms and their
generalizations to produce significant results in equations, in the analysis and
implementation of discrete methods for differential equations, to control
theory, and to many other areas. The use of computer-algebra techniques is
growing rapidly in most if not all engineering and science areas and thus the
dissemination of the latest techniques is important and are not covered by
disciplinary meetings.
