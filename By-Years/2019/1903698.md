The study and identification of quantum phenomena in biological systems is an
interdisciplinary field that has attracted increasing attention in the past few
decades, but has slowly progressed in part due to different background of
physical scientists and biologists. This workshop will bring young and senior
scientists together from different scientific disciplines including biology,
physics, chemistry, and quantum information science to discuss processes in
biology that require quantum theory, like chemical reactions, charge transport,
and quantum biological phenomena, where the quantum process is used by the
biological system for a particular function, such as magneto reception, photon
absorption in vision, and photosynthesis. The workshop will contribute toward
defining current important topics and questions to be addressed with future
research, and will stimulate and possibly identify new research topics of
quantum phenomena in biological systems with applications in quantum information
science and condensed matter physics.

This workshop is co-funded by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division
of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Sciences Directorate and
the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the
Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
