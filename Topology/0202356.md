The investigator and his colleagues study interactions between Representation
Theory, Knot Theory, and Mathematical Physics. These fields are interrelated and
motivate each others' development. Representation theory, among other things,
helps mathematical physicists predict the existence of particles. It has played
a significant role in describing symmetry and in providing a language for
conformal field theory and statistical mechanics. In turn, mathematical physics
has led Representation Theorists to new conjectures, interesting
generalizations, and fascinating results. Invariants of knots and links such as
the polynomials of Kauffman and Jones arise as the trace of representations of
certain algebras (Hecke algebras, Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebras, group algebras
of braid groups). And of course, knot theory is related to mathematical physics
through concepts such as statistical mechanics. This conference fosters a
dialogue between the Researchers, and helps students, in particular graduate
students, and recent Ph.Ds become acquainted with the areas of research that is
of significant importance to high performance computing. This workshop brings
together experts in many different areas of Mathematics, Mathematical physics,
and quantum computation, etc. This is helping research in areas that could help
creation of quantum computers.
