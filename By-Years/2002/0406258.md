0406258&lt;br/&gt;Morse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Mexico award will support
a visit by Dr. Theodore Morse of Boston University to the laboratory of Dr. Juan
Hernandez Cordero of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico
City, Mexico. The investigators plan to finalize plans for cooperative research
on a new type of optical fiber sensor that has applicability to a significant
number of measurands. They will examine the results of some preliminary
experiments they have carried out in their respective laboratories and prepare
the groundwork for submission of a cooperative research effort. Work in this
area may lead to improvements of orders of magnitude increases in the
sensitivity of the detection of wide classes of biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;
