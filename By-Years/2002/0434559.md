Lehnert&lt;br/&gt;04-34559&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt; The
geosciences community is increasingly taking advantage of the exciting
opportunities that state-of-the-are and cutting edge information technologies
offer to efficiently apply a rapidly growing quantity of observational,
measured, and computed data to science and education. This workshop will define
community-wide needs for data management in sediment geochemistry. Special
emphasis will be placed on the aspects of integrating data for the marine and
terrestrial environments and on integrating geochemical data with other relevant
data types. The goal is to begin the process of developing a community consensus
on how to approach a truly integrated marine and terrestrial information
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
