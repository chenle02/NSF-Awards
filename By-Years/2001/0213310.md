The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this award to
University of California Riverside to develop novel open framework chalcogenide
materials to advance new synthetic and structural concepts, and to better
understand self-assembly processes and host-guest interactions. With this award,
Professor Feng will study interactions between organic molecules and the
semiconductor nanocrystal precursors to generate larger clusters, and to
organize these clusters with controlled surface properties into 3-dimensional
ordered frameworks. Properties of these clusters and their 3-D assemblies will
be controlled by changing the composition and interactions between their
inorganic and organic components. The synthesis of larger nanocrystals may lead
to better understanding of material transition between molecules and colloidal
nanocrystals, which in turn will help to control nucleation and growth processes
in the synthesis of semiconductor materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research
studies will be carried out in the synthesis and characterization of
semiconductor nanoclusters and 3-dimensional ordered frameworks to enhance the
understanding of nanocrystal synthesis and assembly of semiconductor materials,
which will have potential applications in magnetic and electrooptic devices.
Instructional and research training in solid state and materials chemistry will
be provided to graduate and undergraduate students with this award.
