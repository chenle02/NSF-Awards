9814331 Nagy This award will partially support attendance, especially for
graduate students and new investigators, at the conference "Linear Algebra:
Theory, Applications, and Computations," to be held at Wake Forest University,
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, January 8--9, 1999. The conference intends to
recognize Robert Plemmons' outstanding contributions to core, applied, and
computational Linear Algebra on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday. The major
themes of this conference will be: matrix analysis and nonnegative matrix
theory; large, sparse least squares problems and parallel algorithms;
applications of linear algebra in signal and image processing. The primary
purpose of the meeting is to bring together scientists researching in these
diverse, yet related areas, to explore greater commonality. There will be four
invited long presentations, and twenty-five invited short presentations. In
order to facilitate interaction between researchers with varying interests,
there will be no parallel sessions. Contributed papers will be solicited for
informal poster presentations, and new investigators will be especially
encouraged to participate. The conference will be held in an intimate setting to
encourage interaction between researchers, and between senior scientists and new
investigators. Research results presented at the meeting will be published in a
special issue of the journal Linear Algebra and its Applications.
