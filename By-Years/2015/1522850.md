A conference on classical and quantum hyperbolic geometry and topology will be
held at the Universite Paris-Sud (Orsay) from July 6 to July 10, 2015. The aim
of the conference is to bring together experts from the disparate fields which
are connected to low-dimensional topology and to foster interactions among them
as well as with junior mathematicians in those fields.

The conference is concerned with the interface of several fields: (1) low-
dimensional topology; (2) geometric structures on manifolds, particularly
hyperbolic geometry; (3) Teichmuller theory --- classical, quantum, and higher;
(4) representation theory; and (5) topological quantum field theory (TQFT) and
quantum groups. The last four decades have revealed many deep connections among
these subjects. The aim of this conference is to further explore and strengthen
these connections by bringing together a very distinguished group of
researchers, both from the US and Europe, who are working in or at the interface
of these subjects. We expect that strong research talks at the conference will
help encourage the researchers working in these disparate subjects to explore
common ground and develop new avenues of research. We also expect that the
conference will expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the
important developments in these areas. More information is available on the
