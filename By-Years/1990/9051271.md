In order to promote the plant sciences and integrate the interests of the
faculty, the college's field station forest is being utilized as a living
laboratory. Building on an already established foundation of species sampling by
freshman students, upper division students investigate anatomical,
morphological, physiological, and molecular/cellular systems to measure the
impact on the forest of the developed/agricultural land which surrounds it. The
equipment enhances that previously acquired through an earlier CSIP grant, and
includes a photomicroscope, herbarium cabinets, spectrophotometer, refrigerator,
electrophoresis equipment, oxygen meter with electrode, and a plant growth
chamber. The college will provide an amount equal to the award.
