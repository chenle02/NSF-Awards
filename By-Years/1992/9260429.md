The goal of this effort is to develop a parallel 3D fast boundary element
method with enhanced computational speed, low storage requirement and reduced
inter-processor communication overhead. A preliminary 2D calculation carried out
at Continuum Dynamics, Inc. has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed new
method. It is based on an application of a fast methodology which we recently
developed for a fast vortex computation. A new inter- processor communication
algorithm with low overhead, which we developed for the parallel fast vortex
method, will be used. Two applications of the new method will be carried out:
(i) flow around solid body for aeronautical application and pharmaceutical
application. The proposed enhancement to the boundary element will allow
realistic representation of the complex surface geometry encountered in a
complete aircraft configuration or a protein macromolecule using as many as tens
of thousands of computational boundary elements.
