Current research focuses on overcoming the speed/sensitivity trade-off present
in semiconductor nonlinear materials and devices. Extension of the single
heterostructure Schottky barrier concept into a hybrid device is promising for
development of simple to fabricate, high sensitivity, high speed devices.
Applications research for these devices include optical dynamic random access
memory, monolithically integrated passive and active absorbers for mode-locked
semiconductor lasers, and spatial light modulators. Optoelectronic integration
is a second interest area. Deposition of optical material onto electronic
material has been achieved by Dr. Jokerst at Georgia Tech by separating GaAs
devices from their substrate (lift-off) and depositing the devices onto Si. GaAs
optical and/or electrical devices can be lifted off and deposited onto any
smooth material such as glass or LiNbO3. Current projects utilizing this
technology include a 512 X 512 element optical phase modulator for beam steering
and optical signal processing. Solar cells created through lift-off are another
project under investigation. Desirable high power to cost and power to weight
ratios exist for lifted-off solar cells since the expensive, heavy substrate is
not longer attached to the solar cell and further, can be reused for growth.
