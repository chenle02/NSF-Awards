Funds are provided for the purpose of an image processing system equipment which
will be used to study the stresses and material behavior at both the macrolevel
and the microlevel. Such equipment permits one to genuinely combine the
traditional experimental methods with computer technology and digital cameras.
The same equipment also allows the possibility of greatly magnified images, in
regions of large strain gradients, such as exist at a crack tip or at grain
boundaries in crystalline materials.
