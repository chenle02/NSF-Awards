9354980 Tlusty The Machine Tool Research Center (MTRC) at the University of
Florida will establish a three phase Machine Tool Research Graduate Traineeship
program designed to lead students from the B.S. to the Ph.D. in a five year
period. During the first phase of the program, the students will concentrate on
coursework. They will identify an area of research interest and complete a non-
thesis Master's research project which will serve as the basis for their
eventual doctoral research. Following the completion of the M.S. degree in the
second year, the students will enter the second phase of the traineeship which
consists of a one-year, off campus internship at an industrial site or an
internationally recognized research lab. The internship will be arranged
carefully to coincide with the student's research area. Following the
internship, the trainees will return to the MTRC to concentrate on their
doctoral research. The NSF Machine Tool Research Traineeships will be nationally
advertised. Particular emphasis in recruitment will be placed on women,
minorities and the disabled. Institutions which are the leading producers of
women, minority, and disabled B.S. level Mechancial or Manufacturing Engineering
graduates will be identified. MTRC faculty will make recruiting visits to at
least four of these institutions. Eight of the most promising candidates
identified will be invited to visit the UF campus to meet with MTRC faculty and
students at departmental expense. Recent expnsion of the MTRC necessitates an
increase in the number of graduate students. The Mechanical Engineering
department is currently restructuring its graduate programs to place an
increased emphasis on the Ph.D. degree. The Machine Tool Research Graduate
Traineeship program will allow the MTRC to significantly increase its Ph.D.
