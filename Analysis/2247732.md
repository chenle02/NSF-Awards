This NSF award will provide partial support for the 2023 Great Plains Operator
Theory Symposium (GPOTS), which will be held May 15-19, 2023 at The Ohio State
University in Columbus, OH. More information about this conference may be found
on the conference website at
https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/GPOTS2023.html.

GPOTS is the largest annual national conference in operator algebras and
operator theory held in the United States. Since its beginning in 1981, it has
grown into a major international conference with attendance approximately
between 100-150 each year. Topics which will be featured at GPOTS 2023 include:
C*-algebras, operator spaces, operator theory, non-commutative geometry, von
Neumann algebras, and random matrix theory, with connections to many areas of
mathematics, including ergodic theory, logic, and mathematical physics. Aside
from plenary lectures, GPOTS 2023 will have contributed talks sessions primarily
given by early career researchers, with many given by graduate students and
postdocs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
