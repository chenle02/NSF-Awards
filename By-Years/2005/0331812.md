Funding is provided to support the publication of a special issue of The
Oceanography Society magazine Oceanography, titled "Ocean Observatories".
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanography is now in its 16th year of publication. It is
published four times per year, with issues going to the membership of TOS
worldwide as well as to the libraries at major oceanographic institutions. TOS
membership (and, hence our readership) includes most of the senior
administrators of government oceanographic agencies and academic research
institutions. In the past, the magazine has published special issues on a range
of topics including the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, Census of
Marine Life, and an issue highlighting the contributions of Dr. John Knauss to
marine science and ocean policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Publication of peer-
reviewed articles on "ocean observatories" will convey the latest research in
this area to the scientists and others who will be future possible collaborators
in this area of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
