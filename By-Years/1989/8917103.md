Dissolution/precipitation reactions involving calcite and plagioclase can have
an enormous impact on the porosity and permeability of sedimentary rocks during
diagenesis. Such reactions are also known to be important controls on the vent
fluid chemistry in geothermal systems. It is thus important to understand the
factors influencing the rates of these mineral reactions, since their timing
relative to the production of oil or gas can be crucial to the development of
major hydrocarbon reserves, or alternatively their timing may strongly influence
the locus or extent of mineralization in hydrothermal ore deposits. This project
will initiate a series of hydrothermal experiments which quantitatively evaluate
the influence of fluid chemistry, grain size (surface area), temperature and
pressure on reaction rates for mineral reactions involving calcite and
plagioclase feldspar, phases which have been shown to significantly affect the
porosity inventory of petroleum reservoirs, and are demonstrably important to
the chemistry of geothermal fluids. The use of isotopic tracers to measure
kinetic and thermodynamic parameters is a new experimental approach which is
especially well suited to the study of sediment diagenesis and hydrothermal
alteration processes, where reactions often proceed very close to equilibrium.
