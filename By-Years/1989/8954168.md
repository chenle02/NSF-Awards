This project is developing a series of summer science institutes for promising
girls, beginning when they are 11-12 years old. Each 2-week science institute
involves the girls in basic science and computer technology through practical
hands-on activities. On completing the first science institute, each girl is
provided with a personal computer and modem, and is linked to a statewide
electronic bulletin board. Project staff provide ongoing mentoring through daily
contact with each girl. The girl's parents and teachers are involved in the
networking process through workshops and conferences. Each group of girls attend
a new science institute every summer until they graduate from high school, with
a new group of 11-12 year olds being added each year.
