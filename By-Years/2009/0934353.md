&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CUNY City College, Clarkson University (CU), University of
North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC), and Western Carolina University (WCU) are
collaborating to establish the Center for Metamaterials, with CUNY as the lead
institution. This proposal is based around a planning strategy to develop an
I/UCRC program where the R&amp;D effort will be focused around metamaterials.
The program involves four institutions with various strengths that can
supplement theoretical understanding, device manufacturing, and characterization
of a variety of metamaterial concepts. The Center for Metamaterials will
essentially provide a one-stop shop for design, fabrication and test of wide
range of metamaterials for use anywhere from the microwave to optical part of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The proposed Center will also address the many
fabrication challenges associated with exploiting these novel properties when
small degrees of disorder are known to modulate properties and performance. The
planning grant will enable a forum to be established whereupon strategic
research programs will be matched to potential industrial members of a fully-
formed I/UCRC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metamaterials will greatly extend the
design tool-kit for all electromagnetic devices and systems; and will advance
the technological capabilities in all areas of wireless and photonics products.
The proposed Center will include universities serving a diverse student body
that includes under-represented minority groups, and plans to develop extensive
metamaterials education and internship programs for undergraduate, graduate and
continuing-education students, as well as web-based distance learning courses.
The proposed Center could have a significant impact on the nation because the
novel materials have the potential to create new technologies that could have
huge economic outcomes.
