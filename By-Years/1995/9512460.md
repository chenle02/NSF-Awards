Pi 9512460 This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. So Young Pi, Department
of Physics, Boston University, to pursue with Dr. Hyunsoo Min, Department of
Physics, Seoul City University, for a period of 24 months, a program of
cooperative research on field theories in various dimensions. Dr. Jae Hyung Yee,
Department of Physics, Yonsei University, will serve in an advisory capacity
with Dr. Min so as to facilitate Dr. Min's entry into collaborative research
with the U.S. scientist. This research will address three principal subjects,
namely: (1) finite temperature field theories; (2) dynamics of particles and
solitons in Chern-Simons gauge theories; and (3) low dimensional gravity
theories. The collaborators expect to use the functional Schr dinger method,
which they will further develop in the direction of renormalization group,
entropy, and bound-state calculations. The collaborators expect to produce new
and important understanding of the theoretical structured for field theories in
various dimensions. Potential benefits include advances in physical theory and
strengthening of the Physics Departments at both universities. A special benefit
is the likelihood of attracting outstanding Korean graduate students to do
research at Boston University. This project is relevant to the objectives of the
U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of
cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the
exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through
collaboration on problems of mutual benefit. Dr. Min's participation in the
project is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
