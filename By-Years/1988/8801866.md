The central features of concurrent, parallel and distributed computation are
captured in the settings of monoidal categories with finite biproducts,
countable coproducts, and distributive laws. Such categories are not only
thoroughly researched, but central to any study of dynamics. In these categories
the interplay of monoids (algebras) and comonoids (coalgebras) play an important
role in the analysis of dynamics. A traditional usage is in Hopf algebras, the
central features of which abstract to bimonoids (bialgebras). Processes which
make progress by interaction require further research into a different interplay
between monoids and comonoids. Call these dimonoids (dialgebras). In addition,
careful attention must be paid to the role of silent moves. The combination of
dimonoid structure with nontrivial grade zero objects requires careful study.
The research will proceed first at the level of automata (semiautomata, labeled
transition systems) and then abstract to equivalence classes of automata
functorially.
