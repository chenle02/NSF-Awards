This research project is to investigate and develop a novel hybrid technology,
a combination of electrostatic spray coating (ESC) of cubic boron nitride (cBN)
powder and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) of titanium nitride (TiN) phase in
the cBN matrix, a revolutionary method for the fabrication of cBN:TiN composite
coated cutting tool inserts. The research program will be executed in
collaboration between the University and an industrial partner. This proof-of-
concept research effort will provide a unique way to achieve maximum
concentration of cBN in cBN-TiN composite layer by maintaining good properties
relevant to cutting tool application. The success of the fundamental study and
applied technological developments will not only be instrumental in the
development of the cBN coated tool product but will lead to innovative products.
