Project studies the variations in spatial, temporal and size distribution of
earthquakes that exist between different faults. Examines whether or not
strength properties (as interpreted by the seismic parameters) are related to
the temporal, etc., characteristics of the faults. Studies the relationship
between the frequency of occurrence of step-like discontinuities, the size of
earthquakes, and the total geological offset registered along the trace of
active strike slip faults.
