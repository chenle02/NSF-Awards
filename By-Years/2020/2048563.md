Cryptography is a cornerstone of modern computer security and is ubiquitous on
the computer systems we depend on daily. However, there is a significant gap
between the theoretical guarantees provided by formalized security models, and
the reality present in deployed systems today. The central research goals of
this project are to perform an empirical study of cryptographic deployments on a
global scale and to develop a framework for experimental cryptographic security
research. This project develops and disseminates tools for measuring
cryptographic security, and will result in increased security for cryptographic
software and hardware in real use by detecting and eliminating flaws. Results
are published for the academic community as well as popularized for nonacademic
and industry audiences and incorporated into course
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project yields fundamental new insights and
deepens the understanding of cryptographic deployments in the real world. The
main activities include the refinement of existing methods and development of
new tools for collecting and processing large-scale cryptographic datasets. The
research also investigates the development of efficient algorithmic tools for
real-time cryptographic anomaly detection, improved methodology for tracing
vulnerabilities to implementations, advancements in the state of high-
performance computing for cryptanalysis, and the development of more precise
security models and requirements for cryptographic systems.
