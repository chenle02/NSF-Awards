Dissipation is generally a bad thing for quantum systems, robbing them of their
special quantum features of coherence, superposition, and entanglement, and
driving them to classical behavior. This project will endeavor to use
dissipation in quantum systems for positive benefit. The research will develop
techniques to use dissipation to remove unwanted energy, entropy, and randomness
from a quantum system while preserving the wanted quantum information. A matter
wave analogy to the field of quantum optics will be pursued, so that the
important features that arise from interaction of matter with light can be
replicated and perhaps expanded in a solely matter-based
system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research resides at the intersection of atomic
physics, quantum information science, and condensed matter physics. Developing
ways to engineer dissipation and understand and control open quantum systems
will be relevant to virtually any new technological applications built on
quantum mechanics, from a fully realized quantum computer to much more modest
applications such as sensors based on coherent quantum mechanical processes.
Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art science
in an environment that exposes them to a wide variety of physics and research in
both an academic and national lab setting.&lt;br/&gt;
