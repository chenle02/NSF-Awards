This research project is concerned with root finding for deficient polynomials.
A polynomial system is deficient if the number of isolated roots is less than
the total number of roots. The main tool for an effective solution is expected
to be the homotopy method which the PI has used successfully for non-deficient
systems. Roots of polynomial systems appear in many practical problems. Research
results from this project is expected to have an impact in all major branches of
science and engineering.
