w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623961 Glyde This is a joint experimental and
theoretical research program, focusing on the elementary excitations of liquid
helium in disordered environments and confined geometries. The aim is to
investigate the effect of disorder and confinement on the fundamental physics of
quantum fluids, with particular emphasis on superfluidity, Bose-Einstein
condensation and disorder-driven localization. The experimental part consists of
precision neutron scattering measurements on liquid helium in Vycor, aerogels
and xerogels. The theoretical part, in parallel, will determine accurate path-
integral Monte-Carlo simulations of realistic models of disordered liquid
helium. %%% This is a joint experimental and theoretical research program,
devoted to the study of quantum fluids in disordered environments. The goal is
to gain understanding of the effect of disorder on microscopic physical
phenomena relevant to materials science and technology. To this aim, the
simplest quantum fluid, namely liquid helium, will be investigated
experimentally in disordered systems such as Vycor, by means of precision
neutron scattering measurements; in parallel, state-of-the art computer
simulations on realistic models will be carried out. ***
