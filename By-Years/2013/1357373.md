Recent observations and climate model projections indicate that the global
oxygen inventory may be declining due to the lower solubility and the increasing
stratification associated with a warming climate. Decomposition of organic
matter in the deep sea consumes dissolved oxygen, which must be replenished by
the circulation of oxygen-rich waters from the polar regions. Without vigorous
oxygen supply from the high latitudes, the global oceans will lose oxygen.

In this study, researchers at Georgia Tech will use a hierarchy of models to
simulate oxygen and nutrient cycling in the Labrador Sea, one of the regions of
deep water formation in the North Atlantic, over a fifty year period. The
Labrador Sea is also a region of extreme seasonality and intense biological
productivity, thus oxygen cycling there likely reflects multiple physical and
biological processes. Results from this study will promote a better
understanding of the interannual variability of oxygen and nutrients in the
Labrador Sea, and ultimately contribute to knowledge on how a changing climate
impacts these cycles.

Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this project include student training,
international collaboration and outreach to K-12 students.
