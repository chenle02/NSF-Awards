Computational geometry is the branch of theoretical computer science devoted to
the design, analysis, and implementation of geometric algorithms and data
structures. Geometry is omnipresent: geometric problems arise naturally in any
computational field that simulates or interacts with the physical world. The
planned research focuses on the fundamental problem of clustering data by taking
a geometric viewpoint of the problem. The project will study what are the
geometric conditions that are required and sufficient to cluster the data, and
how to quickly check for these conditions, and cluster the data.

The problems to be studied in this project include: (i) sufficient conditions
for data to be clustered (i.e., traversed) using a few "centers", where a center
is either several points, or higher dimensional spaces such as lines (i.e.,
projective clustering). (ii) Approximating the number of centers needed to
cluster, and trying to improve the number of clusters needed. (iii) Coverage
problems â€“ can the data be covered by a few slabs/cylinders/etc.? Can such cover
be computed efficiently and quickly? (iv) Finding a small subset of the data
that can be clustered instead of the whole point set and, importantly, providing
a proof that no better clustering is possible with fewer centers. The project
aims to develop algorithms to compute such sets efficiently.
