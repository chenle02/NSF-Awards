Scientific research in all disciplines funded by the National Science Foundation
is producing increasing volumes of data, requiring correspondingly increased
resources for data storage and analysis. At the same time, requirements for
public access to data collected using federal funds are creating greater demands
for data repositories. Emerging research themes require access to an increasing
variety of data types. These trends, along with associated shifts in
expectations, are creating new challenges for the data
repository&lt;br/&gt;community in an increasingly uncertain funding environment.
This workshop will provide an opportunity for data repository leaders to: 1)
enhance their knowledge of sustainability planning, 2) exchange information
about how they currently address sustainability, and 3) learn tools and skills
to enhance the sustainability of their data collections. The process guide, a
key product of the workshop, will promote discussion and consideration of
sustainability issues and will serve as a resource for the data repository
community as a whole.
