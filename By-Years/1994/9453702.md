9453702 Lancaster Project Women in Computer Science (WCS) is a multi-faceted,
instructional and motivational program involving both university faculty and
corporate personnel to recruit additional women students to Bowling Green State
University's undergraduate computer science program. Project WCS offers several
instructional and motivational activities: 1) recruitment activities designed
specifically to encourage freshmen and sophomore college women to consider
computer science as a major, 2) a mentoring program which involves both faculty
and business representatives serving as mentors, 3) formal preparation for
cooperative education work assignments, and 4) workshops for computer science
faculty and business representatives on gender-related issues that impact
women's success in computer science programs and computing careers. The project
components are built upon current understanding of social, learning, and
teaching factors which facilitate the interest, motivation, and achievement of
women in science fields. Both computer science faculty and computing
professionals from business and industry will be actively involved in working
with the participants in a number of ways, including both academic and corporate
mentors for each participant. This integrated use of mentoring, cooperative
education, and university/corporate interaction to increase the participation of
women in the field is unique. A Corporate Advisory Board (state-wide) will be
directly involved with the project co-directors in all aspects of the project.
