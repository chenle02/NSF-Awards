Funding from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of the
National Science Foundation will enable Dr. Ken Feldman of the Chemistry
Department at the Pennsylvania State University to pursue the chemistry of
diazoparaquinone natural products. Naturally occurring molecules that feature a
diazoparaquinone function are quite rare and are among the few examples of
organic species that feature a molecule of nitrogen gas as a covalent
substituent. Several of these diazoparaquinone-containing species exhibit very
potent activity against a range of human cancers, and moreover appear to display
a cytotoxicity profile distinct from any other class of anticancer natural
products. These observations suggest a unique mechanism-of-action based upon the
unusual diazoparaquinone function. The total chemical syntheses of two
structurally complex and biologically potent members of this class of compounds
are planned. In addition, the design and synthesis of rationally designed
analogues of the natural products will be pursued. Together, the natural
products and the derived analogues will serve as probes to help elucidate the
details of the cytotoxicity mechanism-of-action. Preliminary results implicate
both a DNA-damaging sp2 radical and a DNA alkylating orthoquinonemethide
electrophile as plausible candidates for the lethal chemical functionality.
Successful prosecution of these research objectives may lead to new drug leads,
which in turn will impact favorably on the pharmaceutical enterprise in the
United States. In addition, this project will provide training for undergraduate
and graduate students, including historically underrepresented groups in the
sciences, such that these students will be ready to contribute to the scientific
enterprise in the United States.
