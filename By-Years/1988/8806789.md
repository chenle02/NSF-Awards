The objective of this research is the physics of moist convection as described
by a numerical model. The structure and evolution of cloud top mixing will be
explored along with a second objective, the relative importance of subsidence
and turbulent mixing within the cloud. The numerical simulations will be guided
by observations from various field experiments and some recent laboratory
results of mixing being pursued by Professor Robert Briedenthal.
