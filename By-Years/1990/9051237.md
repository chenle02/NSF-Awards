The laboratory components of the biology, marine biology, and oceanography
courses are being revised to shift the emphasis away from traditional
laboratories to one which requires the students to be active participants in an
ongoing research project in local estuaries. Pilot studies for this approach
were done at a summer institute for high school students. In order to involve
students in this long-term research project, sophisticated analytical equipment
is being incorporated into the project in order to analyze water samples and
field biological data rapidly and accurately. This project will provide the
students with hands-on research experiences in collection and analysis of data
which will ultimately provide an ecological baseline of the waters in the
region. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
