This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future
workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this
fellowship is entitled "Functional aspects of Dbl homology proteins as molecular
switches in cell signaling." Communication within a cell is vital for the
maintenance of normal cellular function. Studies being conducted are aimed at
deciphering the basic molecular aspects of function and regulation of a Dbl
homology protein, a vital component in cellular signaling. These studies are
aimed at determining the general mechanism of function using structural,
biochemical and cell-based approaches. &lt;br/&gt;
