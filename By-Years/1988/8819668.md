Lipoxygenases are iron-containing dioxygenases the catalyze the hydopeoxidation
of polyunsaturated lipids. This laboratory has obtained the first primary
sequence of lipoxygenase, the L-1 isozyme of soybean. It contains a 40 amino
acid sequence region which might contain the Fe- octahedral binding site whose
presence in the protein is supported by physical evidene. The sequence is highly
conserved in the other two major isozymes of soybeans. He now proposes to clone
and express the enzyme in E.coli in high amounts, to determine its three
dimensional structure by x-ray crystallography and to perform site-directed
mutagenesis of selected possibly key amino-acids in the enzyme's sequence. This
research will contribute to the ultimate understanding of structure function
relationship of the lipoxygenases and to a better preception of the role of the
various ligands in non-heme non-sulfur iron proteins. These are expecially
interesting enzymes because while catalyzing the same primary reaction, they
exhibit a great diversity in their enzymic behavior. Thus a wide range of
behavior remains to be explained by rather limited variations in structure. Dr.
Axelrod has had a long and distringuished career in enzymology and has been
responsible for much of our fundamental knowledge about plant lipoxygenases.
