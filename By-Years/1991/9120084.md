The aim of this research is to deduce how the genome specifies neuronal
connections by focussing on mutation that alter a particular identifiable
synapse in the adult Drosophila nervous system. The synapse is part of the giant
fiber escape system; it connects the giant fiber interneuron and the jump muscle
motoneuron. Mutations which alter the structure and/or function of the giant
fiber-jump muscle motoneuron connection may be identified by a combination of
behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods. One such mutation
defines the bendless (ben) gene which appears to play a key role late in the
formation of neuronal connections. It may be involved in the final recognition
events between a presynaptic neuron and its post-synaptic target. Dr. Tanouye
will conduct a detailed genetic and phenotypic analysis of ben to determine the
nature of its role in neuronal connectivity. He will then clone the ben gene,
determine if its product has amino acid homology to other known molecules, and
study the spatial and temporal pattern of its expression. The detailed genetic
and molecular description of how one particular synapse is formed may serve as a
model that gives insight into the general problem of neuronal connectivity.
