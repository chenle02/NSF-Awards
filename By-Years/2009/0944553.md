Over the past decade the USAP ships, RV/AS Gould and RV/IB Palmer, have used
hull-mounted acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCP) to routinely record
underway, along track velocity profiles beneath the ships. This has resulted in
a growing database of ADCP transects, especially in the region of the West
Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Combined with other hydrographic data (e.g. XBT/ XCTD
data, drifter tracks, some limited moorings) this current velocity data will be
used for further analysis of the physical circulation in this ecologically and
climatically sensitive region of the Southern Ocean. Processes including inter-
annual and spatial variability of WAP shelf-edge and cross-shelf transport, the
effects of tides, circulation controls upon sea-ice formation and associated
Antarctic ecosystems (e.g. krill) are some of the key circulation features that
may be more accurately inferred from these combined data sets.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will support the development of a graduate
student in descriptive physical oceanography, and introduce undergraduate
students to quantitative scientific analysis.
