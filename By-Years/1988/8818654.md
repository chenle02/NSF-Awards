Professor Rutledge, collaborating with Professor Williams of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, will participate in a thunderstorm experiment near
Darwin, Australia between November 1988 and February 1989. This award will allow
the two principal investigators to operate the MIT 5 cm radar and a network of
10 coronal point stations in the field. The joint operation of the MIT radar and
the NOAA TOGA (Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere) 5 cm radar will provide,
for the first time, Dual-Doppler observations in the tropics. The primary
objective of Professors Williams and Rutledge's research is to better understand
the dynamics and electrification oof deep tropical convection and mesoscale
weather systems and ccompare it with what we know of in the middle latitudes.
Since the field phase corresponds to the winter monsoon period in northern
Australia, this work will also allow a comparison of the behavior of lightning
between oceanic storms, prominent during monsoon onset, and continental storms,
prominent during monsoon breaks.
