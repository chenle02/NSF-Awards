9530314 King This project combines theory and experiment in a study of the
effects of free surfaces and triple junctions upon grain boundary structure,
properties and behavior. Traditional approaches to grain boundary properties
rely on models that are intrinsically infinite, and relatively little attention
has been paid to the effects associated with the non-infinite extent of real
interfaces. Calculations are made of the elastic fields of grain boundaries made
up of dislocation arrays in finite materials, taking into account surface
relaxation effects. The effects of free surfaces on the dislocations are
considered with a view towards understanding how dislocations are eliminated
from grain boundaries, resulting in changes of misorientation. These effects are
also studied in polycrystalline films using in-situ transmission electron
microscopy experiments which are compared to the calculations. The project
includes a study of the properties and behavior of triple junctions within
polycrystalline materials. For certain classes of materials, notably thin films,
triple junctions may fall into restricted symmetry classes in which the
anisotropy of the grain boundary energy exerts a controlling influence on the
morphology of the triple line. An attempt is made to demonstrate that these
triple junctions embody strain fields and excess elastic energies which depend
upon the misorientations of the grain boundaries in calculable ways. This
represents a new approach to triple line studies. %%% The overall thrust of this
project is to study how the terminations of grain boundaries affect their
properties and behavior. This is important in polycrystalline thin films used in
electronic applications and in the properties of nanocrystalline materials. ***
