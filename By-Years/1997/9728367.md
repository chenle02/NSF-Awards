9728367 Knipple Pheromone-based mating disruption has been used commercially for
about 15 years, and has been shown to be an effective, environmentally benign
approach to control several major lepidopteran pests, of which the most
economically significant is the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella). In
contrast to conventional insecticides, pheromones are nontoxic and highly
selective, and thus are well suited for use in conjunction with other IPM
techniques. Despite these advantages, pheromones have met with only limited
commercial success, owing largely to the high costs of their synthesis via
conventional chemistry. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to develop novel, low
cost biosynthetic process steps employing genetic technology for pheromone
synthesis. The specific focus of the proposed research is the unique acyl-CoA
desaturases present in the pheromone glands of adult lepidopteran females, which
catalyze the formation of key unsaturated pheromone intermediates. The
investigator will isolate and sequence cDNAs encoding fatty acid desaturases
from Pectinophora gossypiella (pink bollworm) that catalyze intermediate steps
in the biosynthesis of lepidopterin pheromones, characterize the substrate
specificity of these desaturases by expressing the desaturase genes in a
desaturase deficient mutant of S. cerevisiae and examining the spectrum of
substrate desaturation in vivo in this heterologous system, and construct hybrid
moth/yeast desaturases that have novel substrate specificities. ***
