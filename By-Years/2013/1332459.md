The Implementation Project entitled "Moving Forward - Steps to Graduate School"
at Le Moyne-Owen College builds on a very successful previous project and has
the overall goal to prepare minority undergraduate students with the skills and
knowledge required to succeed in graduate school, with the aim to have them
pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
fields. The objectives of the project are: increased research and publications
by students and faculty; faculty development; enhancement of the curriculum
through honors courses; and methods designed to motivate students to matriculate
in STEM majors. Activities focus on improvement of recruitment and retention
rates; enrichment of the academic preparation of students; broadening and
strengthening the undergraduate research program by improving the partnerships
and collaborations in research with other academic institutions; industry and
federal labs; and strengthening the faculty expertise as mentors and researchers
by encouraging collaborative research and publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le
Moyne-Owen College enrolls mostly African American students, over sixty percent
of whom are women. Most students come from disadvantaged socioeconomic
backgrounds. The outcomes of this project will serve as a model for other
minority-serving private institutions seeking to enhance STEM undergraduate
instruction and research programs leading to increased participation of students
in graduate school and subsequently the STEM workforce.
