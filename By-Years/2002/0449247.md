There is growing interest in creating the cyber infrastructure of tomorrow. The
various disciplines supported by NSF are rapidly moving forward with their plans
to define the cyber infrastructure for their disciplines. The Computing Research
Association and the International Society of the Learning Sciences propose to
host a series of workshops to explore where we are in the application of
pervasive computing power to education, and where we need to be. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The expected outcomes of this workshop series include both a snapshot
of current work and a map of where strategic investments can be made in creating
the learning environments of the future for education research and
applications.&lt;br/&gt;
