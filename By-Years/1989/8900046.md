Travel involved is a cooperative research program with Scotland will be
supported. Flow past a cylinder in a rotating reference frame is to be
investigated experimentally. The end of the cylinder is not perpendicular to the
rotation axis of the reference system, and complex flow patterns have been
theoretically predicted in this plane. The experiment is to verify the reality
of this theoretical prediction. The results have application to flow over
complex topography both in the atmosphere and oceans on the rotating earth.
