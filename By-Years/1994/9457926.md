9457926 DenBaars This research program is directed toward understanding and
developing novel metallo-organic chemical vapor deposition schemes for the
synthesis of III V nitride serniconductor films. The growth techniques of atomic
layer epitaxy and flow modulated epitaxy by metallo-organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) will be used to fabricate (aluminum, gallium, indium) nitride
heterostructure materials and devices. These novel approaches of MOCVD growth
are proposed in order to lower the growth temperature and increase the quality
of the films. Growth on a variety of substrates such as: sapphire, silicon
carbide, zinc and magnesium oxides, and the use of alternative precursors, such
as tertiary-butylamine, will be investigated to improve the optical and
electrical properties of the nitride films. %%% This research project involves
the fabrication of newly emerging nitride semiconductor materials and devices.
This material system has enormous commercial relevance since it is one of the
most promising materials for optoelectronic devices operating in the ultraviolet
to blue wavelengths. A laser diode fabricated with these materials will vastly
improve the optical storage density for CD ROMs and could conceivably enable
full color projection displays. An important feature of the program is the
training of graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and
technologically significant area of materials and processing research. This
research will contribute to improving the general perform ance and to the
realization of advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,
information processing, and tele communica tions. ***
