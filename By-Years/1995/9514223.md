In spite of the focus on information and service industries as the source of
economic growth in the US, the machining and tooling industries are still
vitally important to the economic well-being of the nation. This industry is in
somewhat of a crisis due to a shortage of trained workers. This award to the
University of Illinois will support the research of a cultural anthropologist to
assess and compare five educational programs in machine-tool technology in
western Pennsylvania. Two of the programs are innovative flexible attempts to
train students, and three are traditional public and apprenticeship programs.
The project will interview students, parents, teachers, counselors and machine-
tool company managers on their definitions of relevant skills and the personal
values which underlie their opinions. Using traditional ethnographic methods,
field experiments and experience sampling the project will assess the strengths
and weaknesses of the most prevalent forms of training for machine-tooling
employment. This research is important because the current societal interest in
apprenticeship and vocational training as an alternative to purely academic
programs assumes that we know how to train people for skilled blue-collar jobs.
This sort of basic research on the nature of values people have which underlie
their performance in diverse educational and vocational training experiences,
will be valuable to planners in assessing how to improve the strength of this
fundamental part of our economy.
