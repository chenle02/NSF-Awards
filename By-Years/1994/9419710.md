9419710 Madore This award provides partial funding for the 17th. Annual
Symposium, entitled "Carbon Partitioning and Source-Sink Interactions in
Plants," to be held January 19-21, 1995. It is organized by Professor Monica A.
Madore, Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, UCR, and Professor William J.
Lucas, Section of Plant Biology, Divison of Biological Sciences, University of
California, Davis. The objective of the 1995 Symposium is to bring together
scientists working in the area of carbon partitioning and plant source-sink
interactions, with the intention that the presentations, and the discussions
arising from them, will lead to a greater understanding of the cellular,
physiological, and genetic aspects of plant carbon metabolism. Speakers from
abroad and from other insititutions, including many young investigators who have
introduced innovative molecular approaches to the study of carbon partitioning,
will be invited to participate. Poster presentations will also be included in
the program. The presented papers, as well as poster abstracts, will be
published rapidly.
