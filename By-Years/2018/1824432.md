The gender wage gap (i.e., women receiving less than men for equivalent work) in
traditional labor markets has been attributed in part to a motherhood penalty
and to women having a preference of job flexibility. There is preliminary
evidence suggesting there is also a gender wage gap in the gig economy. If so,
it poses a puzzle to the extent that neither the motherhood penalty nor
flexibility preference explanations are readily applicable to the online gig
economy. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant research seeks to confirm
the existence of the gender wage gap in the online gig economy and explore a
potential supply side explanation: that the gap arises due to differences in job
application strategies between men and women resulting from differences in
expectations. If differences in expectations are responsible for the gap, a
possible solution is to provide bidders with accurate information. This project
will ascertain whether this is the case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gender differences
in job application strategies will be studied using proprietary data from a
major online labor market platform. Two differences in beliefs will be explored:
one arising from a difference in beliefs regarding expected wages or costs and
the other arising from a difference in the perceived uncertainty of expected
wages or costs. To identify which difference in beliefs is at work, the research
will combine results from a large-scale survey of labor market expectations with
an information experiment in which expectations will be systematically
manipulated. Overall, this project can provide insights on how information
policy may reduce or eliminate expectation biases and therefore narrow the
gender wage gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
