This proposal requests partial support for a FASEB Summer Research Conference on
Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements to be held at Saxtons River,
Vermont, July 28 - August 2, 1991. Recombination and genome rearrangements are
central to our understanding of inheritance and this conference is the only
regularly scheduled meeting in the United States that is exclusively devoted to
these topics. The meeting provides a crucial interface between scientists
interested in the mechanistic aspects of recombination and those interested in
more practical applications. The environment of this meeting will encourage
young scientists interested in these areas of research to interact with more
established investigators in an optimal way as well as allowing and encouraging
discussions between the established investigators.
