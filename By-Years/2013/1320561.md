The objectives of this project include the design of networked mobile robotic
sensor nodes, which are&lt;br/&gt;inspired by insects within the family
gerridae, that can monitor water quality in lakes and rivers, and
jump&lt;br/&gt;repeatedly to enhance communication capability to overcome the
effect of water on radio signal propagation.&lt;br/&gt;This work will also
develop energy efficient algorithms that carefully select sensor nodes to jump
to gain the&lt;br/&gt;benefit of longer distance communication while managing
the energy required to jump. The robotic sensor&lt;br/&gt;can harvest solar
energy in a outdoor environment to maintain long term performance. New methods
for&lt;br/&gt;sensor localization as the sensor floats within a lake or river
will be developed as well as efficient algorithms to collect sensor data and
deliver it to the cyber infrastructure that could be used for hydrology modeling
and prediction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research effort should
significantly enhance the capability of networked mobile
sensor&lt;br/&gt;systems for water quality monitoring in response to water
pollution or other environmental conditions. These&lt;br/&gt;concerns can be
from oil spills, issues of bacterial levels, or even detection of levels of
radiation from nuclear power plant disasters. This research should provide a
cost-effective approach for water quality monitoring that can protect health and
emergency management such as advising people to vacate areas of environmental
damage. Furthermore, new sensor technology should be developed that provides
enhanced opportunities for business and job opportunities to industries and
society and provides students with a platform to learn and understand all levels
of sensor development and operation.
