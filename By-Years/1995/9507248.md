This three-year award will support U.S.-France cooperative research in
theoretical computing and programming languages between research groups at the
University of Illinois and at INRIA (the French National Institute for Research
in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics). The U.S. investigators, Edward
Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz, propose to collaborate with Claude Kirchner and
Michael Rusinowitz at INRIA/Lorraine and with other researchers at the
University of Nancy and the French Center for Research in Informatics at Nancy.
Their research deals with problems in term rewriting and search techniques and
in solutions of constraint and search algorithms. The U.S. investigators bring
to this collaboration expertise in algorithms and equational reasoning. This is
complemented by the French investigators' expertise in programming languages,
constraint-based reasoning, and term rewriting techniques. The problems under
study have important applications in image processing, programming languages,
and automated deduction.
