Diablo Valley College is creating a digital modeling, analysis and fabrication
laboratory and developing its associated curriculum. The laboratory incorporates
digital design, fabrication, materials testing, sustainability and construction
in an environment available to all students on campus. This benefits all
students on campus. The project is producing a new degree in engineering
manufacturing and certificates in industrial design and digital fabrication.
These new programs support career pathways for technicians and transfer
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laboratory is building on existing
relationships with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo, San Jose State University and the University of California Berkeley. The
program also helps economic and workforce development in the region. Finally,
the program is addressing high school student misunderstandings about technical
manufacturing careers in an effort to increase the number of students who enter
the STEM workforce.
