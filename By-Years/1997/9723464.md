Sperry 9723464 The goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding of
the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants. The hypothesis is that the
ability of a plant to maintain open stomata and survive under drought conditions
will correspond to its ability to extract and transport soil water to the
foliage. The plant's potential for water extraction is determined by three
variables: 1) its susceptibility to xylem cavitation which eliminates plant
water transport, 2) its rooting density and distribution, 3) the soil type.
Experimental and theoretical analysis of these variables will determine the
range of drought stress over which water transport is possible. The "hydraulic
potential" of the plant will be compared with its actual water use to evaluate
the hypothesis. The research will be conducted on native shrubs of the Great
Basin valleys in west-central Utah. These plants experience a relatively wet
spring followed by a predictable and usually extreme summer drought. The nine
study species represent a spectrum of drought tolerance, differing widely in
their seasonal pattern of stomata! opening, vegetative phonology, and rooting
distribution.
