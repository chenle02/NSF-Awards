A new ultracentrifuge, a density gradient former, and a gradient fractionator
with ultraviolet monitor and strip chart recorder have been purchased and are
being used to prepare, fractionate and analyze plasmic, viral, bacterial, and
eukaryotic DNA, as well as to isolate chloroplast membrane systems, nuclei,
chromatin, and other subcellular components. Ultracentrifugation is being
incorporated as lecture- demonstrations in the introductory biology course,
where concepts such as semi-conservative replication are discussed. Significant
student contact with the instruments progress in stages through selected
intermediate level courses, and culminate in senior honors research projects for
some students. The university is contributing an amount equal to the award.
