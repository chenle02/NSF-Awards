This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
an automated instrument for rapid and specific detection of waterborne pathogens
in municipal water supplies using methods combining immunoassay with
electrochemistry. Although the disposable cartridges for this instrument could
be specified for nearly any pathogen of interest, this project will focus
primarily on the detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. C. parvum is a
threat to the nation's water supply, does not respond to common antibiotics and
resists water purification treatments.

The commercial application of this project will be on the monitoring of
drinking water supplies for pathogens. This would include testing of water at
the source, in distribution networks, and at bottling and packaging facilities.
The proposed device would eventually be adapted for emergency field use, for
home use by safety conscious consumers, and for medical, industrial,
recreational and combat purposes.
