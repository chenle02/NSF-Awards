The research suggests using Evanescent Wave Induced Fluorescence to measure the
adsorption from aqueous solution of polymer molecules onto solid surfaces. The
effect of polymer results will be applied to the adsorption of polymer molecules
onto colloid particles for the purpose of regulating their interaction. The
study will focus particularly on hydrophobically modified polymers adsorbing
onto hydrophobic surfaces, and the results should be applicable to a wide
variety of polymer colloid systems.
