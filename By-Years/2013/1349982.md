Biped humanoid robots hold the potential to perform human-like locomotion and
manipulation tasks in a variety of situations where either skilled humans are
unavailable or where environmental conditions prevent human intervention.
However, while bipedal motion maximizes maneuverability in tight workspaces, it
simultaneously reduces locomotion stability. To initiate a new direction of
ongoing research in legged robot motion control, this work will enable humanoid
robots to transform into tripeds or quadrupeds or, more generally, "SupraPeds".
To control the potentially numerous contact points on SupraPeds, we will also
develop a software system that implements generic multi-contact control for
arbitrary humanoids, which will enable autonomous balancing while satisfying
contact force constraints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This concept is intuitive to
humans as everyone has experienced the need for an extra hand or two to maintain
balance or navigate difficult terrain. The PIs will capitalize on this aspect to
communicate to high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, as
well as educators nationwide, through live and online courses and seminars. To
broaden the participation of under-represented groups, we will participate in a
Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program especially for community
colleges and minority-serving institutions. The results of the research will be
published in open-access conferences and journals whenever possible, and the
sensing and control software will be documented and published on public websites
as open-source code. The applications of the work will impact fields such as
search and rescue and scientific exploration.
