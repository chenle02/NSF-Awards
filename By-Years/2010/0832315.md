This proposal is for a provisional allocation of time on the Blue Waters
computer system, due to become operational in 2011, and for travel funds to
support technical coordination with the Blue Waters project team.

The project will use Blue Waters to conduct numerical experiments in quantum
chromodynamics. The simulations will be used to determine fundamental parameters
of the Standard Model of nuclear physics and will help to determine its range of
validity. They will also be used to calculate the masses, internal structure and
interactions of strongly interacting particles, including the masses of the up
and down quarks and the values of the weak transition couplings between quarks.
These are parameters in the Lagrangian that defines the Standard Model and
refinement of these parameters will allow the prediction of rare decays under
the Standard Model. The nature of the predictions of such decays can be
quantitatively compared with the signatures of such decays in high-energy
physics experiments. Physicists plan to use such comparisons to determine the
range of validity of the Standard Model. The combination of lattice-gauge
calculations such as these and experiments in facilities such as the Large
Hadron Collider and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider offer a way of probing for
new physics in the behavior of sub-atomic particles. The proposed simulations
will reduce the uncertainty in the masses of the light and heavy quarks to 1%
and contribute to a number of other questions in nuclear physics.

The project will provide a library of gauge configurations that will be made
available as a resource that will support research by many nuclear physicists,
domestically and internationally. It is anticipated that these configurations
will be used as input data for many doctoral theses and post-doctoral research
projects.
