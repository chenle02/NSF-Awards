This project is automating the diagnosis of faults in semiconductor
manufacturing equipment. Statistical methods indicate when a machine is
malfunctioning. The causes of malfunctions are then determined by a combination
of numerical simulation of the machine and rule-based inference. The method is
being tested on a vapor deposition furnace in the Berkeley Microfabrication
Laboratory.
