This project will elucidate the nature and basis of social interactions in a
model organism, the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. These normally single-
celled amoebas come together to form a multicellular fruiting body. Most
individuals in the fruiting body reproduce through formation of spores, but 20%
die to form a stalk that helps disperse the spores. There is both cooperation
and conflict over which cells get to become spores. This project will advance
understanding of what keeps this conflict from destroying cooperation. D.
discoideum is uniquely suitable as a model system to study cooperation and
conflict at the molecular level. Genome sequences of many individuals will be
analyzed to test the hypothesis that conflicts cause strong selection that molds
the molecular variation that underlies the diversity of living species.

Many molecular and genetic resources are available for D. discoideum, whose
genome includes many genes similar to human genes and is small enough for whole-
genome sequencing. The insights gained from this model system will help us
understand cooperation and conflict in obvious social animals such as bees,
wolves, and humans, and also in single-celled organisms, including many that
cause disease. D. discoideum thrives in the lab and has a short generation time,
creating diverse excellent opportunities for students at all levels to
participate in research-based learning. This project will provide educational
opportunities to high school students through direct collaboration with one high
school and development of materials for use by others, to grade school teachers,
and to university students through provision of web-accessible novel educational
materials. Dissemination of results will include articles for the lay public and
general scientific readership, as well as publications for teachers.
