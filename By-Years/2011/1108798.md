The goal of this project is to better understand the differences between radio
loud and radio quiet quasars. The project involves a three-fold approach to the
problem: 1) study of the demographics of radio-loud quasars (the evolution of
the radio-loud fraction with redshift and luminosity); 2) analysis of high-
ionization broad emission lines for comparison with differences in spectral
energy distributions, and 3) comparison of radio emission from quasars and
Galactic black hole binaries.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate
students, and public outreach via observatory open houses and as a volunteer in
a local elementary school. The grant will support a female graduate student's
PhD thesis.
