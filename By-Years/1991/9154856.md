The Museum of Science and Industry seeks to facilitate the establishment of a
network of Independent science clubs. Located in Chicago's south side, the
Museum operates an in-house science club which has over many years developed a
large investory of activities. The members themselves, drawn from a broad socio-
economic base, have contributed much of the content and character of this hands-
on program. Now, in response to chicago's pressing local need for strong equity
programming in science and technology education, the Museum proposes to
"package" this club such that local chapters can readily be sent up throughout
the city land region, especially in community centers, churches and Park
District recreation centers. The club "package" will include: Modules of
learning activities for various ages with supporting materials and equipment;
Museum-coordinated trips to research and industrial sites; gatherings at the
Museum; training of club facilitators; and adaptable organization format with an
accounting system; recruitment of volunteers as helpers and role models;
substantial help with fund-raising. NSF support is sought for the establishment
of the modules and system, and the Museum commits itself to on-going maintenance
and coordination of the network. The Science Club Network will draw extensively
on existing programs, community networks and support systems. The Museum has
already elicited many commitments of financial and other support for local
chapters.
