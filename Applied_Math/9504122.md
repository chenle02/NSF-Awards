DMS-9504122 Avellaneda This project covers two areas of current interest in
Applied Mathematics. The first part concerns problems in pattern formation
arising from hyperbolic conservation laws with random initial data. The
statistical properties of solutions, their probability distribution functions
and the complex patterns will be analyzed from a mathematical standpoint. These
problems arise in various settings in Statistical Physics, in turbulence
modeling and in Cosmology. The second part of this project is concerned with the
mathematical modeling of advanced composite materials with piezoelectric
constituents. The mathematical methods that will be brought to bear on these
problems include asymptotics for partial differential equations, including
homogenization theory, probability and numerical modeling.Polymer/piezoceramic
composites are ideal materials to construct high-performance sensors and
actuators that can be used in a variety of industrial and medical applications.
