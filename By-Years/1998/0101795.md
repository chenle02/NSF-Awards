The Design and Manufacturing Simulation Project (DMSP) is supporting systemic
reform through education, applied research, curriculum development and reform,
professional development, and dissemination. It is also providing a forum for
joint industry/education collaboration focused on identifying manufacturing and
simulation technologies critical to the success of the automotive industry
centered in the southeastern Michigan region. Curriculum work is addressing
mathematics, science and technology components essential to the lean
manufacturing enterprise and its virtual design and manufacturing simulation
activities. Expertise is being developed by engaging subject matter experts and
by providing workplace experiences for faculty, teachers and students from a
variety of diverse backgrounds. The DMSP is utilizing the Wisconsin
Instructional Design System (WIDS) to create educational modules designed to
enhance existing manufacturing programs and develop modules that focus on
industry-validated simulation competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMSP partners
include Mott, Macomb, Oakland, and Henry Ford Community Colleges, Central
Michigan University, General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler, Delphi Automotive,
Detroit Center Tool, Delmia, Mechanical Dynamics, and the Tech Prep consortiums
of Genesee, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne counties. This partnership
involves the Design and Manufacturing Alliance (DMA), an established partnership
between the four community colleges and several business/industry
representatives focused on design and manufacturing careers.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DMSP is enhancing existing Design/Drafting/CAD
Associate Degree programs by incorporating and using simulation to validate
design scenarios. In addition, the Manufacturing Simulation Technology -
Robotics program (NSF/ATE #9950052) is being modified to address the needs of
the virtual machining simulation industry. Curriculum deliverables include
modules that update existing design and manufacturing degrees for 21st century
industry and post-Associate degree or certificate programs that address
simulation competencies and software products. The goal is to supply the
automotive manufacturing industry with skilled workers capable of embracing
advanced design and simulation activities that support more efficient
development of automobiles. The DMSP seeks to increase the number of minority
and underrepresented candidates in the field and is marketing programs and
opportunities to schools, businesses, and parent/professional groups.
