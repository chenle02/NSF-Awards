Dr. Benz will investigate two main themes in computational astrophysics: the
modeling of stellar collisions and the simulation of hydrodynamical behavior in
supernova explosions. He will use a 3-D Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
computer code to extend previous work on stellar collisions and disruptions to
include encounters involving main sequence stars of unequal mass and compact
objects. The long range goal is to obtain cross- sections for merging, mass-loss
and binary formation for all possible stellar encounters. Knowledge of these
cross-sections is an essential ingredient for models of the evolution of
globular cluster cores and active galactic nuclei. The need for a better
understanding of hydrodynamical instabilities occurring in supernova explosions
has been demonstrated by the unexpected early detection of x-rays from SN1987A.
Dr. Benz will also study the subsonic flame propagation and off-center ignition
in type Ia supernova. Because SPH is a relatively new method to solve the
hydrodynamical equations, emphasis in this study is given to comparisons between
results from SPH and state-of-the-art finite difference methods. The various
tests envisioned go far beyond the usual simple shock tube problem and will deal
with complicated multidimensional flows. This should provide a better
understanding of the capabilities of SPH at a time when this method is becoming
increasingly popular.
