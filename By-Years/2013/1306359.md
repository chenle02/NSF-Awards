Part of the Standard Model of particle physics, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is
the fundamental theory of the strong interactions between quarks and gluons. The
phase structure of QCD is explored via ongoing experiments at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. In these experiments, the
strongly-interacting matter at high temperatures and densities that prevailed in
the first microseconds of the Universe can be recreated for a short moment in
the laboratory by colliding heavy atomic nuclei at high energies. This project
will advance the theoretical understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma by studying
the electromagnetic radiation and the heavy flavor hadrons used as penetrating
probes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion reactions. The results will be used to
improve our understanding of the relationship between the fundamental properties
of the strong interactions and the generation of the visible mass in the
Universe and the confinement of quarks and gluons into nucleons, the building
blocks of atomic nuclei.

The fundamental research conducted by graduate students and post-doctoral
associates is integrated with education and outreach activities involving
undergraduate and high-school students, including the continued and improved
operation of the Saturday Morning Physics program at Texas A&M University that
benefits high schools and the general public in Southeast-Central Texas.
