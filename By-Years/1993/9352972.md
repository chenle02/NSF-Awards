9352972 Berken St. Norbert College will initiate a three-week, residential,
Young Scholars project in mathematics for thirty students entering the eighth
grade from Native American tribes throughout the U.S. The hands-on activities
will focus on applications of mathematics to physics, biology, chemistry,
geology, and astronomy. Lectures and laboratory activities explore concepts that
are culturally relevant to the participants. Field trips to the Milwaukee Public
Museum, Discovery World, and the International Crane Foundation are also
featured. Ethics of science/career exploration activities and several follow-up
meetings complete the program. Students are then given the opportunity to
participate in several other national programs that are a natural extension of
the St. Norbert YSP. ***
