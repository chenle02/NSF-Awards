This project is testing and disseminating a software tool (WebLAB) that allows
remote students to access laboratory equipment using the Internet. It also is
developing a remotely accessible power grid laboratory that is compatible with
this tool. This combination enables distance-learning students to complete
laboratory exercises that would otherwise only be available to on-campus
students. WebLab is a versatile tool and would support other on-line
laboratories. The WebLab system and the associated laboratory are being
evaluated using student, instructor, and industrial surveys, on-line tests,
structured performance demonstrations, interviews, and observations in a job
setting. The methodology and the results of the evaluation are being
disseminated through mailings to industrial contacts and professional
organizations and through presentations at technical and educational meetings.
