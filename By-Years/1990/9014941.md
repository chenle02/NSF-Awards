Professor William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies of organic
chemical reactions both in the gas phase and in solution using a combination of
quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations. The
results of this theoretical research provide an important interpretation of
chemical reactivity at the fundamental molecular level of understanding.
Jorgensen employs ab initio molecular orbital calculations to provide energy
surfaces for reactions in the gas phase and potential functions that describe
solute-solvent interactions. The effect of solvation is then determined by
computing the free energy surfaces in solution. This involves Monte Carlo or
molecular dynamics simulations for the reacting systems plus about 300 solvent
molecules in a periodic cell. Finally, the reaction dynamics are studied by
trajectory calculations that are started in the transition state regions. These
computations provide detailed information on key issues including the reaction
mechanisms in the gas phase and in solution, the existence of intermediates, the
origin of solvent induced activation barriers, changes in solvation along
reaction paths, energy redistribution during reactions, and the dynamic role of
the solvent in determining reaction kinetics.
