Despite years of effort, the underlying structure of the Internet is still
largely opaque to networking researchers. This opaque structure is also a
barrier to ISP administrators trying to diagnose connectivity problems - when a
problem occurs, it can be difficult to identify the root cause if it is not in
the ISP's own network. In our view, the opaque structure is primarily due to the
lack of vantage points from which to measure the Internet: there are more than
100,000 uniquely routed prefixes, yet there are only a few hundred locations
from which one can launch probes. This project addresses this lack
of&lt;br/&gt;vantage points by developing techniques, using special types of
measurement packets, to simulate having a very much larger number of vantage
points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PI proposes to build these
techniques into a measurement tool, work with several ISPs to have them adopt
and deploy the tool, and also deploy it on an NSF and ISP supported testbed
called PlanetLab. Using the tool, a number of fundamental questions about the
Internet will be studied: How is the Internet evolving? Is the Internet
structure self-similar? What is the prevalence of asymmetric routing? Answers to
these questions are needed to understand the impact of proposed changes to the
Internet. The PI will also make the measurements publicly available.
