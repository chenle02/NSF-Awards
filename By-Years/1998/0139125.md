Washington State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) Site on materials characterization. Twelve students are recruited
nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a
recruitment focus in the Pacific Northwest region. Students participate in
research projects that utilize modern characterization techniques to understand
the relationships between processing, structure and properties of materials,
such as the effects of crystal grain orientation on the corrosion of metals and
the mechanical behavior of organic thin films. Students are grouped into
project-based teams, each project is designed to be finished during the summer
and requires team members to complete tasks in processing, structural
characterization or properties measurements. The summer research experience
culminates with a symposium where the students present the results of their
work.
