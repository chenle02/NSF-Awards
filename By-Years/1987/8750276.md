Siena College will undertake the development and implementation of a computer-
assisted instructional system in mathematics and physics with high-level
symbolic capabilities. The system will utilize a Micro VAX II with SMP, a
programmable symbol-manipulation program which will enable student users to
communicate with the computer at an algebraic level. Software development will
be carried out by Siena's Software Engineering class, under supervision of the
principal investigator and other involved faculty. The facility will be
integrated into the general physics and introductory mathematics courses, and
will be used secondarily by students in the advanced physics courses.
