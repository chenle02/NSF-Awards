Non-technical description:&lt;br/&gt;At temperatures near absolute zero,
superconductors conduct electricity without any resistance. This property is a
consequence of a particular interaction between electrons, which causes the
electrons to organize themselves into a collective state that renders them
immune to scattering. In nanoscale samples, the nature of this collective state
is fragile and can be manipulated by controlling the physical properties of the
samples and their environment. Using custom developed fabrication and
measurement techniques with unprecedented capabilities, this project aims to
design, manipulate and investigate collective quantum states of electrons in
superconducting nanowires. While serving to train students on cutting edge
nanofabrication and low-temperature measurement techniques, the research is
focused on creating a model system for a fundamental study of collective quantum
states of electrons that will bring about the possibilities of applications in
novel logic, sensing and quantum computing
technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description:&lt;br/&gt;The project
aims to tailor and tune the texture of the superconducting order parameter by
controlling the texture, the underlying potentials and the boundary conditions.
The research team has developed a dynamic stencil deposition and controlled
etching techniques, which are used to achieve precise control over the size and
physical texture of the nanowires, while graphene and topological insulator
materials provide a tunable electrostatic environment and a spin texture,
respectively. The tunability of this model system provides exciting
opportunities to address unanswered questions, but also to create new quantum
states of matter that have not been studied or even considered before, possibly
bringing about a paradigm shift in the study of quantum phase transitions. The
main goal is to create and control new quantum states, contribute to fundamental
understanding of quantum matter, and harness the quantum degrees of freedom for
a host of possible applications.
