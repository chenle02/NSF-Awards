9351029 Hoffman This project is establishing a sound generation and analysis
laboratory. A group of workstations provides non-science liberal arts majors in
the Physics of Music course with the means to sample and analyze sounds made by
a non-electronic musical instrument of their choice, followed by an attempt to
synthesize one or more tones made by that instrument using a sophisticated
computer synthesis program. The same workstations provide students in the speech
signal processing curriculum of the Electrical Engineering department with the
means to record short utterances and analyze them using Mathematica. The
presence of machines with sufficient power and graphics display capabilities to
run Mathematica significantly enhances the upper level offerings in the Physics
department, allowing capitalization on an innovative program in the Mathematics
department of teaching calculus by use of Mathematica. ***
