In many mammals, including human beings, similar mechanisms regulate
reproduction. The purpose of Dr. Carter's research is to examine the role of
social and endocrine factors in the regulation of male reproductive behavior.
Dr. Carter has selected a highly social, monogamous rodent, the prairie vole, as
a model system for analyzing the interaction of behavior and physiology as
determinants of reproduction. Voles are agricultural pests and are known for
dramatic fluctuations in their population levels. Dr. Carter will study prairie
voles in the laboratory, and also in nature to validate her research findings
under natural conditions. Of particular interest in these animals is the finding
that parents are capable of inhibiting the reproductive maturity of their
offspring. In addition, preliminary findings suggest that female voles can
induce hormonal changes in their male partners. These studies will contribute to
our knowledge of the role of behavior as a regulator of reproductive
endocrinology and also will extend our understanding of the basic mechanisms
through which hormones may act in the nervous system to influence behavior. In
addition, Dr. Carter's research will yield new information about the role of
social factors in population regulation in mammals. The results of these studies
will contribute information of fundamental importance in medicine, the
neurosciences, and ecology, and may eventually enhance our knowledge of factors
that inhibit reproduction in endangered species.
