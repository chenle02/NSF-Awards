9411715 Dutta This award will purchase a layered manufacturing machine which
will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment will be used
for Project MAXWELL, a research project in the area of discrete part design and
manufacturing. It aims at bringing together two of the latest developments, one
in design and the other in manufacturing, for the realization of efficient
structural and mechanical components. The practical goal of the project is the
verification of a methodology for the design and fabrication of parts that are
highly efficient in terms of reduced weight and increased structural
performance. The project is based on the homogenization design technique for
designing the shape and material composition of structures and structural
components based only on a description of loading conditions and packaging
requirements. Such designs often possess complex geometries and microstructures.
A layered manufacturing machine for the fabrication of such parts will be
acquired. Under project MAXWELL, structural parts will be designed (both for
form and materials composition), fabricated, and tested in an integrated manner.
