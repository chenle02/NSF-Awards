The National Science Foundation awards Gonzaga University ARI funds for the
renovation of research and training facilities in Hughes Hall. Erected in 1962,
Hughes Hall is home to the Department of Biology where six faculty members and
their students pursue investigations involving cell and molecular biology,
ecology, behavior, and physiology. Space, originally occupied by chemical
engineering, coupled with outdated infrastructure components, is deficient in
meeting the needs of Biology's research and training programs. Gonzaga has
embarked upon a five phase renovation plan to improve the sciences, including
this Phase two project to renovate research lab modules for biology. Poorly
designed space will be reconfigured to provide efficient use and flexibility,
consolidate spaces for operational productivity, and create dedicated research
modules. Plumbing for gas, distilled water, compressed air and acid waste will
be improved in addition to the installation of new fume hoods. Electrical,
electronic, and fiber optic distribution systems will be upgraded to meet
increasing equipment, computer and communications requirements. Laboratories
will also be modernized to meet ADA and life safety codes. Renovations will
allow the department to fully implement the incorporation of research as a means
of teaching and training undergraduates students in the biological sciences,
Individual and collaborative research will permit continuing application of a
lab-based curriculum and enhance the faculty -student interface, enabling the
department to better integrate research and education.
