This NSF award supports a planning workshop on Innovation in Medical Cyber-
Physical Systems. This activity arises from an interagency exploration of
emerging CPS research directions. The meeting will develop plans for further
assessment by the CPS community of biomedical research needs and opportunities.
The meeting and subsequent community-wide assessment are conducted in the
context of the interagency High Confidence Software and Systems Coordinating
Group.&lt;br/&gt;
