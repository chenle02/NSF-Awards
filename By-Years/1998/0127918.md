This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores the
feasibility of a novel and inexpensive synthesis, fabrication and processing
route for creating nanostructures at high rates. The approach specifically
targets synthesizing synthetic gecko pads. Geckos have the unusual ability to
adhere to surfaces with a dry nanostructure found on the pads of their feet.
These nanostructures are so flexible and numerous that stresses on the order of
one atmosphere result. This permits walking up walls and hanging upside down on
ceilings. Phase I and Phase II, if successful, will provide adhesive
manufacturers with synthetic gecko pads. The commercial applications of this
project include toys, clothing, and shoes, and any application that requires a
dry, self-cleaning adhesive.
