As the application of computers to the physical widens, there is an increasing
need for computers to deal with the physical attributes of objects, such as
their geometry. The relatively young field of Computational Geometry has made
impressive strides in providing an algorithmic foundation for the solution to
many geometric problems in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, and
many other application areas. This project undertakes in the design and analysis
of geometric algorithms in a of areas including Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay
triangulations, the computation of arrangements or parts thereof, and and
intersection problems. The robustness issue in geometric computing is also
addressed. The goal is to extend the current methods of computational geometry
to deal more effectively with problems in spaces of higher dimension (three or
more) and involving objects of higher algebraic complexity(curved, as opposed to
straight).
