The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on
enhancing the reliability, longevity, security, and trustworthiness of the
advanced metering infrastructure in smart grids. The integration of trustworthy
information technology in the power grid will facilitate effective and efficient
energy management in the presence of distributed generation with renewable
sources. This team's technology, employing hardware-oriented security and trust,
built-in self-test, and device authentication, can be applied to any industry
that employs VLSI/FPGA chips and faces security risks. For example, this
technology can be integrated into medical instrumentation in the health industry
and dash-board chips in vehicles in the auto industry to make them more secure,
reliable, and trustworthy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
earlier NSF funded research in the area of hardware-oriented security and
testing of digital/integrated circuits. Its application in smart meters
overcomes current meters problems by providing remote re-configurability to
accommodate current and future technology advancements and additional security.
While there are multiple smart meter manufacturers in the US, this project's
technology has a strong focus on hardware re-programmability (leading to
increased longevity and expandability), reliability, and security of the system.
Also, current smart meters are not easily updated as technology advances. The
proposed meters provide high security, based on special hardware based
techniques, and incorporate built-in self-test circuitry. Hardware-oriented
security is implemented using physical unclonable functions which provide
authentication and trust to the programmable chip and also establish the
authenticity of the smart meter. The meters can also detect the presence of
hardware Trojans, which can be implanted by untrusted manufacturers and
foundries abroad, to steal information or hamper the functionality of the
device.
