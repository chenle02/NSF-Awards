This award is funded by the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical
Sciences Directorate through the Special Projects mechanism. The Principle
Investigator is Mary Kirchhoff of the American Chemical Society. The overall
goal is to host a colloquium on Nov. 20th, 2019, that highlights the chemistry
breakthroughs enabled by the understanding of the periodic chart. The United
Nations' General Assembly has decreed 2019 as the International Year of the
Periodic Table (IYPT). This is the American Chemical Society's culminating
event. This event will engage ACS members and enhance public appreciation for
chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event will gather highly respected
chemists to present on overarching topics in areas of current public and
chemistry community interest, such as sustainable plastics, quantum computing,
and batteries. By tying these topics back to the history of the periodic chart
and linking them to the future research areas of chemistry, the broader
community (through web access), the local higher education community (by
invitation), and the general D.C. scientific community can be linked for this
celebratory event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
