ABSTRACT PI: Ryan PROPOSAL NUMBER: 9641522 Females often base their choice of
mates on conspicuous traits borne by males. Studies in a variety of taxa show
that females attend to acoustic, visual, or chemical cues when evaluating mates.
Although males can possess suites of traits that influence their attractiveness
to females, most studies, however, examine female preferences for single traits.
This leaves unresolved the issue as to what role female preferences play in
maintaining suites of traits. Do female s exert preferences that determine the
extent to which male traits are correlated? Or, alternatively, do females prefer
a single or perhaps a few male traits, and the resultant constellation of traits
is due to various factors that constrain the presence of male traits? For
example, if female were to prefer longer males with no attention to overall body
mass, this preference would result in them mating preferentially with longer and
heavier males since body length and body mass are usually correlated. It has
been difficult to ascertain female preferences for multiple traits in the visual
domain because technology has not been available to easily animate and morph
traits from one male onto another. We will utilize recent advances in video
technology that will allow us to determine the role of female preferences in
explaining the degree of correlation of male body sexes, sword length, and
complex courtship behavior in three species of swordtail fishes. These studies
promise to provide insights into the general question as to how and why the
sexes differ as they do
