This project is concerned with the introduction of engineering and technology
into the liberal art curricula at the undergraduate level. It is intended that
liberal arts faculty members as well as engineering and technology faculty
members be involved from the inception of the project. A key workshop is
organized to study current efforts and concentrate on recommendations for future
efforts. The agenda includes issues in engineering and technology for liberal
arts majors, discussions of mechanisms to attract a critical core of faculty and
identify evaluation and measurement techniques and processes. Each participant
in the workshop is expected to discuss their experiences, insights and
recommendations for enhancing the technological literacy of liberal arts majors.
A proceedings which summarizes the major aspects of the workshop is developed
and distributed. A project plan for a full study of technological literacy for
liberal arts majors is generated.
