The investigators in multidisciplinary collaborative project are examining the
Tertiary exhumation history of the Colorado Plateau and adjacent southern Rocky
Mountains. The goals of this work are to understand the thermal history of rocks
of the Colorado Plateau region, and how these rocks came to be at near-surface
levels. Together with simple calculations of how the Colorado Plateau landscape
has been eroded, the thermal history of the rocks is being used to constrain the
surface uplift history of the Colorado Plateau. This project relies on rock
exhumation recorded in the thermal and geologic history of the Colorado Plateau
region. The thermal history is reconstructed from two techniques that record the
low-temperature (less than 110 deg C) cooling of rocks, fission-track annealing
and the relative abundance of uranium, thorium, and helium inside minerals such
as apatite. The project involves creating a Geographic Information Systems
database (to be shared with the scientific community) of the rock exhumation and
erosion data. These data are used in a preliminary modeling effort to study the
implications of our data for the uplift history of the Colorado Plateau and
southern Rocky Mountains. This research is providing new products that may be
used in educational displays at National Parks across the Colorado Plateau.
