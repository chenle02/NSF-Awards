A coordinated, interdisciplinary program of experimental research and analysis
for the development of a smart, computer controlled optical sensor for
processor-controlled applications is proposed. Spatially resolved measurements
of temperature and gas composition in process streams are made, using multiple
line-of- sight infrared absorption measurements and tomographic inversion
schemes. The research aims at progress in the area of suitable inversion
methods, their adaptation to vector parallel processing, signal-to-noise
improvement and system integration for adaptive control. Such an on-line
adaptive control would allow for the practical automatic optimization of
powerplant operation in conformity with maximum allowed pollutant levels. Since
the regulatory constraints on this optimization are independent of the choice of
fuel or combustor, the algorithm will be able to search for an optimum figure of
merit, regardless of the grade of coal delivered to the plant. In other words,
the process is not prededicated to a certain type of combustion; it is truly
adaptive. The expected savings in coal consumption would have large economic
proportions.
