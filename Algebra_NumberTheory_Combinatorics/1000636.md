This work concerns some problems in the theory of automorphic forms. The PI
proposes a study of the period integrals of automorphic forms through two
approaches. One is through developing the relative trace formula, the other is
using a period transference principle based on the Rankin-Selberg method and the
explicit realization of Langlands functoriality.

This research is in the area of number theory. Number theory has its historical
roots in the study of natural numbers. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics. Within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems
