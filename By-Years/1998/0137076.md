The symposium will explore the role of law in changes taking place in both post-
industrial and industrializing Pacific Rim nations. Papers will be presented at
the symposium focusing on cultural, social and economic issues that affect the
development of legal institutions and legal doctrine throughout the region. The
trend towards globalization stretches the significance of these issues beyond
the borders of individual Pacific Rim countries. "External" popular culture as
well as legal culture comes on the heels of expanded free trade, but existing
local cultures resist simple transplantation. Many Pacific Rim nations, whether
highly developed or not, are in the midst of important struggles over the place
of legal institutions and legality in their responses to globalization. This
award supports travel and expenses for approximately twelve scholars from
Pacific-Rim nations such as The Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China,
Vietnam, and Thailand to join with social scientists from Japan, Korea, the
United States and Canada. The symposium will be held prior to the 2002 annual
meeting of the Law and Society Association in Vancouver.
