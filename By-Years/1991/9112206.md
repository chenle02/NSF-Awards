Equipment will be purchased and dedicated initially to the development of
advanced superplastic materials. The program will be interdisciplinary in
nature, involving collaboration amongst faculty and students in the Departments
of Mechanical Engineering, Physics and Aerospace Engineering. After gaining
experience through this program, the equipment will be utilized for the
development of and fundamental studies on other classes of materials which can
be processed using similar principles. The major items of equipment requested in
this proposal are an attritor, a glove box, a set of microfine sieves and a
shaker and, a blade cutting mill. The investigators involved already have
equipment for melt spinning, hot isostatic pressing and superplastic testing.
They also have access to extensive material characterization facilities. These
equipment and facilities will be used along with the requested equipment to
develop new superplastic materials as detailed in the project description of
this proposal.
