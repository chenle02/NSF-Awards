Scharlemann will apply new 3-manifold techniques arising from the theory of
sutured manifolds and graph-theoretic combinatorics to a variety of open
problems in knot and link theory, including the additivity of unknotting number
and thecabling conjecture. His students will work on related problems. The
topological classification of surfaces is a classical matter, depending
basically on how many holes they have. The corresponding problem in one higher
dimension is vastly more complicated and an active subject of current research
by numerous geometric topologists, including Scharlemann and his students.
