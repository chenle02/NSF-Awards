This award supports the North Carolina SuperQuest competition for 1991. The
objective of the competition is to introduce computational science into the
classroom at all educational levels and to encourage more student interest in
studies and careers in science, engineering and mathematics. All of the high
schools in North Carolina were invited to enter the competition. The competing
teams will consist of four students and two teachers. The subject matter will be
a scientifically sound and computationally challenging problem that they can
solve using the supercomputing resources at the North Carolina Supercomputing
Center (NCSC). There will be five winning teams. These teams will attend a 2 and
1/2 week summer institute at NCSC in June, 1991. During the Summer Institute the
20 students and 10 teachers will be trained to use the NCSC supercomputing
resources and graphics workstations available at NCSC to design a computational
solution to the problem they have proposed.
