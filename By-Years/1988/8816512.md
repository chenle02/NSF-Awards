This award will provide one-half of the funds required to purchase a system for
fission track dating to be installed and operated in the Department of
Geological Sciences the University of Washington. The University of Washington
is committed to providing the other half of the funds required. Fission track
dating offers a relatively inexpensive optical microscope method for determining
the cooling age of uranium- bearing minerals and is useful in reconstructions of
volcanic history and the development of ancient sedimentary basins containing
volcanic rocks.
