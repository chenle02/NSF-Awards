9408247 Kishi The focus of this research will involve seven parts. The total
synthesis and investigation of conformational changes of palytoxin, the
conformational analysis of C- and O-glycosides, the conformational analysis of
fatty acids and their derivatives, the structure elucidation and synthesis of
AAL toxins and Fumonisins, the study of Ni(II)/Cr(II) mediated coupling
reactions, the development of tripodal ligand chemistry and studies involving
bioluminescence chemistry will all be carried out. %%% With this renewal award,
the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research of Dr. Yoshito Kishi of the
Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. Professor Kishi will focus his
work on synthetic and conformational studies of complex biomolecules. ***
