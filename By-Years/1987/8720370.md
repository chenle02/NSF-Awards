The research activity is the development, and use in physics measurements, of a
particle detector system for the DO intersection region of the proton-antiproton
collider at Fermilab. This detector system, called the DO detector, is expected
to be one of the most important instruments for elementary particle physics
research during the next decade. The DO detector will be used to measure the
properties of the "weak bosons", carriers of the weak nuclear force; study the
properties of the strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics); and search for
yet undiscovered phenomena. The field of research is that of experimental
elementary particle physics. This research studies the basic building blocks of
matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, and weak bosons) at very high
energies. The experiments use accelerators (colliders) which provide the highest
energy particles made in the laboratory. The data is collected and analyzed
using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and techniques.
