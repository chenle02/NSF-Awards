This cooperative project will study semifluorinated n-alkane polymers to
elucidate their solid state structure, the nature of structural transitions that
are observed below their melting temperature, and their propensity to form
liquid crystalline mesophases when dissolved in appropriate solvents. The
objective of this research effort is to gain a better understanding of the
behavior of fluorinated polymers, a class of materials that has important
industrial applications, for example, as heat-resistant electrical insulators.
The approach being taken here is fundamental. The packing of the molecules and
other molecular and supermolecular characteristics will be calculated. The
properties of relatively short molecules which will serve as models for the long
polymeric chains will be determined. The predicted findings will then be checked
with a battery of sophisticated instrumental methods.
