Water-soluble polymers are among the most widely used coatings for preventing
and controlling biofouling and biocompatibility in aqueous media. However, a
unique class of such materials, which exhibit thermally driven phase
transitions, offers the unprecedented ability to manipulate interfacial
properties on demand with a temperature switch. This research focuses on the
design of "smart" biomaterial coatings based on one of the most widely used
temperature sensitive polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). The
specific objectives of this research are: (1) characterize the properties and
phase behavior of PNIPAM films by employing direct molecular force measurements,
light scattering, and spectroscopy, and (2) to define molecular level design
rules for thermally responsive coatings with defined properties. The technical
significance of this work lies in this unique approach to defining engineering
design rules for biomaterial coatings. The potential uses of PNIPAM range from
drug delivery coatings to chromatographic supports. These studies will therefore
have broad impact in a number of areas of biotechnology. Furthermore, PNIPAM is
one of a larger class of water-soluble polymers that exhibit similar phase
behavior. Finally, this research will support the training of students from
underrepresented groups in science and engineering.
