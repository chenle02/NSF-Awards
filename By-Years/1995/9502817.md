9502817 Vernekar The objective of this project is to investigate various
aspects of the behavior of the Indian monsoon. The principal investigator will
develop a regional model which is appropriate for testing hypotheses concerning
mechanisms governing the onset of the monsoon, the northward propagation of the
onset over the Indian subcontinent, monsoon break periods, and monsoon
withdrawal. Towards this end, the principal investigator already has
successfully linked the National Meteorological Center's (NMC) eta model to the
global general circulation model to simulate monsoon behavior. The eta model is
used primarily for short-range predictions and simulates a number of physical
processes including the physics of the boundary layer, the diurnal cycle,
radiation interactions with clouds, and convection. The surface physics module,
currently a simple slab energy and bucket hydrology model, will be replaced with
a state-of-the-art biosphere model. This biosphere model should provide more
realistic representations of the hydrologic cycle as governed by soil moisture
and vegetation. Once implemented, the coupled model's simulated surface fluxes
will be compared with observations. The coupled model will then be used to
simulate the monsoon from the beginning of May to the end of September. To
assess the ability of the model to simulate the space-time variability of the
monsoon, the time- averaged fields as well as the transient characteristics
produced will be compared with those from observation. Finally, the various
hypotheses of monsoon behavior will be tested with the coupled model. ***
