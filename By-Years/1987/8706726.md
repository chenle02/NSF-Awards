The main theme of this project, in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
program, is the study of how energy is distributed within molecules and the
influence of that distribution on chemical reactivity. This research is
fundamental in nature, but its significance lies in its potential to increase
our ability to control the course of chemical reactions to achieve specific
products. The study encompasses three topics. In the first, compound state
resonances will be studied to determine whether energy can be localized in
particular molecular motions and if so, how unimolecular rate constants are
affected; calculations will be performed on energy flow following excitation
into a local mode. The second part involves calculations on complex polyatomic
systems for which analytic potential energy surfaces must be derived; reaction
dynamics will be followed on these surfaces. Finally, different theoretical
methods will be studied and assessed for their accuracy in describing compound
state resonance positions and widths; particularly important will be an
assessment of the accuracy of transition-state theory for ion-molecule
reactions.
