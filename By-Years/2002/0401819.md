0401819&lt;br/&gt;Weingartner&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Alaska
Fairbanks provides support for the acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation
to be used on R/V Alpha Helix, a 132' research vessel operated by the
university's Seward Marine Center as part of the University-National
Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Specifically, support is
recommended to acquire a digital delay-pulse generator, tools for fiber optic
cable diagnostics and splicing, network switches, a fluorometer, and a pure
water maker. All of these items are intended for shared-use operation. These
acquisitions should provide a substantial advantage to marine scientists using
R/V Alpha Helix in their research during 2004 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
