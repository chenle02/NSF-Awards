The proposed state-of-the-art testing equipment will be used to significantly
augment the flexibility and capability of a long- term research program aimed at
providing a fundamental understanding of freshwater and sea ice physical
properties, deformation processes, and mechanical properties. This engineering
knowledge is required in the design of structures to resist floating ice sheet
impact, the transport and traffic of vehicles on natural ice covers, and the
promotion of ice penetration and ice breaking. The equipment will provide means
of testing for thorough characterizations of ice microstructure, accurate
specimen preparation, and data acquisition/reduction directed toward theoretical
analyses.
