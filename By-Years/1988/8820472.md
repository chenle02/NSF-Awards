This research is an experimental study of buoyancy driven fluid motion and
mixing in liquid-gas bubble columns. Local fluid velocities would be measured
using hot film anomometry, and local gas volume fractions would be measured
using a conductivity probe. These measurements would be compared to a time-
averaged theory for the fluid motion. Additional measurements of liquid solute
dispersion would be made. Bubble columns are industrially important gas-liquid
contacting devices. Better understanding of the fluid motion in these devices
should lead to improved design of absorbers, strippers, or fermenters involving
gas-liquid contacting.
