A new undergraduate program in civil engineering systems (CES) has been
instituted as a means of equipping the civil engineering student to deal with
the broader aspects of the profession. The CES program emphasizes the complex
nature of civil engineering problems. This project completes the curriculum
development with a new course in Structural Systems and the integration of
computer-aided design (CAD) concepts into the curriculum. The objective of the
course in structural systems is for the student to understand the
structural/construction phase as a true system. A new CAD course is an integral
part of the CES curriculum. The CES curriculum is a significant departure from
conventional civil engineering education, but one which the engineer of the next
century will need to understand. Matching funds commited by the institution are
more than three-fourths of the amount of NSF funds for this project.
