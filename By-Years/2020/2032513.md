Until a vaccine is developed, behavior change is the only way to stem the
transmission of COVID-19 and safely resume economic activities. Social norms –
aggregate behaviors, private preferences, judgments of behaviors, etc. – affect
individuals' likelihood of adopting behavior change and must be understood in
order to model effectively the impact of behavior-based interventions on disease
transmission. This project investigates how community norms and normative
pressures, in conjunction with population demographic composition, government
policies, and information that people receive, determine behaviors targeted by
COVID-19 health interventions. The results of the research will be disseminated
quickly and broadly to facilitate efforts to stem disease transmission. The
research trains a U.S. based graduate student and undergraduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study evaluates two causal relationships: 1) how
government policies and individual traits (e.g., socio-economic position,
personality) cause an individual to adopt a behavior (e.g., interpersonal
distance, mask wearing); and 2) how aggregate patterns at the community level
cause differences in transmission patterns. Surveys will be administered in five
populations, one rural with limited exposure, and four urban with differences in
the control measures that have been implemented. The researchers will collect
longitudinal and time-series cross-sectional survey data to document 1) how
people make interpersonal interaction and personal hygiene behavioral decisions;
2) how interpersonal interaction and personal hygiene norms change in each
community during the pandemic; and 3) how the prevailing norms and shifts in
those norms impact COVID-19 transmission patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
