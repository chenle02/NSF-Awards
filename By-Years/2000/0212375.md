In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of
Materials Research, Nelson will conduct research in time resolved optical
spectroscopy and coherent optical control of condensed matter systems. The
complex dynamics of disordered and partially disordered materials will be
studied over time scales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds. Supercooled
glass-forming liquids and ferroelectric crystals, both of which exhibit complex
dynamical behavior that changes sharply as a function of temperature, will be
investigated. Novel methods for far-infrared, or terahertz (THz) frequency
spectroscopy, as well as automated methods for spatiotemporal femtosecond pulse
shaping will be exploited for generating intense, focused THz beams with field
levels exceeding 2 MV/cm.

This research is concerned with the complex dynamical behavior of condensed
matter, mainly solids, ferroelectric media and supercooled liquids. Novel high
frequency infrared methods, including terahertz echoes will be developed. The
work has the potential of leading to practical devices. Students and
postdoctoral research associates participate in this research. Nelson will also
conduct an ambitious outreach program to bring research experiences in physical
chemistry/chemical physics to secondary school students
