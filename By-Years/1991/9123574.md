9123574 Hermans' This project will create a workstation cluster in the Molecular
Modeling Laboratory that will be used for studies of structure and function of
biological macromolecules as well as for other biological studies. The
workstations will also be available for students to use in classes and
workshops. The workstation cluster will be employed principally by investigators
who use quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics in understanding molecular
structures and biological activity. Examples of such areas include physical
chemistry of ionic interactions and of phospholipid membranes, problems of
folding and conformational stability of proteins and peptides, and interaction
of small molecules and proteins with nucleic acids.
