Gravity, the most evident force of nature, is in fact the weakest of the
fundamental forces, and consequently the most poorly tested. Einstein's general
relativity, which is currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally
incompatible with quantum mechanics. It is therefore imperative that we subject
gravity to the most stringent tests available. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in
which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off reflectors
placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades
produced some of the leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar
orbit to high precision. Since 2006, an experiment called APOLLO (the Apache
Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has been collecting the best
LLR data in the world, in terms of both data volume and precision. In 2016, an
upgrade allowed APOLLO to guarantee accuracy at the millimeter level - the first
time this capability has existed anywhere. This project will capitalize on this
new capability. Besides its fundamental impact to all areas of cosmology, this
project has a strong footprint in training students and in communicating the
excitement of science to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort seeks to
collect the first-ever set of millimeter-accurate LLR data using APOLLO. Besides
continuing to collect the most accurate LLR data ever obtained, this involves
developing techniques to calibrate APOLLO range data against the newly-installed
absolute calibration system and to characterize APOLLO performance and
systematic errors. Additionally, site geodetic measurements will be collected by
an on-site superconducting gravimeter and a nearby global positioning system
station, incorporating these data into the LLR analysis in order to constrain
motion of the ground.
