A central question in biology is the regulation of the expression of cellular
genes by the environmental signals a cell receives. This signal-response process
is the basis for many biological functions including cell differentiation, cell
proliferation as well as the formation of long term memory. A recent advancement
in the understanding of this signal-response process is the recognition that
activators of the cyclic AMP- dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C can
regulate gene expression. Because protein kinases are in general regulated by
second messengers, which are synthesized in response to environmental signals,
the demonstration of a connection between protein kinases and gene expression
provides clues to a better understanding of this signal-response process. The
goal of this proposal is to understand in particular the role of a tyrosine-
specific protein kinase in the regulation of gene expression. A system has been
developed using temperature sensitive mutants of the v-abl tyrosine kinase to
examine the mechanism of regulation of gene expression. A strategy has been out
to clone genes that are regulated by the v-abl tyrosine kinase, and we have
identified at least one cellular gene whose expression can be induced by the
v-abl tyrosone kinase. Experiments will be performed to determines the site of
action of the v-abl tyrosine kinase and to elucidate the pathway linking this
kinase to the expression of cellular genes. This research will shed light on the
mechanism by which the v-abl tyrosine kinase regulates gene expression and it
will contribute to the understanding of a central biological signal-response
process.
