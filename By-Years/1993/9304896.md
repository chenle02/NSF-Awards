9304896 Sereno By the end of the Triassic Period, a major transition in
terrestrial vertebrate communities had occurred with the replacement of
therapsid-dominated faunas by dinosaur-dominated faunas that would persist until
the end of the Mesozoic. Fossiliferous deposits in northwestern Argentina
provide a unique opportunity to study this faunal transition at a fine
stratigraphic scale within a radiometrically dated framework. In this study PI
will oversee preparation of the complete skeleton of the important new early
dinosaur, Eoraptor lunensis, and also generate more radiometric dates of the
enclosing strata of this dinosaur. This work will shed light on an important
point in tetrapod evolution.
