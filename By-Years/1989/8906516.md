The goal of this research is to investigate the applicability of autoepistemic
Logic to formalization of various forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. Recent work
in this area shows that nonmonotonic formalisms such as circumscription, default
logic, and the negation as failure rule can be expressed in autoepistemic logic.
Moreover, the corresponding autoepistemic formalisms seem to be more natural and
elegent. To make the autoepistemic logic a practical tool for constructing
knowledgebased systems the researchers will further investigate its expressive
power and seek specialized efficient inference mechanisms. The work will focus
on two domains in which nonmonotonic reasoning is frequently used: inheritance
hierarchies with exceptions and reasoning about actions and time.
