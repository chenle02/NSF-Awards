Presently optical-lattice systems holding ultracold-temperature atoms may
already be tuned experimentally so that they may behave either classically or
quantum mechanically. In this work such systems are studied theoretically. For
instance, it will be shown that the very act of monitoring the atoms may cause
them to behave classically. The goal is to turn such observations into
quantitative methods to analyze and engineer nanoscale devices that operate at
the crossover between quantum mechanics and classical
mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research topics from this work are incorporated
into both graduate and undergraduate courses and specialist scientists are
trained, so that the project will contribute to the development of high-
technology workforce. Scientifically, the project should help to build the basis
for future nanotechnology.
