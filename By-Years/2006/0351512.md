The Louisville seamount chain is one of the best places to test hypotheses
related to the eruptive history of a major hotspot chain and motion of a hotspot
plume. The project will acquire geophysical data and geologic samples from the
Louisville chain to answer fundamental questions about the relative motion of
the Pacific plate and Louisville hotspot plume over the past 80 M.y. The
acquired data will also serve to define drilling targets for a possible IODP
program in the future. The researchers plan to dredge seafloor rocks, conduct
extensive total-field and three-component magnetic surveys, use multibeam and
Chirp techniques to map the seafloor, and apply high-resolution seismic methods
to image the subseafloor during an oceanographic cruise along 2900 km of the
Louisville chain, and, along with collaborators, they will conduct chemical and
geochronologic analyses on rocks from 25 sites. They will also compare their
results with data from the better-studied Hawaiian chain.
