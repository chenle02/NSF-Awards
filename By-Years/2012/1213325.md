In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry
Program of the Chemistry Division, Ned B. Bowden of the University of Iowa will
explore the synthesis of polymers containing the sulfenamide and the
diaminodisulfide repeat unit, congeners of polythiazyl. The approach is to
prepare cyclic sulfonamides and then investigate the fundamental chemistry of
their ring-opening polymerization; to develop methods for the step-growth
polymerization of secondary amines and disulfur transfer reagents into
polydiaminodisulfides; and finally to synthesize and characterize semiconducting
polymers based on polysulfenamides and polydiaminodisulfides. The broader
impacts involve visiting local schools to present chemistry demonstrations,
hosting a booth at the Iowa State Fair to present chemical research innovations
to the general public, a monthly newspaper column to communicate science to the
general public, training graduate and undergraduate students, and broadly
disseminating research results in a variety of
formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are
found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural
materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight
electronic devices. This research will explore new approaches to include sulfur
and nitrogen atoms within the polymer chain, which can impact properties ranging
from electrical conductivity to susceptibility to water hydrolysis. The results
of the studies could facilitate access to high performing organic electronic or
light-emitting devices as well as environmentally responsive materials.
