Building on recent work on mock theta functions and mock modular forms, the PI
proposes an ambitious program to investigate the interplay between mock modular
forms and the theory of L-functions, elliptic curves, and representation theory.
The PI will also aim to generalize the theory of harmonic Maass forms to seek
explicit constructions of Maass cusp forms. The PI has had success in the
related problem of explicitly computing harmonic forms. New results in these
areas should have implications for the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, the
arithmetic of critical values of L-functions, Donaldson invariants, and integer
partitions.

This research in number theory has the potential for far reaching real world
applications. Number theory plays a central role in cryptography, internet
security, and the infrastructure of emerging electronic markets. Further
theoretical advances in the proposed research will also have implications in
theoretic physics (string theory), and probability theory (e.g. tumor modelling
via special cellular automata).
