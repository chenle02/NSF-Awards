DMS-0401953&lt;br/&gt;Ezra Getzler and Eric Zaslow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award supports a conference at Northwestern University on the mathematics
&lt;br/&gt;surrounding the theory of branes, in the context of the Emphasis Year
on &lt;br/&gt;Geometric and Topological Methods in String Theory at Northwestern
University.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the award also supports a series of mini-
workshops and seminars to&lt;br/&gt;be held before the conference, which is
particularly directed at students and &lt;br/&gt;post-docs. This conference will
foster a mutually beneficial interaction between&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians and
physicists. In addition, the activities are expected to play a &lt;br/&gt;role
in advertising potential applications of these emerging methods elsewhere in
&lt;br/&gt;geometry and topology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric and homotopy-
theoretic methods have proved of increasing&lt;br/&gt;importance to the study of
string theory and associated areas of&lt;br/&gt;physics in the last few years:
we may mention Fukaya and Kontsevich's&lt;br/&gt;introduction of A1-categories
and the role of manifolds of G2-holonomy&lt;br/&gt;as just two examples. The
flow of ideas has gone in the other direction&lt;br/&gt;as well. For example,
string duality has suggested new directions of&lt;br/&gt;research on derived
categories of algebraic varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
