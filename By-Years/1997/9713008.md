*** 9713008 Paulino A novel computational approach for the study of multiple
interacting crack systems with nonlinear material response is developed. The
hypersingular boundary integral equations along with the Galerkin approximations
is used in this formulation. These allow to circumvent the computational
difficulties and smoothness requirements of the alternative formulations
available in the literature. These developments play a significant role in the
failure analysis of important classes of materials such as composites with one
or more ductile constituents.***
