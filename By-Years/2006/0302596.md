This award will support an experimental study of the temperature vs. magnetic
field phase diagram of type-II superconductors. The project's goal is to
determine if there is a transition in non-zero field, and to determine the
critical exponents of that transition if it exists, as well as the exponents of
the zero-field transition. (The exponents reported in the literature vary widely
for both transitions.) The methods used will be DC I-V and high-frequency (45
MHz to 45 GHz) conductivity measurements on the same samples, providing
independent experiments. It is expected that this project will lead to a much-
improved understanding of phase transitions in superconductors and in other
systems. More broadly, the project will reaffirm that questioning and testing
widely-accepted results is an essential part of the scientific process. An
important part of this project is the support for training of graduate and
undergraduate students. The PIs will continue their strong efforts to involve
women and minorities in research, and to collaborate with scientists from Latin
America and Eastern Europe. Finally, both PIs will continue their extensive
efforts to encourage broader education in science, including work with
predominantly minority public-school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A
superconductor, by definition, is a material that has no resistance to the flow
of electricity, a property with great potential technological importance. Prior
work showed that the consensus concerning the limits of superconductivity, in
particular, whether materials are superconducting in a magnetic field, may have
been incorrect. This award will support research that will more generally
explore under what conditions superconductivity can exist. The project will
