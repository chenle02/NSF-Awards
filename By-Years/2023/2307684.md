Significantly energetic astrophysical flows exhibiting plasma velocities near
the speed of light are referred to as relativistic plasmas. These high-energy
relativistic flows manifest in a diverse array of astrophysical phenomena
involving compact objects. Noteworthy examples encompass core-collapse
supernovae, jets and accretion flows surrounding massive compact objects like
black holes and neutron stars, pulsar wind nebulae, and gamma-ray bursts.
Moreover, astronomical observations consistently indicate the presence of
dynamically significant magnetic fields within these highly compressible
relativistic flows. Computer simulations serve as indispensable tools for
researchers studying these plasmas, facilitating the comprehension of various
physical processes associated with immensely energetic relativistic
astrophysical flows. Scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz aim
to advance the precision of computer simulations concerning relativistic flows,
as current computer algorithms encounter challenges in delivering high-fidelity,
dependable numerical solutions. The team will develop a novel data-driven
machine-learning strategy that enhances the computational performance and
accuracy of numerical solutions for relativistic plasma flows. The expected
outcomes of this project will be disseminated to the broader computational
astrophysics community through publications in scientific journals and the
release of open-source code for improved computer simulations. As part of this
project, the PI will also advise and mentor undergraduate students from
underrepresented groups via the Cal-Bridge and Lamat REU programs. The project's
primary objective is to tackle unresolved challenges in simulating relativistic
flows. Currently, simulating relativistic flows using modern shock-capturing
schemes necessitates an impractically high grid resolution to achieve grid
convergence. To address this issue, the team proposes the development of new
data-driven, fast, a-priori shock-capturing methods for relativistic
hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. The proposed approach aims to eliminate
the need for computationally expensive conventional "limited reconstruction" of
fluid data, which is a nonlinear numerical process required for numerical
stability in standard modern shock-capturing methods. To overcome this
limitation, the team will create high-order "unlimited" reconstruction
algorithms using Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction. By combining the GP
method with a physics-informed artificial neural network, they will introduce a
novel data-learned shock-capturing paradigm named the a-priori annMOOD
(Artificial Neural Network Multidimensional Optimal Order Detection) method,
which will replace the existing a-posteriori procedural shock-capturing MOOD
method. The anticipated outcome of this project is a performance-enhanced
relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamics (RMHD) solver optimized for massively
parallel computing. By leveraging the power of data-driven techniques and high-
order reconstruction algorithms, this project aims to significantly improve the
efficiency and accuracy of simulating relativistic flows, thereby advancing
understanding of these complex phenomena. The resulting solver will be capable
of delivering reliable results while reducing the computational burden
associated with achieving grid convergence.
