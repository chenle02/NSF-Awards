This project is an investigation of the computational complexity of intractable
sets. The object is to gain new insight into the rich mathematical structure
that individual classes such as NP, EXP and TIME (2poly) appear to have, and to
increase our understanding of the structural relationship between these classes.
To these ends new concepts and proof techniques will be employed. Sets that are
difficult to compute on almost all arguments play an important role in the
structural analysis of complexity classes. Separation results between various
deterministic, nondeterministic, and generalized Kolmogorov complexity classes
can be witnessed by these sets. In cases where absolute results are elusive,
relativization results will be achieved. Application of these results will be
used to study the structure of complete sets in NP and EXP. A new
nonconstructive reducibility that relates the polynomial complexity of
computable sets will be used to investigate the structure of the classes NP and
EXP. New results and insights into the fine structure of these classes have been
obtained; further research into these areas is proposed.
