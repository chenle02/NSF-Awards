9501320 Groisman Under this award, Drs. Groisman and Bradley will construct a
clear-sky climatology for most of the North American and Eurasian extratropical
land area. The climatology will consist of monthly mean time series, for each
hour of the day, of meteorological variables and snow cover data for both
average and clear-sky conditions. Initially currently available data from the
USA, Canada, and the former USSR will be employed, but the analyses will be
expanded as data from China and Europe is acquired. The principal investigators
will compare the clear-sky climatology with the conventional all-sky climatology
to estimate empirically the effects of clouds in this region. The climatology
will provide a much needed resource for the climate community. Support is
provided in part by the Climate Dynamics Program. The project also is partially
funded under and contributes to the goals of the Role of Clouds, Energy, and
Water in Global Climate Change Program. ***
