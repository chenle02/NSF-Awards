This project deals with the seismic design of arch bridges which nonlinearly
even in the elastic range under earthquake loading. To develop an earthquake-
resistant design method the groundwork - laid by prior research - the
formulation of a geometrically and materially nonlinear curved beam element, a
nonlinear dynamic analysis procedure, a computer code, and a preliminary
behavioral study of several representative steel arch bridges is used. This
project, representing a culmination of the research efforts, aims to produce
seismic design rules and tools for steel arch bridges. Design rules and other
practical tools are developed for both linear and nonlinear situations. A user's
manual for the computer program developed will be prepared and made available
for general use such as in the design-analysis iteration of an arch bridge of
unusual size or configuration. The research would positively impact bridge
design practice.
