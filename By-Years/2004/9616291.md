Proposal Number: ECS-9616291 Principal Investigator: Robert York Abstract: This
is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for the development of a
compact and tunable sub-millimeter radiation source using integrated photomixing
on low temperature grown (LTG) compound semiconductors. The SGER will be used to
demonstrate the potential for efficient microwave/millimeter wave signal
generation and to investigate the limitations of LTG materials for photomixing,
an area of risk which makes this work appropriate for SGER funding. The source
technologies developed within this research could lead to a simple compact and
cost-effective implementation for broadband spectroscopy with many applications:
environmental science, remote sensing, detection of hazardous chemicals and deep
space exploration.
