enable the investigator to collect perishable data on the Northridge earthquake.
the study will involve investigating the emergency system that evolved in
response to the problems posed by the earthquake and pay special attention to
the role of information and communication as that system developed. Lessons will
be sought in the Northridge experience that have relevance for reducing the
vulnerability of communities to future disasters. ***
