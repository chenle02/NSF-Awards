The University of Connecticut?s preserved plant collection is a valuable
resource of scientific information, particularly for the Northeastern United
States. Through this project, information on the more than 175,000 plant records
will be made available to researchers, educators and students using an
electronic database to provide written information and high-quality, digital
images for each plant specimen, which then will be made available worldwide to
anyone with internet access. By compiling historic and contemporary plant
records, this project will allow for unprecedented studies of topics ranging
from global climate change to urban plant geography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Graduate and undergraduate students will work on the project, gaining experience
in database management, specimen-handling procedures and other elements of plant
biology research. The database will be linked to the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility, which is a worldwide data-sharing initiative designed to
widely disseminate scientific knowledge. The easy access to specimen information
will facilitate research by state agencies, conservation organizations and
academic scientists who study such issues as endangered species, economically
important species, and weedy, invasive species. The database also will be used
to develop lesson plans for Connecticut?s K-12 science curriculum, providing
hands-on experience in scientific research, particularly to underrepresented
students in the state?s urban areas.&lt;br/&gt;
