Problem scale has a significant effect on the way that hydrologic phenomena are
observed and explained. Recent hydrologic research has clearly demonstrated that
laboratory results may not adequately reflect field scale behavior, that models
developed at one scale may not be valid at other scales, and that small scale
variability may have large scale consequences. This research project is designed
to help hydrologists obtain a clearer understanding of scale effects and their
relevance to practical hydrologic investigations. It examines the complex
relationship between natural variability and the models and data collection
programs that from the basis for scientific hydrology. The first phase of the
project reviews stochastic methods for describing natural variability over a
range of time and space scales. The second phase examines new techniques for
deriving scale-dependent estimates of hydrologic quantities. The final phase of
research considers how field data can be used to improve the accuracy of these
estimates. The stochastic approach adopted in the project provides a way to
quantify important scale-dependent tradeoffs between model resolution, sampling
effort, and estimation accuracy. This approach is illustrated with applications
to groundwater flow and transport.
