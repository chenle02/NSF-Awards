highly motivated manufacturing professionals with advanced degrees. The focus of
this program will be in the area of machine tool technology. This program has
designed a number of new features to attract and retain top quality students, in
particular from underrepresented groups. The training activities include course
work in manufacturing and related areas, active participation in weekly graduate
student seminars, early involvement as research assistants in industrially
relevant research projects, and the potential for summer internships at
industrial facilities, as well as student exchange programs with some leading
machine tool research institute in Europe and Asia. ***
