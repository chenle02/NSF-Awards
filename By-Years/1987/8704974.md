A knowledge of various chemical species formed in solution and on solid surfaces
is important in understanding the fundamentals involved in various techniques
used in chemical, mineral and ceramic processing industries. In flotation and
selective flocculation, used in mineral processing industry for beneficiating
low grade ores, an understanding of the interaction between mineral and
surfactant or polymeric reagents in terms of surface species formed is essential
for successful application of these processes. An understanding of mechanism of
adsorption is also essential in the adsorption of polymer on cornea and contact
lens surfaces for selection of appropriate polymers in the preparation of
ophthalmic solutions, used as artificial tears and eye lubricants. In sol-gel
technique, analysis of various species formed during hydrolysis of metal
alkoxide is necessary to understand the gelling process. A Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectrophotometer, provided with a sample cell which would
permit the identification of species on solids in suspension and in liquids in
situ, will enhance the capabilities and quality of the on-going and proposed
research program in the above mentioned areas of study.
