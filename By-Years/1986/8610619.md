This is an exploratory investigation of a novel technique for growing large (in
the size range of about one centimeter or larger) crystals of zeolite, a
material that has numerous applications in separation processes (ion-exchange,
absorption, etc.) and catalysis. Currently available zeolite crystals are in the
size range of 1 to 10 microns (i.e., one-ten-thousandth to one-thousandth of a
centimeter). Availability of crystals in the centimeter range will provide
opportunities for systematic studies of the structure of such crystals, studies
of surface thermodynamics and transport phenomena, and preparation of molecular
"membranes" made of uniform single crystals. A significant impact on many of the
currently-known separation techniques is possible.
