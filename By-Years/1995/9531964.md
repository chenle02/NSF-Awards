9531964 Kronheimer The proposed research deals with geometry and gauge theory in
dimensions three and four, with an emphasis on the study of the monopole
equations recently introduced by Seiberg and Witten. These equations have been
used to define new differential invariants of manifolds, and the investigator
wishes to examine these invariants in isolation as well as in the presence of
various geometric structures on the underlying manifold. In addition, the
proposed research seeks to understand the internal structure of these invariants
in relation to other closely related invariants such as Donaldson invariants.
The study of four dimensional curved spaces has received a boost in recent years
due to ideas coming from theoretical physics. In the early eighties Donaldson
came up with a set of differential invariants (these are used to distinguish and
classify different four dimensional spaces) using ideas from particle physics;
in 1994 Witten and Seiberg came up with another set of invariants which are
considerably easier to calculate.
