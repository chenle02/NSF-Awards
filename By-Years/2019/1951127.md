The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
Phase II project will focus on the preparation of new iron-based compounds as
safer contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an issue that
particularly affects patients who have frequent MRI scans and those with chronic
kidney disease. This project will advance the development of safer medical
imaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This STTR Phase II project will focus on further
development of the first Fe(III) macrocycle-based T1 MRI contrast agents as
alternatives to Gd(III) agents. The macrocyclic ligands in these complexes are
used to control the spin and oxidation state of the iron, as well as the
biodistribution and pharmacokinetic clearance of the agent. The macrocyclic
ligands will be modified to further increase T1 relaxivity of the Fe(III)
complexes. The hydrophicility of the complexes will be increased to better mimic
the clearance profiles of Gd(III) based agents. Scale-up of the synthetic
procedures will produce sufficient compound batches for toxicity studies in
mice, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the no adverse effect level
(NOAEL), imaging studies in rats, as well as histology and metabolic panels. The
most promising complexes will be subjected to further toxicity studies including
Ames testing, thymidine kinase cell screens and cardiotoxicity
assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
