This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program will
investigate intramolecular redistribution of rotational and vibrational energy,
a key component in many aspects of chemical dynamics. With the advent of the
laser, these chemical events can now be experimentally scrutinized at the state-
to-state level. The objective of this research is to develop theoretical methods
to elucidate the mechanisms and pathways of this energy flow. The method of
Almost Degenerate Perturbation Theory will be developed to allow investigation
of energy regimes and densities of states hitherto unattainable by other
methods. This will allow for determination of how the effects of multiple
resonance interactions combined with increasing densities of states leads to the
statistical like properties associated with reaction rate theories.
