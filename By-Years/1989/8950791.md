In this project a FT-IR spectrometer with appropriate accessories was purchased
to replace the current obsolete equipment. The instrument is used in the Organic
Chemistry courses. The instrument is utilized for product verification and
analytical work. The abbreviated organic qualitative analysis scheme which
depends on functional group determination by means of infrared analysis and
integrates commercial computer software uses this equipment. The state-of-the-
art instrumentation aids in the recruitment and retention of qualified students.
The equipment is used chiefly by students under the supervision of qualified
faculty. The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.
