Case Western Reserve is commencing a renovation project which will modernize
51,000 gross square feet of space used for research, research training and
undergraduate education by the Department of Physics. In this department
condensed matter physics and particle/astrophysics are the primary areas of
research with research in the physics of imaging carried out in collaboration
with the medical school there. This department concentrates a great deal of
effort on materials sciences as they study optics, thin film and surface
physics, and low temperature physics. Another significant component of the
department's research involves soft, condensed systems such as polymers, liquid
crystals, and complex fluids, with a goal of providing a platform for
understanding the fundamental properties of this wide class of systems. The
renovation of this facility will aid the Nation in fostering the research and
the training of students in one of its strategic research areas.
