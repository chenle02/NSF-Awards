This award provides renewed support for an astronomy education partnership
between Carthage College and the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), with the
support of Dartmouth College and Rock Point School. The partners will deliver
hands-on astronomy and nature education and outreach programs that engage the
public, train mentors and docents, and provide experiential learning
opportunities for high school and college students. Under the first two years of
prior NSF NSF support, Carthage College and the AMC provided astronomy and
nature education programming to nearly 3,000 participants in year 1, and 5,000
in year 2. The AMC hosts over 500,000 visitors annually, over half of whom are
lower-to-middle-class in income, and approximately 20% are non-white. With
renewed NSF funding, the partnership will expand training opportunities, and
deliver their programming to an even wider audience.
