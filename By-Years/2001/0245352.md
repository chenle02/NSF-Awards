This grant provides funding for the analytical analysis of models that
coordinate pricing, production and inventory decisions in an attempt to develop
optimal or near optimal algorithms for them. Interestingly, concepts such as
convexity or k-convexity, that have been proven effective for classical
inventory models, do not directly apply for models with general, price
dependent, stochastic demand processes. Thus, to analyze models that incorporate
pricing decisions, the concept of symmetric k-convex functions has been
developed and applied to a variety of pricing problems including finite and
infinite horizon single product models. This concept settled a long-standing
conjecture and characterized the structure of the optimal policy for each of
these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will continue with the
analysis, development and implementation of algorithms for different variants of
models that integrate pricing, production and inventory decisions. The focus is
on developing theoretical and practical methods that utilize the available
information to improve supply chain efficiencies and ultimately the company
bottom line. Specifically, the research will focus on (i) applying the notion of
symmetric k-convex functions to a variety of pricing models including models
with multiple classes of customers differentiated by their sensitivity to price
and lead-time, as well as models with discretionary sales; (ii) develop
computational methods and test their effectiveness using data received from
industrial partners; and (iii) apply the notion of symmetric k-convexity to
other operational management problems.
