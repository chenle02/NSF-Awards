This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to build a
prototype of a rapid-deployment, three-dimensional (3-D), seismic reflection
system for near-surface exploration. Although the 3-D seismic reflection method
enjoys tremendous commercial success in marine applications, 3-D seismic systems
for land-based geophysical exploration have been limited because cost-effective
and environmentally friendly deployment systems have not been developed. Such a
system would be useful to build models of ground water flow, track pollutants,
identify mineral-laden zones, and aid the sitting of large construction
projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation seismic system based on the
land streamers concept using gimbal-mounted vertical geophones will be
assembled. An industrial, low-impact All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is a critical
part of the system both to pull the land streamers and minimize environmental
impact. The primary advantage of such a system is that fewer field personnel
would be needed compared to conventional surveys and data can be collected more
efficiently. The customer base for this seismic reflection system includes civil
and environmental engineers and geophysical contractors.&lt;br/&gt;
