Understanding the factors that control production of supercooled liquid water
in mountainous terrain is not only an important fundamental research question,
but such knowledge is needed to advance techniques of enhancing winter-time
orographic precipitation. During the Austral winter of 1988, various Australian
agencies conducted a winter storms experiment to improve knowledge of winter
extratropical cyclones interacting with mountainous terrain. The major research
objectives of the experiment are to measure the mesoscale water budget near
mountainous terrain during the passage of extratropical cyclones and to
understand how this budget is affected by mesoscale cloud structure and
kinematics and microphysical processes. The Principal Investigator will assist
in analyzing the data collected during this project which includes state-of-the-
art measurements from a microwave radiometer, pulsed lidar, rawindsondes,
research aircraft and surface precipitation measurements. Specifically,
supercooled liquid water and ice mass fluxes across a mountain crest will be
calculated and related to mesoscale weather features. Results will lead to a
better understanding of orographic precipitation formation processes. //
