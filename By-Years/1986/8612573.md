In this equipment grant, heats of mixing will be measured for a number of liquid
mixtures for wide ranges of temperature and pressure with an isothermal flow
calorimeter system. Particular emphasis is placed on binary and ternary liquid-
liquid systems, and on liquid mixtures containing high molecular weight alcohols
and aromatic compounds. The basic data resulting from this project will be
utilized to developo accurate models for the determination of the phase behavior
of partially miscible systems. Experimental data will also be obtained for
several liquid-liquid systems with potential for thermal energy storage due to
large changes in the heat of mixing below and above their critical solution
temperatures. The data for mixtures containing high molecular weight compounds
will be utilized to extend and improve analytical procedures for the
determination of phase behavior and other thermodynamic properties of polar
mixtures at elevated temperatures and pressure.
