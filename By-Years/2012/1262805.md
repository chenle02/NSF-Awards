This funding will establish a new CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates
(REU) Site at the University of Maryland-College Park. This Site focuses on
research in combinatorial algorithms, which are algorithms that work on discrete
objects such as numbers, graphs, or data where one needs to optimize over a
space of possible solutions. To help create a climate in which students learn
new techniques, understand a few real world problems, and work on designing and
implementing algorithms, the students will be involved in applied algorithms
research projects that will be jointly advised by members of the UMD theory
group in conjunction with faculty in different research areas, such as systems,
artificial intelligence, and databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will
support eight undergraduate students for ten weeks each year. The Site will
recruit computer science, computer engineering, and mathematics majors, with a
focus on students from Historically Black Colleges and Women's colleges. The
Site will help bridge the gap between theory and practice, which will benefit
both as it gives theorists new and exciting problems and non-theorists tools
they can use. The students will have the opportunity to see what research is
like, obtain a solid grounding in algorithms, and encourage them to go to
graduate school.
