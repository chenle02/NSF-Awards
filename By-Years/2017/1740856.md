This award supports a cohort-based, undergraduate program that seeks to help
develop the next generation of sustainability science leaders. This
collaborative fellowship program connects undergraduates with today's
sustainability science leaders and seeks to provide the students with
cooperative research opportunities. This program seeks to help the students
develop essential skills in generating and applying knowledge and developing
actions that speed the transition toward a more globally sustainable future. The
students will work directly with established research teams, and engage in
activities that will build substantive connections with each group of fellows.
The structure will help to build the next-generation international
sustainability science leaders, equipped to collaborate and innovate across
cultures, disciplines, and nationalities. The program will produce multimedia
educational materials focused on building role models and expanding the
diversity of narratives represented in global change research and sustainability
science. The program will broaden the STEM diversity in some of urban
development's most pressing issues and build greater capacity.
