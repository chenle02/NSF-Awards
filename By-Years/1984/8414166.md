This research effort includes atheoretical and experimental study of the effects
of voltage modulation on selectivity in a parallel-plate cell used for
electroorganic synthesis. The work is of fundamental importance to the little-
studied area of electrosynthetic cell design; it also has considerable practical
importance in this emerging area, which is expected to increase in economic
importance.
