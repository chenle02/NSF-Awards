The interactions among quantum field theory, string theory, algebraic geometry,
and topology are of great current interest. Among the topics to be encompassed
by this project are: (1) two- dimensional gravity and cohomology of moduli
spaces, and their relations with matrix models, topological field theories and
"dessins;" (2) mirror symmetry and its consequences in string theory and
algebraic geometry; (3) two-dimensional string theory and non-compact sigma
models; (4) solvable gauge theories and their applications in mathematics; and
(5) elliptic cohomology and its generalizations. This project will support the
Conference on Geometry and Quantum Field Theory to be held from March 26-29,
1992 at Johns Hopkins University. A pre- and post-conference workshop will also
be held. The conference activity will be held in conjunction with a special year
on these topics, hosted by the Japan-U.S. Institute at Johns Hopkins. The major
topics to be covered by the conference include two-dimensional gravity, mirror
symmetry, two-dimensional string theory, solvable gauge theories, and elliptic
cohomology.
