The nature of dark matter is one of the most important research topics in
physics today. It pertains to fundamental unanswered questions in particle
physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. This award will enable a probe of a very
interesting new region of theoretical phase space for viable Weakly Interacting
Massive Particle (WIMP) candidates in the search for dark matter in order to
improve our understanding of it: what it is, where it is, how it interacts with
Standard Model particles, and what its role is in the evolution and fate of the
universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective is to either measure a
dark matter signal or set a limit on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section for a 60 GeV
WIMP mass. This will be reached through the PI's work as a member of the Cold
Dark Matter Search (CDMS) collaboration. The approach is to improve the
efficiency and to reduce the lower energy threshold of their current detectors
to obtain a factor of 2 increase in the science reach of the experiment, and to
implement new higher-performance, more massive detectors for the next phase of
SuperCDMS. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts of this project include
increasing the pool of under-represented minority applicants to graduate
programs in physics and astronomy. The approach is to increase the exposure of
these students to opportunities in research through a summer program at MIT. The
PI will work with HBCUs and HSIs to bring talented students for a summer of
research, journal club presentations, networking with MIT minority graduate
students, and outreach to local high schools in the Boston community. Research
in the physics of high-resolution low-temperature detectors and new analysis
techniques have applications in other fields such as astrophysics, nuclear
physics, and solid-state physics. &lt;br/&gt;
