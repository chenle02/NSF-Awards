Long-lived, autonomous software systems require ongoing self- assessment, which
implies a comparison between expected and actual stimuli, as a prerequisite to
self-diagnosis and repair. This project addresses the use of dynamic analysis
and machine learning techniques for behavior classification. The proposed work
will - address fundamental research and education issues in dependable software-
based computing systems by exploring how machine learning techniques can most
effectively be applied to improve the self-assessment process; - develop
research products in the form of prototype tools or methodologies, applying
Markov models and cluster analysis to the assessment of program behavior data; -
provide dependability attributes that are suitable for measuring the impact of
the research products, such as the extent to which a set of Markov models
successfully describes the behavior of a software system; - provide empirical
evaluation/validation of the research products together with associated test
data to validate the effectiveness of the approach The proposed research will
provide empirical data on the use of Markov models to encode behavioral models,
and methodologies and infrastructure for use in performing further
experimentation. The resulting techniques for provisioning software with
behavior models to aid in self-awareness will promote research on development of
real-time systems.
