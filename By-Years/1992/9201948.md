Sukamto This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Johanes
Sukamto of the University of Minnesota to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Akira Fujishima for 18 months at the Department of Synthetic Chemistry,
University of Tokyo. They will investigate a new photoelectrochemical
information storage system based on a novel photon-mode storage technique. The
photon-mode technique stores information as a photon- induced chemical change of
the storage media and provides an alternative to the diffraction limited heat-
mode storage techniques which rely on the thermal energy of a laser light. This
new technique uses the photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochromic
properties of thin films such as molybdenum oxide and Langmuir-Blodgett films
and allows the possibility of using semiconductor lasers as a photochromic
reaction light source for a photon-mode memory device. Dr. Sukamto's theoretical
expertise in photoelectrochemistry will complement Dr. Fujishima's extensive
experience in preparing the molybdenum oxide and Langmuir-Blodgett thin films
and will facilitate an increase in absorption capabilities for these thin films.
