The cultural theory of risk posits that individuals' worldviews decisively shape
their assessments of what dangers are worthy of regulatory amelioration. When
evaluating competing claims and evidence, individuals naturally consider what
crediting or discounting an asserted danger would convey about their society's
values. Previous studies have shown that differences over values explain public
disagreements over myriad societal risks from environmental catastrophe to
foreign invasion to economic collapse. These results have been used to develop
procedures for resolving various disputes in which conflicting cultural values
and conflicting factual beliefs reinforce one another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
current study will use the cultural theory of risk to examine public attitudes
toward guns. The gun control debate features competing claims of risk: that
insufficient regulation of guns will make citizens vulnerable to deliberate or
accidental shootings, on the one hand; and that excessive regulation will leave
citizens unable to defend themselves from attackers, on the other. The
hypothesis of this study is that cultural orientations determine which of these
risk claims individuals are likely to take more seriously. To test this
hypothesis, the investigators will design and conduct a nationwide survey on
cultural orientations and gun-risk perceptions. They will also consider the
implications of the cultural theory of risk perception for resolution of the gun
control debate.
