9612168 Lesieutre In this proposal we request travel support for a number of
students pursuing research in power engineering to attend the 28th Annual North
American Power Symposium (NAPS) to be held November 10-12, 1996, at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. NAPS is an annual conference that
provides a forum for university students, professors, and industry engineers to
present and discuss their research. Students in particular are encouraged to
participate. It is often their first opportunity to formally present their work
before colleagues. Travel expenses could be a deterrent for students planning to
attend this conference. In this proposal we discuss the need for travel support
for student authors, outline the activities planned for the conference, and
state the expected impact of the requested travel grant. ***
