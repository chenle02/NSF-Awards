This Research Equipment Grant will make it possible for the Department of
Electrical Engineering at the State university of New York at Stony Brook to
strengthen its research program on Parallel and Neural Computing. The department
will purchase a 128-processor CNAPS computer and a Sun Ultra Sparc workstation
which will be dedicated to support research in parallel and neural computing.
The equipment will be used for four research project s including: 1) neural
control; 2) image processing; 3) parallel system simulation; and 4) Bayesian
neural network for modeling and control. These projects all require data
intensive simulations. The equipments selected is especially designed with these
needs in mind. The 128-processor CNAPS computer is a SIMD (Single Instruction
Multiple Data) parallel computer ideal for neural network and image processing
applications. The ultra-fast Sun workstation will allow fast, concurrent access
to the proposed 128-processor CNAPS system and the existing 64-processor CNAPS
system. It can also provide an infrastructure for parallel system simulation.
