The measurement of people's values for public or non-marketed goods - or for the
loss of these goods - is playing an increasing role in benefit-cost analysis for
public policy decisions and regulations and in assessment of liability for
environmental damage. A widely used measure of these values, judgment of
willingness to pay (WTP) for public goods, seems to be susceptible to a number
of biases and irrelevant influences, particularly when it is elicited by a
survey instrument. An example is the embedding effect, in which the valuation of
a good such as disaster preparedness depends on whether the entire program
containing that good (environmental services) has been evaluated first. The
research will conduct questionnaire studies designed to isolate crucial features
of WTP with particular attention to the role of moral norms. Alternative
elicitation methods, such as direct ratings of goods, will be explored, with a
view to understanding how unbiased evaluation might be achieved. Other variables
for investigation will include provision of context, type of choice rule, type
of good (environmental or consumer), number of other people affected, fairness
of the payment vehicle, and expectation of others' responses.
