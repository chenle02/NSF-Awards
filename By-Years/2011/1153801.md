The College of Lake County NSF Scholars Program is awarding up to 30
scholarships each year to full-time Engineering Transfer, Computer Science, and
Electrical Engineering Technology students who have demonstrated both academic
potential and financial need. Special emphasis is being given to recruitment
from underrepresented groups in these academic areas - including women, minority
students, and the disabled. Scholars are being organized into cohorts, which are
subsequently supported by activities such as individualized advisement,
structured tutorials, mentoring, and a summer
orientation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Lake County (CLC) S-STEM
scholar program provides a model for increasing the recruitment and retention
rate of students underrepresented in these STEM disciplines. Once fully
established and evaluated, many of the mentoring and student support strategies
used in this project can be implemented and continued with nominal cost to an
institution. With institutions like CLC accounting for almost half of the
nation's STEM undergraduates and over half of all minorities in higher
education, the project offers the opportunity for broad impact on the STEM
pipeline.
