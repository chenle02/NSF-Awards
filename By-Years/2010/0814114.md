Proposal to acquire one item of shared-use scientific instrumentation for use on
R/V Thompson, operated by University of Washington School of Oceanography as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. The item requested is a MultiNet Plankton Sampler. The University of
Washington proposes to cover half the cost of this
acquisition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The data collected
from the instrumentation requested in this proposal will be utilized by
scientific research teams studying complex biological, chemical and geological
ocean processes within Puget Sound and the Pacific Ocean basin. Many programs
supported by NSF and other agencies create exciting new web-based instructional,
interactive, and representational presentations for K-12 through graduate school
education programs.&lt;br/&gt;
