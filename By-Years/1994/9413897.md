We are proposing to develop a center for cell sorting and cell characterization
at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The number of projects positively
impacted by establishing such a center are numerous and varied. The
investigators involved in this proposal come from the Colleges of Arts and
Sciences, and Agriculture in the general disciplines of Immunology, Physiology,
Mycology, Cell, Developmental and Molecular Biology. The requested flow
cytometer will be utilized heavily in sorting and characterizing immune cell
populations. A major project will be involved in identifying immune cells
responsible for melanocyte destruction in birds afflicted with autoimmune
vitiligo. Because of the ease of access, and ability to repeatedly sample large
numbers of melanocyte-specific immune cells, the Smyth chicken represents a
valuable animal model for studying autoimmune disease. Flow cytometry would also
be used for sorting based on the ploidy of cultured prostate cells. Cell sorting
will also be instrumental in screening for Dictyostelium transformants in
efforts to study and clone the gene for an antiporter from golgi bodies.
