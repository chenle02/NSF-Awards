This proposal is for a study of variable surface proteins of Neisseria. The
investigator has identified proteins called pilins, which are different in
pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. These proteins show antigenic and phase-
specific differences, which will be studied further. Clones have been isolated,
and the genes will be investigated. Undergraduates will be involved, and a RUI
application is anticipated. %%% This proposal is to study differences between
surface proteins called pilins on pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of the
bacterium Neisseria. The genes for these proteins appear to be expressed at
variable times during the bacterial life cycle; this will be further
investigated why the proteins differ between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic
strains.
