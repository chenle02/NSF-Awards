*** 96-60274 Lyon This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will explore the fire extinguishing properties of particles smaller than 100
microns. Larger particles that are commonly used in dry powder extinguishers
absorb relatively little heat as they pass through a flame, and they extinguish
fires chiefly by absorbing heat from the surroundings. Small particles, however,
can come to flame temperature and thus remove heat directly from the flame by
vaporizing and/or by acting as radiators. They can inhibit flame propagation by
providing surface area for free radical recombination. Small particles of
calcium bromide may be particularly effective since they will oxidize to calcium
oxide and bromine. Calcium oxide will cool the flame by acting as a radiator,
and the bromine will inhibit free radical reactions via the same mechanism which
makes halons effective fire extinguishing agents. Phase I will address the
problem of imparting sufficient momentum to carry small particles to the flame
and demonstrate a solution to this problem. With the banning of halons, polar
operations and many other activities face severe fire protection problems.
Commercial applications are anticipated in these and many other fire suppression
situations. ***
