The aim of the project is to develop a new methodology for prototyping and
designing land-grid-array connectors for multichip modules in high performance
computers. An optimal design procedure to study the effects of several
parameters on the connectors is a part of the investigation. A design
verification procedure using scaled-up prototypes of LGA connector contacts
through experimental models is also proposed.
