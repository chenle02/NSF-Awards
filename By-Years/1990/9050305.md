The National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) will organize
a meeting of representatives from the educational research, school, and
scientific communities to identify questions and set specifications for a
comprehensive research effort related to recent science curriculum reform
efforts such as the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) "Scope,
Sequence, and Coordination" (SS&C) project and the American Association for
Advancement of Science (AAAS) Project 2061. The results of the meeting along
with recommendations for research will be published in a forthcoming volume of
the Journal for Research in Science Teaching.//
