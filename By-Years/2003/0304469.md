This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Lab-on-a-
chip Nanomanufacturing in Freshman Engineering," at Ohio State University (OSU),
under the direction of Dr. David L. Tomasko, is funded by the Division of
Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG).

This project is a novel hands-on design and build experience for freshman
engineers led by faculty and graduate fellows from the Integrative Graduate
Education, Research, and Traineeship (IGERT) program at OSU in Molecular
Engineering of Microdevices. Freshman students will design, build, and test
their own model "lab-on-a-chip" using skills from a variety of disciplines.
These devices demonstrate a manufacturing approach to interface nanotechnology
to the microscale environment thus emphasizing the challenges and potential of
nanomanufacturing. At every stage of the project IGERT fellows and faculty will
lead study modules and lab tours showing the science and technology in the
nanoscale domain. Hence, the students will be engaged in both active learning
through hands on micromanufacturing and state-of-the-art nanotechnology
research.
