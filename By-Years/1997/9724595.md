Acquisition of Equipment for a Virtual Reality Laboratory for Vision, Visuomotor
and Synthetic Environment Research Project Summary Twelve members of the
Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, the Department of Cognitive
Sciences, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine,
plan to establish a virtual reality laboratory for vision, visuomotor and
synthetic environment research. These faculty include Myron Braunstein, Charles
Chubb, Carol Cicerone, Rui deFigueiredo, Michael D'Zmura, Glenn Healey, Gregory
Hickok, Donald Hoffman, Tarow Indow, Michael McCarthy, George Sperling and
Charles Wright. The purpose of the laboratory is threefold: to promote research
in human and artificial visual and visuomotor systems by the participating
faculty, to further knowledge of human behavior and performance in synthetic
environments, and to advance research training among students.
