Diatoms, unicellular algae with silica-rich cell walls that are intricately
ornamented, are important ecological indicators of water quality and nutrient
status, with individual species adapted to particular conditions. Their use as
indicators depends upon a reliable classification of the species, using stable
morphological features of the cell wall. Diatom cell walls are easily preserved
as fossils, for example in lake-bed cores, and make possible the analysis of
very long-term changes in species composition and abundance, a task again
dependent upon reliable taxonomic markers. Dr. Eugene Stoermer of the University
of Michigan is studying freshwater diatoms of the genus Tabellaria to assess the
limits of morphological variability within and between species of this group.
Tabellaria species are found throughout the northern hemisphere, and about 80
species have been named and described over the years, mostly briefly and in many
cases on the basis of unreliable, environmentally induced variations. Dr.
Stoermer is developing morphometric procedures using Fourier transformations for
the rapid measurement, under the light microscope, of cell outline and other
cell-wall features, to delimit those aspects of size and shape that are less
prone to modification by transient water conditions, and can thus be used as
stable markers of particular species. Long-term evolutionary trends among diatom
species, with a presumed genetic basis, can then be studied, uncomplicated by
variations locally induced by the environment. The morphometric methods
developed for size and shape analysis should be useful with other groups of
diatoms and other unicellular organisms.
