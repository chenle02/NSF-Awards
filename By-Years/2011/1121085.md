This award funds research that uses decision-making experiments to investigate
the importance of strategic complexity in repeated games. The project will test
hypotheses about the possible cognitive costs of strategic complexity and how
these costs affect decisions to cooperate in a repeated game in which the
efficient outcome requires cooperation but each individual involved may benefit
from selfish behavior. Previous literature in game theory indicates that
cooperation in repeated games may be limited by the complexity of the strategic
environment, as cooperative strategies are generally associated with greater
cognitive costs and less certain outcomes than selfish strategies. The
experiments funded by this award observe the cooperation rate in a standard
indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma and compare it with cooperation in a
similar but more complex strategic environment. The design allows an
investigation of whether the impact on cooperation depends on the source of
complexity in the strategic environment. Broader impacts include contributing to
graduate education and the possible interdisciplinary impact of the research,
which crosses boundaries between game theory, decision science, and behavioral
economics.
