This Small Business Innovation Research Program Phase II project will develop
advanced forms of transparent network proxies for both satellite and terrestrial
broadband wireless communications to the Internet. Shared wireless access links
to the Internet often exhibit what has been called a traffic / cost anomaly.
While almost 90% of the traffic in the network can flow from the Internet to the
user, almost 90% of the cost of the access links can be attributed to the
channel transmitting packets from the user to the Internet. Wireless Internet
access from the user to the Internet is often implemented by means of some
variation of a random access ALOHA channel. The interaction of ALOHA channels
with TCP and other high level protocols used in the Internet can limit the
effectiveness of both TCP and ALOHA for such access. The goal of this NSF SBIR
research program is to understand this awkward interaction of standards in the
high cost random access channel and to develop a strategy of migration to a more
sensible access architecture based upon transparent proxies.

The societal and commercial impact of this project will be to increase the
capacity of broadband wireless Internet multiple access channels thereby
decreasing the cost per user of the channel. This decrease in the cost per user
when shared with customers can increase the market for broadband wireless access
to the Internet while increasing the profitability for wireless Internet Service
Providers. These fast proxies will make wireless Internet access affordable for
under-served and un-served end users in rural areas in the United States and in
much of the rest of the world. Additionally the technical innovations of this
research will serve to advance the current level of understanding of how TCP/IP
protocols interact with other protocols in wireless data networks.
