The Southern Ocean may play a central role in causing ice ages and general
global climate change. This work will reveal key characteristics of the glacial
ocean, and may explain the cause of glacial/interglacial cycles by measuring the
abundances of certain isotopes of nitrogen found in fossil diatoms from
Antarctic marine sediments. Diatom-bound N is a potentially important recorder
of nutrient utilization. The Southern Ocean's nutrient status, productivity and
circulation may be central to setting global atmospheric CO2 contents and other
aspects of climate. Previous attempts to make these measurements have yielded
ambiguous results. This project includes both technique development and
analyses, including measurements on diatoms from both sediment traps and culture
experiments. With regard to broader impacts, this grant is focused around the
education and academic development of a graduate student, by coupling their
research with mentorship of an undergraduate researcher
