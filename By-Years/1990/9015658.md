The research will explore the effects of combustion assist gases and
ultraviolet/infrared laser combinations to develop efficient methods of
machining materials that are conventionally difficult-to-machine, such as the
refractory metals (tungsten and molybdenum), superalloys, and ceramics such as
silicon carbide, aluminum nitride, and composites. The specific goals are (1) to
study the effects of infrared/ultraviolet combination laser sources, combustion-
assist gases, and gas-flow conditions on the cutting process, (2) to conduct
experiments on difficult-to-machine materials, to verify experimentally and
augment the results of the analytical study, and (3) to recommend methods to
improve the effectiveness of laser cutting for thicknesses greater than 5 mm.
The specifics that will be addressed include the effect of infrared/ultraviolet
laser beams on the absorption of laser energy, the effect of chemical reactions
on laser energy absorption, and the influence of combustion on the cutting
efficiency.
