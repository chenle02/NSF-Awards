Resource planning for large scale electric power systems under uncertainty using
mathematical programming, importance sampling, and parallel processors is the
central theme of this project. The basic problem relates to the determination of
a mix of generation and transmission capacities from the present to a given time
horizon to meet future demand, satisfy reliability requirements, and minimize
discounted capital investment and operating costs. The project is multi-
disciplinary and jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the
Electric Power Research Institute. The project involves a continuation of the
development of a prototype algorithm and model.
