Infrastructure: Computer Information Systems Programs for The Navajo Nation The
goal of the project is to update and expand two-year computing curricula and
courses for Navajo students based on regional employment needs, students'
educational experience, and recommendations of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM). Governmental, educational, health services, and private
employers in the Four Corners region will be surveyed to assess current and
projected needs for information science employees. Survey results will be
presented to high school and college information science educators and employers
at a Tsaile meeting. The CS and CIS programs at Navajo Community College will be
modified and expanded - based on survey findings, recommendations from the
meeting, and ACM suggested curricula for two-year programs in computing - to
better prepare Navajo students for further education or to find employment in
the information industry. The project is significant for several reasons, such
as: - including the first survey of information science employment ever done in
this area; - establishing communications among high school and college computing
educators, and employers that do not currently exist; and - enhancing students'
educational and employment prospects
