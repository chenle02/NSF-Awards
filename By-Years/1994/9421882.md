This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Facilities Program will
help the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon at Eugene purchase
a 300 MHz spectrometer which will be used in the following research
investigations: Structural studies of organic molecules biological relevance,
inorganic complexes pertinent as models for magnetic materials and catalysts,
and solid state inorganic materials of technological interest. Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for
the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to
study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas
such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
