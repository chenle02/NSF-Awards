The PI will study the physical processes associated with solar prominences and
eruption of solar magnetic fields on the basis of computer simulations and
mathematical theories. He will observe the formation of solar prominences, the
formation of a current sheet in an arcade-like geometry, and the eruption of
prominence-arcade systems. In particular, he will model the formation and
eruption of solar prominences as sequential phenomena in one evolutionary track
of a solar active region.
