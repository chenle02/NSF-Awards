Carleman estimates with nonconvex weights

The research will focus in two main directions. The first objective is to
understand the role of long-range perturbations in certain Carleman inequalities
for Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Euclidean spaces. These inequalities have
applications to questions concerning uniqueness of solutions of Schr\"{o}dinger
equations. The second objective is to further develop real-variable methods that
can be used in various aspects of analysis on semisimple Lie groups and
symmetric spaces. In particular, the PI is interested in understanding Riesz
rearrangement inequalities on semisimple Lie groups of high real rank.

Many partial differential equations of the type the PI proposes to study
originate from physics, chemistry or engineering. The role of these equations is
to model certain phenomena, and their relevance is often verified numerically.
The PI proposes to study these equations rigorously, and confirm the expected
behavior of solutions, such as the infinite speed of propagation of solutions of
large classes of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations, as mathematical theorems.
