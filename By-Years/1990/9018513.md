The structure imposed upon spoken sentences by intonation seems frequently to be
orthogonal to their traditional surface- syntactic structure. The involvement of
two apparently uncoupled levels of structure in Natural Language grammar appears
to complicate the path form speech to interpretation unreasonably and to thereby
threaten a number of computational unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a
number of computational applications in speech recognition and speech synthesis.
This work will complete the specification of a generative theory of intonation
in relation to syntax and discourse function, and instantiate the theory by
constructing a "discourse-model driven" utterance generator and speech
synthesizer. Such a device is to be contrasted with "text-to-speech" generation.
The input to the system will be a representation of discourse context
characteristic of a simple natural language query system. On the basis of such
representations, the system will be capable of constructing a variety of
contextually appropriate intonation contours for any given sentence covered by
its grammar. Such a device is expected to considerably improve comprehensibility
and naturalness of the synthesized speech.
