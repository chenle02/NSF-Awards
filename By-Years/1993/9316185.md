IBN 93-16185 Ryan In order to fully understand a behavior in a biological
framework, it is necessary to understand the evolutionary history of that
behavior. This is perhaps the most difficult issue in behavioral research. It
requires thorough knowledge of both the behavior of a group of animals and the
evolutionary relationships among the species in the group. Dr. Ryan's exciting
work on this problem combines sophisticated studies of animal communication with
detailed reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships. This combination of
approaches will lead to a much better understanding of how the behaviors
involved in acoustic communication evolve.
