This research is concerned with the study of a variety of problems of current
interest in surface physics. These include: 1) the study of the multilayer
structure of the simplest (rare gas) films as well as novel structures in
molecular monolayers; 2) the observation of collective vibrational excitations
in quasi-two-dimensional molecular solids and their analysis to infer
intermolecular and molecule substrate interactions; and 3) the study of phase
transitions in adsorbed films which either do not occur in bulk solids, or which
may be more tractible theoretically in low dimensions. The experiments will
employ inelastic and quasielastic neutron scattering to investigate monolayer
dynamics and both elastic neutron diffraction and synchrotron x-ray scattering
to probe film structure.
