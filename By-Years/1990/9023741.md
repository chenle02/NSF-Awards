A group of three senior scientists, research associates and students will
continue their research in elementary particle physics. Three activities will be
pursued during the grant period. 1. A comprehensive program of precision studies
of the spectroscopy of the system consisting of a b-quark with its anti-particle
will come to conclusion. These studies at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring with
the Columbia University - Stony Brook detector (CUSB), began in 1977 and
emphasized photon detection with a high resolution spectrometer. 2.
Participation in the construction and research program of the D0 detector at
Fermilab will continue. The detector will have a major commissioning run in the
summer of 1991 followed by a long data taking run two to three years later. The
group has been involved with design of the electronics for the detector and its
upgrades and will soon also be heavily involved in the data analysis. 3. A new
activity will begin with the Phi- factory planned to be built at Frascati in
Italy.
