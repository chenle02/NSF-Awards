Smith The principal investigator will study finitely presented, noetherian
graded algebras, particularly the Sklyanin algebras. The study of these algebras
has been significant in the development of noncommutative algebraic geometry. A
key problem is to classify the fat point modules over the Sklyanin algebras. The
principal investigator will also extend to higher dimensions the results he has
obtained on the 4-dimensional Sklyanin algebras. In addition, noncommutative
surfaces of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 3 will be studied. This will provide a
clearer understanding of the general outline of noncommutative algebraic
geometry. This research is in the general area of noncommutative ring theory.
The rings considered in the project are of interest in many areas of mathematics
including algebraic geometry. Given a curve, one of these rings can be
associated with certain points on the curve. A better understanding of these
rings and this association will be useful in determine the geometry of a given
curve. ***
