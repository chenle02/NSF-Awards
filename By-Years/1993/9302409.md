Dr. Carl D. Frisbie has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Frisbie's doctoral degree was from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Mark Wrighton. Dr. Frisbie will
continue research at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor
Charles Lieber. Dr. Frisbie's postdoctoral experience will train him in surface
imaging techniques, particularly scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) as applied to materials chemistry. Longer term, he plans
to study the structure and ion dynamics of fast ion conductors by AFM and
scanning surface harmonic microscopy. %%% The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships
in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed
to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into
meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
