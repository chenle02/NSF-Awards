This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on very fundamental studies of
the behavior of water at electrochemical interfaces. Professor Borguet and his
students at the University of Pittsburgh will use optical second harmonic
generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation methods to probe the orientation,
structure, and dynamics of the interfacial water layer at metal electrode
interfaces. The respective roles of electrolyte concentration and electrode
potential will be evaluated. This CAREER project will seek to improve science
literacy for non-science majors by developing a unified course inclusive of most
of the science disciplines. Outreach to high school students will be undertaken
by Professor Borguet through greater use of modern instrumentation in the
University of Pittsburgh Chemistry Van Program. The interaction of water with
metallic surfaces is of great technological importance, but is still not well
understood on a fundamental level. Professor Borguet and his students at the
University of Pittsburgh will use a suite of optical techniques to study the
physical structure of water molecules at electrode surfaces. This CAREER project
provides graduate students with a system which intimately ties fundamental
chemical reactivity with a topic of great technological importance; corrosion.
Professor Borguet will make contributions to improving the scientific literacy
of non-science majors through curriculum development and capturing the interest
of high school students through participation in the University of Pittsburgh
Chemistry Van Program.
