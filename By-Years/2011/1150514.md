Abstract

Objective: This project seeks to formulate a clear and consistent interpretation
of optical dynamics so that field interactions with matter can be confidently
modeled in a manner previously impossible. Such will enable educators to teach
modern electrodynamics with confidence and allow for the development of
applications involving electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of this goal, the
specific aim of the proposed project is to answer, within the framework of
classical electrodynamics, the questions ?how do we express with confidence the
dynamics of complex material systems subject to optical/electromagnetic forces??
and ?how are the various models of electromagnetic forces and momentum
interrelated?? This new interpretation will be applied to evaluate emerging and
proposed technologies.

Intellectual Merit: This research will provide the background necessary for
modeling complex systems where electromagnetic fields are used for self-assembly
and in situ control of photonic structures and will additionally benefit biology
and medicine where optical forces are currently used to probe the mechanical
properties of living cells. Applications focus on efficient and sustainable use
of resources and include the use of optical matter for fabricating nanophotonic
structures for various applications.

Broader Impacts: This grant will assist in advancing technology developments in
Arkansas through a collaborative effort with other grants and contracts to build
regional centers of excellence, which will promote new innovation while
encouraging small business development. This work also proposes to improve how
engineering education treats field interactions with matter, an approach that
will have a fundamental impact on the preparedness of next generation engineers.
