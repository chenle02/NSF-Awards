A workshop on Research Issues in Software Engineering is to be organized.
Approximately 25 persons representing academia, industry and government will be
invited. There are at least three foci of the workshop. First the workshop
attendees will need to identify the major research issues in Software
Engineering. The workshop would concentrate on topics which represent activities
that can be carried out under NSF programs, i.e., research in an academic
setting, but not excluding industrial participation. The second focus will be on
appropriate research paradigms. Software Engineering is a broad subject and no
single paradigm will always be appropriate. The workshop will attempt to
identify approaches to the topics of research. This means context as well
methodology, i.e., is the research best carried out by a single investigator, by
teams, by consortia, or by academic-industrial paternerships. Issues of scale
will be also be considered. The workshop also consider questions related to
funding levels and related issues. The workshop will produce a comprehensive
document that addresses the issues and the proposed courses of action, provide
and assessment of the national needs vis-a-vis their impact on Software
Engineering research, and the perceived priorities on these issues.//
