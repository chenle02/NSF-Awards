The Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture will conduct a 3-week
summer project for 20 undergraduate faculty that demonstrates environmental
problem-solving as an effective teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates'
interest in environmental science. Using the theme of Stressed Stream Analysis,
participating faculty will learn NEPA-based environmental analysis concepts and
techniques and will work in teams to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
for a proposed pollution source in a disturbed stream ecosystem. Concepts and
skills participants will learn include: Habitat Evaluation Procedures, using
Biotic Indices, electrophoretic and microscopic techniques to evaluate pollutant
effects on organisms, and water quality analysis of nutrients and metals in a
stressed stream ecosystem.
