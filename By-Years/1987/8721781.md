The study of operating system mechanisms and policies for the management of
various levels of shared storage in tightly-coupled MIMD machines is at an early
stage. This is even more true for the case of large-scale machines with hundreds
of processors. These issues are investigated in the large-scale with a focus on
the Butterfly multiprocessor. Specific projects divide into the following
classes: shared data migration across parallel main memories, management of
virtual memory in a setting of multiple secondary memories each associated with
a main memory, file systems design, and the design and evaluation of
distributed, concurrent data structures (which are crucial components in the
implementation of systems responsible for shared memory management).
