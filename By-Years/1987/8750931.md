This project will improve the electrical machines laboratory by adding six well
equipped student experimental stations. The stations are to be equipped with
"take-apart" machines which will allow the student to understand the physical
construction of machines and its relation to the physical and mathematical
principles. Included in the stations will be most of the common types of
machines and transformers. The related experiments will expose the students to
both the static and dynamic behavior of electrical machines, and the deviations
of dynamic behavior from theoretical performance based on simplifying
assumptions.
