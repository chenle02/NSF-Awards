9500047 Smith The Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, will purchase real-time control system
equipment which will be dedicated to support research in engineering. The
equipment will be used to set up the infrastructure for a coordinated
experimental control laboratory. This will be used to improve the control
capability on existing experiments and to integrate these experiments into a
computer network, thereby facilitating data transfer and storage, and enabling
the application to advanced identification, control, or image processing
techniques. The sum requested from NSF is $31,300. The UCSB College of
Engineering will provide $20,000 in equipment purchase matching funds. A Santa
Barbara company, Magnetic Moments will provide a matching equipment gift worth
$8,490. The individual experimental research projects involve: modeling and
control of uncertain systems; nonlinear process control; magnetic bearings;
vision based sensing and control; atomic force microscope control and image
processing; and atomic level control of semiconductor deposition processes. The
connection of these experiments to a common data an control network will greatly
facilitate the cross fertilization of ideas and the application of new
algorithms and approaches. This will provide a unique facility that will foster
new research ideas across a wide variety of applications. ***
