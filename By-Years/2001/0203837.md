This award supports a collaborative research project between Dr. Richard T.
Scalettar of the University of California Davis and Dr. Raimundo dos Santos of
the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to study the nature of
superconductivity in an attractive Hubbard Hamiltonian model. The model to be
studied will have a random mix of attractive on-site interactions and sites with
no attraction. A related model of borocarbides in which attrative Hubbard layers
alternate with free layers where there is no interaction will also be studied.
It is anticipated that this research will provide new insight into the nature of
the superconducting phase transition and in particular the effect of impurity
sites on pairing.
