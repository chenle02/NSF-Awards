Support is requesting for the 35th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference
on Genetic Exchange, to be held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado,
Jun 5-9, 1991. This conference is primarily concerned with the biology and
molecular biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and
eukaryotic systems, and is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this
subject area internationally. One significant feature of these meetings is their
accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel
funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem, we request
funds to provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of
graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various areas of genetic
exchange and related subject areas. The amount requested is $7,000. Corporate
funds are also solicited to provide expenses for 2-3 distinguished scientists as
plenary speakers.
