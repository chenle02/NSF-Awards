This research is on techniques and tools for automated logic design of low-
power, semi-custom circuits. Digital circuits are specified as models in
hardware description languages that can be readily compiled into finite-state
machines. The latter are described by transition diagrams or by synchronous
logic networks. These models are then used to solve logic synthesis problems in
encoding sequential circuits, restructuring logic networks, and library binding.
Tools for a comprehensive EDA system for low-power design are being developed.
