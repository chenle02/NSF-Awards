The project is an introductory two week workshop on various aspects of Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy for science faculty in the Southwest. The
faculty are being given the opportunity to enhance their understanding of modern
spectroscopy, so that they cans bring this augmented knowledge to bear on their
own teaching. The learning environment is an interactive workshop which includes
a hands-on component for a series of modern NMR spectrometers as well as an
exposure to a variety of other state-of-the-art spectroscopic metnods. The main
thrust of this workshop is Fourier Transform NMR Spectroscopy, both ID and 2D.
The course includes lectures, hands on laboratory experiences, problem solving
sessions, and detailed instructions for setting up an inexpensive data station
for teaching FT-NMR, without requiring access to a sp0ectrometer. This will
enable FT-NMR to be incorporated into the curriculum. In addition to the
workshops, experience in four other spectroscopic techniques is also being
provided; including Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography,
ESCA and Fast Kenetics using Lasers. The University is also contributing funds
in support of this program.
