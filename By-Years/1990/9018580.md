The Black Mountains, Death Valley, CA, present an opportunity to characterize a
magmatic system developed during large-scale intracontinental extension. The
goals of this project are to: 1) determine the relationship of magma sources and
magma evolution to the geometry and stages of extension, 2) determine the
chemical and isotopic signature of new additions to the crust in extensional
provinces, 3) determine the crust-mantle mass balance for the southern Basin and
Range Province, 4) determine whether or not the geochemistry of the intrusive
series is reflected in the eruptive sequence. The PI hopes to: 1) determine the
ages of various plutonic bodies through U-Pb, Rb-Sr and fission track studies,
2) measure the Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope, and trace element composition, and 3)
apply geobarometry studies. All this wil be done following careful field work.
