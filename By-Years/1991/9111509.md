The dayside magnetopause and magnetosheath are important regions to study in
order to gain a better understanding of how solar wind plasma couples to our
geospace environment. This grant is to continue a theoretical and simulation
study of plasma processes associated with this region and their coupling to the
polar ionosphere. The project includes studying 1) the formation mechanism of
slowmode shocks in the dayside magnetosheat, 2) the responses of the bow shock
and dayside dynamic pressure pulses, 3) three-dimensional impulsive plasma
penetration, and 4) the heating mechanism and nonlinear particle dynamics
associated with slow shocks.
