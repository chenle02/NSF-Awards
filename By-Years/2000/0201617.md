0201617&lt;br/&gt;Holmes&lt;br/&gt;Under this Investigator Initiated Award, the
PIs will develop methods to characterize cardiac motion from 4D
echocardiographic images (3D over time), thus taking advantage of advances made
in recent decades by cardiologists in imaging technologies and by engineers in
strain analyses. A multidisciplinary team will analyze 4D ultrasound images in a
database obtained with a novel 4D ultrasound scanner at Columbia. The proposal
has three objectives: 1) Establish a parametric 4D representation of endocardial
wall motion in a parameter space optimally suited to detecting regional wall
motion abnormalities and test potential detection strategies, 2) Use a 3D finite
element model to estimate the sizes of ischemic regions or scars that would
produce detectable wall motion abnormalities on 3D ultrasound images and 3)
select a method for displaying information on detected wall motion abnormalities
that best enhances detection while promoting acceptance among cardiologists.
Teaching materials will be developed to describe various historical approaches
to analyzing heart function and to outline the current state of the art.
