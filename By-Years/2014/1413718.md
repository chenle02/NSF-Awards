This work will provide maps of nearby planetary systems in unprecedented detail
using the new Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) with the Gemini Observatory. Planetary
systems around other stars are associated with tenuous structures composed of
dust known as debris disks, the counterpart of our solar system's asteroid and
Kuiper belts. The observations will be used to test models of planet formation
and evolution, and the data reduction pipeline will be made available to the
astronomical community. The PI and his team will train and mentor graduate and
undergraduate students in research, and develop an exoplanetary system imaging
exhibit at UCLA's Exploring Your Universe public outreach event.

The GPI instrument is a new coronagraphic integral field unit commissioned at
the Gemini Observatory. It is capable of detecting and spectroscopically
characterizing young Jovian planets reaching 10 million times fainter than their
parent star at separations as close as 0.2 arcseconds. This project
scientifically exploits new, high-contrast, polarimetric images of debris disks
to be obtained in the early science operations of GPI. Debris disks imaged with
unprecedented contrast and inner working angles will reveal distinct signs of
interaction with planets, such as eccentricity of the dust belt, surface density
asymmetries, and gaps. Coupling analytical and numerical models of the dynamical
evolution of dust grains with radiative transfer calculations will enable
detailed scattered-light modeling of each disk with the goal of producing a
physically grounded model that gives strong constraints on the mass and orbital
parameters of the related planet(s). The results of this project will be used to
produce independent estimates of the planet properties from those derived from
the dedicated, multi-year, planet-searching campaign, and provide a unique
viewpoint on the dynamical history of each system.
