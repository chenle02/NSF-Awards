The 2017 "Houston Summer School on Dynamical Systems" will take place May 17-25,
2017 at the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas. This event will introduce
graduate students to recent progress and novel techniques in dynamical systems
and ergodic theory. Particular emphasis will be paid to statistical properties
of systems with some hyperbolicity, and on connections between dynamics and
number theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the school will consist of five
lecture series covering topics in: hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics,
symbolic dynamics, Diophantine approximation, dynamics of group actions on
homogeneous spaces, and linearly recurrent systems. These lectures will be given
by internationally recognized researchers in dynamical systems and its
applications. In addition to the formal lectures there will be informal review
sessions, problem sessions, and project sessions, with the goals of maximizing
interactions between students and lecturers and allowing plenty of opportunity
for discussion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school URL is:
