Jennes 9712928 Many important findings are discovered in a serendipitous
fashion. Dr. Jennes was attempting to synthesize specific antibodies to the
gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) which he hoped to used as neuroanatomical
tools to help understand this important hormone system. As a result of this
work, he isolated two antisera, (antibody #80 and #81), that did not recognize
the GnRH receptor protein but instead had unique neural properties. Dr. Jennes
is now proposing that these two antibodies may lead to the isolation and
identification of novel neural proteins important for the neuroendocrine system.
His preliminary data strongly suggest that the antibodies labeled #80 and #81
recognize two novel unknown proteins that could possibly be a new neuropeptide
and a membrane receptor for a putative hormone, respectively. Based on the
morphology and location of antibody #80 in the axon terminals of the outer layer
of median eminence, Dr. Jennes speculates that it may be recognizing a new
neuropeptide which can be released into the portal system and transported to the
pituitary gland to modulate its hormones. On the other hand, antibody #81 labels
neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, the hypothalamo-
neurohypophyseal tract into the neural lobe of the pituitary as well as axon
terminals in the outer layer of the median eminence and it is absent in brain
regions not accessible to peripheral hormones. Dr. Jennes speculates that #81 is
actually recognizing a novel membrane receptor protein. Using funds available
through the Small Grant for Exploratory Research Program which supports small-
scale, exploratory, high risk research, he will now characterize and sequence
the two proteins. This is the first step towards understanding the function of
what possible could prove to be two novel proteins important for understanding
the endocrine system in the brain.
