The Trek of the Mammoth is a three-week multidisciplinary K-12 science
educators' summer workshop based on a thematic unit about mammoths. The Trek
incorporates field study in a unique rural geographical region with classroom
materials development. Participants will study topics in field biology,
environmental science and earth science with a major emphasis in science
processes and cooperative learning groups. During the Trek teachers will have an
opportunity to observe actual scientists in the field doing research and to
create specimen collections of their own. In addition, participants will study
Lakota ethno-botany and ethno-astronomy and Lakota culture and beliefs, along
with the special educational needs of all minorities. Follow-up activities
during the school year include a "Video pen pal network" for classrooms, a
Science Fun Day and a Prehistoric Hunters of the High Plains olympiad. Phase II
is a three-year implementation program based on an NSF-funded one-year pilot
Trek. The Trek is designed to meet the needs of teachers who traditionally work
with underserved and under-represented students including Native Americans,
Hispanics and rural people. An amount equivalent to 102% of the NSF contribution
is included as cost-sharing.
