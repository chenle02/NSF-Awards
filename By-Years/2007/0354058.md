The REU site in Spectroscopy at Coe College, sponsored jointly by the Physics
and Chemistry departments, continues a tradition of strong interaction with
undergraduate students pursuing high-level, publishable research. REU students
carry out research in glass science, optics, environmental chemistry, organic
synthesis, acoustics, and atmospheric chemistry, all under the common focus of
spectroscopy. They are exposed to and trained in a variety of techniques,
including FTIR, Raman, NMR, time of flight mass spectrometry, absorption and
fluorescence spectroscopies, x-ray fluorescence, thermal calorimetry. Projects
are designed to be suitable for undergraduates, but are also challenging and
leading to results of interest to external researchers. Additional educational
activities provide participating students with a well-rounded exposure to
different spectroscopic techniques. The site is very friendly and student
centered, with students working directly with professors and alongside more
senior research students. The site is especially interested in students from
rural backgrounds who attend small colleges offering little or no opportunities
for research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the Department of
Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;
