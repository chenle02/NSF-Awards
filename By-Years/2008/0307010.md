GeoInformatic surveillance data combined with the right statistical
interpretation can enable detection of anomalies, or hot spots, either
geographically, over time, or both. The need may be for monitoring, etiology,
management, or early warning on topics that are natural, accidental or natural.
Many government applications can benefit from such detection, such as carbon
budgets, ecosystem health, crop pathogens, invasive species, and public health.
This multi-disciplinary grant will develop a prototype system and tool set in
collaboration with several Federal agencies using a statistical method known as
upper level set scan statistic. The prioritization scheme will be based on
multiple criteria using revealing Hasse diagrams and partially ordered sets.
