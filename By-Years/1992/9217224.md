This project proposes the construction of a powerful, variable-field nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer (range from 0 to 2 Tesla) for the
investigation of relaxation and molecular dynamics in a broad range of
materials, including liquid crystals, phospholipid membranes, and polymers, as
well as bonding structure in bioinorganic compounds. Field-cycling NMR (FC-NMR)
is an innovative and rather new technique and such FC-NMR spectrometers are not
commercially available. The major application of the FC-NMR spectrometer will be
to obtain novel information on the relaxation properties of IH, 2H, l9F, and 31P
nuclei in the solid and liquid-crystalline states of various materials at low to
intermediate magnetic fields strengths (0 to 2 Tesla), where measurements using
standard NMR methods are difficult or impossible. The relaxation mechanisms will
yield new information regarding the dynamics of the molecules in the various
materials to be studied. Knowledge of the relaxation in the low magnetic field
(low frequency) region is essential to obtain any comprehensive understanding of
the molecular properties in solids, liquid crystals, and membranes. The FC-NMR
spectrometer will also be used to obtain information regarding the charge
distribution around quadrupolar nuclei, such as 2H, 14N, 17O, and 59Co in
bioinorganic substances, which is essential to achieve a detailed understanding
of their reaction chemistry and their role in enzyme mechanisms.
