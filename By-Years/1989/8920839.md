The Department of Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh will
purchase a 16 node, iPSC2/D4 Hypercube multiprocessor that will be dedicated to
support research in computer science. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including: 1) Fault tolerance in hypercube systems, 2) An
integrated parallel finite element system, 3) A framework for parallelizing
transformations, and 4) Strategies for data partitioning and mapping.
