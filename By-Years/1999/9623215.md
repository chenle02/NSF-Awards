This award provides support for the Paul Catlin Memorial Workshop on Graph
Minors and Eulerian Subgraphs, which will be held in Kalamazoo, Michigan on June
1-2, 1996. The workshop is structured around a series of instructional lectures,
first on graph minors and then on Eulerian subgraphs. The purpose of the
workshop is to bring together workers in these mainstream areas and help them to
merge their methods and ideas. The proposed timing and location of the workshop
are the two days preceding the Eighth Quadrennial International Conference on
Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Algorithms, and Applications being held at Western
Michigan University. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics.
Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research. In addition, the type of enumerative
information being sought in this project has been of use in the design of
geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning.
