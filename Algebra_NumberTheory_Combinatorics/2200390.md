This project investigates the relationship between algebra (Galois
representations), analysis (automorphic forms), and geometry (motives). The
study of this relationship in the past has had a major impact in solving
classical problems in number theory, for example in the solution by Andrew Wiles
in 1995 of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that had remained unresolved for
more than 350 years. The work in this project will advance the paradigmatic
Langlands program, which drives a lot of the current research in modern number
theory. This has broad implications which might also be useful to applications
of number theory where reciprocity laws can provide a powerful computational
tool. The project provides training opportunities for graduate students.

One of the broad themes of algebraic number theory is to prove reciprocity laws
which give a way to understanding the splitting behavior of primes in number
fields, or L-functions of varieties, in terms of more computable and apparently
unrelated objects like automorphic forms. Such reciprocity laws go back to Gauss
and his Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, and have a continuing life in current
mathematics in the guise of the Langlands program. The methods of this proposal
will prove novel cases of such reciprocity laws and establish new relations
between the much studied triad of motives, Galois representations and
automorphic forms. Reciprocity laws have implications for Diophantine geometry
that studies solutions of polynomial equations in integers.
