Establishment of Extended General Physics - An Alternative Course for
Underprepared Students Rutgers is the state university of New Jersey located in
a urban area with 33,000 students on its New Brunswick campus. Most
undergraduates at Rutgers are first generation college students and 30 percent
are minorities. Many are underprepared to succeed in the sciences. Our proposed
project is to create a physics course specifically for underprepared science and
pre-health profession majors that is rigorous, laboratory based, and non-
threatening. Based on our experience with a somewhat similar course for
engineering students and the research findings and developments of others, we
are designing a program with active lectures, cooperative learning, and
qualitative and quantitative laboratories that will help our students succeed in
science and pre-health profession majors and be exportable to other colleges and
universities schools.***//
