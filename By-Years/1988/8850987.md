The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of the role of the
Comprehensive University in U.S. science, engineering and mathematics education.
The Comprehensive Universities are an important segment of the higher education
effort and make a significant contribution toward meeting the nation's needs for
undergraduate education in science, engineering and mathematics. A central part
of the effort is a conference of representatives from the Comprehensive
Universities focusing on the topic. A principal resource for the participants in
the conference is the pre-conference report which analyzes the problems,
describes some approaches for improving undergraduate science, engineering and
mathematics education and offering recommendations for further actions by the
universities, government and private industry.
