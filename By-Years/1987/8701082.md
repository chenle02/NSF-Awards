This proposal requests resources to help support the Fourth International
conference on Numerical Methods in Fracture Mechanics. The objective of the
conference is to consolidate the recent advances in development and application
of numerical methods in fracture mechanics. This conference is an excellent
forum for exchanging information between the computational community and the
leading fracture mechanics researchers and practitioners. The conference will
address theoretical bases and the practical techniques involved in computational
fracture mechanics. Seven major session topics are planned, each initiated with
an invited lecture by a distinguished researcher. The papers will be published
in the proceedings that will be provided to the participants at the conference.
A very rich return on the requested resources is quite certain. An award is
recommended.
