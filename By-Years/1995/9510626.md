This RPG in the Organic Synthesis Program to Professor Akerfeldt of Rutgers
University will be used to design and synthesize artificial proton channels. In
this work the PI will prepare a number of specific peptide sequences which will
self assemble in a membrane and in an electric field to form proton channels.
These model assemblies may be characterized and used to correlate with natural
and uncharacterized systems. The objective is to try several different peptide
sequences to determine how they assemble into conducting pores. Proton or ion
channels regulate the flux of ions across membrane barriers. This is critical
for cell regulation, cellular communication and nerve transmission. The
synthesis and characterization of models of these systems will provide basic
knowledge for extrapolation to the natural systems which at present are too
complicated to characterize.
