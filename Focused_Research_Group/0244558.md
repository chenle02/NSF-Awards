This is a Division of Mathematical Sciences Focused Research Group (FRG) award
made under solicitation http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02129/nsf02129.htm

The goal of this proposal is to find purely topological (continuous or
combinatorial) definitions of the invariants arising out of Seiberg-Witten
theory. These include the basic classes for 4-dimensional manifolds, and the
Oszvath-Szabo Floer homology for 3-manifolds. Recent progress, in particular the
striking results of Ozsvath and Szabo in the last two years, has brought
Seiberg-Witten theory seemingly close to topology, and a concerted effort by
this group may be able finish the task.

This proposal falls under the larger topics of gauge theory and string theory,
which are closely connected to and motivated by theoretical physics, in
particular the attempt to unify the forces of nature. Low-dimensional bordism
theory is the mathematical analogue of n+1 dimensional quantum field theories,
i.e. an n-dimensional space and 1-dimensional time correspond to an
(n+1)-dimensional bordism between two n-dimensional manifolds. These bordisms
can have extra structure, e.g. contact structures in odd dimensions and
symplectic structures in even dimensions. Progress in understanding the
mathematical underpinnings of this sort of physics feeds back into better
understanding of the physics.
