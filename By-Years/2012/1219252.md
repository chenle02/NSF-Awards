Contrary to some depictions in popular media, humans are still far better than
any computer program at understanding the visual world around them. If we
understood how the visual system does this, perhaps better artificial vision
systems could be built. The goal of this project is to understand how the brain
represents the visual world and why. Following a mantra famously credited to
Richard Feynman -- What I cannot create, I do not understand -- this project's
approach is to create a computer system that learns from natural input (images,
videos), assuming that the visual system operates with the goal of efficiently
representing the world. These representations will then be compared to
measurements of visual neurons. The long term goal is to understand the
functional roles of the early visual processing layers in the human visual
pathway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model is based on the efficient coding
hypothesis, in which the early visual pathway serves to capture the statistical
structure of its visual inputs by efficiently coding visual information in its
outputs. Most computational models following this hypothesis have focused on
modeling only one or two visual layers. In this project, Cottrell's group
proposes a hierarchical information processing model, which concurs with the
efficient coding hypothesis, yet provides the most complete description so far
of the early visual processing layers. In this model, the visual inputs are
first compressed to reduce noise using Sparse Principal Components Analysis
(SPCA), then the data dimensions are expanded to capture the statistical
structure of the visual inputs using overcomplete Sparse Coding. A nonlinear
activation function then formats the outputs of this layer for the next layer
up, and the whole process is repeated. Preliminary work shows that the resulting
hierarchical model can learn visual features exhibiting the receptive field
properties of neurons in the early visual pathway, including retinal ganglion
cells, LGN, V1 simple and complex cells, and V2 cells.
