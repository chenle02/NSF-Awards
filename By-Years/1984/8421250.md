This work explores the fundamentals of the mechanism of transient natural
convection in a two-dimensional porous medium confined between isothermal
vertical and insulated horizontal walls. Relevant internal time scales are
determined governing the transient evolution of the fluid-saturated porous layer
to verify the validity of the scale analysis. Numerical experiments are
performed to calculate the heat transfer rate in those steady states not
documented in the literature. All of the engineering heat transfer correlation
will be updated.
