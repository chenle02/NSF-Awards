This equipment will enable an interdisciplinary consortium of faculty from the
Departments of Biology, Psychology, and Biomedical Engineering at Saint Louis
University located in midtown St. Louis, MO. Many of the faculty have used
confocal microscopy in their research, but the lack of a facility on this campus
limits access, particularly for undergraduate and graduate students, and hinders
the ability of researchers to conduct experiments that involve live samples and
time-lapse imaging. The work of the researchers submitting this grant
encompasses a wide scientific scope and includes both basic and applied science
and engineering. This microscope will be available to students in Cell Biology,
Development, Biomaterials and Neuroscience laboratory courses and facilitate
integration of traditional teaching laboratories with research.
