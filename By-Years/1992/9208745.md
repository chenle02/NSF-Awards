Johnson This research is on developing formal techniques to decompose higher-
level system specifications into interacting sequential processes. A functional
algebra is used for defining formal representations and building a set of
transformations for manipulating them. The notion of "interaction schemes" is
the central subject. The project is composed of four activities: 1. theoretical
studies of the decomposition of digital systems; especially formal derivation of
control-synchronization and data- communication protocols; 2. automation of
formal transformations which correctly do sequential decompositions; 3.
integration of the mechanized formal system with available CAD tools, and other
reasoning systems; and 4. application of the design system to meaningful
examples of digital-system designs.
