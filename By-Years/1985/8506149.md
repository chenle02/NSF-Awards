Adaptive control algorithms presently dominating the theoretical literature have
recently been demonstrated to behave poorly when assumptions used to prove their
idealized behavior are violated. Though such violations undoubtedly occur in
practice, adaptive controllers have been repeatedly documented as successful in
a variety of applications. This research will focus on eliminating the theory-
practice gap due to the impractical, current theoretical limitation that the
controller structure be sufficient to arbitrarily modify all modes of the plant
behavior. Thus, the aim of this research is the development of a theoretical
framework for describing, and subsequently improving, the robustness of
restricted complexity adaptive controllers. The major directions to be pursued
are the characterization of undesirable parameter estimate drift in restricted
complexity adaptive control as well as generation and evaluation of algorithm
fixes given improved understanding of stability/instability mechanisms in
existing algorithms.
