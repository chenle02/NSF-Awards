The principal investigator proposes to construct miniature fiber optic chemical
sensors (FOCS) for the in-situ, nondestructive analysis of gases and liquids in
living plants in their microenvironments. This will be accomplished by using
remote fiber fluorimetry, a new technology that integrates fiber optics, lasers,
chemistry, optics, and spectroscopy. The key to this approach is the FOCS, a
fiber optic with a chemically reactive tip at its distal end. Proper selection
of the FOCS chemistry provides a sensitive, species-specific sensor. In the
proposed research, emphasis will be on miniaturizing these sensors so that they
ultimately can be inserted into the tissues of living plants. Phase one will
focus on the carbon dioxide FOCS. In phase two FOCS for oxygen and water will be
researched. Together development of these FOCS will enable in-situ measurements
during photosynthesis.
