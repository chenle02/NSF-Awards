This project will use combinatorial and computational techniques to further our
understanding of conformal dynamics, in particular studying the dynamics of
rational maps from a topological and algorithmic point of view. This is a
continuation of previous work of the PI on characterizing rational maps among
self maps of the sphere. The project will also conduct outreach to the broader
community and mathematical training at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

The project will utilize the PI's graphical techniques for understanding and
analyzing the topology of these maps, and especially the energies introduced for
maps between graphs. In the past, this led to a positive characterization
theorem, giving a concrete combinatorial object that certifies when a given
topological map from the sphere to itself is equivalent to a rational map. This
project will improve the positive characterization theorem to cover more cases
like: extensions to other related questions, including dynamics of
transcendental maps and Fuchsian groups; better understanding and estimates of
the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, a measure of the "thickness" of sets,
for Julia sets and other dynamically interesting subsets of the plane; a
polynomial time algorithm for finding rational maps; and a better understanding
of convexity in the context of geodesic currents and measured laminations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
