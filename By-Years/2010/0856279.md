Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Portals of Discovery, a partnership between the
University of Wisconsin-Manitowoc and the University of Wisconsin-Stout, engages
and retains students in STEM fields through collaborative research. Students
move through a pipeline of STEM education from high school to a two year,
associate degree-granting institution and then to degree completion at the
baccalaureate institution. The goals of the project are to recruit new
populations of STEM students, retain STEM students during the crucial early
stages of their education, and see those students through to the completion of
their baccalaureate degrees. The project includes 1) summer research workshops
and research-based curriculum development at the high school level, 2) financial
support, peer tutoring, faculty and peer mentoring circles, curriculum
development, and participation in undergraduate research at the two year campus,
and 3) a 10-week research immersion program for transferring students, continued
faculty mentoring, participation in undergraduate research, and student
opportunities to serve as peer mentors at the 4-year
campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complete integration of research, coursework,
and mentorship across institutions ensures that STEM students have a persistent
support network throughout their undergraduate career. Research activities
develop critical thinking, technical skills, and confidence. Outreach and mentor
support networks reach students of diverse demographic backgrounds who otherwise
would be unlikely to pursue or persist in STEM education. The model is being
developed for expansion across all twenty six UW-System two and four year
campuses, resulting in a comprehensive effort to alleviate Wisconsin's need to
increase the technology workforce.&lt;br/&gt;
