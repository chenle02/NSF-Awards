This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program will aid a junior faculty in the Department of Structural Biology at the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory acquire a Multiple Column Peptide synthesizer for
combinatorial chemistry. This equipment will be used to prepare substrate for
screening of libraries and resynthesize molecular forceps that show affinity to
these substrates in the screenings. A multiple peptide synthesizer allows the
preparation of twelve peptidic compounds simultaneously. The synthesizer enable
a scientist to concentrate efforts in the actual generation and screening of the
combinatorial libraries.
