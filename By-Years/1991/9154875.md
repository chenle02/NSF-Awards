Southwest Texas State University will initiate a four-week, residential Young
Scholars project in mathematics for 40 students entering grades 11 and 12. The
project will excite young students about doing mathematics, teach the students
to think rigorously and precisely, and develop inquisitive, questioning minds.
Students will learn elementary number theory using a computer lab where they
apply Mathematica to discover new patterns and implement and compare algorithms.
They will engage in problem solving in a mathematical setting linking
experiments with computers to real-life problems in physics, biology and
economics.
