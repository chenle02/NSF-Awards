This three year model program will assist a significant portion of the
estimated 2,000 high school biology teachers in the Texas Gulf Coast Region, to
implement biotechnology concepts in their Introductory Biology classrooms. The
model to be employed, the Texas Biotechnology Teacher Enhancement Program (BTEP)
model, consists of extensive training of previous four day workshop participants
in three-week summer institutes; coupled with a collaborative network of
scientists from the private sector, Texas A&amp;M Research and Extension Centers
and cooperating institutions: a broad based Advisory Board; and a highly skilled
staff which will carry out a carefully designed implementation support process
and project data collection. Upon successful implementation in their classrooms,
selected institute participants will lead awareness and four day workshop
activities in their local areas, with support from local Research and Extension
Centers and cooperating institutions. Specifically, 1,200 Biology I teachers
will attend awareness sessions (1-2 hours), 440 Biology I teachers will
participate in four day workshops, and 90 Biology I teachers will participate in
three three-week summer institutes (held at Texas A&amp;M and other regional
sites). Cost sharing equals 14.8% of the NSF award.
