Foraminifera are major primary producers of organic carbon and sinks of
nutrients and carbonate in ocean waters. Although all foraminifera contain one
of a wide variety of algal symbionts, the diatom-bearing larger foraminifera are
a unique form of the symbiotic phenomenon. However, the biological basis for the
broad adaptation of foraminifera to symbiosis remains unknown. This project will
test several testable hypotheses to understand the molecular basis whereby these
marine protists recongnize specific algal species as endosymbionts and others as
food. Previous research has already identified the fibrous net outside of the
foraminifera shell as the contact site for recognition. The goal of this project
is to compare the surface antigens of endosymbiotic and free-living diatoms as
possible recognition sites for the initial steps in the pathways leading to the
establishment of endosymbiosis or digestion. Immunochemical techniques will be
used to screen cross-reactive antigens of diatoms that are involved in the
interaction of diatoms with foraminifera.
