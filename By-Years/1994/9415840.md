This research will assess the importance of electric field variability as an
upper-atmosphere energy source. Data from incoherent scatter and satellite
observations will be used to define the relevant temporal and spatial scales and
to determine the statistical characteristics of high-latitude E-field
variability. This information will be used to parameterize an additional energy
source in the high-latitude thermosphere, for use in general circulation models.
A coupled thermosphere-ionosphere general circulation model will then be used to
determine the significance of this additional energy source for the chemical
composition, temperature, and dynamics of the upper atmosphere.
