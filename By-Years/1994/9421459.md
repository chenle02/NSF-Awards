The proposed research has three primary goals: (1) to investigate the
relationship between objective measures of cognitive control, and self-report
measures of awareness, (2) to contrast different assumptions concerning the
relationship between automatic and controlled influences of perception and of
memory, and (3) to explore a variety of manipulations that may selectively
affect the two types of influence. Research aimed at examining the relation
between automatic and controlled processes has the additional goal of further
examining the assumptions that underlie the process-dissociation procedure, a
procedure developed to separate the contributions of automatic and controlled
influences to overall task performance. What is the relation between subjective
experience and effects of perception and memory on task performance? Results of
recent research provide striking examples of perceptual analysis in the absence
of `seeing` and effects of the past in the absence of `remembering.` For
example, amnesics show effects of practicing a task in their later performance
even though they are unable to remember having practiced. Similar dissociations
are shown by people with normally functioning memory. The proposed research
extends previous work done to develop a process-dissociation procedure that
allows one to separate the contributions of controlled (conscious) and automatic
(unconscious) components to performance of a task. Among the topics investigated
are unconscious perception and unconscious influences of memory.
