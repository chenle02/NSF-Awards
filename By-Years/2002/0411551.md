In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. Lucy Ziurys of the University of Arizona will conduct
research with her student colleagues on the measurement of the microwave spectra
of an extensive series of 3d transition metal-containing species. The goal of
the research is to study systematic trends in the bonding and electronic
structure of these simple metal-ligand systems. Given the ubiquity of transition
metals in chemical and biological systems, the results of this basic research
are expected to inform other areas of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the
broader scientific impact of the research, the research will result in the
training of numerous undergraduate and graduate students in spectroscopic
research. The results of the research will be documented on a website maintained
by Prof. Ziurys. The ultimate goal of this website is to provide a tutorial for
the basic concepts of molecular spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;
