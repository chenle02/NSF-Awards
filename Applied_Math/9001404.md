With this award the principal investigator will continue his modelling of
elliptical galactic systems and the analytical solution of the model problems.
In particular, he will construct self-consistent models of elliptical galaxies
by means of Staeckel potentials. The main reasons for using Staeckel potentials
are that they allow the same major orbit families as those found from numerical
simulations of realistic galactic models and they lead to mathematically
tractable problems. The aspect of astronomy that most of us are familiar with
involves the use of telescopes to make observations of stars and galaxies.
Another aspect that is less well known involves the construction of mathematical
models of celestial objects in order to gain a greater understanding of the
physics of stellar systems. This research involves the construction and analysis
of a model for elliptical galaxies by means of a potential that describes an
interacting system of many bodies.
