Methyl halides are important trace gases in atmospheric chemistry. Methyl
bromide and methyl chloride supply a significant amount of inorganic chlorine
and bromine to the stratosphere where they catalyze ozone loss. Methyl chloride,
methyl bromide and methyl iodide are also active in lower atmosphere chemistry
and may impact the cleansing rate of the troposphere. Consequently, methyl
bromide, a widely used agricultural fumigant, is being regulated in the U.S. and
abroad. As anthropogenic sources of these gases decline with time due to
regulation natural halogen sources will dominate. Agricultural emissions of
these gases must be quantified and understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent field
research has shown that globally significant amounts of methyl bromide and
methyl iodide are produced by worldwide rice agriculture. We propose to
determine the effects of certain abiotic factors (including soil halide amounts
and light levels) on methyl halide production in rice and to examine the
underlying physiology and biochemistry of the plant response. These studies will
incorporate in-situ (seasonal greenhouse measurements) and in-vivo (leaf-disk
enzyme assays) studies&lt;br/&gt;
