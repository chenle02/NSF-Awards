Dai Interconnection topology and metrics needed for laying out high-speed
interconnections in multi-chip modules are being pursued. The first topic is
optimal design of transmission lines for multi-chip modules (MCM). These are
self-damped lossy transmission lines in a tree network, which propagates high-
speed signals. Algorithms to implement a robust method for designing these
transmission lines are being developed. Attention is paid to distortion-free
signal propagation, cross-talk, switching noise, and thermal resistance. The
second topic is routing of clock signals for optimum system performance. An
algorithm is being developed to construct a planer clock tree which can be
embedded on a single layer of metal. Path length from the clock source to each
clock terminal is exactly the same. The third topic is a multiple bus network
for parallel processing which matches the MCM requirements of higher I/O pin
count and inter- chip routing density. An algorithm with good fault tolerant
properties that leads to uniform bus load and processor fanout is being
developed.
