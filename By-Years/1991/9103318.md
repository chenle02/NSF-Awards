In projects (1) and (2) the focus is on obtaining bounds on the number of
integral solutions of certain classes of diophantine equations over function
fields which depend only on the number of monomials of the equation. This
problem which seemed so inaccessible a few years ago, has recently made
significant progress and the success is largely due to the abc- inequality. The
proposed research in project (3) is to investigate Siegels conjecture over
complex number fields. Project (4) deals with Thue's equation F(x,y)=1 over the
rational. The object here is to show that the number of integral solutions can
be bounded in terms of the number of large coefficients of F only. The project
is in an area of number theory where the methods of proof are extremely
complicated and technical. It furthers VPW program objectives to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or engineering
through research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in these areas
through the investigators' enhanced visibility as role models on the host
campuses. In this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the
second objective include: teaching a graduate course, co-sponsoring the Number
Theory seminar, and organizing a new seminar. The aim of the last project is to
offer women mathematicians greater stimulation in research and interaction with
other mathematicians.
