Wachs 9701407 The PI intends to continue her current research in algebraic
combinatorics, focusing on topological and algebraic properties of partially
ordered sets. The theory of poset topology, which grew out of the famous 1964
paper of Rota on the Moebius function of a partially ordered set, provides a
deep and fundamental link between combinatorics and other branches of
mathematics such as topology, algebra and geometry. One major impetus for this
study has come from Stanley's consideration of group actions on the homology of
posets in a seminal 1982 paper, another comes from Bjorner's pioneering paper on
shellable posets and still another comes from its fundamental connection with
the theory of hyperplane arrangements as developed by Orlik and Solomon. A more
recent and extremely important development in the theory of poset topology is
Goresky and MacPherson's link to the theory of subspace arrangements. This has
lead to applications in complexity theory due to Bjorner, Lovasz and Yao. These
recent developments have lead Bjorner and the PI to extend the theory of
shellability from pure to nonpure simplicial complexes and posets. Shellability
is a combinatorial tool for establishing certain topological and algebraic
properties of simplicial complexes and posets. The nonpure setting provides for
a richer and more powerful theory that the PI plans to continue to explore and
develop. This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals
of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete
collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is
extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large
networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of
algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this
makes use of combinatorial research.
