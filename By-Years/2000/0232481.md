This SBIR Phase I program involves the development of a solid-state proton
conductor (SSPC) suitable for intermediate temperature applications, i.e.,
&gt;100 to ~300C. We will develop an ultra-thin (&lt;1 m) dense film (using a
properly selected inorganic electrolyte), which is supported on our existing
commercial ceramic membranes as a solid-state proton conductor (SSPC). Based
upon the specific conductivity, the proposed ultra-thin proton conductor can
potentially deliver a hydrogen permeance comparable to or better than existing
polymeric (e.g., Nafion) and high temperature (e.g., perovskite) proton
conductors and permit operation at the intermediate temperature ranges.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SSPC can be used as (i) a hydrogen pump for hydrogen
recovery from waste/recycle streams, (ii) a 2nd stage hydrogen separator to
conventional pressure-driven membranes for further hydrogen separations without
an interstage compressor, and (iii) a membrane reactor (MR) to enhance the
conversion/yield of industrial dehydrogenation reactions.&lt;br/&gt;
