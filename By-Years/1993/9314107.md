Biomedical Engineering Conference. The conference will be held at the University
of the District of Columbia in April 1994. The award will help support keynote
speakers, student awards, student assistants and miscellaneous costs. The
conference has a long history. By hosting the conference, the University of the
District of Columbia, a Historically Black University, will receive greater
visibility in the Biomedical Engineering community. In addition, the students at
the university will benefit directly, both through employment and participation.
