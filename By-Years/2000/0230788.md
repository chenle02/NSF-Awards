National reports over the last decade have focused on the need for change in the
way mathematics is taught at the secondary and post-secondary levels. Discovery-
learning and the increased use of technology are two teaching strategies that
have figured prominently in mathematics education reform efforts and are
principal themes in the current standards for teaching mathematics at the
secondary level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry is an ideal course in which to
model discovery-learning and the use of technology for future teachers is
college geometry, since most mathematics education majors take it as a required
course. There are few, if any, materials that successfully integrate these two
themes as fundamental ways of investigating geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
development of a textbook and computer software materials that use discovery-
learning and computer exploration for the teaching of geometry offers
significant intellectual merit to this project. This materials developed from
this project provides a national model for discovery-learning that integrates
technology, so that mathematics education students will be well versed in both
themes useful in investigating geometry &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader
impact of " Exploring Geometry: Integrated Textbook and Software for College
Geometry" is realized through the development, testing, and revision of
innovative materials that targets college and university faculty who teach
geometry and pre-service teachers. In the area of teacher preparation, there are
recognized needs for strengthening both subject knowledge and pedagogical
technique of future teachers so that they can assist students from diverse
backgrounds. This project is one attempt at addressing these needs.
