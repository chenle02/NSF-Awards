We plan to study a variety of free boundary problems. The first one deals with
growing polymeric crystallines. The unknowns are temperature in the melt and the
growing surface. The speed of the free boundary is a given function of the
temperature, and free boundary points move in such a direction so as to minimize
the travel time. We wish to establish the existence of the solution and to
determine the shape of the free boundary. The second problem deals with non-
Newtonian jets. We want to approach it via nonlinear perturbation of the
linearized case, a case we have recently studied. The next problem is to develop
a general bifurcation theory for free boundary problems. Here we expect to be
guided by recent work that we have done dealing with special models that arise
in mathematical biology. In order to determine the stability of the bifurcation,
we shall first study the asymptotic behavior of solutions of free boundary
problems, including the Hele-Shaw problem and the evolution of viscous drops.
Subsequently we shall consider the more complicated problems that arise in
mathematical biology, such as the evolution of tumors and of protocells.
Finally, we shall study the evolution of cracks in elastic media. We expect to
utilize formulas that we have derived for the evolution of the stress intensity
factors.

Free boundary problems deal with solving partial differential equations in a
domain, a part of whose boundary is unknown in advance; that portion of the
boundary is called a free boundary. In addition to the usually prescribed
initial and boundary conditions, an additional condition is imposed at the free
boundary, and one seeks to determine both the free boundary and the solution to
the differential equations. A seemingly small change in the conditions imposed
at the free boundary often result in, technically, an entirely different
problem. Special examples have historically guided research in this field; some
of the most commonly known examples are flow of liquid in contact with air, air
streams behind an aircraft, solidification of steel, and melting of solid.
Special examples motivated by physical models continue to be a driving force in
the development of the field. The present proposal focuses on several different
problems dealing with questions such as crystallization of polymers, jet flows
for non-Newtonian fluid (e.g. inkjets), bifurcation of free boundary problems
arising in biology, nonlinear stability, and propagation of cracks in elastic
media. In all these problems, the goal is to prove that there is a mathematical
solution to the scientific problem and to determine properties of the free
boundary.
