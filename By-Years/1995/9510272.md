9510272 Brown The primary goals of this project are to establish the generic
principles which allow organic-inorganic composites having controlled
microstructures to be designed and to establish mechanistic paths governing
self-assembly of composites formed by reaction in aqueous solutions. Three
technical objectives will be pursued: (1) to concentrate on establishing the
relationships between the chemistry of the inorganic matrix phase, the kinetics
of its formation, and the attendant microstructural development; (2) to explore
the use of polymers having specific polymer conformations and functional groups
and thereby to investigate the interaction between these polymers and the matrix
phases; and (3) establish effects of the polymeric structures and the hydrolysis
of the matrix phase precursors on the formation of polymer crosslinks. The
investigation of adsorption phenomenon and interaction with surfaces having
spatially and compositional controlled functional groups will also be explored.
%%% This research project is important to the design and development of chemical
routes to form composites. It emulates the attributes of biological composite
materials associated with their formation at net shape, low temperature and
pressure. ***
