Chemistry (12) For many chemistry students, physical chemistry is the capstone
course of their undergraduate careers. This project integrates laboratory and
classroom experiences in physical chemistry while introducing students to modern
experimental and computational methods and building skills in problem solving
and scientific communication. &lt;br/&gt;For the laboratory components of this
project a nitrogen-pumped dye laser, workstations, and an FT-Raman modification
for an existing spectrometer are being acquired. Enhancements adapted from both
the educational and research literature are being designed to closely integrate
the laboratory with the lecture course and introduce experiments that employ
both computational and modern laser-based spectroscopic methods. The new
activities are also designed to stimulate problem solving skills and inquiry
based learning in independent student projects and provide experience in both
oral and written communication.&lt;br/&gt;A visiting instructor from an
undergraduate institution is also participating in the project. The project
impacts a wide range of students, including chemistry majors who take a full
year of physical chemistry as well as students who take only a single semester.
