Rees 9723050 Conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia) in fresh, brackish and marine
waters are brought about by both natural processes and human activity. Since
many important metabolic processes require oxygen, a decrease in oxygen
availability is a potentially life-threatening situation for the organisms that
live in these environments. One way to compensate for a decrease in oxygen is to
shift to metabolic pathways that do not require oxygen. This research will
evaluate this response in a common inhabitant of coastal estuaries, the Gulf
killifish, Fundulus grandis. The activities of enzymes (the protein molecules
that catalyze the reactions of metabolism) will be determined in fish exposed to
hypoxia in the laboratory. These measurements will show whether these enzymes
change in a manner that reflects an increased reliance upon oxygen-independent
metabolic pathways. If the initial phase of this work shows a change in enzyme
activity, then the later phase will investigate the mechanism of this change.
This research will lead to a better understanding of how this species, and
potentially other, commercially important species, respond to environmental
hypoxia.
