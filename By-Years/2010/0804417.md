The award is to fund the development and implementation of a non-redundant mask
interferometer for use with the 200 inch Hale Telescope at Mt. Palomar. The mask
will be used in conjunction with a high-order adaptive optics system, currently
being developed at California Institute of Technology, and will feed an integral
field unit spectrograph. This instrument will enable detection of faint
companions, such as brown dwarfs and massive planets in close proximity to
nearby stars. Many extra-solar planets have already been detected by the
indirect technique of high-resolution spectroscopy but this instrument will
permit direct imaging at different wavelengths permitting detailed analysis of
the size and composition of these massive planets and low-mass stellar
companions.

The direct detection of extra-solar planets is a very topical scientific
research area and also one which captures the public imagination. The project
will be carried out at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City
and will have high visibility due to the Museum?s public outreach.
