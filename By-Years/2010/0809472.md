The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the collaborative research program of Prof. James Evans and Prof.
Patricia Thiel of Iowa State University. Profs. Evans and Thiel and their
students will study the self assembly and stability properties of metal
nanostructures on surfaces. Detailed analysis and elucidation of these systems
will be achieved by a closely integrated combination of experiment (scanning
tunneling microscopy and surface sensitive diffraction) together with theory and
simulation (from ab-initio DFT and semi-empirical calculations of energetics, to
atomistic modeling of nanoscale organization utilizing Kinetic Monte Carlo
simulation, and possibly hybrid/multiscale or coarse-grained continuum
formulations). These studies will provide the basic scientific underpinnings for
a broad range of nanotechnologies based on thin film deposition. The study will
provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and
postdoctoral trainees in the cutting edge area of nanostructures imaging and
theory.
