*** 9661732 Redi This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
introduce novel energy-saving protocols which are critical for the successful
wide range commercial deployment of wireless tag networks. A myriad of
applications are emerging in which communication between low speed - very low
cost tags (wireless nodes) and base stations designates energy conservation as a
critical system parameter, such as warehouse identification tags, hospital ID
tags, smart tags, intelligent ID cards, to name only a few of these
applications. Tags are small devices with radio or infrared
reception/transmission and processing capabilities, integrated in the size of an
ID card or smaller, designed for the lowest possible cost. Cost minimization and
network size prohibit the replacement of batteries which need to last for as
long as the object needs to be identified, from weeks to several years. The
design of wireless access protocols for tag networks requires, therefore, that
transmission of, often delay sensitive data, occur under critical energy
conservation and cost constraints. As classical access protocols do not meet
these requirements, this project will introduce and evaluate several novel
classes of protocols designated for these emerging low speed - low cost
networks. The market potential for these systems is estimated at billions of
dollars per year, underscoring the importance of this work. ***
