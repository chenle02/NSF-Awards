This study aims to evaluate the validity, and hence the utility, of suicide
statistics in the United States, an essential prerequisite for analyzing the
causes of suicide. This research follows up on earlier work by the principal
investigators which found a misreporting of suicide in 1969- 70. The present
study draws on sociological theory to examine how the personal, professional and
community ties of coroners and medical examiners operate to influence their
decisions in classifying "suspicious" deaths. This network approach will be
tested using data collected from all coroners and medical examiners in the
United States in 1989 and 1990. These data will be used in conjunction with
other data from the U.S. Census, the National Council of Churches, and the
Nation Center for Health Statistics. Given the growing concern about the rise in
reported rates of suicide in the United States, especially among youth, research
on the reporting process itself is critical. This study should shed light on how
official rates might be adjusted to identify high risk groups and, in the
process, clarify the underlying causes of suicide.
