9418090 Veblen The proposed work will involve applications of transmission
electron microscopy and ancillary techniques to problems important in the fields
of petrology, geochemistry, geophysics, and environmental mineralogy. The
underlying thread of the research is to understand the crystal chemistry of
minerals and their reactions at the sub- nanometer scale. Topics to be explored
include: in situ variable-temperature studies of the C2/c - P21/c phase
transition in monoclinic pyroxene, the structural state of excess Ca in
monoclinic pyroxenes, mixed layer illite- smectite and defect structures of
mixed layer chlorites- serpentines, structural and chemical changes in thermally
heated asbestos, time series studies of tremolite and other amphiboles during
synthesis, quench products from high pressure DAC experiments of high-pressure
peridotite, and mosaic-equilibrium domain size of layer silicates as a function
of prograde, low temperature metamorphism.
