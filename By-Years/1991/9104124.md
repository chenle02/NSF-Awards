A user mode research program will be carried out in fundamental electroweak
interactions and in the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon. The former
studies will be conducted at TRIUMF in Canada and involve radiative muon capture
in hydrogen. A much improved determination of the induced pseudoscalar weak
interaction coupling constant will be obtained and will be used to test the
Goldberger- Treiman relation in weak interactions. The electric and magnetic
polarizabilities of the proton and neutron will be determined in another
experiment using Compton scattering of linearly polarized gammas available at
the Brookhaven National Lab Laser Electron (backscattering) Gamma Source.
Results from the latter work will be compared to calculations based on
fundamental quantum chromo-dynamics.
