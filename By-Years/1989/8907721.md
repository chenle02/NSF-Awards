The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is providing some of the funds to
support travel of participants to an international conference-particularly for
some of the junior participants (e.g.,Assistant Professors), to subsidize
graduate students and post doctorates by permitting them to attend at a lower
fee than more senior participants. This is The Second International Conference
on Heteroatom Chemistry to be held July 16-21, 1989 on the campus of the State
University of New York (SUNY) at Albany in Albany, NY. The purpose of this
conference is to bring together in an international forum, academic and
industrial researchers studying organic compounds containing such heteroatoms as
Sb, Bi, B, F, P, Se, Si, S, Te, and Sn for such varied purposes as organic
synthesis, and mechanistic and structure-theoretical investigations in order to
promote a broader interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge than is possible at
more specialized meetings. The topics to be emphasized at the Heteroatom
Conference include heteroatom-directed organic synthesis, synthesis and
reactions of chiral heteratomic compounds, heteroatom-containing enzyme
inhibitors, theoretical-structural studies of heteroatomic systems, and uncommon
bonding involving heteroatoms. The format of this conference provides 12 hour-
long and 12 half-hour-long formal presentations by invited speakers, selected
15-minute talks, two poster sessions and several social events. The speakers and
participants come from a variety of countries.
