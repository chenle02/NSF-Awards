This award will support a workshop on the topic of parallel algorithms and data
structures to be held at the University of Hawaii at Manoa on December 9-13,
2019. This workshop will bring together researchers in parallel algorithms and
from broader algorithms community to present recent advances in modeling modern
parallel systems and to perform research solving open problems in parallel
algorithms and data structures. Students will be exposed to the research
environment and will have an opportunity to engage in research. The University
of Hawaii is a Native Hawaiian-serving institution, and the workshop will
promote participation by underrepresented groups in
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
