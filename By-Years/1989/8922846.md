San Jose State University will operate the R/V POINT SUR during 1990 as a
general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The R/V
POINT SUR is a 135' general research vessel constructed in 1981 and owned by the
National Science Foundation. San Jose State operates the POINT SUR under a
charter agreement with NSF. The ship operates primarily for short cruises off
the California coast. This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National
Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most
oceanographic research projects require highly specialized equipment and
extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number of research
projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a ship and for
which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires
highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not
operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore,
NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to
oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities and research
institutions around the country.
