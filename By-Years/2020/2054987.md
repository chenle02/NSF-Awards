In nature, there are many phenomena that exhibit fractal features, such
lightning bolts, growth patterns of plants and crystals, snowflakes, or
coastlines and river networks. In mathematics, fractal objects often appear in
the study of dynamical systems. This project will explore the geometry of
certain fractal spaces. The principal investigator will develop better analytic
and geometric tools for an improved understanding of fractals that arise from
very specific dynamical systems, namely so-called expanding Thurston maps. The
involvement of early-career researchers in this activity will contribute to
increasing the expertise in the field, and will help to maintain a scientific
community that provides the necessary mathematical knowledge for progress in
science and engineering. The project includes the training of graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanding Thurston maps provide a surprisingly rich
landscape with ties to fractals, Teichmüller theory, geometric group theory, and
hyperbolic geometry. While there are many interesting questions in this field,
in this project specific problems will be singled out whose resolution will lead
to advanced insights into the subject. These problems are related to Thurston
obstructions, the induced pull-back map on Teichmüller space, and the geometry
of the visual sphere associated with an expanding Thurston map. An important
numerical invariant of these spheres will be studied, namely their Ahlfors
regular conformal dimension. A fundamental technical tool for this investigation
is the notion of combinatorial modulus of path families. It seems that
obstructions for Thurston maps are tied to path families of degenerating
modulus. One of the goals of this project is to get a better grasp of this
connection, which is only poorly understood at
present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
