Proposal No. 0343712 is a continuation of an existing evaluation study designed
to review the impact of the Rural Systemic Initiative (RSI) Program. Since
October 1, 2001, Systemic Research, Inc. has been working on this two-year NSF
grant titled "Mathematics and Science Education in Rural America: An Evaluative
Study of NSF's Rural Systemic Initiative." Hence, the proposal requests support
to continue collecting data through the 2002-03 school year. The collection and
analysis of the 2002-2003 data will complete a decade of ongoing research and
evaluation of the RSI. The current activities of the grant to be expanded as a
result of a one-year extension are:&lt;br/&gt;Development, collection, and
compilation of RKID-2004&lt;br/&gt;Rural Math and Science Indicator
Report:2004&lt;br/&gt;Publication of updated RSI Case Stories with additional
indicator data&lt;br/&gt;RSI/RKID web site upgrade for enhanced communication,
RKID management, and dissemination&lt;br/&gt;RSI/RKID Annual
