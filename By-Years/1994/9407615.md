9407615 Bronstein The study of mutualism has lagged behind the study of other
interactions between organisms. Several features of mutualism, notably the
inherent conflicts of interests between mutualists, suggest that these
interactions may be easily perturbed and unstable. Yet mutualisms are important
and common relationships in most ecosystems. This project attempts to test some
new ideas about how mutualisms persist successfully in nature. Specifically, the
PI's will test the idea that mutualists' fates are linked by extrinsic factors
that simultaneously limit both partners' success, and that this variance often
cancels out the inherent conflict between mutualists. The study system used is
the relationship between figs and fig wasps. This research will improve our
understanding of the ecology of mutualisms and elucidate the role of extrinsic
factors in creating stability in otherwise inherently unstable systems. The
results may have application in conservation biology, including the design and
management nature reserves, and in agricultural pollination.
