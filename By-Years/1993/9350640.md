The project is creating an introductory laboratory environment in which the
student is allowed to focus attention as completely as possible on physics
principles. This is being accomplished by eliminating distractions of poorly
functioning equipment, outmoded data collection techniques, and mathematical
tedium. Modern, up-to-date computers, electronic data collection via
transducers, and software for data analysis are being used in the introductory
physics laboratory. The new environment allows students to identify more easily
the underlying physical principles and explore their consequences more
efficiently and effectively than previously possible. Many of the experiments
emphasize the relevance of physics to everyday life. These improvements are
improving student interest in physics as a possible career or as a component of
their education.A secondary goal is the enhancement of the technological
awareness of the introductory students. It is desired that students will
effectively use modern techniques in more advanced laboratory settings, whether
physics or other areas. By integrating the data collection process with video-
assisted tutorial presentations and analysis and display of results, the
students are using the power of this more advanced equipment without treating it
as a "black box". It is believed that the result of this project will be physics
students with a better grasp of physical principles, of the technology necessary
to solve them, and will appreciate the role physics plays in their every day
lives.
