0217100 Eberhardt This award continues Design Projects' activities begun under
NSF award #9704215 at the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), in which
students designed and built custom projects for people with disabilities. The
objectives of the activities are to enhance engineering education, provide
students with insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of
life of people with disabilities, and to serve the community. The previous award
led to the successful completion of numerous projects and training of over 40
undergraduate students in basic design principles. Projects are to be featured
in regional news media and local television specials, and will be described in
international symposia. This new project is expected to expand the number of
design projects and will include students from the new Biomedical Engineering
(BME) undergraduate program at UAB. The majority of the projects are to be
conducted in partnership with United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) of Birmingham.
