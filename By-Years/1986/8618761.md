This collaborative program of research between J. W. Mayer, Cornell University;
S. S. Lau, University of California (San Diego); and J. M. Poate, AT&T Bell
Laboratories at Murray Hill will investigate ion- induced formation of
crystalline, metastable phases. The study will emphasize three major areas: 1)
aluminum-transition metal systems with emphasis on ion-induced formation of the
quasicrystalline, icosahedral structure, 2) direct, hot substrate, ion-induced
transformations to the metastable phase in binary systems near deep eutectics,
and 3) formation of metastable phases in ternary systems using ion irradiation
of metallic alloys on silicon or germanium and of germanium-silicon alloys on
metal films. The primary analytical approach will be based on Rutherford
backscattering, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and in-situ
electrical measurements. The research is a continuation of a previously
successful and productive investigation under support from the NSF
(DMR-8106843). Research on beam-induced metastable phases is a promising path to
the development of new classes of materials with unique surface and electronic
properties. The objective of the research is to provide important information on
the physics of these new materials and on the range of new compositions and
properties that may be available. Fundamental understanding is needed in this
area to provide guidance for materials scientists and engineers who are now
seeking new materials and processing techniques. The research will also have a
significant impact on the production of qualified researchers in the field of
materials science and electronics.
