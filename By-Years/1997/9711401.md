This project plans and executes a workshop that brings together representatives
of the diverse research community funded by the Information Technology and
Organizations (ITO) Program. This workshop will be a forum to allow researchers
in this area to meet, mix, learn about others' contributions, to potentially
form more fruitful interdisciplinary research alliances, and to articulate the
significant research and programmatic issues facing ITO today and in the future.
One outcome of the workshop will be collection of short project descriptions
suitable for display on the World Wide Web. Another workshop product will be a
report that weaves together the diverse research threads supported by ITO,
showing their common concerns and their special distinctions. This report will
also discuss historical, current, and potential future directions of ITO
research.
