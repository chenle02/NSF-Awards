Temporal patterns of deposition in fluvial systems are controlled by
interactions among internal and external parameters. Many of these interactions
are complex and may include non-linear feedbacks. Recent developments in the
study of non-linear dynamical systems and fractal geometry have made it possible
to test for the existence of non-linear behavior. We propose to examine temporal
distributions of sediment transport and deposition in gravel bed rivers to
determine (1) whether they exhibit a hierarchy of discontinuous behavior (i.e.
fractal) and (2) whether depositional events and patterns respond only to
changes in hydraulic parameters or are also associated with non- linear feedback
mechanism. Our research will be based on field measurements made in gravel-bed
streams and on data sets on depositional events compiled from the literature and
our previous research.
