9704482 Escobar This project lies in the area of Riemannian geometry. More
specifically, the investigator is to study the total mean curvature plus the
total scalar curvature functional, the Stekloff problem, isoperimetric
inequality, and harmonic maps between noncompact manifolds. Also, the
investigator has been active in developing collaborative research programs
between the United States and Colombia, organizing various conferences and
workshops. Riemannian manifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of curved
surfaces. Such manifolds have well-known applications in theoretical physics. A
Riemannian manifold possesses a notion of distance, or a metric. And by taking
the derivative of the metric one can measure its curvature. Harmonic maps and
harmonic functions constitute an important class of mappings between Riemannian
manifolds. Harmonic maps have a variety of applications, e.g., they can be used
to describe the temperature distribution on a homogeneous lamina.
