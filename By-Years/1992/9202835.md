9202835 Jaffe An aerial vibrating probe will be developed to map and measure
standing surface voltage gradients (maintained by subsurface currents) in
various aerial organisms such as higher plants, aerial fungi and insect eggs.
the instrumentation will be made available to users throughout the country for
biological research.
