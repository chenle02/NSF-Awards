ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 January 2013&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:
1262188&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;PI: C.
Reimers&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: D. Bailey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests
funding to support advancement of NSF?s Regional Class Research Vessel (RCRV) to
the Conceptual Design Phase with Oregon State University as the Lead Institution
for up to a three-ship construction effort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts: The science tool kit has evolved dramatically since the last Regional
Class ships were delivered in the early 1980's. The interdisciplinary
oceanography community now routinely employs a wide range of sophisticated
instrumentation (acoustics, optical sensors, video, high speed data links,
specialized nets and corers) deployed in a variety of ways (ship-mounted,
lowering on ropes and cables, Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles) and geared toward multiple scales of interest. The new
class of Regional vessels will include state-of-the-art design features and
equipment for enhanced investigation of the present and emerging coastal science
themes. These capabilities are simply not available on the older Regional
vessels due to their age and physical configuration. Along with the R/V
Sikuliaq, the RCRV project represents NSF's inter-agency commitment to Academic
Fleet modernization.
