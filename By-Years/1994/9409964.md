9409964 Yan Preparation of expitaxial electro-optic thin films is the base for
fabricating new integrated electro-optic and optoelectronic devices. To have
good electro-optic performance, the films should be in a single domain
structure, which can not be achieved automatically in the growth processes. This
project is to study ways to prepare epitaxial electro-optic thin films with
single crystal and single domain structure. LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 films with
multilayer structure will be deposited by RF magnetron sputtering and laser
ablation. The expitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 films will be poled by an electric
field after the deposition process. The electro-optic coefficients of the poled
epitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 film waveguides will be measured and the correlation
with the poling conditions will be studied. The objectives are to successfully
prepare single domain epitaxial LiTaO3 and LiNbO3 film waveguides with good
electro-optic property and to understand the basic process. ***
