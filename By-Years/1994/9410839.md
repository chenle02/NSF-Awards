9410839 Finn This award supports a workshop entitled Geodynamic Evolution of the
Transantarctic Mountains and the West Antarctic Rift: A Linked System. The West
Antarctic Rift system is a major continental rift adjacent to the East Antarctic
craton and the Transantarctic Mountains are thought to represent an uplifted
rift shoulder on the south side of the rift system. The rift system is of
particular interest because of the marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet that
occupies the region. The late Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the
rift and mountains have been the subject of several recent investigations
sponsored by several national Antarctic programs. These investigations have
demonstrated that these features are clearly linked and that their evolution has
been complex. The proposed workshop will allow investigators to discuss
approaches to future research to understand the dynamics of this rift system and
the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains and to begin discussions about
collaborative research to focus on this region. ***
