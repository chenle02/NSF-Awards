The Twenty-first Northeast Probability Seminar took place on November 17-18 2022
at Columbia University. The meetings had four plenary lectures, two on Thursday
morning and two on Friday morning. Thursday and Friday afternoons were set aside
for sessions where 25 junior participants had the chance to give ten-minute
presentations with questions of their recent work.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specialized mathematical meetings like this are very
important as they give people the opportunity to exchange fresh ideas and try
out new theories, and also provide junior researchers with the opportunity to
network with and direct questions to each other as well as senior
mathematicians. Regional meetings are especially important because it is easy to
follow up on significant conversations and begin collaborating. They also foster
the sense of belonging to a group of active researchers---in this case the
Northeast Probability group. Over 80 researchers attended this meeting, with the
NSF funding 25 junior participants to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Seminar
