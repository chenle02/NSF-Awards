This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant. The award permits
undergraduate students to participate in a research program in the materials
field under the supervision of faculty members actively engaged in research.
This program has strong participation by women and minority undergraduate
students from institutions primarily in the Southeastern United States. Funding
for up to twelve students is provided. Students spend ten weeks in the summer
involved in group meetings and individual research with faculty members at North
Carolina State University. Progress is discussed in the meetings, and results
are presented in a seminar series during the last week. Students elect to work
on research with individual professors on one of the following topics: super-
resolution optical spectroscopies, molecular beam epitaxial growth of cadmium
telluride, fundamental physics of atomic collisions, x-ray absorption
spectroscopy of amorphous semiconductors, studies of supernova remnants, thin
films and interfaces of semiconductors, theoretical studies of the properties of
solids. It is possible for students who can accommodate the schedule and afford
the time to continue their individual research beyond the ten week period using
supplemental funding by the institution or the faculty researchers by mutual
arrangement. The program enhances current research activities as well as adding
to the number of scientifically trained individuals. It is hoped that this
hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain highly-gifted
students into careers in teaching and research.
