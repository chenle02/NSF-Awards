9706531 Lancaster Vegetation plays an important role in determining the dynamics
and morphology of desert and coastal sand dune environments via its influence on
the entrainment and transport of sand by the wind. Many of these environments
are sensitive to climate change and variability as well as human impacts such as
grazing, off-road vehicles, and recreational use. This research develops an
empirical model of relations between sand transport rates and the cover and
geometry of natural dryland vegetation based on field studies of boundary layer
winds, vegetation characteristics, and direct measurements of sand transport
rates in vegetated areas are investigated through an assessment of the
partitioning of shear stress between the vegetation and the intervening surface
and by high frequency measurements of temporal and spatial variations in sand
movement in relation to the gustiness and turbulence intensity of near surface
winds. Based on field data, empirical models are developed that can be used
to:(1) predict the effects of climate change and variability on sand transport
rates in vegetated sandy areas; and (2) guide environmental restoration programs
in such areas.
