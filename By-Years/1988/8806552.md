The two co-principal investigators will study many problems connected with
disordered materials. The physical events to be studied include unfrustrated
bond random magnets, disordered electronic systems and spin glasses. Analysis of
the corresponding mathematical models is expected to lead to fundamental
discoveries about these events such as low temperature properties of spin
glasses. The mathematical models used include percolation and classical
transport models, and stochastic growth models. Most of the questions relate to
the equilibrium properties but some relate to the dynamics. Behavior near the
phase transitions will be of particular interest. The novelty of this project is
the rigorous study, rooted primarily in mathematics, of systems that are
generally studied experimentally. The investigators have already made very
valuable contributions to the field including the existence of a spin-glass
phase for an Ising model on a Cayley tree.
