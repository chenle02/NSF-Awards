This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
break the curricular gridlock which prevents little teaching of probability and
statistics in secondary school mathematics courses by developing new course
materials and state- of-the-art computer software based on current understanding
of students' conceptions of probability and statistics. The computer learning
environment, provisionally named StochasticsLab, integrates simulation, data
gathering, data display, exploratory data analysis, and statistical inferencing
capabilities. Emphasis will be on illuminating the inner workings of statistical
and probabilistic processes and promoting investigation and exploration by
allowing objects such as spinners, graphs, and statistical measurement tools to
be linked together by students and teachers to create dynamic micro- worlds.
Tightly focused yet widely applicable two-week modules are proposed that could
be integrated into other courses in the high school curriculum or combined into
a semester course. This project has educational merit and potential for
widespread impact on education.
