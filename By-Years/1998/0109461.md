This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a major
problem faced by participants and government regulators in the electrical power
industry. The electric power industry in the United States and throughout much
of the world is presently in a period of radical and rapid restructuring. The
ultimate goal of much of this restructuring is lower prices, to be achieved
through the development of competitive markets for electricity. These changes
require new tools both for the market participants and for the market
regulators. For the participants one such new tool is the ability to optimize
their market decisions in order to maximize profit. For the regulators a new
tool is needed to insure that the market operates without undue market power
abuses by the participants. As will be shown in this proposal, the software tool
needs of both the participants and regulators are quite similar. The goal of
this project is the development of such a tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PowerWorld
Corporation's present customers include traditional utilities, power marketers,
industry consultants, several state regulatory commissions, as well as the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Many of these customers have expressed a
great desire for PowerWorld to expand its products to include a detailed market
simulation tool. PowerWorld Simulator, with further development, has a
tremendous potential to be one of the most valuable new tools available in the
coming years.&lt;br/&gt;
