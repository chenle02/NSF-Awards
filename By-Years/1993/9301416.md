For marine animals with the capacity of producing large number of offsprings
and high average mortalities of early life stages, there exists the potential
for a large variance in the success with which individual contribute offspring
to the next generation of reproducing adults. For these animals, an assumption
of binomial variance in offspring numbers is likely wrong, and that a small
minority of offsprings may replace an entire population in each generation when
there is a mismatch between reproductive activity and permissive oceanographic
conditions. To examine this hypothesis, a model oyster population Crassostrea
gigas in Dabob Bay, WA, for which a 30-year record exists on reproductive
activity and recruitment success, will be tested rigorously by comparison of
genetic diversity among larvae, juveniles, and adults. Genetic diversity studies
of larval populations are now made possible by advances in molecular biology.
Large variance in reproductive success may be a major factor in the population
biology, adaptation and speciation of most marine animals.
