9411547 Provine/Carbone This dissertation project will provide support for
interviews and archival research on the evolving role of the laboratory animal
veterinarian. The research will be undertaken by the staff veterinarian for
Cornell University's Center for Research Animal Resources, towards completion of
the PhD degree in Science and Technology Studies. When pressures mounted from
the animal rights community during the 1980s, the U.S. Congress increased its
regulation of animal-based research dramatically, thus empowering the laboratory
animal veterinarians who oversee the welfare of research animals. These
veterinarians, employed by research institutions, now have enormous
responsibility. The central aims of this research are to develop a historical
understanding of the evolving definition of laboratory animal veterinarian and
to examine professional and moral difficulties inherent in reconciling competing
models of what the veterinarian should be. The researcher will follow review of
government documents and scientific and philosophical literature with interviews
with the scientists, animal protectionists and veterinarians who have tried to
shape the legal role of research veterinarians. The analysis will provide
insight into the complex interactions between scientists' values and society's
values, against the changing backdrop of our understanding of the nature of non-
human animals. ***
