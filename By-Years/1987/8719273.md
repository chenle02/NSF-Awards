Professor Davis will conduct analyses of pollen deposits to determine how the
climatic effects of the Sierra Nevada of eastern California have changed from
the last glacial maximum to the present. The Sierra crest currently separates
dryland vegetation to the east from mesic forest vegetation to the west. In the
last glacial age the boundary was not as sharp; vegetation was similar on both
slopes of the Sierra. This project will examine the timing of vegetation changes
and will attempt to determine what combination of precipitation and temperature
changes produced the documented shift in vegetation patterns. The results of
this research will increase our understanding of processes of climatic and
vegetation change and the ways regional changes are related to global changes.
