Professor Y. Kim and his coworkers have been at the forefront of research on
the few-nucleon problem for twenty years. They have played a major role in the
calculation of the properties of few-nucleon systems beginning with well-defined
Hamiltonians. Professor Kim proposes a large and varied research program
centered around three-nucleon physics, both bound-state and scattering
calculations. The trinucleon continuum-state calculations are of great interest
and importance, both to other theorists and to experimentalists, regarding the
data to be obtained from proposed experiments. Research concerning
photodisintegration and radiative capture, meson-exchange currents and three-
nucleon forces, quark degrees of freedom in nuclei and relativistic light and
heavy-ion collisions is also planned. Professor Y. Kim has been a leader in the
analysis of the three-nucleon problem and has recently moved to quark-cluster
models of light nuclei. He now proposes an extensive research program which
would refine his previous work on the structure of the three-nucleon bound state
using a baryons only model. Most importantly he plans to perform calculations of
the trinucleon continuum states. The results of such calculations are needed for
comparison with proposed experiments at the major nuclear physics accelerator
centers. He also proposes theoretical investigations of the effects of quark
degrees of freedom associated with few-nucleon systems and light nuclei.
Numerous important and useful results will come from this research.
