This action funds Emily Gasser of Yale University to conduct a research project,
entitled "Reconstructing Language History in the Pacific with Statistical
Modeling," during the summer of 2012 at the University of Auckland in Auckland,
New Zealand. The host scientist is Professor Russell Gray.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to contribute to the
development of the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database and to analyze the
data therein using Bayesian phylogeographic methods, thus exploring settlement
and migration patterns of the Austronesians into eastern Indonesia and the
island Pacific. This project contributes new knowledge concerning the
Austronesian language family and more broadly to the field of historical
linguistics.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
