9311164 Tang The School of Electrial Engineering at Cornell University will
purchase an Argon ion laser to be used for the NSF-supported project on
Femtosecond Optical Sources and Ultrafast Processes in Semiconductors.
Femtosecond of ultrafast and optical techniques have been used with great
success to study a variety of ultrafast processes in optical materials. Most of
these experiments are, however, performed with the Rh6G dye laser around 630 nm
in the visible. There is a clear need to extend the femtosecond sources to the
uv and to the ir and to achieve wid tunability. We have recently succeeded in
demonstrating for the first time a broadly tunable femtosecond optical
parametric oscillator (fs OPO) at high pulse repetition rate. A program of
research has been proposed to extend the tuning range to cover the entire
spectrum from approximately 400 nm to 5 um, to thoroughly characterize the
devices, to evaluate new nonlinear optical crystals for applications in fs OPO,
and to apply the variety of tunable fs sources developed to the study of
ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in various semiconductor materials
and structures. A key piece of equipment for such a project is the Argon Ion
Laser. The particular Ar-laser currentyl is use is out dated. An problems
originated in the Ar-laser, which is the first in a chain of laser sources, are
propagated down-stream to the Ti-sapphire laser, the femtosecond opticl
parametric oscillator, and finally to the experiments on ultrafast processes. To
asses and to fully realize the potential of this new development, it is vitally
important that the possible pump laser source, which ia an Argon ion laser, be
used. v s t & F ^ & + ^_MM Ã• M $ * $ ^ w x D z { I 9311164 Tang The School of
