9603002 Komanduri This award supports a two year collaborative research project
between Professor Ranga Komanduri of the Oklahoma State University and Professor
Takahiro Shirakashi of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan. The focus of
this research is to delineate the micromechanisms of finishing advanced
materials such as ceramics and glasses. The use of ceramics for many advanced
applications is hindered by the high cost of finishing them. Both analytical and
experimental studies will be carried out. On the analytical side, molecular
dynamics simulation and analysis of the ultraprecision machining will be carried
out. On the experimental side a variety of finishing operations will be
investigated including magnetic field assisted finishing processes for internal
and external finishing. The proposal brings together the effort of two
laboratories that have complimentary expertise, research capabilities and
equipment. The research should provide new knowledge of magnetic field assisted
polishing, ultra precision machining of metals, `gentle' grinding of advance
ceramics and glasses, and in situ micromaching inside a scanning electron
microscope. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will
broaden our base of knowledge and promote international understanding and
cooperation. ***
