This pilot study will analyze stable isotopes in planktic foraminifera in
sediment cores off the coast of Peru for the Holocene interval. In many regions
of the world the early Holocene is believed to have been a time of warmer-than
modern temperatures. Data derived from Peruvian middens give conflicting
evidence as to whether this period was somewhat warmer or cooler than today. The
foraminiferal data should provide a record of sea surface temperatures and
seasonal upwelling along coastal Peru throughout the Holocene, including the
period of human coastal settlement.
