The basic motivation of this investigation is to understand the power-law
distributions that describe various properties characterizing large movements in
stock price fluctuations, with characteristic exponents that seem to be
universal for different sizes of stocks and different stock markets around the
world. This project develops a model of the microbehavior of financial markets
to account for these empirically observed facts. The model will have the
following key components: (a) market participants behave strategically, i.e.,
they seek to minimize execution time and price impact, and (b) the size
distribution of mutual funds has a power law tail with exponent 1. The model is
tested for consistency with a series of equal-time codependences among return,
volume, and number of trades that are displayed by empirical data. This project
consolidates and extends the conceptual framework of the model in several
directions. The model predicts that some mechanisms proposed to reduce extreme
fluctuations are ineffective. For example, a Tobin tax and circuit breakers do
not change the value of the exponent of returns, but a modified Tobin tax whose
tax rate increases sufficiently quickly with volume traded decreases the fatness
of the return distribution. The model also suggests a way to use volume to parse
out noise from news in return fluctuations, and this project explores how useful
this approach is. Volatility is known to be autocorrelated, and preliminary
evidence suggests that number of trades and return volatility are similarly
autocorrelated. Their long-term memory exponents are very close. The
investigators study the propagation of volatility, volume and number of trades
in a systematic way, particularly focusing on the extreme events and the long-
term memory properties. This study achieves a reasonably complete description of
the way market activity is created and propagates.
