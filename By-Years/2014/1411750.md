PI: Philip Benfey (Duke University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Daniel Goldman
(Georgia Institute of Technology) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this EAGER
project is to begin to address the question "How do plant roots behave in soil?"
Due to the opaque nature of soil, most previous studies have involved digging up
roots, observing them in transparent materials, or observing them as they grow
against a transparent interface. This project is an early stage effort that has
the potential to transform the way root/soil interaction studies are performed.
Expertise in the physics of granular matter will be combined with expertise in
root biology to explore this area. The experimental plan involves growing rice
in cylindrical containers and systematically varying soil parameters. Root
response will be imaged with X-ray computed tomography with 3-D root structure
reconstructed and analyzed using software previously developed by the PIs.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is interdisciplinary (physics and biology) and
applies new expertise (physics of granular matter) and new technology (high-
resolution X-ray detection). The work also has important practical applications:
poor soil fertility and environmental stress suppress crop yields in many parts
of the world, and many models predict abiotic stress will increase in coming
decades. Thus, enhanced knowledge of root responses to soil composition and soil
moisture could be highly beneficial to agriculture, particularly in developing
countries. X-ray CT scans of roots and software necessary for analysis will be
made available on repository websites at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
