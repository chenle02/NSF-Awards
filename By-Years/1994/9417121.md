9417121 Von Damm Hydrothermal system at fast- and superfast-spreading ridges
have not been investigated and various trends (geochemical and otherwise)
suggest that the variability in hydrothermal systems in slow to moderate rate
spreading ridges cannot be extended to superfast ridges. This project involves
an ALVIN dive program to study gas and fluid chemistry of hydrothermal systems
on the East Pacific Rise 17-21degrees south. The intensity of local hydrothermal
activities here are indicated by the He-plume.
