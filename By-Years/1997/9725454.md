9725454 Sinton High MgO lavas (komatiites and picrites) are a rare but important
component of the mid-Cretaceous Caribbean plateau large igneous province (LIP).
These lava types are critical to understanding mantle temperature and dynamics
that lead to their production but are inaccessible in other oceanic LIP
provinces. This project is an integrated field, petrological and geochemical
study of the recently discovered Tortugal ultramafic/mafic lavas of Costa Rica.
Major element, trace element, platinum group element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Os isotope
analyses, combined with 40Ar-39Ar dating, will be used to characterize the
Tortugal lavas in order to further document the spatial and temporal variability
in petrogenesis related to LIP formation in the region. The Tortugal suite is
temporally related to the Gorgona Island komatiites, picrites and basalts 1000
km to the southeast, however preliminary data show significant differences in
mantle source and thermal regime between the two areas. Understanding the
spatial variability in high MgO lavas will help distinguish between rapid
decompression melting or plume head models for the creation of the Caribbean
plateau.
