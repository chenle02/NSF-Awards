9707153 Halliday This award provides partial funding (50%) for improvements to
the instrumentation of the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory housed in
the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Michigan. The
University of Michigan is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary.
The Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory is involved in a wide range of
research requiring modern geochemical instrumentation including studies of the
origin of the solar system, the early differentiation history of the Earth, the
accretion history of other planets, the tectonic history of the Grenville
Province, and the chemical composition of the Earth's mantle. The improvements
to the laboratory's instruments will include acquisition of a direct injection
nebulizing system for the laboratory's plasma-source mass spectrometer and an
ultraviolet laser ablation system. ***
