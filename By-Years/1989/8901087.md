This REU site project is designed to illustrate methods and phases of research
from problem definition and literature search, through the actual research, to
the point of writing up results and conclusions. The particular research topic
for this project is parallel processing. Students will be involved in the
development and implementation of efficient parallel algorithms, which use
supporting data structures, to solve integer linear programming and/or composite
graph coloring problems. This research will necessarily involve the
investigation of current algorithms for solving integer linear programming
and/or composite graph coloring problems, as well as the data structures used by
those algorithms.
