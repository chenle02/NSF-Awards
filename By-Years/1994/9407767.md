These studies are to investigate how hormones from the brain of a primitive
fish, the sea lamprey, control reproductive function. This hormone is a protein
called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is
present in all brains of all vertebrates. This hormone regulates reproduction by
stimulating the release of hormones from the pituitary which, in turn, stimulate
activity of the gonads. Since 1971, when the structure of mammalian GnRH was
determined, over 5000 analogs have been made to GnRH and tested in hundreds of
studies in mammals. Analogs are variants of the GnRH protein molecule with
different substitutions of amino acids that can either make the GnRH a more
potent hormone or an antagonist to the hormone. In mammals there has been great
success using various mammalian GnRH analogs for sterilization, conception and
other therapeutic uses. The scientists who are doing this study have identified
the primary structure of GnRH in the sea lamprey and have provided evidence for
its regulatory influence on the pituitary-gonadal axis. The goal of the present
studies are to determine the biological effects of lamprey GnRH. The long-term
goal of the studies is to develop lamprey GnRH analogs as an alternative method
for sterilizing lampreys in a sterile-male release program in the Great Lakes
region. This is an exciting possibility because these compounds are proteins
which are easy to synthesize, easy to administer, easily degraded within the
organism, and non-toxic to humans.
