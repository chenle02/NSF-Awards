9500716 Coburn Coburn will continue studies of heat flow estimates and Berezin-
Toeplitz algebras in several directions. Efforts will be continued to develop
"backward heat estimates", obtained for the usual heat equation in earlier work
with C. A. Berger, to more general parabolic equations. Another focus will be to
follow-up recent work with J. Xia on "Toeplitz algebras and Rieffel
deformations" to check whether Toeplitz algebras on bounded domains are
generally "strict deformation quantizations" of the corresponding algebras of
continuous functions. Coburn and Berger will also follow-up Coburn's work on
"Deformation estimates for the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization" to obtain
isomorphism invariants for the algebras of (boson) canonical commutation
relations. These invariants arise from an appropriate extension of the index
theorem to pseudo-differential operators with "eventually slowly varying"
symbols. ***
