Interior-point methods have proven to be efficient for solution of large,
sparse linear and quadratic programming problems. These methods are being
extended to cover more general classes of problems. In particular, interior-
point technology are being used to create efficient algorithms for the solution
of convex programming problems and semidefinite programming problems. The first
class is important for general nonlinear optimization and the second has
important applications to integer programming.
