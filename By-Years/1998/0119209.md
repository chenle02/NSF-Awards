This award is funding to permit the History of Science Society (HSS), Society
for the History of Technology (SHOT), Philosophy of Science Association (PSA),
and Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) to provide travel awards to
graduate students and independent scholars--with no access to funding--to attend
the annual meetings of the societies during the five-year period 2001-2005. It
also asks for travel funds to allow the respective president, secretary, and
editor of each society to meet each year in order to foster cooperation among
these five societies.
