Through a collaboration between university and private industry, the P.I. and
his team will develop a new compact instrument using quantum cascade lasers
capable of measuring carbon monoxide and methane with sufficient robustness,
sensitivity, accuracy, response and reliability so as to be suitable for use on
research aircraft. After manufacture and testing with his industry partners the
P.I. will deploy the instrument alongside an existing research-grade carbon
dioxide instrument to generate a comprehensive airborne package targeting trace
gases important to the global carbon cycle. Such atmospheric data is of unique
use to quantify natural and anthropogenic emissions as well as gaining a more
informed understanding of some basic yet critical global biogeochemical cycles.
Broader impacts of this project include tools developed that target important
and critical research needs within the carbon cycle and climate change
communities. This work may in future lead to a commercially viable instrument
that would be available to a broad community. Support is included for
postdoctoral researcher(s) and a graduate student, which will contribute
positively to education and professional development of young scientists at a
major university.
