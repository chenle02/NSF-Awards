Abstract

Proposal 0341148 Integrating Algorithm Visualization into Computer Science
Education Grand Valley State University Scott Grissom

This project will bring together experienced developers from three institutions
to develop a suite of materials for teaching data structures and algorithms
using the algorithm visualization tool JHAVE. These materials and the tool will
support student work in active, engaged learning outside the classroom. The
project will develop new materials and refine existing materials during its
first two years, based on formative evaluation by outside reviewers and
experiences in the classroom. In the second and third years the project will
provide workshops that train faculty on how to use the developed materials and
how to create their own materials. Workshop participants will use project
materials in their teaching and will contribute to additional evaluation.
Expected project outcomes include a published student laboratory manual, a
digital library of high quality Web-based visualizations, and an instructor's
guide describing best practices in using these materials.
