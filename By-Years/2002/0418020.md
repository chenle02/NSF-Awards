This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop antibody arrays for studying kinase proteins based on the Protein
Epitope Tags (PETS) method. This method relies on a computational process to
mine the human genomic sequence to find good tags using a nearest-neighbor
approach to filter out similar tags.

The commercial application of this project will be to make available effective
antibody arrays as protein analysis tools for use in biomedical research and
diagnostics.
