The objective of the project is to develop the theory, techniques, and
mechanical designs needed for robots to rapidly build large, rigid structures
from blocks that geometrically interlock, without the need for fasteners,
cement, or glue. The work is motivated by the desire to quickly assemble
structurally strong buildings, furniture, and devices, in such a way that the
structure may later be disassembled and the parts re-used. Fabricating in parts
presents many advantages: for instance, individual components may be fabricated
efficiently, packed for storage and transport, repaired or replaced as needed,
and design changes can be made readily in response to changing customer needs.
Design of smooth surface finishes allows applications such as modular furniture
and packaging of delicate parts for shipping, and embedding mechanical or
electrical components will allow rapid construction of robots and other
devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem to be studied is how structures may be
designed to rigidly interlock, using cycles of geometric constraints imposed by
blocks to reinforce, support, and immobilize other blocks. Goals for the project
include: 1) the design of joint geometries that allow a connection process that
is robust to assembly and fabrication errors; 2) mechanical block designs that
allow incremental construction of interlocked structures; and 3) layout
algorithms that tailor assembly sequences to allow construction of desired
shapes. Methods and approaches include mechanical design, development of layout
algorithms, and analysis of assembly processes to ensure structural stability
during construction. Experimental work includes robot assembly to validate the
approach for complex structures involving hundreds of
blocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
