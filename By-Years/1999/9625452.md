9625452 Eberlein The proposed research lies in the general area of Riemannian
geometry. The investigator plans to study the geometry of complete Riemannian
manifolds of nonpositive curvature and rank 1, a condition implied by but weaker
than strictly negative sectional curvature. Particular emphasis will be given to
manifolds that are compact or are simply connected and homogeneous. More
specifically, the investigator will pursue the following three topics: geometry
of compact rank 1 manifolds; geometry of simply connected 2-step nilpotent Lie
groups with a left invariant Riemannian metric; homogeneous spaces of strictly
negative sectional curvature. Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of curved
spaces possessing a distance function. Unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space
these are abstract spaces in that they do not necessarily lie in an ambient
space. The proposed research has to do with understanding the large scale
structure of certain of these spaces, and looking at various examples coming
from Lie group theory.
