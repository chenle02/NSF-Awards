RESEARCH: Nutritional influences on social insect division of labor

The aim of this dissertation research is to investigate the connection between
nutrition and division of labor in the social insects. Completed work has shown
the nutritional state of worker honey bees, as indicated by stored lipid, is
closely related to behavioral role in the colony. Future work aims to broaden
the scope of this research in three ways: 1) determine whether changes in worker
bee nutrition cause changes in behavior, 2) explore a molecular mechanism
linking nutritional status to changes in brain gene expression in honey bees,
and 3) use comparative studies with other social insects to investigate the role
of nutritionally-sensitive molecular pathways in social evolution. Because
nutrition can interact with numerous other physiological processes, these
studies will have profound implications for understanding the mechanisms
controlling division of labor in social insects. To a more general audience,
this work can provide important insights into how an individual's nutritional
state can lead to neurophysiological changes that give rise to specific
behaviors. At the same time, this research encourages the integration of
research and education, as it provides opportunities for a number of
undergraduate students to receive training and become involved in the scientific
process.
