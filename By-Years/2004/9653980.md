This pilot program provides a beginning model for systemically reforming and
improving undergraduate content courses, with particular attention to the
teaching models they provide for students preparing to be teachers. The courses
are being redesinged by Action Based Research Teams (ABRT). There are three
ABRTs, each composed of a scientist/mathematician, a science/mathematics
educator, a pre-service teacher, and an in-service teacher. Each team is
resposible for a specific course. The three courses being redesigned are: a two
semester introductory chemistry course (about 2000 students, approximately 20%
intend to become teachers); a year long biology course (about 250 students,
approximately 80% intend to become elementary school teachers); and a one
semester introductory geology course (about 50 students) designed specifically
for students preparing to become K-8 teachers. Courses are being restructured to
help students better understand the concept of the science while at the same
time providing models for activities that can be used for teaching these same
concepts to elementary or high school students.
