through the Chabot/Las Positas Community College District to the Internet over a
T1 (1.544 million bits per second) line. Faculty and students at the school
benefit from access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and
supercomputers. In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with
colleagues at other institutions in pursuit of research and educational
projects. The award provides partial support of the project for one year.
