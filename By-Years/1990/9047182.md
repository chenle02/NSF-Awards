This supplementary award funds Rutgers University's Industry/ University
Cooperative Research Center for Ceramics to perform collaborative research with
Pennsylvania State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
for Dielectrics on a project "Effects of Particle and Grain Size on the Phase
Transitions and Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate." Both Centers'
Industry Advisory Boards have recommended and cost shared this two year project.
A woman undergraduate is also funded to augment the Center's research studying
the processing of submicron powders of complex prevoskite materials and
conventional ceramic processing. Three years of supplementary funding is also
provided to maintain the evaluation protocols for the Center. The Program
Manager recommends that Rutgers University be awarded $50,000 for two (2) years
for a "TIE" project with Pennsylvania State University. $24,000 for three (3)
years is also recommended for the evaluator costs. Another $5,000 for one (1)
year is recommended for the woman undergraduate with funds from the Women,
Minority and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.
