9303404 LeVeque Many important practical problems lead to partial differential
equations whose solutions have discontinuities or nonsmoothness across some
interface. In solving these problems numerically, it is very convenient to use a
uniform Cartesian grid in spite of the fact that the interface may cut between
grid points. The investigator and his colleagues develop finite difference
methods that aim to give highly accurate solutions at all grid points while
maintaining the efficiency and ease of implementation of uniform grid methods.
Several specific problems are studied in depth. One goal is to develop improved
versions of Peskin's "immersed boundary method" for incompressible fluid
dynamics in regions with complicated moving boundaries, such as blood flow in a
beating heart. Hyperbolic wave equations with discontinuous coefficients arise
in modeling the structure of the earth in seismic oil exploration. Other
applications include porous media equations arising in oil reservoir simulation
and groundwater transport, and multi-phase solidification problems. In modeling
fluid motion near rigid boundaries, an additional problem arises in solving an
ill-conditioned system of equations for the strength of discontinuities at the
boundary. Iterative methods for solving such problems are studied. Simulating
the behavior of complicated structures in the real world typically involves
solving large systems of equations that cannot be solved exactly. Instead the
solution must be approximated by numerical methods on high performance
computers. The investigators study problems in which there is a boundary or
interface that has a complicated shape and may be moving in time. Examples
include the surface of a body of water or a bubble surrounded by fluid, the
surface of a beating heart, or the boundary between oil and some fluid that is
injected into the earth to force oil out of an oil field. In these examples the
equations being solved model the flow o f some fluid. Another problem is to
study the motion of the boundary between melting ice and the surrounding water,
or between different phases of a substance more generally. In this case the
equations model the conduction of heat. In oil exploration it is necessary to
model the motion of seismic waves in the earth and the manner in which they
reflect off interfaces between different kinds of rock deep within the earth.
The goal of the project is to develop relatively simple methods that can be used
to solve a wide variety of such problems with complicated boundaries or
interfaces. ***
