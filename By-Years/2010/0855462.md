Dark matter research is at an exciting juncture. The confluence of increasingly
sensitive direct detection experiments, large indirect detection experiments,
the discovery of more local group galaxies and the Large Hadron Collider is
likely to dramatically broaden our understanding of dark matter in the next few
years. The PI proposes to undertake novel investigations that deal with the
collisionless and collisional aspects of dark matter including indirect
detection of dark matter and coupling of dark matter and dark energy. The PI
will also investigate how strong gravitational lensing data sets made available
by future large sky surveys may be used to study dark energy. The PI will also
investigate constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) on a large class of
beyond standard model theories that have charged particles that decay during or
after BBN. The education and outreach plan of this program is focused on the UC
Irvine Physics Road Show program. The Road Show takes basic physics
demonstrations, presented by UCI undergraduates, to an ethnically and
economically diverse group of elementary and middle school students in schools
in the neighboring districts.
