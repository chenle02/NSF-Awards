This project focuses on academically talented and financially needy students who
transfer from 2-year schools to Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Through
this scholarship effort, the program recruits, retains and graduates 25
additional transfer scholars per year in engineering and engineering technology
BS degree programs. In support of this project, RIT contributes $50,000 to
ensure that scholars have continuing financial support after the grant expires.
This contribution indicates the university's enthusiasm, a firm commitment of
service to engineering and technology students, and an endorsement of the goals
and objectives of the scholars program. This scholars program targets women and
minority students, identifies scholars in academic trouble and provides help to
them through proactive intervention, prepares students with skills, education
and work experience needed to enter the high technology workforce, and performs
regular and thorough assessment of program level strategies.
