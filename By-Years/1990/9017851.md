This program will continue the analysis of two aspects of the 1985 MCS data set
from the East Pacific Rise. 1) Selective reprocessing and modeling of the CDP
data will be done to the data from the 9 N survey area, which is the location of
a forthcoming ODP drilling leg. 2) The nature of the velocity structure and
thinckness of the uppermost crust along the EPR using Wide Aperature Profile
data, will enhance the value of the ODP data . Improved seismic imaging and the
development of a structural context will be of value in the planning and
interpretation of future detailed surveys in this area.
