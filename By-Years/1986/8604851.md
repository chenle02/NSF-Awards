This grant is for partial purchase support of an X-Ray Diffractometer System to
aid the III-V semiconductor materials research effort at the University of
Michigan. The Solid State Electronics Laboratory is presently equipped with a
Riber 2300 Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) System used for the growth of III-V
semiconductor materials. The epitaxial materials are characterized by
photoluminescence, Hall Effect Measurements, and Deep Level Transient
Spectroscopy. Currently much research is aimed at the growth and
characterization of strained layers formed from heterojunctins composed of
materials of different lattice constants. An X-ray Diffractometer System is an
invaluable tool in measuring lattice constants and characterizing strains
present in mismatched systems.
