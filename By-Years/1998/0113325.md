The primary goal of this project is to design, implement and test a new display
system for digital libraries.&lt;br/&gt;It is motivated by the lack of display
capabilities in most systems today; we need more screen resolution and screen
size. This project will combine commodity video projectors and computing
equipment with software to provide automatic calibration and to provide better
interfaces to visualization techniques. This will be of value in virtual reality
environments and scientific data analysis environments as well as in digital
library implementations. The project will be done in partnership with a library
at the University of Kentucky and a computing facility at the University of
Puerto Rico.&lt;br/&gt;
