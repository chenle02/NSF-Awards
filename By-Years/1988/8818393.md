ABSTRACT Chiwere is an endangered Siouan language, surviving today in the minds
and speech of only about 40 Ioway and Otoe-Missouria Indians, all of whom are
elderly. This project aims at preparation of a grammar and associated studies of
Chiwere before the language dies, taking with it much of the expression and
tradition of the culture for which it had been the framing element. The study
goals are (1) to write a grammar of Chiwere, based on field work and archival
materials; (2) to collect reminiscences and traditional narratives in Chiwere,
as records of the past and as documents of the persistence of a culture; (3) to
offer counsel to interested Chiwere speakers and tribal groups, as requested, on
the preparation of teaching and dictionary materials; (4) to provide direction
to papers on specific topics in language, culture, ethnohistory, and prehistory;
and finally (5) to train and direct the work of several graduate students toward
increasing the number of scholars concerned with Siouan languages. These goals
will be achieved using standard structural linguistic field research methods,
employing controlled elicitation of grammatical forms with careful transcription
and analytic translation of a corpus of tape and video recorded texts.
