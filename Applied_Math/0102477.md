Title: Structured Deformations and the Microgeometry of Continua

Structured deformations provide a multiscale geometry and kinematics for
describing the effects at the macrolevel of both smooth and non-smooth
deformations occurring at submacroscopic levels. The proposed research focuses
on (i) applying this recently developed multiscale geometry to refine and
improve important continuum descriptions of single crystals undergoing slipping
on more than one crystallographic system, (ii) identifying via a relaxation
technique from the calculus of variations a geometrical variable that measures
the volume swept out by submacroscopic vacancies and understanding the
connection between this variable and different types of dislocation movements,
and (iii) obtaining relations that complete the system of balance laws and
constitutive relations that arise when a continuous body undergoes structured
deformations and motions. This research bears on the fields of materials science
and engineering and on the mathematical study of geometry at multiple length and
time scales.

The geometrical changes in a deforming paper clip or other metallic body that
appear continuous and smooth to the naked eye often appear to be jerky and
abrupt when viewed in a microscope. Similarly, the smooth stretching of a
plastic sandwich bag or other thin plastic film appears differently at
macroscopic and submacroscopic scales. The most successful theories for studying
macroscopic changes in a body - paper clip, sandwich bag, or otherwise --
brought about by applied forces or heat sources are called field theories. The
success of field theories rests first on our physical understanding of how a
particular substance, e.g., the particular metal comprising the paper clip or
the particular plastic constituting the sandwich bag, influences the detailed
form of the field theories and, second, on our mathematical understanding of the
equations that comprise the field theory. The research undertaken in this
project is part of an ongoing program to enrich these field theories by
permitting them to describe and predict the behavior of a body that changes
shape differently at macroscopic and submacroscopic length scales. The desired
outcome of this research is refined, improved field theories that permit more
accurate simulations of the behavior of technologically important materials.
