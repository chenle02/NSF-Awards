This funding supports the acquisition of a Hewlett Packard Network Analyzer and
two Sweep Oscillators for use in the development of the Microwave and Antenna
Laboratory for Electrical Engineering courses at the Rochester Institute of
Technology. Although these laboratories have been offered over the last three
years, the equipment needed for testing the design projects had to be borrowed
for short periods of time from local manufacturers. Design, fabrication, and
testing of an antenna constitutes a fundamental portion of the student's
laboratory experience and the acquired instrumentation corrects a serious
deficiency the laboratory hardware. In addition, a new course in "Design
Projects in Electromagnetics: is developed around the enhanced capability of the
laboratory. This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal
investigator's institution.
