This project supports the research of Professor Tate on 1) various refined
conjectures on special values of L-functions, such as Gross's conjectural
refined class number formula and the corresponding refinements of Stark's
conjectures, 2) questions about the fine structure of the Stark unit in a cyclic
extension of a real quadratic field, and 3) Sklyanin algebras of dimension 5.
This research lies in the general areas of number and arithmetic geometry.
Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,
addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole
number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was
pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the
last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in
areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.
Arithmetic geometry combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. The new insights arising out of this combination are
producing increasingly powerful tools to solve long-standing problems like
Fermat's Last Theorem, which have resisted the strongest efforts of over three
centuries of mathematicians. In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is
sometimes regarded as among the purest of pure mathematics, it has also been
developing insightful new techniques leading to dramatic progress in such
applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography.
