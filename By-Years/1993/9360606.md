9360606 Nelson The possibility that atomic chlorine concentrations in the marine
surface layer are large enough to compete with the hydroxyl radical as the major
tropospheric oxidizer has received considerable speculation. Chlorine atoms
participate in the oxidation of hydrocarbons and dimethyl sulfide and can also
directly influence tropospheric ozone loss through catalytic cycles with
chlorine monoxide and the hydroperoxy radicals. The net effect on the ozone
budget may be highly dependent on the partitioning of the inorganic chlorine
pool between hydrochloric acid, hypochlorous acid, chlorine gas, and chlorine
nitrate. In order to assess the potential importance of chlorine chemistry,
direct measurements of these species are necessary. In Phase I of this research,
the PIs will assess the feasibility of detecting hypochlorous acid at the 10 to
20 ppt level using tunable diode laser infrared absorption. This will require
(1) measurement of pressure broadening coefficients for selected absorption
lines, (2) identification of suitable spectral regions, (3) investigation of
photolytic modulation of hypocholorous acid to implement background subtraction,
and (4) design of novel multiple pass absorption cell with a path length of at
least 600 meters. Phase II research will improve the basic spectroscopic
parameters for quantifying hypochlorous acid concentrations and develop a
prototype field instrument capable of simultaneous measurements of hydrochloric
acid and hypochlorous acid in the marine atmosphere. ***
