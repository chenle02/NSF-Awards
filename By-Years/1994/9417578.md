Connecticut Hospital Research and Education Foundation, Inc. - J. Lynch
Connection to NSFNET Proposal No. NCR-9417578 The Connecticut Hospital Research
and Education Foundation, Inc. (CHREF), a non-profit affiliate of the
Connecticut Hospital Association, proposes to serve as a central coordination
site to interconnect interested health care institutions and to provide such
institutions with a gateway to the NSFNET. This connection will benefit both
health care professionals and patients, and will provide an infrastructure which
will be used for a multitude of health care related applications and
communications. CHREF proposes to accomplish this connectivity using a frame
relay based network approach in order to provide sufficient bandwidth upgrade
potential. This will provide a cost effective solution, and will also serve to
isolate intra-state network traffic from the internet.
