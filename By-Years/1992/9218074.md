The evolution of closely separated binary stars can produce objects and
phenomena not found among single stars. Low-mass X-ray emitting binary stars and
symbiotic stars fall into this category, but the evolutionary origins of these
comparatively rare objects are uncertain. This research will explore possible
origins of these objects by constructing model stellar populations, allowing
them to evolve under different scenarios. A comparison of the evolved model
populations with observed populations may shed light on the precise mechanisms
responsible for the formation of these systems.
