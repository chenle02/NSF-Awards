This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a step-
out technology for paraffin alkylation to produce high-octane clean gasoline.
Conventional alkylation processes require large volumes of corrosive liquid
acids, which can inflict serious injury via skin contact or inhalation. The new
alkylation process will be fundamentally safer and cleaner, reducing the use and
generation of toxic chemicals. It uses a first-of-a-kind engineered zeolite
catalyst that is environmentally benign and eliminates the risks associated with
liquid acids while producing alkylate of comparable quality. The new catalyst
promises significantly improved yields and selectivities, minimizing waste by-
products and disposal problems associated with liquid acids.

The engineered zeolite catalysts can be used most effectively for liquid phase
alkylations of paraffins and aromatics, such as the production of high-octane
alkylate, and industrially important petrochemicals such as cumene and
ethylbenzene.
