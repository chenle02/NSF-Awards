The marine sciences are of interest to students K thought undergraduate school.
However computer-aided instruction in the marine science appears to be limited
to approximately twenty-four software programs currently available for
microcomputers. This project is directed at the 6-12 grade levels in the area of
marine biology The objectives are: to design a lesson to demonstrate the form
and function of fishes; to involve students actively in the learning process by
providing a computer environment for manipulating fish form, function and
habitat in order to "design a fish"; and to demonstrate the concept that
evolution is a function of environmental dictates. The Apple IIc or IIe computer
will be used in the development because the Apple II Series is currently the
microcomputer used most extensively in the precollege level schools. Evaluation
of the lesson will proceed through the Delaware Department of Public
Instruction, using Delaware schools. In addition to various inservice programs,
the Mid- Atlantic Marine Education Association and the National Sea Grant
Program will be evaluating the materials. Marketing will be done through the
University office of Instructional Technology. This project makes excellent use
of the appropriate technology in a most suitable fashion. Secondly, the product
has high potential to serve as a model for future development in other
disciplines. The availability of good software in the area of biology is very
low so a real need is being met by highly qualified persons and with a modest
budget.
