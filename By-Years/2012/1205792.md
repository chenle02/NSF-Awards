This project is a continuing program of low energy, high precision, muon
experiments. The measurements are the MuSun experiment at Paul Scherrer
Institute (PSI) in Switzerland and the new g-2 experiment at Fermi National
Accelerator Facility (FNAL) near Chicago. Both experiments utilize innovative
methods to address questions ranging from the testing of the Standard Model to
the nature of the weak nuclear interaction. The MuSun experiment at PSI will
measure the lifetime of the muonic deuterium atom to a precision of about 10
parts-per-million. The measurement will determine the muonic deuterium doublet
capture rate to unrivaled accuracy of 1.5%. The New g-2 experiment at FNAL will
measure the muon's anomalous magnetic moment to a precision of about 0.14 ppm.
The measurement addresses the tantalizing discrepancy between the BNL E821
result and the Standard Model calculation of the muon anomaly and offers a probe
of new particles and undetected forces that uniquely complements the physics
reach of the Large Hadron Collider.

The project involves several areas of broader impact and broader significance.
The PI will continue his involvement of high school students, physics majors and
physics graduate students in research activities. The group's involvement in
high-speed data acquisition and high-volume data analysis will expose our
students to many aspects of cutting-edge computer hardware/software. The
proposed measurements of textbook quantities including fundamental parameters
and basic interactions will have wide-range impact in nuclear, particle and
astrophysics.
