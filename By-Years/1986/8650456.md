This project aims to introduce gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
capability into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at the University of
Scranton, both in course-related laboratory work and in independent student
research. To accomplish this aim, a benchtop gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
will be purchased. The instrument will be configured for capillary GC, and will
be supported by a complete data system including a spectral library. It will be
used by undergraduates to learn principles and applications of GC/MS in the
organic, instrumental and advanced inorganic course sequences, and to gain
experience with computer-controlled data acquisition and analysis. It will also
provide students with a powerful modern technique for use in their varied
research projects, many of which involve significant work in drug analysis and
petroleum exploration.
