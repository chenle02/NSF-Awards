DMS-0628758 David G. Ebin

The three-day conference on Symplectic Topology and Geometry will be devoted to
a very active area of current research. The notion of symplectic structures is
not new; it goes back at least to Darboux, but the area expended greatly after
Gromov introduced the concept of J-holomorphic curves. Since then connections
have developed with gauge theory, Kahler geometry and more recently integrable
systems. The will be explored and discussed in the course of conference.

The conference honoring Dusa McDuff, who is one of the leaders in Symplectic
Geometry and Topology, will comprise fourteen lectures. It will also include a
workshop at which several young mathematicians will present their ideas. The
presentations will be accompanied by discussion which should result in
suggestions for new research. Graduate students will be encouraged to
participate.
