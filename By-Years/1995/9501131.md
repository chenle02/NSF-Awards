DMS-9501131 Gelfand Investigation of mathematical aspects arising in the study
of integrable equations is proposed. Emphasis will be placed on the following
problems: (a) The nonlinearization of Fourier transforms and their use for
solving initial and boundary value problems for certain physically significant
equations (b) Algebraic and geometrical aspects related to integrability,
including the algebra of Chern and Chern-Simons classes, Crofton K-densities,
and integrable surfaces; (c) Classification of the finite bi-hamiltonian
problems and their connection with geometry . In recent years important
developments in the study of certain nonlinear equations have occurred. In
particular it has been found that there exists a general method for solving
certain equations. It turns out that this method can be considered as the
application of nonlinear Fourier transforms. These nonlinear transforms will be
used to study several physically important equations. It turns out that
integrable equations have a rich underline algebraic and geometric structure,
which also will be investigated.
