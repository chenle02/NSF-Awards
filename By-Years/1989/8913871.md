The Insect Collection in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum of Hawaii contains the
world's most complete representation from the Pacific Rim. It contains more than
13 million specimens, of which more than 13,000 are type specimens. The
collection is surpassed in size only by the Smithsonian Institution and the
American Museum of Natural History. Dr. Scott Miller, Chairman of the Gressitt
Center for Research in Entomology, proposes continued improvement to the
collection, including installation of high-density storage facilities, support
for a visiting specialist program, creation of a computerized inventory of the
collection, and curation of extensive holdings that await sorting and labelling.
The proposed curatorial effort will increase the availability of this collection
to investigators from around the world. Museum collections such as this one
comprise the primary means of studying the earth's biological diversity. Proper
curation and computerization of such natural history collections will offer new
insight into the factors that control this diversity.
