The primary objective of this investigation is to develop radiative transfer
codes of stratocumulus and cumulus cloudiness for climate models which are
accurate in the solar spectrum to within 10 W m-2. While the infrared spectrum
also is important, the emphasis in this investigation is on the solar spectrum.
There are three components to this study: 1) A more thorough analysis of 3D
cloud field structure and microphysics. For stratocumulus, the FIRE IFO
database, as well as other sources, will be utilized. The recent North Dakota
(1987 and upcoming FAME, Hailswath II, COPS, and Hawaii Rainband data will be
used for the cumulus studies. 2) On the basis of aircraft microphysical
observations and high spatial resolution satellite imagery to determine cloud 3D
structure, advanced broken cloud radiative transfer models will be developed.
The resulting radiative transfer predictions will be validated against satellite
nadir radiance. 3) Parameterization of the broken cloud radiative fluxes in
terms of plane-parallel values will be attempted. This work will lead to
improved representation of clouds in climate models and thus enable more
accurate treatment of cloud radiation interactions in climate change
simulations.
