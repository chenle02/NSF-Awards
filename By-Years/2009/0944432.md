This SBIR Phase I project will develop an on-board biosensor platform based upon
micropost technology that will detect viral pathogens in livestock. The system
relies upon an immuno-detection system to identify the presence of the pathogen.
The Phase I project will establish proof of concept both in the laboratory and
with infected livestock to demonstrate the function of the technology in
response to a single selected pathogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader/commercial impact of the project will be to provide a new means of viral
monitoring that ideally would provide earlier detection of viral infection and
is more practical and less invasive as compared to blood or tissue
sampling.&lt;br/&gt;
