A rich and unique set of observations collected before, during and after the
passage of Hurricane Gilbert in the gulf of Mexico was collected in 1998and its
analysis is almost completed. The purpose of the study is to better understand
the three-dimensional response of the upper ocean to hurricanes in the context
of near-inertial wave dynamics. The rate of propagation of vertical energy from
the mixed layer into the thermocline is estimated from near-inertial rotating
current vectors. The results are also compared with numerical and analytical
models.
