The Metallurgical and Materials Engineering department is improving its
laboratory to demonstrate materials fundamentals important for ceramics,
polymers, and electronic materials - the classes of materials which are
undergoing the most rapid changes and advances. The laboratories will be used by
students from all engineering majors as well as by students in courses closely
associated with manufacturing - metallurgical and materials engineering,
mechanical engineering , electronic engineering, industrial engineering,
manufacturing engineering technology, and chemistry. The equipment requested
will facilitate experiments on superconducting ceramics, electronic device
failure mechanisms, and high-temperature polymeric composites. This project is
being matched by an amount greater than the award.
