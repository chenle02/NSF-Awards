9315123 Damodaran This project is on research to study various aspects of
protein adsorption and film formation at interfaces. The main objectives are:
(1) to elucidate the role of the electrochemical potential of proteins in
adsorption at the air-water and silica-water interfaces; (2) to investigate the
adsorption and film forming behavior of magnetoferritin at these interfaces; (3)
to study the molecular factors that govern competitive and coadsorption of
proteins from solution; and (4) to study the conformation of proteins in situ at
the air-water interface. This research has potential importance to: (1)
understanding protein stability; (2) the development of information storage
devices; and (3) the production of new chemicals by bioprocesses. ***
