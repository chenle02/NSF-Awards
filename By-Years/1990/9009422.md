The goal of this exploratory research is to develop a method to control the
degradation properties of implanted materials. The approach is to deposit
negative charges on the implant material using low-temperature gas plasma
technology. The negative surface charges are expected to repel the negative OH
ions involved in hydrolytic degradation mechanisms. The work will test the
hypothesis that the degradation rate of surface-treated synthetic absorbable
polymers will be reduced when compared with those of untreated materials. The
degradation rate will be determined using several quantitative techniques. If
successful, this research will open up a new way of designing implant materials
for specific degradation rates. Moreover, the possibility also exists that the
degradation rate may be controllable externally.
