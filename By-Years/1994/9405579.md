9405579 Heinz The PI will perform laser heating and Brillouin scattering
experiments on a range of materials. He will revisit the melting behavior of
perovskite and Fe using his new thermal analysis technique to provide better
constraints on the thermal structure of the deep Earth. He will also determine
elastic velocities in several silicates, oxides and alkali halides in
polycrystalline form. These experiments, coupled with seismic observations, will
permit a better understanding of the deep structure and composition of the
Earth. ****
