The proposed experiments address a number of issues particularly germane to
excited-state processes and chemistry. The quantum efficiencies of the
luminescence and the photochemical reactions of aminoarenes and aryl amides,
which have recently been shown to be sensitive to the position of the amino
substituent, will be correlated with precursor structure to provide insights
into structural relaxation of the excited state, and how that relaxation
influences subsequent photophysical and photochemical processes. A separate
measure of the electronic influence on excited state behavior will be achieved
by measuring the photocyclizations of the amino-substituted stilbenes, while new
information regarding photoinduced electron transfer and intramolecular charge-
transfer states will be provided through studies of novel donor-acceptor pairs.
With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
research of Professor Frederick D. Lewis of the Department of Chemistry at
Northwestern University. Professor Lewis' research will provide unique insights
into the structural changes that accompany electronic excitation and how these
changes, separate from concurrent electronic changes, influence the subsequent
reactivity and relaxation of intramolecular charge-transfer states. The research
will introduce undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to steady-state
and time-resolved photochemical techniques, and their application to elucidating
fundamental excited-state processes.
