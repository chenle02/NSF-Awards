This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award to study
uncertain inference. While there may be a variety of sources and kinds of
uncertainty, the kind of uncertainty that is most pervasive and that should be
best understood is uncertainty based on (at least approximate) statistical
knowledge. This project focuses on that kind of uncertainty. There are three
main applications of statistical knowledge in planning under uncertainty; in
justifying the assumptions we take for granted in planning and in design, and in
obtaining and updating statistical knowledge. When it comes to making these
applications under the special, unique, never-to-be repeated circumstances in
which we find ourselves, they are each problematic. In each case the key concept
is that of uncertain inference. We will characterize uncertain inference, and
develop principles that will allow the formal application of statistical
knowledge in the presence of rich and detailed knowledge of our unique
circumstances.
