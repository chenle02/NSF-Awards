The objectives of this research and educational program are to develop new
formalisms and methods for artificial intelligence by combining a sound
theoretical approach with a principled experimental component, to provide a
practical evaluation of the proposed models and relate them to real-world
applications and challenges, and to educate the next generation of computer
science students about the ambitious and challenging goals of artificial
intelligence. To develop successful applications, general search and reasoning
has been avoided in recent years by explicitly incorporating large amounts of
domain-specific knowledge. Such a knowledge-intensive approach has been
successful in, for example, expert systems; but in areas such as general
planning or reasoning, progress has been disappointing, and specific knowledge
acquisition is often difficult and expensive. However, recent advances in
general methods combined with faster hardware and better implementations provide
strong evidence that a compute-intensive approach is not only suitable for
dealing with the combinatorial nature of many AI formalisms, but may also be
required to supplement domain-specific knowledge. This research studies fast
general reasoning and search methods, with an emphasis on stochastic procedures,
which are a promising recent development for solving computationally hard
problems. It also investigates the various sources of complexity in hard
problems, using both theoretical and experimental methods, exploring interesting
connections between computer science, artificial intelligence, and statistical
physics. In addition, it is studying issues in problem representation, including
robustness of encodings, abstraction, compilation, and approximation methods.
The result is expected to be new general approaches to artificial intelligence
that are applicable to a wide variety of problems in such areas as planning,
operations research, and computational biology.
