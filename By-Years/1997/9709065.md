This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will assist the
Department of Chemistry at University of Wisconsin at Madison to upgrade an
existing Bruker AM-360 8.46 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas involving mechanism of
organometallic reactions, organolithium reagents, organosilicon chemistry,
electron transfer in radical cations, characterization of homogeneous catalysts,
and fundamental studies of molecular structures and dynamics in liquids. Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies are
useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
