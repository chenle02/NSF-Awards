This project is to continue work on volcanic gas emissions to the atmosphere. It
will involve field sampling at volcanoes using a variety of techniques,
thermochemical modelling of speciation and reactions, and development and use of
remote sensing methods. In the next two years, the plan is to focus on the
testing of a new field laser Raman spectrometer which has the potential of
providing a new capability for remotely sensing many gas species. The results
are of potential interest to atmospheric scientists who want data on
volcano/atmosphere interchanges, volcanologists interested in forecasting
volcanic events or in volcanic gas hazards, and geochemists interested in metal
volatilities and ore deposits of fluid/rock interactions at high temperatures.
