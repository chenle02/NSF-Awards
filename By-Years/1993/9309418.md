9409834 Dorsey This is the first year of a three-year continuing RIA Award to
investigate acoustic simulation techniques to improve accuracy of acoustic space
evaluation, utilizing theoretical and interactive techniques to indicate
specific acoustical effects in a three dimensional computer model. By creating
and altering these effects, the surfaces, sound emitters, and geometry will be
indirectly modified. The purpose is to have the system cary the burden of
searching the design space, allowing the user to focus on the goals of the
acoustical design rather than on the details of the model specification. The
project benefits from analogous work done in lighting simulation and interactive
graphics techniques.
