Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Phonons are collective vibrations of the atoms
in a solid and are the dominant heat carriers in materials such as
semiconductors. Phonon transport physics is important as it dictates thermal and
other related properties of materials. Normally phonons either travel
diffusively, randomly scattering from lattice impurities, or ballistically, in a
straight line. This project aims to investigate a new regime of phonon transport
termed "phonon localization" where the wave nature of the phonons prevents them
from propogating. The study could lead to new approaches to engineer thermal
properties beyond the current paradigm, in particular achieving ultra-low
thermal conductivity, which is important for a wide range of thermal
technologies such as thermal insulation and thermal to electrical energy
conversion. The project broadens its impacts by providing interdisciplinary
education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students
while attracting underrepresented groups into science. The integrated outreach
activities provide education and research opportunities in nano- and energy
technologies for disadvantaged, first generation high school students in the
greater San Diego area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Anderson localization has been experimentally demonstrated in
both fermions and bosons, including electrons, photons (light), and recently
with ultrasound. Theoretical studies have already predicted localization of
thermal phonons, but until now there has been no experimental verification of
these predictions, presumably due to the daunting challenges associated with the
perceived experiments. This project aims to overcome these experimental
challenges and carry out the first systematic study of phonon localization in
low dimensional systems with disorders. The phonon localization regime is
experimentally probed by thermal transport measurements of semiconductor
nanowires with precisely controlled surface morphology and impurity
concentration. Phonon localization signatures to be investigated include the
dependence of thermal conductance on the nanowire geometry, surface roughness,
and defect concentration as well as the temperature.
