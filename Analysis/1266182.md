The aim of the proposed work is to consider a wide array of challenging problems
within the field of nonlinear dispersive equations. Broadly speaking, the goal
is to improve our understanding of nonlinear interactions in the context of
wave-like phenomena. Equations of interest include wave equations, the
Schroedinger equations and KdV type equations, as well as physically relevant
coupled systems such as Einstein's equations, water waves, Maxwell systems and
the Chern-Simons-Schroedinger model.

While most of the work will be concerned with nonlinear problems, one cannot
obtain good nonlinear results without having a good understanding of the
underlying linear dispersive dynamics. The two main themes here are (i) boundary
value problems and (ii) global in time dispersion on curved backgrounds. The
latter topic is mainly oriented toward systems, e.g. the Maxwell system and the
spin two wave equation; this is related to the study of the conjectured
stability of the Schwarzchild and Kerr black holes in the context of the
Einstein equations in general relativity.

On the nonlinear side, a key topic to be explored is that of large data
solutions in energy critical semilinear dispersive equations. The first stage
involves understanding and classifying possible obstructions (e.g. solitons,
steady states, self-similar solutions) to global scattering solutions. In the
absence of such obstructions the goal is to obtain global well-posedness and
scattering. Another goal is to achieve a good understanding of the dynamics near
these obstructions.

The study of short and long term dynamics in quasilinear dispersive equations is
another main theme of this proposal. There are several models of interest,
namely nonlinear wave equations (in particular Einstein's equations), nonlinear
Schroedinger equations as well as some water wave models.

Although the proposed work is primarily theoretical, many of the problems have
their origin in physical theories such as general relativity, many body quantum
field theory, surface wave propagation and plasma physics. As such, it is hoped
that the results of the research may shed some light on the corresponding
physical phenomena. Two good examples in this directions are the black hole
stability question in general relativity, as well as the long range propagation
of water waves.

On the human resource side, the project involves a good number of graduate
students (six at present), as well as postdocs (five for the first year of the
project, including three NSF postdocs). It also involves many collaborators at
various institutions, both domestic and abroad. The results of this research
will be made widely available via publications, web based tools, presentations
at conferences and summer schools.
