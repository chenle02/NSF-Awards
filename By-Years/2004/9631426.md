Anne Beeson Royalty Stanford University SBR-9631426 This research will look at
several aspects of the impact of nonwage benefits. Nonwage benefits account for
approximately one-third of total compensation. The first part of the project
will investigate the effect on measured inequality of including employer
contributions to health insurance in measures of earnings, as well as the effect
on measured inequality of the nondiscrimination provision of the tax code. The
second part of the project will explore the effect of preferential tax treatment
for fringe benefits on the composition of compensation. The last part of the
project will investigate the trade-offs workers make between wages and fringes
when choosing fringe benefit options.
