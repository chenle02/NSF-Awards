Often experimental conditions, the circumstances of an observational study or
scientific theory or conjecture require an ordered response. Standard
statistical analysis software does not allow constraints of these kinds,
although the statistical theory is now well-developed. This project will develop
software for order restricted inference. This project will integrate regression
analysis and the analysis of linear models with order restricted inference.
