The Clark Atlanta University will initiate a six-week, multidisciplinary,
residential and commuter, Young Scholars project for 30 students in grades 8-12.
This program will provide participants with intellectually challenging
experiences in classroom instruction, as well as hands-on research experiences
designed to increase interest in -- and knowledge of -- career opportunites in
the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science. Participants will be
made aware of the academic preparation required to pursue these careers. Program
participants in grades 10-12 will conduct research projects as members of
research teams consisting of research professors and undergraduate and graduate
students; while program participants in grades 8 and 9 will be involved in an
interdisciplinary science curriculum with an emphasis on problem solving and
research opportunities.
