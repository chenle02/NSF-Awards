characteristic of the life history of many organisms allowing individuals to
take advantage of different habitats as environments change seasonally. For
example, over two-thirds of all landbirds that breed in temperate North America
fly thousands of kilometers to nonbreeding areas in Central and South America.
Traveling long distances is energetically expensive, and the mortality
associated with migration is thought to be substantial. How well a bird solves
problems that arise during migration determines the success of migration, and
ultimately a bird's survival. That said, following individuals throughout the
year poses a serious challenge, and our understanding of the behavior of
migrating birds has been constrained by not knowing the bird's breeding
destination, not to mention the point of departure. Information from stable
isotopes, genetic markers, and plumage coloration is integrated to
geographically link individual birds captured at stopover sites in the southern
U.S. during spring migration with their ultimate breeding destination in North
America. This novel approach will allow a more comprehensive understanding of
the strategies used by birds during migration. For example, do birds 'late' on
their migration stop over for a shorter time and do they redeposit critical
energy stores faster than migrants on schedule? Do late migrants 'catch up' by
migrating faster or for more hours once aloft? This project will enhance not
only understanding of the behavior, ecology, and evolution of migratory birds,
but also development of conservation strategies for animals whose annual cycle
bridges continents. The project continues a long history of undergraduate and
graduate student traineeship and, because of the dramatic nature of animal
migration, provides rich opportunities for outreach to educational groups and
the community.
