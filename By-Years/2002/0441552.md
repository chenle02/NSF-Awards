This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for a new
network infrastructure technology suitable for Grid Network Systems. The
technology takes a diametrically different approach to building and operating
distributed, multi-site networks. It is based on a concept of cooperating nodes
forming cells that manage the traffic as a collection of distinguishable network
segments with predictable traffic characteristics. The resulting network offers
significant improvements over traditional IP networks in the areas of
predictability, scaling, simplicity of operations, and ease of reconfiguration.
It is fully compatible with all Layer 3 devices, protocols, and applications. In
particular, it can co-exist with existing networks allowing gradual migration.
In Phase I the feasibility of fundamental concepts will be verified and analyzed
for practicality of implementation through a set of computer simulation
sessions.

The technology is a different approach to building and operating networks. It
will impact a wide range of applications in several markets and is certain to
spawn new research in the areas of large-scale network architectures and
distributed computing applications. The company intends to support these efforts
through sharing concepts as well as through direct participation through
partnerships and contracts in later stages. The first two targets for the
technology are government data fusion and distribution systems for homeland
security, and scientific research networks at universities and other research
institutions. The former has a direct impact on the society by leading to
improvements in national security. The latter directly enhances education and
scientific research in many areas, most importantly those that utilize extensive
computational resources such as molecular research, climate, astrophysics,
particle physics, materials, and other.
