This project represents a continuation of research previously funded by NSF
grant EAR83-18674, involving use of Atom Location by CHanneling-Enhanced
MIcroanalysis (ALCHEMI) techniques to determine crystal site distributions of
major and minor elements in minerals. The project will include a careful
assessment of errors involved in the ALCHEMI technique by comparing the results
of electron channeling experiments with those obtained from other, "standard"
techniques such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectrometry,
for a variety of silicate minerals. In addition, site distributions will be
determined for a number of minerals, including high-pressure Mg-Fe silicate
perovskites.
