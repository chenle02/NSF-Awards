This award supports the research of Professor Philip Hanlon in the field of
algebraic combinatorics. Hanlon will investigate a number of problems connected
with two distinct subjects, the Macdonald Root System Conjectures and the inner
product matrices defined by Varchenko in his work on representations of quantum
groups and hypergeometric functions related to quantum groups. This research is
in the general area of Combinatorics. Combinatorics attempts to find efficient
methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The
behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.
For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone
systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete
sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
