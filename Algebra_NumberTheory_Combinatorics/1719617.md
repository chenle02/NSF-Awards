This award is to support Oregon Number Theory Days, a joint seminar series to be
held at University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and Portland State
University. For the first year of this seminar series the workshops be held at
Portland State University on Saturday, October 21, 2017, at Oregon State
University on Saturday, February 24, 2018, and at the University of Oregon, On
Saturday, April 21, 2018. Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at
regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in
the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions
operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three
seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The
speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields
of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional
expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians,
speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to
those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular,
without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians
in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also
be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging
environment.

Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number
theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from
the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial
challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences
and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-
profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which
will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon.
In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number
theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will
host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon
Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of
distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and
development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days
will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage
graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support
the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting
institutions.
