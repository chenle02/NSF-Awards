0126241&lt;br/&gt;Zreda&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proof-of-concept project will
provide data to test the feasibility of a new method for soil water
determination. The method is based on thermalization of cosmic-ray neutrons by
hydrogen atoms present within water molecules in soils. It has several appealing
characteristics: it is noninvasive (measurements can be conducted above the
ground); it measures moisture at an intermediate scale; it may be scalable by
changing instrument position and/or configuration; it can be easily automated
for long-tern unsupervised monitoring; and it is safe (it does not use an
artificial source of neutrons). The proposed work will involve measurements and
modeling of the intensity of cosmic-ray neutrons under controlled water content
conditions. The specific objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to
identify and quantify any trends in neutron intensity with water content and
with chemistry of soil; (2) to quantify the effect of water layer placed on top
of soil on the neutron intensity; and (3) to determine what the measurement
volume is and whether it can be controlled by instrument position above the
ground or by instrument configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
