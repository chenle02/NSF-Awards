This study will develop and apply innovative information technologies to
investigate the evolution and dissemination of precedent in the American legal
system. In particular, it will develop a tool for automated data and network
acquisition from textual data on citation patterns in Takings Clause cases
between 1900 and the present. Our study will harness the power of information
technology and spatial analytic techniques, including: automated file
acquisition and transformation; data management based on a relational database;
mapping (network) relations between cases; quantitative linguistic analyses; and
code-and-retrieve software (to facilitate qualitative review). This project will
not only break important new ground substantively, but also will develop new
methodological approaches drawing on information technologies that have
heretofore been seriously under-utilized within social research. Development of
these approaches also promises to foster synergies between application
developers and social scientists, and to enhance transparency and rigor of text-
based research across a range of disciplines.
