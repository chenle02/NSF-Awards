Antonucci, Robert AST 96-17160 Dr. Antonucci will conduct a number of related
research projects bearing on the nature of active galactic nuclei, primeval
galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The first group of projects exploits
observations with optical spectropolarimetry on hidden AGN. The second group
describes some tests of optical/UV and IR emission mechanisms. The additional
projects will use the Lick adaptive optics system with laser guide stars,
attempts to detect the ionized intergalactic medium and a search for ultrahigh
redshift sources.
