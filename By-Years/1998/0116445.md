With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico in Humacao will acquire
a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) structural characterization of
organometallic intermediates; b) enzyme mechanisms in organic solutions; c)
solution-state dynamics for semiquinones in phospholipid membranes; d) kinetics
of photochemical degradation of membranes by radical peroxidation; e) structure-
function relationships of molecules of biological or pharmaceutical interest;
and f) polymer structure.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry.
