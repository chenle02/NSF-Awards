In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
Division, Rizzo will pursue a new approach for measuring the spectroscopy of
highly vibrationally excited molecules on the ground potential energy surface
using a CO2 laser to selectively dissociate molecules promoted to those highly
excited levels by means of overtone excitation. In these experiments he will use
infrared multiphoton dissociation as a detector in infrared-optical and optical-
infrared double resonance spectroscopy experiments conducted in low-pressure
static gas cells as well as in supersonic free jets. These investigations are
extensions of previous three-laser experiments complicated by the addition of
the fourth CO2 photodissociating source. Specific systems for study consist of
molecules which have a light-atom stretching vibration suitable for overtone
excitation and which can be photodissociated to produce a fragment that can be
probed using laser-induced fluorescence. Examples of such molecules include
alcohols, amines, cyanides, and halogenated alkanes. %%% Vibrationally excited
molecules are commonly produced in chemical reactions or by absorbing light
followed by loss of some of the excitation energy in internal processes. Such
highly excited molecules can be significantly more reactive than their unexcited
counterparts, so that it is important to understand the dynamics involved with
such molecules, such as how quickly they lose their energy internally, in
collisions with walls and other species, and how quickly they react.
Understanding such dynamic processes is important for developing accurate models
of combustion, atmospheric processes, chemical laser action, and chemical vapor
deposition, which is used to make thin-film coatings. Professor Rizzo's studies
will help gather information relevant to understanding internal energy
conversion.
