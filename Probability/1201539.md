Travel support is requested for about twenty U.S. participants (recent Ph.D.s,
women, and members of underrepresented minority groups) to attend the 8th World
Congress on Probability and Statistics to be held in Istanbul, Turkey from 9th
to 14th of July, 2012.

The Congress is organized under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society for
Mathematical Statistics and Probability and the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics. It is the major worldwide event bringing together researchers
working in the fields of statistics, probability and stochastic processes and is
held every four years.

An important part of the intellectual development of researchers at the
beginning of their career is to attend international conferences where they have
an opportunity to interacts with people working in a wide range of topics. The
conference covers a wide range of active research areas and features 14 Invited
Plenary Lectures presented by leading specialists. In addition, there will be 40
special Invited Sessions, consisting of three talks each, as well as Contributed
and Poster Sessions covering many aspects of applied and theoretical
probability, statistics and stochastic processes.
