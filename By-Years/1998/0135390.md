This proposal requests support for a single investigator to continue work on
outstanding problems in numerical general relativity. The proposed projects are
(1) formulation of boundary conditions for a numerical evolution of the Einstein
equations, (2) computation of gravitational waveforms in the final stages of the
coalescence of two black holes, and (3) gravitational radiation from the capture
of a neutron star by a black hole. These are all of great interest to the
community of scientists studying gravitational waves and the foundations of
general relativity. Perturbation techniques have been successfully employed to
deduce properties of some exotic cosmological events such as neutron star-
neutron star coalescence (NS-NS inspiral) in the very early or very late stages,
but are not sufficient in the intermediate stage of the merger. Large-scale
computer simulations are necessary to bridge the gap between these extremes. The
research proposed here will seek to develop the tools needed for such
simulations. Numerical techniques developed by the P.I. and his colleagues have
enabled important advances in the past and will be used to advantage in the
proposed research program.
