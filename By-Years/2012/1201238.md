This EAGER award funds a theoretical study of a proposed new technology for
measuring neural currents within brain tissue. This research project is headed
by Professors Lawrence Frank and Terrence Sejnowski at UC San Diego.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program funded by this grant concerns new
methods of understanding and measuring the electrical processes that occur
within the human brain and which signal brain activity. Current techniques
involve functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), but these methods only
operate indirectly by triggering on the electrical changes that occur in the
blood surrounding the brain or within the brain. Such techniques are therefore
limited by the fact that blood flow induces a certain fundamental inaccuracy
having to do with spatial separation (the distance of blood flowing prior to
FMRI detection) as well as a time lag which separates the time of the original
electrical activity in the brain and its subsequent impact on the surrounding
blood. In this study, by contrast, the PI's will analyze a new technology which
might be able to completely overcome these limitations by focusing directly on
the neural currents within the brain tissue itself. This new technology is
referred to as "neural current MRI", and the PI's will model the effects of
these neural currents and the possibilities for their detection by conducting a
detailed numerical simulation of such brain activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
implications and broader impacts of such a project are significant. The results
of such a study might help to pave the way for a whole new technology by which
we might be able to image the brain with a precision never previously achieved.
Moreover, because the research in this proposal crosses many traditional
boundaries (including biology, physics, and computational mathematics), it is
highly interdisciplinary. The results of this study therefore have the potential
to benefit research in a variety of related disciplines.
