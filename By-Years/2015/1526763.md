With the emergence of Big Data platforms in social and life sciences, it is
becoming of paramount importance to develop efficient lossless and lossy data
compression methods catering to the need of such information systems. Although
many near-optimal compression methods exist for classical text, image and video
data, they tend to perform poorly on data which naturally appears in fragmented
or ordered form. This is especially the case for so called ordinal data, arising
in crowd-voting, recommender systems, and genome rearrangement studies. There,
information is represented with respect to a ?relative,? rather than ?absolute?
scale, and the particular constraints of the ordering cannot be properly
captured via simple dictionary constructions. This project seeks to improve the
operational performance of a number of data management, cloud computing and
communication systems by developing theoretical, algorithmic and software
solutions for ordinal data compaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the
project is to develop the first general and comprehensive theoretical framework
for ordinal compression. In particular, the investigators propose to investigate
new distortion measures for ordinal data and rate-distortion functions for lossy
ordinal compression; rank aggregation and learning methods for probabilistic
ordinal models, used for ordinal clustering and quantization; and smooth
compression and compressive computing in the ordinal domain. The proposed
analytical framework will also allow for addressing algorithmic challenges
arising in the context of compressing complete, partial and weak rankings. The
accompanying software solutions are expected to find broad applications in areas
as diverse as theoretical computer science (sorting, searching and selection),
machine learning (clustering and learning to rank), and gene prioritization and
phylogeny (reconstruction of lists of influential genes and ancestral genomes,
respectively).
