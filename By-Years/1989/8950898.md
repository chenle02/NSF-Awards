This project implements a new set of objectives for laboratory instruction in
biology and chemistry. The implementation will shift the focus for the
laboratory work from observation and illustration of scientific theories to
developing skills that relate scientific concepts to: inferences from data,
developing alternative hypotheses, devising clear tests of hypotheses,
recognizing patterns and causal relationships, and analysis of simulated and
collected data. The grantee provides funds that are an equal match for the NSF
award.
