9527900 Simms Plants may respond to disease or herbivory either with resistance,
which reduces the level of damage, or they may tolerate damage by reducing its
effect on reproduction. Little effort has been devoted to understanding how
plants tolerate or compensate for damage. Nevertheless, many plant ecologists
have maintained that compensating for damage is an important mechanism by which
plants respond to herbivory. Recent studies have revealed genetic variation for
tolerance within natural plant populations, as well as trade-offs associated
with tolerance: when plants do relatively well in the presence of damage, their
siblings do relatively poorly in a damage-free environment. This proposal
describes two major experiments designed to explore mechanisms underlying this
trade-off in the wild turnip mustard, Brassica rapa. To measure tolerance, half
sibs will be exposed to carefully controlled levels and timing of damage
produced by both insects and artificial means. These manipulations will be
performed in various environments to determine what environmental factors
influence the ability of genotypes to compensate for damage. Quantitative
genetic analyses will be used to test two hypotheses: H1: Tolerance is more
costly than resistance because costs of tolerance are associated with major
life-history trade-offs; and H2: The cost of tolerance is caused by a trade-off
between ability to compensate for damage and competitive ability. Results from
this study will significantly improve understanding of how plants respond to
herbivores and pathogens. Furthermore, as tolerance and compensatory growth have
become recognized as important agronomic traits, this study will provide
important insights as to what trade-offs might be involved in breeding these
traits into crop varieties.
