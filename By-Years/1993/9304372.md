This ongoing project will continue development and application of new techniques
for the microanalysis of stable isotope ratios. The studies will utilize the
laser probe, ion microprobe and conventional techniques to study micron-scale
zoning in high grade metamorphic rocks. The principal goals of the project are
to document the styles of isotopic zonation in metamorphic rocks and to
elucidate the causes of such heterogeneity. This research will ultimately find
application in evaluating theories of fluid migration in the crust, granulite
genesis, geothermometry, and cooling/uplift history.
