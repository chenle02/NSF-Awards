This is a comperative study of the oxic-anoxic transition in modern sediments
of the Black Sea and of some Pennsylvania shales in the U.S. The Black Sea core
samples and the Pennsylvania rock samples from oxic, transitional, and anoxic
environments have been collected. The PI will undertake sulfur isotopic analysis
of pyrite and chemical analyses for pyrite sulfur, organic carbon, reactive and
total iron, and inorganic and organic phosphorus. The chemical analyses will be
closely integrated with determinations of sedimentary texture (bioturbated,
laminated, etc.) via X-ray slab techniques. The result will be used to test
current theories and develop new paradigme for: (1) the discriminaation of
normal marine from euxinic sediments; (2) the discrimination of syngenetic from
diagenetic pyrite; (3) the formation of phosphorus (and manganese) enrichments
within oxic/anoxic transition zones.
