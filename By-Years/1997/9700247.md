ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9700247 Principal Inveqtigator: Wirtz This is a
grant to purchase a low-intensity CCD camera system with a controller,
monochromator and three-dimensional motor controlled microscope stage. This
system will be used for imaging the transport of fluorescently-labeled
macromolecules. An innovative magnetic force technique will be used to generate
calibrated forces on fluorescently-labeled macromolecules, such as DNA, allowing
for measurement of transport coefficients, e.g. relaxation time, friction
coefficient and diffusion time. It is expected that this system will offer
unique advantages for research in polymer and colloidal science and engineering.
