ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9610123 Principal Investigator: James R. Engstrom
Institution: Cornell University Probes for an existing UHV reactor dedicated to
semiconductor thin-film deposition will be purchased. They will include: a
quadrupole mass spectrometer with molecular-beam compatible cross-beam ionizer
and negative or positive ion detection capability: a translation stage for
sample positioning; a refrigeration trap for the quadrupole mass spectrometer; a
lock-in amplifier for reverse-view LEED or retarding-field Auger spectroscopy;
and accessories.
