The three principal investigators, Michael Reed and Harold Layton of the Duke
Mathematics Department and Jacob Blum of the Duke Department of Cell Biology are
continuing their research programs which apply mathematical analysis and machine
computation to specific biological problems. Blum and Reed investigate partial
differential equations that arise in cellular transport processes and study
information processing in nuclei of the auditory brainstem. Layton studies the
physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of the kidney. Several new
research projects are underway with colleagues at other institutions including:
new models for cell signaling; new applications of computational fluid dynamics
to anguilliform swimming and microvascular flows; and the mathematical analysis
of large time delays in ordinary and partial differential equations. The purpose
of this project is to increase the mathematical expertise that is available for
the solution of biological and biomedical problems. This is accomplished by
training undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates in the
mathematical methods and modelling techniques which can give valuable
information about biological systems. Strong efforts are made to develop
research collaborations between mathematicians, these trainees, and biological
researchers in industry, at medical centers, and in government laboratories.
Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical
Science, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division Of
Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.
