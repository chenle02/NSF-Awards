This award funds the compilation of a catalog of dwarf galaxies, identified on
photographic plates originally taken for studies of bright galaxies. Studies of
this material will explore the possibility of utilizing associations of dwarf
galaxies with giant galaxies to obtain a method to measure distances to the
galaxy pairs. It will also permit constraints to be placed on models of the
formation of dwarf and giant galaxies, and of their subsequent evolution.
