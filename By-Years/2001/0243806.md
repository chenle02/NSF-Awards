ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Mariusz Urbanski, University of N.
Texas&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0243806&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Dynamical Systems, Denton
2003"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides substantial support for active
research&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians (both advanced and beginning) with limited
means of&lt;br/&gt;support to attend and participate in the conference Dynamical
Systems,&lt;br/&gt;Denton 2003. The conference is designed to provide an
opportunity for&lt;br/&gt;leading experts in the fields of ergodic theory,
topological dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;smooth dynamical systems, holomorphic dynamical
systems, one-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, combinatorial ergodic theory and
Hamiltonian dynamical systems&lt;br/&gt;to share their ideas with the research
community. With only a&lt;br/&gt;single speaker scheduled at any given time, the
conference will also&lt;br/&gt;give less renowned speakers and their ideas
exposure to a wide audience.&lt;br/&gt;The plenary speakers will be Krystyna
Kuperberg, Carlangelo Liverani,&lt;br/&gt;Rafael de la Llave Michael Lyubich and
Lai-Sang Young. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
