This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
continued investigation on novel main group compounds by Dr. Philip P. Power of
the Chemistry Department at the University of California at Davis. The primary
focus of the work will be synthesis and characterization of monomeric and
polymeric species containing multiple bonds between main group III and V
elements. In some cases both elements will be heavier members of the series,
e.g., In-P. In other cases, only one member will be a later element, e.g., B-Sb
or B-Bi. Particular attention will be paid to the synthesis of ring species, in
which delocalized bonding might occur. In addition, preparation of other
compounds containing main group elements from groups III through VI which are
multiply bonded will be attempted. For example, species containing Al=C and Ga=C
will be prepared. Compounds will be characterized by X-ray structures and NMR
spectrometry. %%% New compounds containing members of the boron family and the
nitrogen family will be prepared. These compounds are unusual because they
contain multiple bonds between elements of these families. The strength of the
second bond will be determined and compared to theoretical predictions. Bonds
between these elements do not usually occur in discrete molecules, but are
common in materials used as semiconductors or ceramics. This research provides
an opportunity to learn more about the nature of such bonding and thus may help
guide design of electronic or structural materials with specific properties.
