Human language is both universal within the species and highly variable across
populations. This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship
(IGERT) project will train young scientists and engineers to understand language
diversity by combining the tools of behavioral, computational and biological
research, drawing upon an extensive collaborative network that spans nine
departments in five colleges at the University of Maryland. The project aims to
promote sustainable change in the science of language by building infrastructure
for interdisciplinary research on diverse languages through local and
international collaborations and outreach efforts, by strengthening links
between basic science and clinical and engineering applications, and by building
awareness of the science of language through high school and undergraduate
partnerships. The training plan provides coursework, research training, and an
environment geared towards preparing students for interdisciplinary research and
equipping them to build collaborative networks in their future careers.
Preparation for interdisciplinary research will be provided by broad coursework,
integrative pro-seminars and a post-candidacy lab rotation that will pair
trainees with students from other disciplines. A central component of the
project is the Winter Storm, an intensive two-week workshop that will provide
foundational skills training, research planning, and professional development.
The project will enhance the use of computational and neuroscientific techniques
in studies of atypical language and second language learning, and will partner
with an NSF-supported Science of Learning Center based at Gallaudet University
that focuses on visual language. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet
the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries.
