The goal of this collaborative research is to conduct the first end-to-end
simulations of systematic errors in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
experiments conducted with interferometers. A variety of cosmological processes
have imprinted the CMB radiation with faint polarization signals, including
Thomson scattering, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves released
during inflation. Measurements of these faint signals will determine key parts
of the cosmological puzzle, among which are the energy scale of inflation and
the masses of the neutrinos. Detecting these small signal levels is extremely
challenging, and this program will help determine the best ways to accomplish
such measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program
include training of undergraduate students in research, and public release of
simulations which will be useful to future CMB experiments.
