This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Investigation of Cytokinin Regulation of Light-Harvesting
Chlorophyll a/b Binding Protein mRNA Stability in Lemna gibba." The Research
Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to applicants trained in traditional
areas of plant biology who wish to extend their training in new techniques and
to those trained in molecular or cellular techniques who wish to gain experience
working with plants. These fellowships are designed to increase the number of
outstanding young scientists in plant biology.***//
