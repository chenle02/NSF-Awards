The recently introduced Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) technique for
InfiniBand and High Speed Ethernet provides native I/O virtualization
capabilities and enables us to provision the internal PCI bus interface between
multiple Virtual Machines (VMs). However, achieving near native throughput for
HPC applications that use both point-to-point and collective operations on
virtualized multi-core systems with SR-IOV presents a new set of challenges for
the designers of high performance middleware, such as MPI. In order to solve
this problem, this project aims to address the following set of challenges: 1)
How to redesign MPI communication library to achieve efficient locality-aware
communication and facilitate fair resource sharing on modern virtualized high
performance clusters, with SR-IOV? 2) Can communication libraries be designed to
deliver the best communication performance across different VM subscription
policies and network communication modes? 3) What are the the challenges
involved in designing support for advanced features such as, live migration,
Quality of Service, and I/O storage virtualization? and 4) What kind of
benefits, in terms of performance and scalability, can be achieved by the
proposed approach for HPC applications? A synergistic and comprehensive research
plan is proposed to address the above challenges for HPC Virtualization on
clusters with SR-IOV and study its impact for a set of HPC applications.
