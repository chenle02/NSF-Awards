The main goal of this project is to study quantum entanglement, which is
arguably the most perplexing feature of the already confusing theory of quantum
mechanics. Quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the microscopic world--
elementary particles, atoms, molecules, photons and so on--allows particles to
be at many places at the same time, a property called superposition. If several
particles are in a superposition state, then their individual properties may
become "entangled" in such a way that detecting one of the particles will affect
the other particles even though there is no direct physical connection between
them. Dubbed "spooky action at a distance" by Albert Einstein, this property has
no classical physics analog, and its understanding is essential for verifying
the validity of quantum mechanics. This seemingly esoteric property also has
important practical applications and implications for a rapidly developing new
technology: quantum computation and quantum communication. Quantum computers
should be able to break computational speed records using exotic algorithms;
their very existence requires strong quantum entanglement between the quantum
bits, or "qubits", which form the basis of their operation. Quantum
communication channels can transmit data with the highest possible levels of
security; the reliability and range of these channels depends crucially on the
ability to generate entanglement.

The PI's will use trapped Ba ion qubits and the ion-photon entanglement protocol
to generate long distance entanglement between the ions. The long (~1 km) range
is needed to close both the locality loophole (which requires the measurements
on the two qubits to be outside of each other's light cone) and the detection,
or fair sampling, loophole (which requires that the detection efficiency is
high) in the same experiment. The photons emitted by the ions will be sent
though optical fibers and measured in a partial Bell state analyzer, a process
which in turn entangles the distant ions via entanglement swapping.
