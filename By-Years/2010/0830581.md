A signal, when transfered over a long distance, is likely to be corrupted.
Error-correcting codes have been designed to solve this problem, so modern
communications are possible as we see today. Algebraic codes are mathematically
interesting and intriguing, and they form the backbone of coding theory and its
applications. The best algorithms for many algebraic codes are very powerful but
not very practical. Also, the exact decoding complexity is not well understood
for these codes, including the simple but extremely important Reed-Solomon
codes. The project will strive to identify the complexity of decoding algebraic
codes and to design more efficient algorithms for a large class of algebraic
codes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main focus is on algebraic codes with natural
parameters. The complexity results for these natural codes thus are more
relevant to communication practice. It is expected that the project will lead to
a number of substantial new results linking coding theory, computer sciences and
mathematics. The project is also expected to develop graduate courses and train
students in this cross-disciplinary research area.
