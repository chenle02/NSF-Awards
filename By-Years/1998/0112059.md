This collaborative research project will examine how some of the techniques that
have been used for English text recognition can be used with enhanced
technologies for OCR of Indian language documents. The proposal will create data
resources for testing and evaluating Devanagari recognition systems. Devanagari
is the script used by a number of Indian spoken languages, prominent among which
are Sanskrit, Hindi and Marathi. It is an alphabetic script, used by over 450
million people around the world. The research will be carried out by teams from
the Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition at SUNY-Buffalo
and the Indian Statistical Institute. The project is expected to result in new
tools for Devanagari and to stimulate research in other areas of script
recognition for NLP, document analysis and information retrieval.
