This award supports research in the area of vortices in algebraic and
symplectic geometry. It is based on earlier work by the investigator on vortices
and stable holomorphic pairs. Vortices are minima of Yang-Mills-Higgs energy,
and holomorphic pairs are holomorphic vector bundles with prescribed holomorphic
sections. This research concerns new directions in the study of vortices and
stable pairs and involves a generalization of the notion of a pair to that of a
triple consisting of two holomorphic bundles together with a holomorphic bundle
homomorphism. This will address the way in which objects can be obtained by a
dimensional reduction of an equivariant stable bundle on the Cartesian product
of the Riemann surface with the projective line. This award is in the general
area of geometry and, in particular, in algebraic and symplectic geometry. This
research will aid in our understanding of 4-dimensional manifolds and are
central to the current research in 'gauge theory'. In lay terms, a 'manifold'
plays the role of a surface.
