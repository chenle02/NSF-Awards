Physics (13) This project improves student conceptual and epistemological
knowledge in the sciences while developing a template for formative assessment
in a general education course at the University of Maine. A general education
course in Intuitive Quantum Physics is being created in which non-science
students learn quantum physics through simple observations, basic logical
reasoning, and graphical analysis. Materials from three proven curricula are
being adapted to include explicit discussions of epistemological issues. The
three curricula (developed in part with NSF funding) that are being adapted to
create the Intuitive Quantum Physics course include Activity-Based Tutorials in
wave mechanics, New Model Course in Applied Quantum Physics, and materials from
Tutorials in Introductory Physics.

Through these experiences, students become aware of their thinking and why they
can believe seemingly counter-intuitive ideas. Students leave the course with
deeper understanding of the process of science, confidence in their capacity for
seemingly difficult and counter-intuitive physics, and deeper conceptual
knowledge of modern physics. Results from the course are being shared at the
university, state, and national levels.
