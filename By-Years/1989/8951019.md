This funding supports a Microcomputer-based Instrumentation Laboratory which
enhances existing facilities by offering students in several disciplines hands-
on experience in automated data acquisition and sensor characteristics. Five
experimental stations in the laboratory each contain a microcomputer, hard disk,
floppy disk drive, math co- processor, and data acquisition boards. A printer is
also,available and five electrical ovens are used to investigate thermal sensor
characteristics. and to heat cycle electrical circuits. This award is being
matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.
