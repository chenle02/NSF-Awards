This award supports a new REU site located at Idaho State University with a
focus on applied nuclear physics. Undergraduate students will be recruited for
ten weeks of summer research and will work with to work with ISU researchers in
Accelerator, Nuclear, and Materials Science Facilities in the Idaho Accelerator
Center (IAC) and associated laboratories. Weekly lectures on advanced topics in
materials science and physics are also planned, as are opportunities for
students to improve their communication skills through presentations on their
work. Once accepted into the program, but prior to arrival at ISU, REU students
will be assigned to work in pairs with one or two specific faculty mentors.
Assignments will be based on prior student experience and communications between
students and mentors. Each pair of REU students will spend almost all of their
time working with faculty mentors on a specific research project. Brigham Young
University Idaho (BYUI) and the College of Southern Idaho (CSI) will serve as
partner institutions in these activities. A variety of social activities that
allow students to explore the area and to interact with other students are also
planned.
