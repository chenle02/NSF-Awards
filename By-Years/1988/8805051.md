This will establish an REU Site at the Demographic Research Laboratory, at
Western Washington University. Nine undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will
participate in "Applied Demographic Research on Migration" for two months in the
Summer, 1988. These students, supervised by a project team of professional
demographers, will focus their research efforts on the study of migration
profiles and analytical models. Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) and the
County to County Migration Flow files will serve as primary data sources for the
research experiences for undergraduates. The project provides undergraduates the
opportunity to become involved in the research process and to expand their
research related competencies through an intensive, two-month research project.
