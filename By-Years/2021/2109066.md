Principal Investigators (PIs) Stark and Zitrin will identify some of the largest
ionized gas bubbles around massive galaxies within the first billion years of
cosmic time. The team will conduct a survey using the Binospec spectrograph on
the MMT telescope and the Folded-Port Infrared Echellette spectrometer on the
Magellan telescope. The PIs will also collaborate with education experts at the
Mount Lemmon Sky Center to host professional development workshops for teachers
and provide them with human orrery models to use in their classrooms. This
project is supported by both the National Science Foundation and the US-Israel
Binational Science Foundation to further collaborations between the
astrophysical communities in the two countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Stark is
a co-PI of the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) using the
Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillmeter Array. This project is a complimentary
rest-frame ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of the bright REBELS galaxies at
z~7. The team will characterize the progress of reionization around these
massive galaxies using the brightness of the Lyman-alpha line and fainter
diagnostic lines observed in each system. The data will be used to characterize
both the nature of the ionized gas in terms of kinematics and chemical
enrichment, as well as to determine whether the major source of ionization is an
active galactic nucleus or a population of young massive
stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
