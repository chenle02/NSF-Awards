This SGER proposes to develop a plan to extend international high bandwidth
Internet connectivity to a group of up to four countries in sub-saharan Africa.
The lack of such connectivity has been a major impediment to the development of
the Internet in Africa. To accomplish this, it will investigate a unique
opportunity to obtain a donation of bandwidth on fiber optic submarine cables
that are currently being installed. Within each selected country, a "Technology
Exchange Point (TEP)" that will serve as both an aggregation point for domestic
network links and as a national network technology support center, will be
identified. Linkages will be developed with scientific and health/medical
communities that have research projects involving US/African collaborations.
Partnerships will also be explored with US agencies that fund research in the
target countries.
