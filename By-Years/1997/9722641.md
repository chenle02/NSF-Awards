This experiment searches for astrophysical neutrinos. These particles interact
very weakly and so massive detectors are needed to search for them. Amanda uses
the South Polar ice cap. Neutrinos which travel through this ice give of a
signal in the form of light. Detectors sensitive to this light are buried in the
ice and the signals are recorded. Information on the location and time of the
signal can be used to determine the direction of travel of the neutrinos. This
allows the experimenters to decide if the neutrinos are coming from point
sources. The goal of the research is to understand high energy astrophysical
processes.
