9322144 Johnson This award provides funds to the Department of Molecular
Genetics at Ohio State University to establish a Research Experience for
Undergraduates Site. Participants will be recruited from high quality
undergraduate institutions where research opportunities are limited. The
students will undertake an intense 10-week summer research program that
introduces them to a research problem, trains them in the experimental
approaches that are used to attack the problem, stimulates them to develop
independence, and enhances their ability to communicate scientific information
to others. Particular emphasis will be placed on the students' independent
planning of experiments, interpretation of experimental data, and presentation
of their observations to other students and faculty. The projects in which the
REU students will participate reflect the diversity of research interests of the
faculty as well as the common foundation of molecular genetics. This common
foundation will enable the REU students to appreciate the power of modern
molecular genetic approaches to solve a wide variety of problems in the
biological sciences. The REU students will work closely with the faculty mentor
and with the graduate students, postdocs and technicians in their laboratories.
They will participate in the weekly meetings of each research group as well as
the weekly REU seminar series. This will enable all of the REU students to meet
on a regular basis, to compare their experiences, and to broaden their horizons
regarding important research problems. At the end of the summer, the students
will write a summary of their experimental results and present their results to
the faculty and REU participants. ***
