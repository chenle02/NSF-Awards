This project is to develop a computer laboratory which serves the needs (solely)
of freshman engineering students in a sequence of required courses. Freshman
engineering students utilize this laboratory to acquire an initial experience
with the use of basic computer tools. In particular, the students obtain
experience with computer hardware and software that has been standardized for
use throughout the undergraduate curriculum.
