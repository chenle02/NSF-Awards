9304304 Dyar This is a research program on experimental study of the mechanical
behavior of upper mantle rocks. From an understanding of the way in which
hydrous species partition at upper mantle conditions it will be possible to
interpret mechanical property measurements. The proposed program will include
static experiments on aggregates of mantle minerals under high pressure and
temperature conditions, infrared measurements to characterize the partitioning
of water-derived species between the phases, and Mossbauer spectroscopy
measurements to monitor changes in the iron valence during uptake of water. ***
