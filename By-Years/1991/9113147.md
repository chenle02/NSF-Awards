The primary purpose of this Dissertation Improvement Proposal is to clarify
some of the factors affecting the appearance of early modern humans. Currently
this is a major point of contention in anthropology for some feel that modern
humans arose quite recently while others attribute much greater antiquity to our
species. The student proposes to gather measurements on crania from the Middle
Pleistocene, the early and middle Upper Pleistocene and the late Upper
Pleistocene; the key time periods involved in this debate. The data will then be
analyzed by a variety of algorithms in order to test the competing theories
about modern human origins.
