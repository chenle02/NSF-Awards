96306000 Standley Particle-reactive organic contaminants introduced into
aquatic environments are quickly concentrated onto suspended particle surfaces
and delivered to the sediment surface where intimate contact with benthic
organisms occurs. In this innovative project, the investigators will study
geochemical-biological interactions involved in the transfer of particle-
reactive anthropogenic organic contaminants from aquatic sediments to benthic
meio- and macrofaunal communities. The approach is innovative inasmuch as the
effects of sedimentary organic composition, chemical nature of contaminants, and
organism feeding pattern will be considered synoptically in field studies and
also studied in detail by experimental manipulation in laboratory microcosms.
The investigators anticipate that such studies will lead to a clearer
understanding of processes involved in sediment-to-animal transfer of
contaminants and to an improved capacity to predict the transfer of organic
contaminants between aquatic sediments and benthic communities.
