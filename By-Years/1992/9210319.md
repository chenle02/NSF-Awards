The purpose of this research is to analyze four topics related to the economic
theory of urban transportation. Given the huge costs of major new transportation
projects in downtown areas, as well as the political opposition to such
projects, the current trend in urban transportation policy is to utilize
existing capacity more effectively. This entails primarily demand reallocation
across travel modes, time of day, and links of the urban traffic network. The
dominant cause of the inefficient utilization of existing capacity is that urban
car travel is underpriced because drivers do not pay for the congestion they
impose on others. Three of the topics concern various aspects of congestion
pricing. The first asks the question; If efficient congestion pricing is
employed, what proportion of the costs of constructing and operating an urban
traffic network will be covered by tolls? The second examines efficient parking
policy by analyzing how much space, both on- and off-street should be provided
for parking and how should fees be set. The third topic considers some practical
aspects of the use of congestion pricing at major metropolitan airports to
replace the current system of weight- based landing fees levied on airplane. The
final topic investigates how individuals coordinate their daily schedules
(leisure and work activities) over time and space, with the aim of assessing the
desirability of government policy to encourage more flexible working hours.
