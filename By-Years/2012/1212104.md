Emotions are pervasive to human life and interactions. They are particularly
important to economics as they influence choices at several levels, impact well-
being, and shape communication in many markets. While economists have started to
realize the importance of emotions, it is not clear yet why and how much
individuals value expressing them and what kind of expression they favor.
Neither do we know the costs or benefits associated with allowing people to
express their emotions. In this proposal the PI will conduct a sequence of
laboratory experiments that modify bargaining environments in which a
disadvantaged party potentially has the option to express their emotions, either
verbally or through an action that has monetary consequences to the party
responsible for the disadvantage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Negotiations are
commonplace in politics, business and interpersonal relations. Findings from
this research may provide us with additional insights into the negotiation
process to the extent that the setting involves opportunities for expression
beyond those involving purely informational exchange.
