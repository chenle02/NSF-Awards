Intellectual Merit: The proposed program will develop nanowire transistors for
low-noise operation, which has not been addressed extensively to date in most
material systems. The proposed work will focus on core/shell nanowire
structures, which have the potential to provide well-controlled interfaces
comparable to those which have enabled high-performance heterostructures devices
in a number of materials. This well-integrated effort will correlate the device
performance to the materials, structure and bias conditions of the devices, and
will provide a means to utilize the measured noise characteristics to understand
the overall conduction processes within the devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:
The proposed research would provide new device concepts and new insights for
technologically relevant developments in nanowire-based electronics, including
applications in RF circuitry. The study will explore an approach which could be
broadly applied to a number of semiconductor materials of interest for various
device applications. The proposed effort also includes an integrated education
and outreach program aimed at addressing challenges in nanotechnology-related
education/training arising from the interdisciplinary nature of many of the
projects, and aimed at providing opportunities for participants from under-
represented groups. The proposed education and outreach program builds from
programs which address the specific challenges arising from this
interdisciplinary area. The proposed program includes development of a 1-D
Nanoelectronics course and integrated research and professional development
experiences for undergraduates.
