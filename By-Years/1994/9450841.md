9450841 Landau The project substantially enhances the computer lab component of
the Computational Physics class developed and taught for six years.
Specifically, the number of X-terminals and the number of CPU's are increased.
The three-fourfold increase in power and access permits the inclusion of
computational tools into the general physics curriculum -- in parallel with the
Computational Physics class-- and eliminates bottlenecks when the entire class
works on numerically-intensive projects. All the high performance workstations
in the physics department are being connected with the two new ones, and then
the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) software will run on all machines. This will
create a powerful, distributed memory parallel computer which gives students
needed experience in message passing and synchronization primitives. The
additional facility has also permitted the extension of the Computational
Physics course to an extra term, and thus continue the development of projects
which can be used throughout the physics curriculum. Finally, the equipment
strengthens and broadens the Physics Department's computing resources as a means
to assist in the development of an interdisciplinary Computational Science
program.
