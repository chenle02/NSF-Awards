Chapman Conferences are meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union,
designed to promote progress in the physical sciences by providing opportunities
not normally available through the format of larger meetings. The purpose of
this conference is to explore the Gaia Hypothesis along with its numerous
consequences and ramifications. A conference on this topic will draw from and
involve a large variety of disciplines. The convenors are leading experts from
the fields of atmospheric science, oceanography, geochemistry, biology, ecology,
geophysics, geology, and philosophy of sciences. Topics to be covered include
the homeostatic earth trends over earth's history, challenges to biological
homeostasis, and future climate and life.
