This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site: Manufacturing Metrology and
Quality Engineering at the University of Oklahoma, under the direction of Dr.
Shivakumar Raman. The project will involve 12 undergraduate students annually in
a 10-week summer program of individual and team research projects covering
topics that include coordinate tolerance metrology, machine vision, in-process
sensing and roughness metrology as well as emerging areas such as Scanning Probe
Microscopy and optical interferometry. The students will work with the REU site
P.I.s and a team of research mentors on selected projects. In addition, the
program will include, weekly presentations by faculty, laboratory tours,
industrial interaction, participant progress reports, social interaction and
other discussions. Ethics discussions and issues will be incorporated throughout
the program components.
