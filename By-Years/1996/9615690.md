9615690 Khoshnevis This award funds investigation of the concept of a single
centralized station to provide supervision, sensing, control, intelligence, and
perhaps power to a colony of robots, organized for the performance of specific
tasks. The consequence of such an approach is that each robot can be made much
simpler, smaller, and less expensive, since requirements for on-board sensing,
control, and intelligence are reduced or even eliminated. Human capability for
supervising and controlling multiple robots may also be augmented by this
approach. The issues to be studied concern tradeoffs in control (bandwidth,
accuracy, and channel capacity); relations between numbers of controllable
robots and task suitability; and representation for control.
