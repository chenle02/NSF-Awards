Unlike most organisms where the structure of the chromosomes (the karyotype) is
relatively stable, in the fungus Microbotryum there is enormous variation in
chromosome size and the DNA content from one generation to the next. Even within
an individual, there can be large differences between its two chromosome sets.
The reasons for this variation appear to be related to the reproductive system
of the fungus where mating occurs among the gametes produced by one precursor
cell (automixis). This mating system is very similar to that found in many other
fungi, plants, and insects. This study will examine the consequences of changes
in genomic structure for offspring viability, as well as the correlations
between chromosome variation and the proportion of the genome consisting of
highly repetitive sequences of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the
dynamics of genetic variation is the basis not only for interpreting
evolutionary processes, but also for rational approaches to plant and animal
breeding and population management for conservation, disease prevention, and
control of invasive species. Furthermore, even small changes in chromosome
structure are frequently associated with severe abnormalities in humans and
other systems. This study will help identify genetic processes that allow some
organisms to cope and even adapt to genomic instability. &lt;br/&gt;
