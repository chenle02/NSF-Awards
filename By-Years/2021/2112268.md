This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address one
of the most significant physical security gaps facing corporations and
government organizations alike, namely physical goods, deliveries, and mail
items moving in and out of buildings. According to the US Postal Service,
approximately 3,500 letters containing white powders are received each year. In
the best case, the letter is a hoax resulting in temporary shut-down and lost
productivity. In the worst case, the powder may be anthrax, ricin, or fentanyl,
resulting in hospitalization or death. Recently the opioid epidemic has also
grown to become a national health crisis, with a large fraction of opioids
entering the U.S. via the international mail system. There is a large unmet need
to non-invasively detect these materials as well. This project will address
these challenges head-on with a terahertz scanner that can image trace amounts
of powders and liquids in the mail, along with conventional threats including
weapons and explosives. The effort is focused on developing automated image
analysis tools to increase its effectiveness. If successful, the project will
address critical public health and safety challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
intellectual merit of this project centers on the development of image
processing and computer vision techniques to capitalize on the multidimensional,
dynamic three-dimensional (3-D) terahertz imaging dataset. No commercially
viable approaches are currently capable of automatically detecting threats in
real-time from terahertz imaging data streams. This project aims to develop
robust techniques to both enhance the capabilities of a human operator and
automatically detect specific threats. One challenge is the detection of liquid
or particle motion within the context of a moving reference frame â€“ such as the
motion of liquid within a small pouch, which is itself concealed within a moving
package. The subject THz imaging system is capable of detecting single drops of
liquid (50 mg) and imaging the movement of powders within explosives in real-
time. Another focus area for the project will be the integration of the 3-D
terahertz data set together with contextual information gleaned from other
sensor inputs, as well as external sources due to the connected nature of the
device. The fusion of this information with the terahertz data will provide
unparalleled detection capabilities and have far reaching impacts in the field
of dynamic, 3-D imaging, and threat detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
