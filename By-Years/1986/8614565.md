Funding is provided to the Dept. of Biology at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI) for the acquisition of equipment to establish a facility for
high resolution video analysis of biological systems. The equipment consists of
an inverted light microscope with attachments for making video images, and a
computerized motion analysis system for quantifying cell movement, ciliary
feeding mechanisms, and predator-prey interactions in a variety of marine
organisms. Recent studies have underscored the fact that the flow of energy in
marine ecosystems is greatly influenced by cell-to-cell interactions of
plankton, and that several "classical concepts" regarding the role of plankton
in the marine food chain are being reevaluated as are methods of studying
plankton. Traditional methods of working with preserved specimens are no longer
considered adequate to assess the complex interactions of organisms within a
population. Aquisition of the proposed video equipment will assist WHOI
investigators study and better understand the physiological, behavioral, and
ecological principles that affect trophic interaction in the marine food chain.
