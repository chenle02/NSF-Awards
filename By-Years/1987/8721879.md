This project is concerned with various problems involving the subgroup structure
of simple algebraic and finite groups. In particular, the principal investigator
will determine the maximal subgroups of the finite groups of Lie type and
associated algebraic groups. Related problems on the representation theory of
such groups will be studied. Following the classification of finite simple
groups, it is evident that applications will require knowlege of maximal
subgroups and representations. This award supports research which will determine
this structure.
