This Phase II SBIR award is concerned with increasing the maximum current that
can be carried by superconducting wire. The superconducting wire material is
Niobium-Titanium (NbTi), a material commonly used in superconducting magnets.
The approach is to introduce artificial pinning centers, impurity material
introduced to prevent the movement of magnetic flux lines. A factor of 2 in the
maximum current carrying capacity of superconducting wires at medium to high
magnetic fields is sought. The increase in maximum current carrying capacity
together with the reduction in processing costs through the new approach to
introduction pinning centers is expected to reduce the superconductor costs is
such applications as Magnetic Resonance Imaging in medicine. The Phase II
research is based on Phase I research in which a record current density of 7500
amperes per square millimeter at 3 Tesla, a relatively low magnetic field, was
achieved in NbTi.
