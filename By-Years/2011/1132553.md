Dr. Dorothy Zolandz of the National Research Council of the National Academy of
Sciences is supported by the Chemistry Division to convene a workshop with
leaders from the academic and industrial chemistry community to frame possible
research areas that should be considered under a Sustainable Chemistry Basic
Research program. This workshop is to be done partially in response to the
America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010, which calls for the Director of
the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a Green Chemistry Basic
Research program to award competitive, merit-based grants to support research
into green and sustainable chemistry. This workshop addresses the society's
critical need for safer, economical, and more environmentally sustainable
chemical products and processes. This one-day workshop will engage about 20
technical experts drawn from both industry and academe to discuss the most
pressing questions and greatest technical and research opportunities related to
sustainable chemistries.
