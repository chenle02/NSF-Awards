The purpose of the proposed work is directed toward the investigation of
stabilization of enzymes by attachment to soluble polymers. Methods for the
stabilization of enzymes by multi-point attachment to soluable polymers will be
developed, with the emphasis on improving the scope of the technique with
respect to the types of chemistry employed, the types of stabilizing molecules
used, and the number of different enzymes to which the methods can be applied.
The tresyl chloride method developed in Phase I of Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) will be further examined, using several different hydroxylic
polymers and also lower molecular weight diols and polyethylene glycols. Other
chemistries to be explored include reactions to produce multi-point attachment
through chemically modified lysine residues and through carboxyl groups. Once
refined, the methods will be applied to a number of different enzymes. Finally,
the techniques will be developed for the production of stabilized, immobilized
enzymes. This work is to be funded under Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR)Phase II program. The funds to be granted here will permit Genetics
Institute to undertake further research to fully demonstrate the technical
feasibility for commercialization under Phase II of the SBIR Program. The
technical staff of Genetics Institute has an outstanding track record on enzyme
technology, and the success of this project could benefit the food,
pharamaceutical and feed industries.
