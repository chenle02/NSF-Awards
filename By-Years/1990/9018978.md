As a continuation of the geochronological and geochemical studies in the
hotspot lineaments of French Polynesia, helium concentrations and isotopic
ratios will be run by D. Desonie as a post-doctoral study with R. Duncan (OSU).
This geochemical work will be done on submarine basalt glasses and olivine
phyric basalts from the OSU a collection as well as other samples obtained by
OSTROM (France). The helium analyses will be done in Mark Kurz's lab at WHOI.
