Although scientific knowledge about many dimensions of global-scale climatic
change has been growing for a number of decades, many organizations are ill-
prepared to address challenges posed by changing environmental conditions.
Information upon which they base decisions is incomplete and sometimes
erroneous, and the processes used to formulate, consider, implement, and
evaluate decisions may be incomplete or lacking. This distributed
interdisciplinary collaborative group will combine knowledge and research
methods from behavioral and decision sciences, engineering, and natural science
to assist individuals, corporations, governments, and the international
community to better address many of the difficult climate decisions they now
face. The group's researchers are associated with about 10 different
organizations. They will address a range of topics, including decisions about
reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy system, decisions related
to adapting to the impacts of climate change, issues that arise as a result of
interactions between reducing emissions and adapting to change, and dealing with
unexpectedly rapid or large changes or impacts. While addressing these climate
decision problems, the group's investigators will work to identify limits to
existing theory and methods and to make fundamental contributions to the
development and dissemination of new frameworks, theory, and methods in the
social, behavioral, and decision sciences. In order to assure that this more
fundamental work occurs in a regular and systematic way, the group regularly
will convene theory and methods workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group's
anticipated contributions are four-fold. It will provide guidance and support
for a number of key climate-related decisions. It will develop and demonstrate
advanced tools and methods to support improved decision making and disseminate
those new tools to decision makers and to the policy and research communities.
The group will educate a cadre of high-quality interdisciplinary Ph.D. and M.S.
researchers who will make future contributions in the field. Through a Teacher
Professional Development Program, the group will provide large numbers of high
school students across North America with the opportunity to learn with, and
make use of, materials derived from the group's research. This collaborative
group project is supported by the NSF Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and
Economic Sciences through its Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU)
competition.
