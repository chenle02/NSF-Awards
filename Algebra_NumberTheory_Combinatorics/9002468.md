This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic geometry of Professor
Andrew Wiles of Princeton University. Dr. Wiles plans to continue his researches
in Iwasawa Theory by examining the symmetric square of a representation
associated to a certain class of Hecke eigenforms. In this way, he hopes to
attack the Greenberg conjectures, which concern the newly defined Selmer groups
of compatible families of L-adic representations. This is research in the field
of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of
algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic
geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and
such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two
subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from the
earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual influence has
increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses
techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence
beyond its own borders.
