The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting Professor
Davidson at Indiana University. Over the next three years he will continue his
development and application of new methodologies in the field of quantum
chemistry for the purpose of understanding the very fundamental inner workings
of molecules. The major focus of this theoretical research is in the area of
multi-reference perturbation theory. Another aspect of this work involves the
development of an alternative formulation of open shell density functional
theory. This research will also continue investigations of a number of chemical
systems, particularly of unstable forms of molecules. Computational chemistry
has become very proficient at describing the properties of stable species.
Chemical reactions of hot molecules are much more difficult to describe because
the electrons in a reacting molecule are often distributed in ways that differ
greatly from their behavior in stable molecules. Application of many standard
computational methods often provides inaccurate and misleading predictions for
reacting molecules. This research aims to improve methods designed to follow
chemical reactions and to predict their outcomes. This requires developing
methods that apply to fragments of molecules and to molecules with partially
broken bonds. These methods will be tested by collaborating with experimental
research groups that have compiled some information for a few well chosen
reactions.
