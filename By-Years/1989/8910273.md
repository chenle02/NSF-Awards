The proposal consists of eight distinct projects which are both theoretical and
applied. It is expected that the result of this work will be further
contributions in the areas of theoretical econometrics, financial markets and
regional economic forecasting. One of the most important recent breakthroughs in
the field of econometrics was in the development of Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models. The first six projects to be undertaken by
Professor Engle involve this type of analysis. The theoretical components of
these analyses include developing more fully the statistical theory for FACTOR
ARCH models and running experiments with such models on his data sets, and using
spline functions to estimate ARCH models with non-parametric conditional
distributions. The other projects in this area involve applying ARCH models to
examine the volatility of the term structure of interest rates using longer term
government securities than previous work (i.e., short-term Treasury bills),
daily price changes for small publicly-traded firms which exhibit large
variances, forecasting in the options markets and estimating the "price of
risk". There are two projects that are included in this grant involving the
field of cointegration.THe first will test to see if there is cointegration in
payrolls between broad industry groupings in the U.S. and individual states,
using the traditional forecasting assumptions of share shifting and base
multipliers. The second project is more theoretical in nature and will attempt
to answer some questions involving general estimation problems in cumulative
integrative processes, such as consumption and income or consumption and wealth.
