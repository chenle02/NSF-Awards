The innovation of this neuroscience project will be used to build a proprietary
model of how the human brain generates preference from the perception of visual
information. This model will serve as the basis for a web-based software product
that can automatically select the most visually appealing frame from an online
video to be used as the thumbnail representing the video. Using neuroscience to
predict the visual appeal of a thumbnail allows for automated identification of
more engaging thumbnails that will increase click-through rates and, as a
result, video views. This is critically important for publishers because the
thumbnail is the direct point of contact between publishers, advertisers, and
users, meaning that billion dollar revenue streams pass through this tiny image.
By introducing state-of-the-art neurotechnology to online video thumbnail
selection, the proposed innovation offers a scientific way to increase clicks
rates, video views, and, as a result, revenue streams.

The broader/commercial impact of the proposed innovation stems from the
generality of the core technology, which is predicting human preference for
visual information using neuroscience. Once developed, this automated video
thumbnail selection method will revolutionize online video, and can easily be
extended to optimize image selection for any online media. For example, static
online display advertisements such as banner ads, thumbnails for products on
e-commerce websites, consumer package design, product design, User Interface
(UX) Design for mobile devices, and application icons. Together these commercial
sectors generate trillions of dollars in revenue every year, creating an
exceptionally large market for the technology. Through Neon's technology, the
way in which Internet users interact with and select visual information will be
transformed.
