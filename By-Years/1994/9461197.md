The use of neural networks for forecasting sockeye salmon Bristol Bay returns is
proposed. In Phase I, this project will collect and characterize available data
sources, train a neural network to forecast the sockeye salmon run, and compare
the performance of the resulting system against existing techniques. Because
neural networks are able to automatically learn nonlinear mappings from diverse
data types, it is expected that neural networks will produce more accurate
forecasts. In Phase II this project will expand its scope to include fish
population modeling.
