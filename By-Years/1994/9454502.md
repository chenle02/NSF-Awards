A program for training biotechnology technicians is presently operating at
Contra Costra Community College, with articulation with Richmond High School. A
Tech-prep grant funded internships at Contra Costra College and local
biotechnology firms for high school students. This project proposes to assist
science educators and scientists to continue preparing technicians for local
biotechnology companies. A three week workshop for 48 teachers and 8 meetings
during the academic year will be offered. Mentors will do two site visits and
telecommunications will be used to implement the program. Funds are requested to
assist with development of Dr. Rosen's biotechnology kit and curriculum and its
implementation into many high schools with high minority enrollments.
