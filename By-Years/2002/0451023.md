0451023&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to support conference and
travel expenses for the fourth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Coastal Ocean
Circulation, to be held June 5 - 10, 2005 at Colby-Sawyer College, New London,
New Hampshire. The objective of the Coastal Ocean Circulation GRC is to bring
together scientists with common interests for a week of intense discussion
stimulated by invited lectures on research at the forefront of coastal physical
oceanography and related interdisciplinary areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This Gordon Research Conference is a
valuable means of disseminating information and ideas in a way that cannot be
achieved through the usual channels of communication, such as publications or
presentations at large scientific meetings. The conference provides a forum for
the development and evaluation of new disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research directions and an ideal environment for collaborations between
different scientific communities within coastal oceanography.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The conference directly addresses NSF's
goal to foster the integration of research and education. This conference is an
effective way to educate young scientists in the different topic areas at the
frontiers of coastal physical oceanography and provides a unique opportunity for
young scientists to meet and interact with leading researchers in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;
