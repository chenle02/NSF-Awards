The award is for theoretical studies important for the interpretation and
understanding of experimental data on cosmic-ray extensive air showers and
neutrino fluxes. The group of two senior faculty, together with a post-doctoral
associate focus on calculations of neutrino interaction rates in the various
detectors, further development of a model to calculate particle interactions at
high energies and determination of the primary composition of cosmic-rays at .
1014 eV. That last is to be compared with expectations based on hypothesized
acceleration mechanisms.
