Silicon carbide is a leading new candidate for mirror blanks because of its
high stiffness, relatively high thermal conductivity, and abrasion resistance.
This base material contains pores or large grains, which make it difficult to
provide a smooth front surface. A process has been developed for using electron
cyclotron resonance chemical vapor deposition to deposit very smooth amorphous
silicon carbide (SiC) on 100 mm substrates. This material is easily polished to
obtain a 10-20A rms surface roughness. This process will be scaled up to coat
large diameter optics. The main problems associated with scale up involved
plasma gas dynamics and fluid flows. As part of this program, we will develop a
general computational model that will be used for designing the gas delivery
system. We will then modify an existing system to coat large-area optics with
smooth, amorphous SiC.
