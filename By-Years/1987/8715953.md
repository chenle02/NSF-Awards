The Ohio University has several researchers who would benefit from access to
supercomputers and access to other researchers connected to the NSFNET. These
scientists constitute a growing number of faculty and graduate students who
require advanced computing facilities in order to carry out their research. The
campus requests a portion of the funds needed for equipment for connection to
the NSFNET through the State of Ohio communication network centered at Ohio
State University. Consistent with the NSFNET Program policy regarding connection
to existing mid-level networks, this grant is an award of $20,000 for routing
equipment at the campus, which will be used as a gateway to networks external to
the campus. Connections to the Ohio State University hub will be provided by
Ohio University. Ohio State University is connected to the NSFNET Backbone
network as member of the the CICNET regional (multicampus) network and as such
has computer communication capability with all institutions currently connected
to the nation research network, NSFNET.
