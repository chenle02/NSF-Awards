Non-technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;Colloids are nano and micrometer sized spheres
suspended in a liquid. The aim of this research is to explore and develop
methods to direct, or program, the assembly of these particles into specific
ordered crystalline arrangements. The ultimate goal is to take colloids made
from diverse materials such as polymers, glasses, metals, and semiconductors,
suspend them in a water (or some other liquid) and cause them to self-assemble
into preprogrammed functional microscopic arrangements. The applications are
likely to be in technologies as diverse as optoelectronics, microfluidics,
filtration, and catalysis, where the precise arrangement of different types of
materials on the microscale is key to their functionality. The research team
will use DNA sequences attached to different nano and microparticles, which will
be used to program the self-assembly of the microscopic colloidal particles. The
team will investigate how these particles move and dynamically arrange
themselves to form various crystalline structures and will test theories of how
such programmed assembly occurs. The research will train doctoral and
postdoctoral researchers in these emerging state-of-the-art methods of colloidal
self-assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;The goal of
this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the microscopic
processes that govern the self-assembly and crystallization of DNA-coated
colloids. The work takes advantage of recent breakthroughs developed in the
principal investigator's laboratory for creating new DNA coatings for a wide
spectrum of colloidal materials. The research team will focus on the dynamics of
crystallization in one-component and, as time and resources permit, two-
component systems. The experiments will measure the dynamics of phase separation
using optical microscopy and light scattering primarily, but will also employ
electron microscopy and rheology. The experiments target the different dynamical
processes involved in crystal formation at the microscopic (individual particle)
level, including nucleation, spinodal decomposition, diffusion, and annealing.
DNA-coated colloids represent a new frontier for the self-assembly of advanced
materials. Because they possess a number of unique properties, including
programmable specific interactions, temperature-dependent pair potentials, and
spatially fluctuating surface interactions, they present a number of new
scientific challenges related to the frontiers of self-assembly, and modify
classical mechanisms of nucleation and growth, anomalous diffusion, and
programmable directed diffusion. The research team will develop quantitative
models to describe and understand their observations.
