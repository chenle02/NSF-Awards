This Science in Developing Countries Program award supports travel expenses of
U.S. and Latin American physicists and doctoral students to participate in a
Workshop on High Energy Physics, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in January
1993. Workshop organizers are Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin and
Alberto Santoro of the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Brazil.
The workshop is organized in conjunction with collaborative projects associated
with experiments 769 and 791 conducted by Fermilab and Brazilian high energy
physicists. Its aim is to involve graduate students and junior researchers in
these projects and enhance their background in high energy physics. This
workshop is likely to produce benefits to all participating countries by
promoting science education and the development of future collaborative research
ties.
