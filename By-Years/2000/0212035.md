This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fabricate a
nanostructured, palm-size gas chromatography (GC) for the in-situ, and low cost
analysis of volatile chemicals. Gas chromatography has been widely used as an
analytical instrument for volatile organic compounds. The existing GC
instruments, including the portable ones, have inherent limitations that make
them unsuitable for the continuous, on-line/in-situ monitoring applications. The
proposed program will design and demonstrate a nanotechnology-based miniature GC
to detect, identify, and quantify chemical pollutants. The proof of principle
demonstration is based on an EPA furnished test matrix.

The miniature GC is expected to be pocket sized, low power (1-5 W), low cost (<
$500/unit) and low maintenance. In addition to the EPA environmental monitoring
applications, the miniature GC has a variety of other applications for DOD,
NASA, and other government agencies involve in chemical warning medicine,
homeland security, and demilitarization and treaty verification.
