The self-concept is the outcome of a number of forces, including no doubt, the
culture within which the concept develops. If cultures differ, then the self-
concepts of inhabitants of the cultures should differ too. If this is so, then
the system of rewards, of interdependencies, of fitting-in, achieving, etc.,
should differ as well. This research, focused on American and Japanese
respondents, is an attempt to test these possibilities. The goal of the 12
studies of the project is to lay the groundwork for understanding differences in
the ways in which the fundamental reward systems work cross-culturally. The
implications of this research for understanding important cultural differences,
and for understanding ways in which cultures might be brought into more
effective communication, are vast. The research team on the project is first-
rate, and there is little doubt that this project will provide results of
immense importance, both in terms of fundamental social psychological theory and
application.
