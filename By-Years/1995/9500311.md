DMS-9500311 Fokas The PI is investigating mathematical aspects arising in the
study of integrable equations, as well as their implications for the associated
physical problems modeled by such equations. Emphasis will be placed on the
following two problems: (a) The solution of initial- boundary value problems on
the half-infinite life for decaying initial and boundary data; (b) Investigation
of certain new integrable generalizations of the well known integrable equations
and their novel mathematical solutions, which include peakons and compactons. In
recent years important advances in the study of certain nonlinear equations have
occurred. In particular it has been found that large classes of physically
important equations support coherent structures. Such coherent structures
include the so called solitons, dromions, peakons, and compactons. Most of these
studies have concentrated on initial value problems. However, many physical
situations, including problems arising in ionosphere and in optical switches,
are modeled by initial-boundary value problems. The proposed investigation of
these problems will have important physical implications such as the
understanding of the interaction of a light beam with an interface separating
two media with different dielectrics.
