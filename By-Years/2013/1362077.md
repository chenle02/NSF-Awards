The planned I/UCRC for Rational Catalyst Synthesis intends to establish a
research portfolio that can transform the art of catalyst preparation into a
science through bringing powerful, complementary expertise to bear on
fundamental problems of nanoscience and nanoengineering of heterogeneous
catalysts. In nanoengineering applications, nanoparticles can be synthesized
with specific size, content (single or multi-metals) and morphology and so be
optimized for particular catalytic reactions or to minimize the content of
expensive precious metals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalytic processes represent a
major underpinning of the U.S. economy and are responsible for commodity
chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, and fertilizer and specialty chemicals
such as pharmaceuticals. About 20% of the world?s economy depends directly or
indirectly on catalysis. Broader educational impact will be achieved in the
practical mindset of all projects and the students trained through their
execution. This industrial bent will stem from two sources; first, internally,
from the industry research experience of the leadership, and second, from direct
involvement of industry in individual research projects. Educational outreach
will include the recruitment and eventual industrial placement of
underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
