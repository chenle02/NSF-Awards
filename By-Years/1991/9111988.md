Currently, users have difficulties in retrieving information which is stored in
different types of database systems. Most users are not familiar with different
query languages and may not be aware of the locations of data. The objective of
this project is to facilitate query formulation and to speed up query processing
in heterogeneous database environments, i.e. where different types of database
systems, specifically, relational, object-oriented, deductive, and textual
systems co-exist in an organization or across different organizations. To enable
a user who is familiar with only a single query language to access information
stored in different types of database systems, translators of query languages
are being built. An intelligent data dictionary is constructed to facilitate
schema integration and query translation. Query processing performance is
optimized by application of logic-based methods, using knowledge about the types
of queries previously processed. Parallel processing techniques across different
systems are employed to provide further speedup. The resulting heterogeneous
query processing system will find wide applicability as the networking of
different database systems becomes widespread.
