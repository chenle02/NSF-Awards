In this doctoral dissertation study Mark Westneat, working under the
supervision of Dr. John Lundberg at Duke University, will study the evolution of
feeding specializations in the cheiline wrasses, a group of fish species common
in coral reef communities. Westneat has applied the concept of a four-bar-
crank-chain model, borrowed from mechanical engineering, to the analysis of jaw
structure and function in these fishes. Westneat has developed a computer
simulation of this model which he uses to analyze data derived from high speed
cinematography of wrasses feeding. A second parallel project is to reconstruct
the evolutionary history of the group using modern cladistic methods. Cladistic
methods are numerical procedures that examine the distributions of traits
(morphological, biochemical, etc.) among the species; closely related species
share more derived traits than do distantly related species. Cladistic
procedures can be programmed into computers and the computers then used to
reconstruct the evolutionary history of the group of species. Lundberg and
Westneat will study the jaw specializations in many species of wrasses against
this backdrop of evolutionary history to determine how the basic plan of the
four-bar-crank-chain is modified by natural selection into many feeding
specializations. This study melds modern technologies such as computer
simulation, cladistic methods, high speed cinematography, etc. into a single
study of the evolution of a complex system. Studies of this nature serve as
paradigms for understanding the evolution of complex adaptations.
