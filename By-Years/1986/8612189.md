This proposal will provide a computing facility to support the computationally
intensive research efforts being undertaken by groups working on the structure
function relationships of biological molecules and their assemblies. These
research efforts include x-ray crystallographic studies of proteins and
macromolecular assemblies, solution structures of proteins and polypeptides by
NMR spectroscopy, computational simulation of biomolecular behavior using
quantum mechanics, molecular mechanics, and molecular dynamics, molecular
modeling of macromolecular interactions using computer graphics and
computational analysis and methods development in molecular graphics and
computational geometry. This instrumentation will greatly enhance the
advancement of research involving the structures and functions of biological
molecules and their assemblies. Support is recommended.
