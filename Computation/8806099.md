This project is concerned with the development of fast and efficient algorithms
for the optimal feedback control of continuous time nonlinear dynamical systems,
perturbed by Gaussian and Poisson white noise. The computational treatment of
Poisson noise is a particularly unique feature of this proposal. Fast algorithms
for vector multiprocessor computations are being developed that take advantage
of vector formulation of the problem and other parallelizeable parts of the
algorithm. Another important feature is that the advanced computing aspects of
this work help remove Bellman's "curse of dimensionality".
