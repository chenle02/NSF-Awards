ABSTRACT - Koylu This is a study of soot formation in laminar flames that are
forced by a controlled time-varying flow field. A counterflow burner is used
with a loudspeaker on each side to impose unsteady strain rates on the flames.
Measurements are made on steady and unsteady flames including volume fraction of
translucent and mature soot particles, particle/aggregate sizes, soot
morphology, particle velocity, flame temperature, molecular fluorescence, and
radiative losses. Experimental techniques include laser scattering and
extinction, thermophoretic sampling with examination by transmission electron
microscopy, visible absorption spectroscopy, laser Doppler velocimetry, two-
wavelength pyrometry, thermocouple measurements, laser-induced fluorescence, and
total radiation heat flux. Fuels used include methane, propane, propylene, and
acetylene; strain rates are varied in the range of 20-200 sec -1. Computational
predictions of soot and flame properties are made and compared to the
experimental observations. This is an attempt to bridge the gap between laminar
(which is easily studied) and turbulent (reflecting practical systems)
nonpremixed combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. The long-term goal is perfection of
methods to control soot formation in a range of applications including internal
combustion engines, gas turbines, and industrial furnaces.
