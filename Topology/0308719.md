Abstract

Award: DMS-0308719 Principal Investigator: Gordana Matic

The Georgia Topology Conference is an annual conference that has been organized
by several generations of topologists at the University of Georgia for over
forty years. The conference has focused on many areas of topology including
hyperbolic geometry, laminations, foliations, 4-manifolds, 3-manifold
invariants, symplectic topology and contact topology. The conference has always
featured emerging areas of research in topology.

Topology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the space we
live in. As such there are deep relationships between topology, geometry, and
physics. It is this diversity of approaches to central problems that has always
energized research in topology. We encourage and fund participation by members
of underrepresented groups. Our participants and organizers have included many
women. Typically our conferences feature a few senior researchers and a large
group of young researchers, mostly recent Ph.D.'s and some graduate students.
This format, with its attention to emerging areas of research, helps this
conference play a significant role in both disseminating the newest research and
preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful research career in
mathematics.
