This project seeks to develop plasma gas-liquid reactors to produce chemical
disinfectants (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals) through plasma
formation. Previous support from NSF has provided knowledge of the basic
chemical reactions and the mechanisms for the formation of reactive species
including hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide in small laboratory scale
reactors where non-thermal plasma contacts with liquid water. The research team
has discovered that higher efficiencies can be obtained when plasma formed in
the gas phase contacts a flowing liquid film or an aerosol of water droplets and
used this to develop a reactor system. The reactor system developed is quite
simple, durable, and robust. While it is currently of relatively small
laboratory scale, we expect that the scale up can be addressed so that the
system can have a potential impact on the market for small processing plants and
perhaps personal use where portability and low unit expense are
needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new technologies for
disinfection, water cleaning, and chemical oxidation can address many public
health and environmental problems as well as improve industrial
efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;Small scale efficient gas-liquid plasma reactors may find
wide use in a variety of such applications.
