Abstract - Clark - 9413890 The goal of this research is to develop a working
understanding of microwave interactions with materials that will enable targeted
industrial operations to apply microwave technologies to product manufacturing.
The system to be studied will be that of sol-gel-derived silica. A silicon
alkoxide precursor mixed with water and alcohol will undergo reactions under the
influence of both microwave and conventional heating techniques. Using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIRS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as
well as a new technique for measuring the effects of microwave irradiation
during processing -- a cavity ring-down apparatus outfitted with a microwave
applicator -- the effects of microwave energy and conventional heating on
molecular bond formation/dissociation of each individual component of the sol
and the sol itself will be examined. Dielectric property measurements will be
performed on the sol, gel and solid components at microwave frequencies (and
temperatures) over which the reactions will take place. This approach will
enable a correlation between dielectric properties, the molecular/phase changes,
reaction extent and the resultant properties of the chemicals/materials during
the various stages of microwave processing. The silica system will be used
because: (1) it is a well-studied material system that will allow for comparison
with current standards and targeted properties; (2) it will allow for evaluation
of the microwave/material interactions from liquid through solid states; and (3)
it is an industrially important material for applications ranging from optical
lenses and fibers to high-temperature, corrosion-resistant windows.
