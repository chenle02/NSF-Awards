This action funds Austin Jay Brockmeier of University of Florida to conduct a
research project, entitled "Signal processing techniques to separate and analyze
brainwaves." during the summer of 2012 at Brain Science Institute RIKEN in Wako-
shi, Saitama, Japan. The host scientist is Dr. Andrezj Cichocki.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the application of recent work
on matrix and tensor constrained decomposition methods to separate sources of
recurrent patterns and oscillations in local field potential and
electroencephalogram data. The primary hypothesis is that these signals can be
decomposed as a linear combination of sources with distinct spatio-temporal
characteristics, and the revealed sources will serve as sufficient descriptors
to classify behavioral or cognitive activity of interest.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
