This project will develop operator theory methods for differential equations.
The main areas to be studied are Thomas- Fermi theory, nonlinear partial
differential equations, semilinear problems, singular perturbation, and
semigroups of operators. The questions to be addressed have been motivated by
models arising in science and engineering. Understanding of the fundamental
properties of these models has profound implications in areas such as physics,
biology, and geology.
