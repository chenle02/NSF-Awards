Software development involves both individual and group activities that search
for information artifacts such as code and software development documentation.
The research objective of this project is to understand and improve the
effectiveness of information gathering in software development. The research
adopts foraging theory from biological ecology to mathematically model the
economics of information gathering. The research will validate the individual
foraging model, extending them to group activities. The models attempt to
enhance developer productivity by capitalizing on collaboration and learning by
quantitatively characterizing the interdependent relationship at the individual
and group levels, characterizing the limits, creating optimal solutions within
those limits. The technical approach uses systems of networked information
economies involving the production, distribution, and consumption of information
products (e.g., tags) by decentralized users operating over a network, as in
FLOSS (free/libre/open-source software) communities and Wikipedia. In this
economy, costs occurring at the personal level benefit not only the individual
but also the group (collective, team, society). The broader impacts arise from
higher software productivity, new training methods, and a formal theory that can
be used in further empirical investigations.
