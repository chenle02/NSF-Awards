The ultimate goal of this research is to understand and develop methods to
better forecast large-scale, extended range forecasts on time scales of 10 to 30
days. A number of factors contribute to the variability of the skill of extended
range forecasts such as the quality of the information available to describe the
initial state of the atmosphere at the start of the forecast, model
deficiencies, and the dynamical instabilities of the atmosphere. The Principal
Investigator will explore the predictability of the atmosphere by: (1)
diagnosing existing data sets of extended range forecasts carried out with the
National Meteorological Center's (NMC) operational forecast model and (2)
conducting experiments with simplified versions of the NMC global model to
determine to what extent particular regions or weather regimes determine
subsequent atmospheric predictability.
