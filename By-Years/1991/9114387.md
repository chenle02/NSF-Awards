In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Chemistry Division, Prof.
Weltner (U. Florida) will use Electron Spin Resonance and Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy to study clusters of metals, carbon, and semiconductors
trapped at low temperatures in rare gas matrices. Novel aspects of the work
include magnetic field dependence of IR spectra and ESR spectra of
microcrystalline metal particles. %%% Prof. Weltner (U. Florida) will trap very
small particles of metals and semiconductors at low temperatures, and study them
using infrared and radio frequency irradiation. This is important because it
provides fundamental information on how assemblies of molecules interact to give
desirable properties of bulk materials.
