The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of an enterprise performance management (EPM) platform for
investors, customers, suppliers, employees, and the community. The technology
aims to broaden the scope of knowledge from financial-centric performance to an
interdisciplinary framework of economic, social, psychological, and physical
well-being concerning all stakeholders. In addition, the technology may
democratize artificial intelligence (AI) to ordinary organizational managers who
may not possess sophisticated analytics skills. The current AI models lack
interactive and intuitive storytelling. Matching the hierarchical clustering of
data with a causal knowledge graph, the proposed technology will prepare user
data in a way that mimics a general managerâ€™s intuitive thinking. The technology
addresses a commercial gap in the market - that of a lack of prescriptive
capability, that is, telling end-users what they should do. Data may be
collected from different sources in an organization, so they are fragmented and
the causal links are lost. The external source of a causal knowledge graph fills
the gap by presenting and interpreting the hidden causal links in EPM data. The
project seeks to help executives to prescribe interventions to enhance the well-
being of all stakeholders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on
the development of a knowledge graph embeddings-based platform for statistical
and machine learning models of enterprise performance management (EPM) data. The
technology is designed to engage natural language processing models to convert a
massive volume of scientific research in organizational science into a causal
knowledge graph, which will be embedded into a visual analytics platform to
structure and interpret enterprise management data. The goal is to help EPM
users by explaining the hidden causal pathways visually and intuitively to
enable improvements in organizational management. The proposed technology
combines research outcomes across organizational and computer sciences and
involves two innovations: a scientific knowledge graph on causes-and-effects
related to organizational performance and a new knowledge graph embeddings-based
visualization technique to enable explainable AI (XAI). Hierarchical clustering
is used to explicate the descriptions of variables in data and organize these
descriptions. Causal hypotheses are automatically developed based on the known
causal links in the knowledge graph and then empirically tested in statistical
and machine learning models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
