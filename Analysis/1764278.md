Free boundary problems arise in many models in physics, engineering, fluid
dynamics, and economics. Free boundaries correspond to sharp changes in the
variables describing the problem. While significant progress has been made in
the study of free boundary problems, many important questions have yet to be
studied in the case of nonlinear partial differential equations and especially
equations of mixed type. For these cases, a better understanding of properties
of free boundaries, such as stability, regularity and geometric structure, would
make it possible to study complex phenomena in real-world applications. The
primary focus of this project is the study of shock reflection problems in gas
dynamics, one of the most fundamental multidimensional shock wave problems. The
project will also have a broad impact through close interactions with
engineering and meteorological communities and through training of graduate
students.

The project consists of two main topics: (1) Free boundary problems in shock
analysis. The PI will continue his work on self-similar shock reflection for
potential flow and for full and isentropic Euler system. Shock reflection
problems arise in many physical situations. Moreover, such problems are
important in the mathematical theory of multidimensional conservation laws since
their solutions are building blocks and asymptotic attractors of general
solutions to the multidimensional Euler equations for compressible fluids. Self-
similar equations of compressible fluid dynamics are of mixed elliptic-
hyperbolic type. Shocks correspond to discontinuities in the solution for Euler
system, and in the gradient of the solution for potential flow equation. Type of
equation may change from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock. Shock
reflection problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem in which unknown
are the elliptic (subsonic) region and solution in the elliptic region. The PI
will continue his work on existence, stability and regularity of global
solutions of the regular reflection, to extend the global existence results to
the case of compressible Euler system, which is a fundamental model of gas
dynamics. Further study includes uniqueness and stability for regular reflection
problem in various classes of solutions. (2) Another area of the proposed
research is semi-geostrophic system. The PI will study semi-geostrophic system
with variable Coriolis parameter. Such model arises from taking into account the
curvature of the Earth.
