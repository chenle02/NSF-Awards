9616913 Duennebier A Seismic swarm at Loihi seamount detected by the US
Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory seismic array began on 16 July
1996 and, at this time, over 2000 earthquakes have bee recorded. This is the
most intense swarm of earthquakes ever recorded from any Hawaiian volcano.
Anticipating that this swarm is accompanied by volcanic activity, this project
will use the University of Hawaii research vessel KOK and Pisces submersible.
the bathymetry of the seamount will be resurveyed, the water over the seamount
will be sampled to locate any eruptive activity, and, if safety considerations
allow, rock samples obtained.
