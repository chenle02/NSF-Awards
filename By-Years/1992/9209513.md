The goal of this research is to develop more reliable, experimentally-based
constant-rate-of-strain (CRS) test analysis techniques, particularly at fast
strain rates. A new computer automated CRS consolidation apparatus will be used
to conduct one-dimensional (1-D) consolidation tests on a resedimented clay. The
proposal has the following objectives: 1. develop computer automated CRS; 2.
conduct CRS tests at various strain rates and characterize the excess pore
pressure distribution; 3. compare these results to those from other 1-D
consolidation tests; 4. assess the CRS test's suitability for rapidly
determining hydraulic conductivity; 5. incorporate the results into a unified
data base of time-dependent cohesive behavior.
