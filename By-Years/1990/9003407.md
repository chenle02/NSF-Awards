This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989) investigation project in
learning from this damaging event. This project studies one particular structure
which faired remarkably well amidst similar buildings which suffered
considerable damage during the earthquake. The Clarion Hotel complex is located
in a region where high ground accelerations were measured due to the soft soil
conditions near the San Francisco Airport. Interaction of the heavily reinforced
pile foundation with the soil medium is suspected to have provided beneficial
effects by mobilizing radiation and hysteretic damping. In addition, the pile
flexibility may have provided a longer period than present in a fixed base
structure. The effects of soil-pile-structure interaction on the performance of
a portion of the hotel will be investigated using a complex response analysis in
the frequency domain and a nonlinear time history analysis. The analysis
utilizes and extends a methodology developed earlier to focus on interaction
effects in an actual case. Important results expected include a comparison of
the forces acting in the building and foundation elements as computed from the
interactive and fixed base models, and an assessment of the period shift
produced by pile flexibility.
