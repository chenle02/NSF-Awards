The use of portable equipment (e.g., radio transceivers, portable communication
devices, medical-related instrumentation, sensing devices, night vision
equipment, high-rate missile firing systems) over a wide range of conditions
have placed an increased premium on the development of improved batteries. The
problems to be addressed in the proposed program are how to increase the cell
energy/power density as they are affected by electrolyte and cathode material,
and how to increase the potential at which reduction occurs. A further problem
is how to improve cell safety by using a less reactive, energy-dense anode
material such as calcium. Lithium batteries, which combine a high energy-density
anode with an equally high energy-density cathode, are very attractive power
sources. Primary batteries, such as Li/SOC1 or Li/SO , have the highest energy
density, but they suffer from serious safety hazards and high cost. Any leak in
the can of such batteries releases a highly-corrosive acidic vapor. Secondary
batteries with organic electrolytes, such as Li/TiS and Li/MoS , offer a
rechargeable system, but at significantly reduced specific energy density
Ä±65-120 W-hr/kg or 35 to 65 A-hr/kg, respectively!. Other primary systems
(Li/MnO or Li/CF ) offer higher safety and lower cost but at reduced power
density. The new Ca/electrolyte/TAA-C system to be demonstrated technically
feasible by Tracer under the proposed Phase I program offers a combination of
characteristics of these battery types: high energy/power density with a high
level of safety and low cost. This new class of batteries consists of cells with
calcium anodes, TAA-catalyzed carbon cathodes and organic electrolytes: the
innovative approach of the proposed program lies in the proper choice of the
cathode catalyst and electrolyte components. Tracer plans to develop a
catholyte/cathode system which provides a cell with energy/power density
sufficient to be a commercially viable power source. The research plan is well
thought out and the personnel is very capable. Phase I funding is recommended.
