The focus of this research is the synthesis of acyclic compounds containing
several asymmetric centers. The methodology to be developed rests on the use of
thermodynamic equilibration processes to set the centers in place. The viability
of the approach has been shown with a 1,7-dioxaspiroı5.5!undecane-4,10-dione
template that has been equilibrated to single diastereomers in which 5
asymmetric centers have been established. The specific goals of the project are
to extend the preliminary results to more highly substituted templates, to
manipulate the equilibrated 1,7-dioxaspiroı5.5!undecane-4,10-diones to open
chain forms and to study entirely diferent templates. %%% With this new award,
the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kim F. Albizati
of the Department of Chemsitry at Wayne State University. Dr. Albizati will
focus his work on developing thermodynamic equilibration processes as general
methodology for the establishment of several asymmetric centers in a single
transformation, thus promulgating a new strategy for the synthesis of acyclic
organic compounds.
