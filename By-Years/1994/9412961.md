The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) has three biological field stations
in Costa Rica that are used by a broad spectrum of the international scientific
community. Both La Selva (wet lowland rainforest) and Las Cruces (wet mid-
elevation site) are developed and well along the way to achieving their
respective training and research potential. Palo Verde (seasonally dry
lowlands), on the other hand, is a diamond in the rough with primitive
facilities that have been stressed beyond capabilities to service the demand.
This project is designed to meet the need for improved facilities that can
accommodate the many researchers who wish to investigate dry forest ecosystems
and their derivative landscapes, with direct implications for the management of
the vast zone centered on the Tempisque Conservation Area and Moracia irrigation
project will expand and remodel the station to: (1) ameliorate overcrowding and
accommodate a broader range of research projects; and (2) provide access to
communications, databases, and utilities to support long term research. Palo
Verde was originally singled out in 1969 for use in comparative ecosystem
studies because of the stark contrast between its seasonally dry forest and the
tropical wet forest of La Selva that is at the same latitude but has more than
twice the rainfall. The site is appreciated as much now for the diverse mosaic
of forests and wetlands in pristine, disturbed and regenerating states that
interface with farms and fisheries. With the extension of the long-term
agreement with the Costa Rican Park Service and the recent inauguration of a
Ph.D.-level station director position, and a husband and wife team in place, OTS
is now ready to move Palo Verde into the mainstream of international tropical
science. In addition, the project will include support for the establishment of
full Internet connectivity in a configuration appropriate to conditions in Costa
Rica.
