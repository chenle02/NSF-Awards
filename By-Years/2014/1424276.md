The USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST) is a leading forum
for innovative research in storage systems, bringing together researchers and
practitioners from both industry and academia to reveal and discuss leading
topics germane to file and storage systems. This award provides funding to
assist approximately 20 US-based graduate students to attend the 12th USENIX
Symposium. Participation in leading conferences is an extremely important part
of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with
more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work. This award will
fund participation of those students who would otherwise be unable to attend
FAST, with a particular emphasis and intent of supporting women and other
underrepresented minorities.
