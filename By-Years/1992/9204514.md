Scaling equations form a class of functional equations arising in a wide
variety of applications including wavelets, sub-division schemes for computer
generation of curves and surfaces and iterated function systems, the fundamental
tools of fractal geometry. This project continues mathematical research on the
representation of solutions to scaling equations (scaling functions) in terms of
infinite matrix product expansions. At the present time, the convergence of the
product is dependent on a contractivity assumption. The terms of the infinite
product are chosen from a finite set of matrices and combined in a certain
deterministic manner. That all possible finite products appear lead to
investigations into bounded semi-groups of matrices. Work will be done
investigating weaker assumptions involving bounded semi-groups and establishing
weaker contractivity conditions on the corresponding products in terms of the
Lyapunov exponent. A second goal of this project is that of using infinite
matrix product expansions to establish iterated function system algorithms for
the construction of scaling functions and to analyze their regularity and
dimensionality. The work will concentrate primarily in the multi-dimensional
setting where the most important applications lie. At the heart of wavelet
theory is the simultaneous local decomposition of functions in space and
frequency. Applications of this goal abound in mathematical analysis, signal
processing, statistics and data compression. In combining the underlying
principles with that of iterated function systems, this work leads naturally to
important techniques for compression and reconstruction of television and other
communication signals.
