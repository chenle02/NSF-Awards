9529369 Sullivan This proposal seeks to lay a mathematical foundation for the
continuum model of fluid motion in three dimensions. This relates to the
investigator's earlier works on applying smooth manifold techniques to
topological manifolds. The proposed research also deals with the newly
discovered monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten: the proposal aims to
determine exactly what structures the Seiberg-Witten invariants depend on. The
fluid motion dynamics can be described by a system of nonlinear partial
differential equations. There are traditional difficulties with the partial
differential equation approach in that the system often is not smooth enough.
The proposed research aims to introduce topological techniques not requiring any
smoothness to these systems of equations.
