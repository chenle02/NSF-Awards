This project will produce knowledge of how precipitation, snow, and runoff in
the Snake River Basin will be impacted by climate variability and change, while
also expanding the use of cloud computing in water science research. Although
cloud computing is increasingly important in research, the water science
community lacks training materials and case studies to onboard researchers to
effective practices. This project addresses this tension by: (1) developing
cloud computing solutions to three common computing uses in water science, (2)
using those approaches to create datasets that characterize the effects of
climate variability and change on hydrology in the Snake River Basin, and (3)
designing and disseminating educational materials to train water scientists in
the use of cloud computing. This project will produce scientific insights and
datasets to help water managers prepare for climate change in the western US and
prepare the next generation of water scientists in modern computing paradigms.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partnering with colleagues at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the Consortium of Universities for the
Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI), the PI will engage in
professional development that will enable research activities to be performed
exclusively through cloud computing. The open-source Intermediate Complexity
Atmospheric Research (ICAR), Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), and WRF-
Hydro models will be used to create a regional high-resolution climate and
hydrology ensemble in the Snake River Basin. That ensemble will be analyzed to
quantify changes in hydrologic variables through a lens of changes in risks of
extremes like floods and droughts. Data will be shared such that researchers and
practitioners will be able to discover, access, and analyze the data via
CUAHSIâ€™s HydroShare platform. The project will also develop curricular materials
to introduce 8th graders to computational climate science by supporting middle
school science teachers in the Nampa School District with summer research
experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
