This college's Biotechnology Program, launched in 1994, is the only 2-year
degree program in the state of Ohio. Biotechnology prepares majors for
employment in this rapidly expanding leading-edge technology. In addition to
intensive lecture/lab courses, majors are required to conduct a capstone
research project and to participate in the college's nationally recognized co-op
program. Graduates earn an Associate of Applied Science degree that transfers to
4-year degree programs. For nonmajors in the Associate of Science (AS) transfer
program, the Biotechnology sequence fulfills the sophomore-level science
component. The program is advised by a partnership committee of industry and
research laboratory scientists. This project improves undergraduate instruction
by enabling students in all five Biotechnology courses to work extensively with
eukaryotic systems (yeast and insect cells), as well as with the traditional
prokaryotic systems, across the range of biotechnology techniques. In addition,
the project significantly expands student biotechnology lab experience with
growth, maintenance, and storage of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells;
centrifugation; column chromatography (gel filtration, ion-exchange, affinity);
and antibody-antigen interactions (ELISA). The Biotechnology improvements can
annually affect 40 majors, 50 A.S. students, and 250 Health Sciences students
(Microbiology and Immunology courses). The project can also generate SEM
pipeline workshops for 11-12 graders (100/year) and teachers (50/year) and
awareness for 7-12 graders (160/year).
