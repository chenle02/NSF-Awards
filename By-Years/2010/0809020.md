In this research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, new
optical methods will be developed to analyze samples of single-walled carbon
nanotubes. These nanotubes are novel molecular-scale structures with remarkable
electrical, mechanical, and optical properties that will lead to important
future applications. However, the nanotubes are formed in a variety of similar
structural forms that are difficult to distinguish and separate. The results
from this project will make it possible to use relatively simple laboratory
measurements to quickly determine not only which structural forms are contained
in a nanotube sample, but also how much of each form is present and how perfect
or damaged the sample is.&lt;br/&gt; The new analysis methods developed in this
project will have a range of impacts. First, they will be very valuable to basic
scientists who need well-characterized samples to perform their nanotube
research. Second, reliable and standardized characterization will speed the
commercial production and industrial use of carbon nanotubes. Finally, the
project will advance the scientific training of undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral students (including women and underrepresented minorities) by
giving them hands-on research experience vital to their scientific education and
professional development.
