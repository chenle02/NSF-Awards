The lack of success to date in preservation of mammalian organs in a frozen
state is attributable to the disruption of the structural integrity of blood
vessels caused by vasculature expansion during freezing, such that the organ
becomes non- functional. As an organ is being frozen, ice first forms in the
blood vessels, excluding solutes into the yet unfrozen intravascular water from
nearby cells, resulting in the expansion of the vasculature. To modify this
detrimental freezing pattern, a novel method is proposed to freeze in the
presence of special antifreeze glycopeptides from the blood of Antarctic fish.
The glycopeptides entrap excluded solutes within channels in the ice structures,
and thus reduce or prevent efflux of intracellular water. Freezing experiments
will be done on a directional solidification stage, and tissue histology will be
examined using a low termperature scanning electron microscope. The long term
preservation of whole organs would significantly alter transplant procedures and
increase the availability of vital organs for needy patients. If the proposed
hypothesis is confirmed, the possibility of preserving whole livers by freezing
will be greatly enhanced.
