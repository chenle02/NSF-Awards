9730139 Zucker SRI International is developing a set of problem-solving modules
for students in grades 6, 7, and 8. The modules will be distributed via CD-ROMs,
will have Internet connections, and will use multimedia, including video
segments, to present real-world problems tied to the NCTM Standards. A kit of
computer-based tools, with appropriate "helps", will be included with each CD-
ROM. All problems will be designed so it is appropriate for students to use the
computer-based tools while they work to solve the problems. The materials are to
be aligned and coordinated with Connected Mathematics, Mathematics in Context,
STEM, and other NSF-supported middle school mathematics instructional materials
development projects. A major part of the project is a research component to
identify topics in the cited instructional materials for which a multimedia
environment provides learning opportunities not available in a traditional
format.
