The P.I. has carried out significant research on isotope and trace element
geochemistry of EPR (9o30'N, 13p30'-15oN), MAR(36oN), the Gorda Ridge, President
Jackson Seamounts, & S. Atlantic hot spot tracks. He now wishes to continue this
effort and analyze trace element abundances in basalts from both Pacific and
Atlantic oceans with the objective of characterizing source compositions and
magmatic processes in the two ridge systems that have very different spreading
rates. Additionally, he will analyze zero age and somewhat older basalts from
the EPR area in order to evaluate the processes which cause temporal geochemical
variations in magma evolution along the EPR. An important thrust of the present
project is the determination of the U, Th and Pb abundances of oceanic basalts
from EPR, FAMOUS, and some ocean island areas. The purpose is to characterize
U/Pb and Th/U ratios of mantle plumes vs. the depleted N-MORB reservoir. The
ultimate goal of this project is to quantify geochemical models of mantle
sources (plumes, depleted reservoirs) and the processes which affect crust
formation at mid-oceanic ridges.
