Great progress is being made on understanding exactly how sex steroids act on
the nervous system to yield adaptive behavior and physiology that serves to
promote reproductive success. Dr. Adkins-Regan is performing experiments on
birds which investigates the spinal level neuroendocrine processes. This work
will contribute to our understanding of the role of testosterone metabolites in
androgenic actions on the nervous system. Dr. Adkins-Regan has data that show
that these sex steroids change the dendritic arborizations of motor neurons.
This finding has ramifications for neuronal plasticity in the adult. This work
is important because there is increasing recognition that in addition to
specific reproduction related effects on the nervous system such as the
production of sexual dimorphism, sex hormones may have more general trophic
effects on neural development. Neuroendocrinology is a tremendously fast moving
field, and its study should yield many new findings regarding the physiology of
human behavior.
