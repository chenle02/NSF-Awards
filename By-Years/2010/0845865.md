This project is designing new data structures and efficient algorithms for
scaling modern machine learning techniques to massive datasets, and their
application to recent sky surveys to solve central problems in astronomy. The
long term goal is to scale up all the best machine learning techniques, by
focusing on key computational primitives, and by creating the educational
initiatives to allow future generations to do the same.

In the shorter term, the project is accelerating the singular value
decomposition (SVD), the key computational bottleneck in a number of state-of-
the-art methods in machine learning (and well beyond). In addition to the
classic principal component analysis, we consider the application of our ideas
to kernel ridge regression, graphical model inference, and maximum variance
unfolding, each representing a larger class (kernelized, graphical, and convex
models). Working with leading astrophysicist collaborators, we validate each of
these in a fundamental astronomical data analysis problem: respectively,
estimation of the distances to objects, cross-matching of objects in different
catalogs, and discovery of new types of objects.

The key insight is the use of a new data structure called a cosine tree, which
partitions vectors based on their mutual orthogonality, using analogies of
successful ideas for distance-based geometric problems to enable a new Monte
Carlo sampling technique. Preliminary results demonstrate as much as 20,000
times speedup over exact SVD in moderate-sized problems with user-specifiable
high approximation accuracy.

The broader impact of the work is the transformative ability to utilize the
advanced data analysis techniques to unlock the potential insights across
science, engineering, and business lying within the tera- and peta-scale
datasets of the present and future. Apropos these goals, the project educational
goals are deep integration of real-world data analysis, and cross-disciplinary
thinking into traditional computing programs.
