The seismic behavior of ground-based liquid storage tanks under horizontal and
vertical excitations has received considerable attention in the past two
decades; however, most of these studies dealt only with the behavior of anchored
tanks. Few attempts were made to analyze the complex behavior of unanchored
tanks and models sought were either too simple to capture the basic response of
such structures or too complicated by modeling many features at once. It is
believed that the behavior of the bottom plate is a dominant factor in the
analysis of the overall system. Also, based on past experimental tests, liquid
sloshing has a more pronounced effect on the response of unanchored than
anchored tanks. This research will conduct a comprehensive study to analyze the
seismic response of unanchored tanks. The study consists of both theoretical and
experimental investigations, and is divided to three major phases: 1. Nonlinear
static and dynamic analyses of the response of the bottom plate of the tank
under uplifting forces taking into account its nonlinear contact with the
foundation, its large deformations, its inelastic response, its interaction with
the underlying soil and its behavior under impact; 2. An analysis of the
nonlinear response of the liquid, and an evaluation of the corresponding
hydrodynamic pressures; and 3. An analysis of the coupled response of the shell,
the liquid and the bottom plate under moderate to severe earthquake motions. The
research will provide a comparison between theoretical results and observed
experimental data to assess the accuracy and the reliability of the predicted
response.
