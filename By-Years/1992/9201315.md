The analysis and interpretation of a meridional hydrographic transect of the
Atlantic ocean from Iceland to Georgia Island will be completed. The study's
focusses are (1) the mixing between Labrador Sea Water and Mediterranean
Overflow Water, (2) cross- equatorial deep water exchange in the western basin,
(3) the abyssal circulation of the Brazil and Argentine Basins, (4) a
description of eastward flow of Deep Water from the deep western boundary
current eastward near 21 S, and (5) the circulation of Antarctic Intermediate
Water in the southwestern South Atlantic.
