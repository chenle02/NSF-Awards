The attenuation of 'third sound' in superfluid helium films, 4 to 20 layers
thick, will be studied over the range 30mK to 300mK. In particular, one hopes to
illuminate the role of pinned vortices in the damping and, ultimately, develop
third-sound attenuation as a reliable probe for many new low-temperature
systems.
