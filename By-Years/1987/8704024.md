This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of atomic absorption spectroscopy. The principal investigator will
study desorption of materials from heated surfaces and high temperature surface
reactions by means of atmospheric pressure-temperature programmed desorption and
temperature programmed static secondary ion mass spectrometry. This research
will aid in understanding fundamental aspects of electrothermal atomization on
graphite surfaces used in atomic absortion spectroscopy. This technique is
widely used for the analysis of extremely low levels of metal impurities.
