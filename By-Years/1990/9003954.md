It is widely recognized that fabrics preserved in natural tectonites record a
portion of the strain history and the physical conditions surrounding the
deformation. Full use of fabric data, however, is prevented by the uncertainty
in the relationships that may exist between the fabric, the grain-scale
deformation processes and the rock's mechanical behavior. This project will
develop methods to add capability of making stress- strain measurements to
previously developed techniques using low melting- point analog materials that
are able to follow development of fabrics microscopically. The addition will
facilitate application of synkinematic microscopy methods to problems of deep-
earthquake source mechanisms, growth of minerals during deformation and an
assessment of how much of the microstructure in natural tectonites represents
the microstructure present during deformation.
