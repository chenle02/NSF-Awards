This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks continued support of
investigations of the polar mesosphere, thermosphere, and ionosphere over
Sondrestromfjord through coordinated optical and radar observations. Airglow
emissions are measured by a spectrometer and an interferometer and combined with
observations by the incoherent scatter radar at Sondrestrom to provide
information on the energetics, dynamics, and thermodynamics over the region. The
specific questions to be addressed are: 1. What are the effects of geomagnetic
storms on the E-region's O/N2 (atomic oxygen to molecular nitrogen) ratio and on
thermosphere dynamics and how do these lead to variations in the E-region
composition? 2. What are the effects of intense auroral electric fields and the
subsequent Joule heating on the thermodynamics of the ionosphere? 3. To what
extent are perturbations to planetary and gravity waves observed in the polar
mesosphere associated with stratospheric warming events? The O/N2 abundance
measurements will make contributions to understanding of thermospheric
circulation and its solar and geomagnetic drivers. The investigations focused on
Joule heating will augment information on auroral energy inputs. The planetary
and gravity wave investigation will contribute to a more quantitative
understanding of the energetic coupling between the stratosphere and the
mesosphere/lower thermosphere region. A particular interest is the energy
transport mechanism responsible for the mesopause cooling that precedes
stratospheric warmings by about two days, including the role of planetary and
gravity waves in the stratospheric warming events. The broader impacts of the
project include the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and a
postdoctoral researcher and the generation of an extensive database of optical
and radar data.
