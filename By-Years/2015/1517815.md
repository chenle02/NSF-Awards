The team will use ground-based telescopes to study the vast population of
"satellite" galaxies that live in the suburbs of cities of galaxies called
clusters. We know that satellite galaxies can transform themselves from bluish
systems rife with brilliant, young stars into reddish systems filled with dull,
old stars. But models that attempt explain this remarkable transformation fail
dismally. This means that the modellers need much more guidance about factors
that govern a galaxy's life in the suburbs. The team will provide that important
guidance. The team will also expand existing, successful outreach programs at
their institutions. Areas of emphasis include high school students using the new
data to conduct inquiry-based research, school teachers adding evidence-based
research into their lesson plans, deaf students "smelling" and "touching" data
that have been suitably transformed, and Hispanic students being encouraged to
continue on from college to graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the
project is to examine the physical processes responsible for quenching the star
formation in clusters' satellite galaxies, as distinct from their central
galaxies. Models of central-galaxy quenching agree well with observations. In
contrast, models of satellite-galaxy quenching strongly violate observations,
meaning that such models need better guidance about the processes involved. The
team will provide that guidance by obtaining new spectroscopic data for massive
groups and clusters at redshifts of 1-1.5 and comparing those data to existing
lower-redshift data. These comparisons will be used to analyze the dominant
modes of satellite quenching, how galaxies populate dark-matter halos as a
function of environment, the relative timing of morphological transformation and
star-formation quenching, and the dominant driver of size growth in quenched
galaxies. These results will lead to new, better-informed models of satellite-
galaxy quenching.
