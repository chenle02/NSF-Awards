This award will support an observational survey to detect and characterize a
large sample of white dwarf stars. The goals of the project are to search for
white dwarf stars in the stellar spectra obtained with the Visible Integral-
field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark
Energy Experiment (HETDEX), and to create population statistics to study the
evolution and origin of many types of single and binary white
dwarfs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is expected to have an impact on several fields
of astrophysics, including the production and evolution of white dwarfs and on
the physics of matter at high densities. The project will also involve amateur
astronomers and students from high school through graduate school.
