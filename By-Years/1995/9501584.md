A major focus of this research is to develop a general ``industrial strength''
mixed integer programming (MIP) code with parallel distributed computing
capability --- in particular, a code that allows parallel execution on clusters
of personal computers or various types of workstation platforms. A second focus
of the research is to explore new applications of mixed integer programming to
problems in discriminant analysis. A recently developed MIP model of a problem
in discriminant analysis opens up a new avenue for approaching this important
area of statistics. The polyhedral structure of this class of problems is being
investigated, and efficient strategies to solve real instances are being
developed. In conjunction with the research plan, a concerted effort is being
expended to arouse more interest in mathematical programming (especially integer
programming) and its computational aspects among engineering students. New
courses/seminars on linear algebra, parallel computation and mixed integer
programming are planned. In addition, an effort is being made to establish
interaction with industry, thereby exposing students to important issues in
building and analyzing models for real-world problems and in deriving and
solutions.
