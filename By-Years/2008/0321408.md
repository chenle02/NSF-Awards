This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop
high quality, inexpensive polymer-based (plastic) optical fiber imaging guides
and other new and unique endoscopic devices through the use of innovative
polymer processing techniques. Polymer imaging guides have several distinct
advantages over their glass counterparts, including reduced cost, smaller bend
radius, and increased ruggedness. Additional benefits include the ability to
dope the polymer matrix with molecules that can be used as environmental probes,
scintillating material, or indicators ; the ability to tailor the guide for
highly specific applications, and the ability to impart diverse functionality
into a single imaging guide. The Phase II project is expected to result in a
truly disposable endoscope.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices
and instrumentation. It is expected that the polymer imaging guide developed in
this project will be used as a direct replacement for glass guides in all types
of fiber optic endoscopes currently manufactured. The resulting benefits would
be lower costs, less patient discomfort, higher reliability, earlier detection
of abnormal conditions, and an increase in the number of procedures that could
be performed with endoscopes in an outpatient setting.
