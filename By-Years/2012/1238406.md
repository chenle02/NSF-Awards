This proposal would provide to two local high school students an opportunity to
work in cutting edge research in the summer of 2012 for a period of 9 weeks.
Both students have been identified and have already engaged in volunteer
research at the American Museum of Natural History. The students will pursue
novel research questions on a full time basis and in concert with ongoing summer
research. One research project will involve systematics of the leech family
Haemadipsidae. New species descriptions will be accomplished employing legacy
collections and recent material in a natural history collection. For the second
project, evolutionary relationships and species boundaries within the order
Actiniaria will be evaluated, in particular from those of polar and deep-sea
chemosynthetic environments using nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences.

This activity will provide an excellent research experience for the high school
students. It will also result in a presentation or publication of the research
results.
