9512558 This project will support planning activities pertaining to the
remodeling of research facilities in the building housing the Center for
Environmental Studies, Romberg Tiburon Centers. The Center for Environmental
Studies is a marine laboratory and field station on San Francisco Bay operated
by San Francisco State University. The tasks to be undertaken with the support
are essential precursors to remodeling and expanding laboratory facilities and
enhancing the research capabilities of the Center for Environmental Studies. The
specific tasks are: 1) design a fire suppression system for Building 36; 2)
evaluate the structural limitations and seismic safety of the building; 3)
perform a geotechnical evaluation of slope stability and drainage around the
building; and 4) produce a detailed plan for remodeling a portion of the
building. The research facility is excellent and continues to accumulate an
admirable record of research productivity.
