9521227 Messing This award establishes an Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Particulate Materials (PMC) at the Pennsylvania State
University. The Center's horizontally-integrated generic research program will
benefit a wide range of industries where particle production, dispersion,
handling, fabrication of shaped products from powders are critical processing
and manufacturing operations. The research area addressed by the Center include:
Particulate Formation, Grinding and Classification, Colloidal Dispersions,
Powder Storage, Flow and Handling, Net Shape Forming, and Press and Sinter
Systems. A Powder Characterization Laboratory is being developed to provide
state-of-the-art characterization support for the research program. Eleven
companies involved in a wide range of processing and manufacturing of minerals,
food, fertilizers and pesticides, bulk and specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
ceramics, and high technology advanced materials, etc., are participating in the
Center. An Industry Advisory Board (IAB) consisting of one representative from
each participating company provides guidance to the Center's research program.
An outside Analyst assists the IAB in the evaluation of the Centers research
accomplishments.
