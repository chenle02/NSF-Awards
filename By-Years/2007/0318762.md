Under the direction of Dr. Jane Hill, Ms. Tania Granadillo will collect and
analyze linguistic data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research concerns the
Ehe dialect of Kurripako, an endangered Arawakan language spoken in Venezuela
with approximately 2,000 speakers. Two main methods will be used to collect
data: direct elicitation of words and sentences through interviews with native
speakers, and audio-recording of naturally occurring speech. The texts collected
will be chosen to represent a variety of the social and cultural contexts in
which Ehe is currently being used. On the basis of this material, Granadillo
will describe and analyze the lexical, phonological and grammatical features of
the language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting grammatical descriptions will
be aimed at a scientific audience, including sociolinguists and anthropologists.
But they will be accessible to teachers developing pedagogical materials. The
recordings will constitute a sound archive that will provide a documentary
record of the Ehe language and its use. Copies of both the grammar and the
archive will be left with the Ehe community and are expected to contribute to
plans by community leaders to develop a revised practical orthography of the
dialect, and produce materials to teach their language to future
generations.&lt;br/&gt;
