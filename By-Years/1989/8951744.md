This project has improved the physical chemistry laboratory experience at
Carson-Newman College by introducing four experiments and upgrading a fifth.
There are two unique aspects of this project. First, an equation of state
apparatus (not commercially available until 1988) that acquaints students with
the properties of real gases such as liquefaction and critical temperature and
prepares students for newly-developing applications of super critical fluids.
Second is an innovative experiment that utilizes a high speed clinical osmometer
so that in a single laboratory period students can obtain a large amount of data
illustrating the principles of the Donnan equilibrium and molecular weight
determinations. In addition, bomb and solution calorimetry experiments are
introduced and the conductivity experiment has been upgraded. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
