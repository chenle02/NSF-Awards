Under this award Professor Robert and Barbara Reys, Department of Curriculum and
Instruction, University of Missouri-Columbia, will spend eleven months in Japan
(due to commence in March 1991) based primarily at the Institute of Education,
University of Tsukuba where they will work with Professor Nobuhiko Nohda. They
will also spend considerable time at Joetsu University of Education where they
will work with Professor Shigeo Yoshikawa. The focus of their research will be
on mental computation and computational estimation. Specifically they will 1)
assess the lavel of mentel computation skill s of Japanese students in grades 2,
4, 6, 8, 10; 2) determine the relatives emphasis on estimation and computation;
and 3) identify highly skilled students and examine their thinking strategies.
On the basis of such observations the principal investigators will modify the
existing theoretical framework or generate an alternative which accurately
models Japanese students.
