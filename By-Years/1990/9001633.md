This project is concerned with two problems in quadratic form theory. The first
concerns the existence of composition laws for sums of squares. The second
problem considers the connections between the behavior of quadratic forms over a
field of characteristic different than two and the types of Galois groups which
can arise over that field. This project is related to the classical study of
quadratic forms. One of the early achievements in this field is the discovery by
Gauss that every positive whole number is the sum of four squares. This area is
important not only in pure number theory but in geometry and the mathematics of
relativity.
