The objective of this research is to provide alternative estimates of reaction
rate coefficients using statistical methods to improve model predictions of
atmospheric nitrogen chemistry. This is a demonstration project that will make
direct use of field observations to guide further investment in laboratory
experiments and reveal mechanisms that can lead to modeling biases. The
independent estimates of reaction rates provided by this project will provide an
important constraint on estimating the health and climate impacts of reactive
nitrogen chemistry.

This project aims to improve model simulations of reactive nitrogen by achieving
the following objectives: (1) Apply a previously successful inference modeling
framework to a more recent observational campaign (such as the NSF-supported DC3
campaign) where nitrogen imbalances in 3-D models have been shown; (2) Constrain
rate coefficients and product stoichiometry in climate relevant environments
using likelihood calculations based on reduced model ensembles and observational
datasets; and (3) Replace stochastic physical transport with mechanistic
transport using an ensemble of simulated air parcel trajectories that are
representative of post-convection transport. Together, stochastic modeling,
mechanistic chemistry, and high quality observations will be used to supplement
laboratory studies and identify reactions for subsequent laboratory
investigation.
