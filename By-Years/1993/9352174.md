Acquisition of a multinuclear (1H, 13C, 19F, 31P) Fourier Transform Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer will have a significant impact on the
undergraduate chemistry curricula. Educational opportunities in eight existing
courses will be significantly enhanced, including Instrumental Analysis,
Advanced Instrumental Analysis, Organic Chemistry, Advanced Organic Chemistry,
Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, Biochemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Elements of
Research. This instrument will provide the students with analytical capabilities
to determine both 1D and 2D-NMR spectral data for proton, carbon, fluorine, and
phosphorous. The FT-NMR will significantly enhance laboratory studies for
students in conventional and research courses, with improved data for structural
elucidations, kinetic studies, and characterizations of complexes. The FT-NMR
will also be used for workshops that include instructors and students from both
high schools and two-year colleges.
