This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants,
especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, in the
"Carolina Dynamics Symposium 2012" that will be held during the Spring of 2012
on the campus of Clemson University.

This conference will cover a variety of topics in analysis, e.g., dynamical
systems, mathematical physics, mathematical control theory. The conference
topics are central to analysis and are active and important subjects of current
research. The format of the meeting is such that young people will have ample
opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference
activities.
