The annual Geometry Festival is one of the main conferences in the world in the
area of Geometry - Topology. It has been held since 1985 in rotation at the
University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, Stony Brook University,
Duke University, the University of North Carolina and New York University's
Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. It will be held April 12 - 14, 2013
at the University of Maryland, in April 2014 at Stony Brook University, and in
April 2015 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

The aim of the Geometry Festival is to expose and explain the major recent
accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and
faculty, and to advance discoveries in the field by bringing together present
and future experts in a supportive atmosphere, with special attention to and
financial support for under-represented groups, graduate students, and young
faculty. The URL for the upcoming Geometry Festival at the University of
Maryland is
