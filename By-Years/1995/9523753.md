This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan in the
purchase of an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
photo-induced charge transfer in intercalated lamellar solids, EPR studies of
paramagnetic centers in low-dimensional crystalline lattices, characterization
of the structure and mechanism of Mn catalase, supramolecules and site-
differentiated redox isomers, elucidation of metalloenzyme active site
structural and functional properties of the Mn sites in the photsynthetic oxygen
evolving complex. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an
instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
structure of molecules. It may also be used ot obtain information about the
lifetimes of free radical which are often essential for the initiation of tumor
growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions. f8 Û-ª þ + Ûª▓ ÑOh ª' +'ª▒0 Ý + S
