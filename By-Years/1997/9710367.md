Technological advances in computer architecture and communication technology,
coupled with economic factors, have led to the development of a variety of
parallel computing environments with high message latencies. Examples include
mesh- and hierarchical-ring-based multiprocessors, and networks of workstations.
Many algorithmic techniques that ensured efficient interprocessor communication
(at least with high probability) in the tightly coupled, small- diameter
parallel machines of the past no longer guarantee efficiency in the new
environments. This project is dedicated to developing and analyzing
communication-scheduling algorithms that ensure: (A) efficient parallel
computation in networks of workstations; (B) efficient execution of dynamically
evolving computations in "ring-like" multiprocessors (including chordal rings,
express rings and hierarchical ring networks); efficient orchestration of
variable-length communications on ring-like networks. Both analytical and
experimental methods will be invoked to craft and evaluate algorithms that
achieve these goals. This project has complementary goals: (1) to gain
theoretical understanding of factors that enhance --- and detract from ---
efficiency of interprocessor communication in high-latency parallel
environments, and (2) to develop algorithmic techniques that translate such
understanding into provably efficient communication strategies.
