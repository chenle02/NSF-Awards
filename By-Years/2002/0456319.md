Because of its long association with humans, the honeybee's rich behavioral
repertoire is well-characterized, both in the field and in the laboratory. The
proposed cell and molecular level studies will use naturally occurring changes
in bee behavior and brain structure to address a key question in neuroscience:
How do our experiences alter our brains? When honeybees forage at flowers for
pollen and nectar, the region of their brains involved in learning and memory
becomes larger. The honey bee forms of a family of nuclear hormone receptors
that have structures similar to the steroid hormone receptors of vertebrates
were identified by searching a database of genes known to be expressed in the
bee brain. Several of these receptors were found to be expressed in the nerve
cells that regulate bee learning and memory and that grow as a result of
foraging experience. Because steroid hormones such as estrogens are important
regulators of brain structure in vertebrates, it is hypothesized that the bee
nuclear hormone receptors have a similar function in the bee brain. To
investigate the role of nuclear hormone receptors in experience-induced brain
growth, nerve cells from bees with different amounts of foraging experience will
be placed in culture. The growth of neuronal processes called dendrites in these
cultured cells will be studied under different combinations of hormones and
nuclear receptor expression. The graduate students participating in this
research project will also develop a computer-based workshop for undergraduates
that will use the honeybee genome as a teaching tool for methods of DNA sequence
analysis.
