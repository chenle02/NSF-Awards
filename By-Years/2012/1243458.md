This proposal includes two, back-to-back workshops. The first will focus on the
history of work on the science of learning over the last ten years, including
but not limited to work conducted within the six Science of Learning Centers.
The second will focus on how work on the science of learning might best be
conducted over the next ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first workshop, The
Science of Learning: History, will review what has been achieved scientifically
and in terms of infrastructure and facilities, and what has not been achieved
within the science of learning, dealing with strengths and weaknesses. The
second workshop, The Science of Learning: Prospects, will attend to where the
opportunities are for the future, where the threats lie, and how the science
should best be conducted and nourished in terms of the research opportunities
and the organizational structures to support the research (centers, awards to
individual investigators, synthesis centers, post-doc fellowships,
etc).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to explore general strategies for the
future of the science of learning, and to connect the knowledge to societal
challenges, including educational, technological and workforce challenges.
Discussions from the workshops will help to formulate attainable objectives and
methods of assessment. Reports will be written of both workshops, to be made
available to science of learning research communities and funding communities.
