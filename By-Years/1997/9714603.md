ABSTRACT Proposal Number: CTS-9714603 Principal Investigator: Rempfer This is a
proposal to hold a workshop on POD-Galerkin models for the description of the
dynamics of complex flows. The Workshop will be held at October 13 and 14, 1997
at Cornell University. About two dozen of the leading scientists doing research
in this area will participate. The objective is to determine the state-of-the-
art in this field. Topics will include the issues involved in construction of
POD models, the accuracy of low dimensional models and their possible
application such as control of turbulent flows.
