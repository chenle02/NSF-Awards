This project will continue a longitudinal study of mathematics achievement of
eleventh-grade Chinese, Japanese, and American students who were studied in 1980
and 1984 when they were in the first and fifth grades. Data were collected from
achievement tests in mathematics and reading and from tests of cognitive
ability; from interviews with mothers, children, and teachers about their
beliefs, expectations and practices related to mathematics; and from
observations of the children's classrooms. These data will be used in an attempt
to understand early correlates of later achievement in mathematics. New
information will be collected from the students, and from their mothers, fathers
and teachers about current attitudes and beliefs about mathematics evaluations
of prior experiences with mathematics, prospects for using mathematics in the
future, and other factors relevant to their education in mathematics. It is
expected that data will be obtained from approximately 600 of the 720 first-
graders who were originally studied. To extend the representativeness of the
results, a larger sample of 1500 eleventh-graders will respond to group-
administered tests of achievement and to selected questions from the student
interview. The goal of this research is to increase our understanding of prior
and contemporary influences on achievement in mathematics so that effective
suggestions may be made for the improvement of mathematics education in the
United States.
