96223011 Guralnick This award supports the research of Professor R. Guralnick to
work in many diverse areas of algebra. He will be particularly concerned with
connecting primitive permutation groups to other questions in algebra, geometry
and number theory including problems of polynomials over finite fields. He will
also study questions of how to generate finite simple groups and the eigenvalues
of symmetric matrices over commutative rings. This is research in the subfield
of algebra called group theory. Group theory can be though of as the study of
symmetry in the abstract. As such, it has direct applications to areas of
physics and chemistry. Much of group theory also connects directly to problems
in coding theory and so has a direct bearing on the very practical problem of
error correcting in data transfer.
