This project is designed to acquire a better understanding of the general
principles whereby the brain of an animal learns new things by touch and stores
and recalls them as memories. Changes that occur in the brain of invertebrates
during learning are detectable with the electron microscope. Experiments will be
conducted using fluorescent dyes to determine how the cells in a specific part
of the brain are connected to other parts of the brain that are involved in the
learning process.
