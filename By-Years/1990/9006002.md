The effect of floods on stream invertebrates has been the topic of a number of
studies by stream ecologists. Rapid re- establishment of populations following
extreme floods is common yet we do not understand the mechanisms responsible for
this recovery. This pilot project will begin to test the hypothesis that debris
dams lessen the detrimental effect of floods on stream meiofauna and that the
effect of these mitigating patches (dam) will be greatest for those species with
slowest reproductive rates. Start up funds will be used to begin work to
determine if faunal reproduction is rapid enough to account for recovery of
populations following floods. Additional development time will be invested in
determining if the high abundances of fauna near debris dams are linked to flood
events. This study will begin to provide data on the mechanisms determining
which species of stream invertebrates persist at a given locale over time, and
pave the way for longer project which will experimentally examine the interplay
of dispersal, reproduction and patch dynamics.
