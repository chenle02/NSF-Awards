This project involves the study of discrete groups with specific applications to
analytic number theory. The principal investigator has shown that special values
of derivatives of L-functions are expressible as finite linear combinations of
certain one-cocycles which are generalizations of modular integrals. One goal of
this project is to develop a theory of these one-cocycles which generalizes the
well known theory of modular integrals, and to develop applications of
derivatives of L-functions associated to modular forms. Another goal is to find
sharp bounds for the Shafarevich-Tate group for elliptic curves defined over
function fields. Recently, the principal investigator in conjunction with
Hoffstein and Lieman has shown that there are no Siegel zeros for zeta functions
associated to adjoint square lifts from GL(2) to GL(3). The methods used for
this proof will be pursued to study Siegel zeros on GL(n). A final goal is to
develop new crypto-systems based on zeta functions. This research falls into the
general area of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the
study of the whole numbers, addressing suah questions as those dealing with the
divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of
mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.
However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in
diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and
communication systems.
