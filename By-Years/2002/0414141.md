EPR is known for its ability to determine the detailed electronic structure of
point defects in a wide variety of materials. Decades of investigations have
produced a huge database of defects so that today the technique may also be used
as a general characterization tool. The dual nature of the technique enables its
use for major research investigations as well as for basic education and
training. &lt;br/&gt;Students studying diamond thin films and chemistry students
probing electron transfer reactions in transition metal complexes have used the
instrument to further their studies. Sensitivity is a particularly significant
issue for us because defect densities in electronic materials are generally
below 1 part in 105, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the present system is only
40% of its optimal value. This results in extensive signal averaging and limits
our ability to detect certain centers. The new system will minimize data
acquisition time and allow for lower numbers of defects to be observed. Our
studies utilizing EPR directly affect the semiconductor industry by contributing
a basic understanding of the low concentration of intrinsic defects and
impurities required to produce the high quality material necessary for the high
power, high frequency applications.
