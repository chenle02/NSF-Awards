9602559 Das This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research between
Dr. Ashok Das of the University of Rochester and Dr. Joao Barcelos-Neto of the
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They wish to investigate the following:
the Gelfand-Dikii formulation of the nonlinear sigma models which would clarify
various properties associated with the system; two boson equation to 2+1
dimensions and study the existence of a Miura transformation which would map it
to the Davey-Stewartson equation (They will analyze this through a non-standard
multicomponent KP system.); various properties of dispersionless equations and
their supersymmetric counterparts; and the large order behavior of perturbation
theory at finite temperature. This grant will allow two well-respected
researchers to meet and work together at one of the strongest research
institutions in Brazil. They will include a graduate student from the University
of Rochester to their team, giving a young researcher an international
experience, as well as the benefit of working with two accomplished senior
researchers. ***
