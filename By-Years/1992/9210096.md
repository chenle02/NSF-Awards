A central unresolved question in visual physiology and biochemistry is: How
does light cause the creation of nerve signals in the retina? This process is
called "visual transduction." Nerve signals generated during transduction are
further processed and encoded by higher-order cells in the retina and
ultimately, in the brain. Exciting new developments in genetics, biochemistry,
and electrophysiology have made the Drosophila (fruit fly) visual system a new
model preparation with which to examine visual transduction. This elegantly
simple experimental system promises to yield rapid advances in our understanding
of the physiology and biochemistry of biological signalling. In particular, this
research will offer a new scientific description of crucial intracellular events
in visual transduction, by studying the isolated photoreceptor preparation.
Using light- induced introduction of calcium ions into the intracellular space
of a single photoreceptor will also enable a variety of significant questions to
be answered in this model preparation that will have major significance for
understanding the processes of visual transduction that occur, generally, in
other species.
