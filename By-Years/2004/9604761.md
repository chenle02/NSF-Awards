The objective of this proposal is to fund the purchase of a gel and blot
analysis system for investigators at FSU conducting cellular and molecular
research. Such a system which produces rapid, quantitative analyses of data
produced with molecular probes (radioactive, chemiluminescent, fluorescent, or
chemifluorescent) is absolutely essential to competitive research in these
areas. Four funded investigators comprise the major users group, and an
additional group of seven minor users are included. The focus of research in
these laboratories include a broad variety of cell and molecular questions in
the areas of structural cell biology, developmental neurobiology, gene
regulation and molecular biology in multicellular organisms. These investigators
are currently conducting research requiring such an analysis system and "making
do" with much less accurate and much more time-consuming techniques
(autoradiography with X-ray film and subsequent densitometry). Additionally,
this equipment will be available to 3 new faculty who are in the initial phase
of their research careers as independent investigators, as well as several
faculty with established (but in some cases unfunded) programs. A large number
of undergraduate and graduate students will be the primary beneficiaries of the
use of this equipment.
