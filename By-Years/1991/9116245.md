A field experiment designed study the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) near
the Blake-Bahamas Ridge with an Absolute Velocity Profiler (AVP) will take place
in July 1992. The main objectives of this work are to determine the
characteristics and volume transport of the DWBC and how that current interacts
with topography. Supporting measurements of dissolved oxygen, turbulent kinetic
energy dissipation rates and nutrients will be conducted
