This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah acquire a Raman spectrometer.
The Raman spectrometer will be used in research projects aimed at: 1) Raman
studies of metalloproteins, 2) chemical structure and kinetics at dielectric
solid/liquid interfaces, 4) vibrational studies of complex Ni(III) and Ni(IV)
oxides, 5) vibrational studies of host-guest interactions in organometallic
systems and 6) Raman spectroscopic studies of solid state chain reactions. Raman
spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational transitions in
molecules. The information obtained sometimes complements that obtained from an
infrared study and provides valuable structural information. Fourier-transform
Raman spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful solution to
problems of high background fluorescene or sample photodegradation, as well as
enhanced signal-to-noise quality. Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in
studies of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
