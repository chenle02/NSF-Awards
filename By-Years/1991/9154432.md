The purpose of this project is to conduct the first large- scale national study
of the introduction and use of portfolio assessment in pre-college mathematics
instruction. The goal is to identify principles that can inform continued policy
and program development and that can stimulate new initiatives in assessment,
curriculum, and instruction. Focusing on states, districts, schools, and
teachers as they experiment with portfolio assessment to measure student
learning, the proposed research will examine these efforts and the ways they
affect curriculum and instruction in mathematics. The workplan, which spans 35
months, includes a national survey of activities to introduce portfolio
assessment at state and local levels, a comprehensive review of the research on
alternative assessment practices and materials in mathematics, and related
innovations in curriculum and instruction, intensive case studies of five
promising local programs, and extensive product development and dissemination
strategies, supported by a partnership between Policy Studies Associates and the
Council of Chief State School Officers, will ensure high quality products and
their immediate dissemination through a national network of state and local
practitioners and policy makers.
