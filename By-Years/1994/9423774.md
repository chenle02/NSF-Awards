9423774 Nayfeh An analytical and experimental investigation is conducted in to
the transfer of energy from high-frequency to low- frequency modes in the
responses of multi-degree of-freedom and distributed-parameter dynamic systems
subjected to periodic excitations. Exchanges of energy between widely spaced
modes are generic to certain classes of nonlinear systems and because of
possible dire consequences, e.g., instability or chaotic motions, require a
complete understanding. This research project demonstrates the energy- transfer
phenomenon via relevant experiments; formulation of analytical models to explain
the interactions between widely spaced modes of structures and using them to
determine conditions under which energy can be transferred from high- frequency
to low-frequency modes, as observed in the experiments; and the use of developed
analytical models to identify possible control schemes to suppress these
potentially dangerous transfers of energy.***
