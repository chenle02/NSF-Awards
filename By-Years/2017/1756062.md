The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project brings several
benefits in medical imaging. These include a substantial improvement in
diagnostic image quality and contrast, enhanced soft tissue image resolution, an
image method free from ionizing radiation, and substantial reduction in patient
discomfort. This new medical imaging technology will potentially reduce clinical
costs by decreasing the number of hospitalizations, surgeries and physician
visits. It is envisioned that the technology will potentially capture a
significant part of the imaging contrast agent market and eventually be used to
treat not only cancer-related diseases but also other diseases such as
cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and
nephrological disorders.

This I-Corps project aims to improve early cancer diagnosis by developing
targeted contrast agents for use with a clinical scanner to improve diagnostic
image quality. Small tumors cannot typically be detected using current scanning
methods and cancers are often not diagnosed during this early stage when the
disease can most susceptible to treatment. The engineered contrast agents we
have developed are polymer-based nanoparticles whose external and internal
chemistry and morphology can be tailored according to the patient's need. The
nanoparticles have a hollow core with an inner lining of a semiconducting
polymer that emits a strong imaging signal when used with a multispectral
optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) scanner. This imaging modality, known as
photoacoustics, is a non-invasive imaging method that provides high spatial
resolution and high penetration depth, resulting in a very high-quality image.
The combined MSOT/contrast agent technology enables physicians to get real-time
anatomical, physiological and functional information of the patient's affected
organ.
