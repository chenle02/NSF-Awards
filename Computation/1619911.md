The 4th International Workshop on Fluid-Structure Interaction Problems
(http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/016wfluid/index.php) will be hosted by the
Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS) at National University of Singapore
during 30 May - 3 June 2016. The workshop aims to bring together mathematicians,
computational scientists, and engineers having a common interest in solving
fluid-structure interaction problems. The ultimate goal is to initiate new
research collaborations that improve on existing techniques and generate ideas
for new approaches. Funding from the NSF is sought to support the travel of ten
US participants, including graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty.

This workshop will address many challenging and important computational and
modeling techniques for fluid-structure interaction problems in biological
flows, multiphase flows, material sciences, and manufacturing processes. It will
provide a platform to exchange, promote and generate ideas across a wide range
of research areas in scientific computing and applications. The workshop will
also introduce US researchers to a broad international community, expands and
creates research collaborations with their international peers, and provides
research and career counseling for junior US researchers.
