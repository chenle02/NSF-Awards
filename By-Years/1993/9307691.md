The 37th annual meeting of the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Genetics, is
being held at the Wind River Ranch, Estes Park, Colorado June 5-9, 1993. This
conference is primarily concerned with the biology and molecular biology of
genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic and eukaryotic systems, and
is the major annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area
internationally. One significant feature of these meetings is their
accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel
funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address this problem, funds are
being provided to partially support travel and scholarships to facilitate the
attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students working in various
areas of genetic exchange and related subject areas. %%% This is the major
meeting in the United States where gene exchange is discussed for a wide variety
of microorganisms.
