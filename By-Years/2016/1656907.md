It has long been recognized that tropical climate and variability can be
affected by climate processes in the extratropics. Previous studies on the
extratropical impact on the tropics have remained largely qualitative in nature
and from the fully coupled ocean-atmosphere perspective. As such, the impact of
extratropical climate on tropical climate has remained largely unexplored. The
goal of this project is to investigate the extratropical impact on tropical
climate with the focus on quantifying extratropical influences of tropical
climate and its variability. The project will use a novel modeling approach
called Regional Coupled Data Assimilation (RCDA) approach, which combines
coupled data assimilation with coupled climate dynamics, to assess and
understand the extratropical climate impact on tropical climate for the real
world. In RCDA, observations in the extratropics are assimilated in climate
models while the tropical ocean-atmosphere processes remain fully coupled. This
allows the quantitative assessment and understanding of the extratropical
impacts on both tropical climatology and tropical climate variability, such as
ENSO. The research team will also explore the extratropical impact on the
tropical bias in coupled general circulation models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
funded research represents a systematic study of the extratropical impact on
tropical climate and tropical climate variability that combines coupled data
assimilation with coupled climate dynamics. This work will develop a new
modeling strategy to assess and understand the impact of extratropical climate
variability on tropical climatology and climate variability. This understanding
will help further improve climate models for climate predictions, future climate
projections, and, in turn, their societal impacts. This project will train two
graduate students.
