The project has as its goal the increased placement of mathematics and computer
science graduates in local technology-oriented businesses in Maryland's Lower
Eastern Shore region. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is working
with the Delmarva Education Foundation (DEF) and local STEM enterprises in order
to: o Increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in mathematics
and computer science; o Improve educational opportunities for students in
mathematics and computer science; o Increase retention of students to degree
achievement; o Improve student access and utilization of support programs at
UMES; and o Strengthen partnerships between UMES, local school districts, and
local high-technology industries. UMES is working with DEF to recruit 29 local
students to pursue undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science as
CSEMS scholars at UMES. These students benefit from scholarship support as well
as enhanced academic advising, a framework of academic and other support
services, mentoring from professionals working in local STEM enterprises, and
opportunities to engage in pre-professional work experiences.

The Intellectual Merit of this project is in strong academic programs and close
contact between faculty and students. The Broader Impact is the effect of
enabling the students to enter the local high-technology workforce in the
region. Implementation of the activities holds potential for strengthening the
social, economic, and intellectual fabric of the Lower Shore Community.
