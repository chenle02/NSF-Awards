To reverse the historically poor preparation of many of California's elementary
school teachers in science, and to increase the quality and quantity of science
instruction in the state's elementary classrooms, California State University,
Fullerton (CSUF), in collaboration with five local community colleges, will
develop Contextual Coursework for Elementary Pre-Service Teachers (ConCEPT).
Because most elementary teachers fulfill their science requirements at community
colleges, ConCEPT will target prospective elementary teachers at CSUF and the
community colleges (a pool of 3,500-4,500 students). ConCEPT will draw on
existing exemplary curriculum materials to develop three 3-unit courses,
including laboratory experience, designed to help future K-6 teachers understand
science concepts, acquire science process skills and implement the K-6 National
Science Education Standards. The courses will be cross-disciplinary, with a
contextual approach to science and a hands-on, inquiry-based pedagogy. ConCEPT
courses will be developed collaboratively during the first year and refined and
piloted during the second year. ConCEPT's immediate impact will be to change the
way future elementary teachers at the six participating institutions experience
science. Within a few years, as newly credentialed teachers enter their own
classrooms, ConCEPT will begin to affect the way California's elementary
students learn about science as well. The ConCEPT courses will have application
at any institution where future elementary teachers fulfill their general
education science requirements and after successful field testing, will be
disseminated to institutions throughout the U.S. Beyond the course design,
ConCEPT will establish an innovative model for higher education collaborations
generally and course development specifically, creating a new approach to
articulation between community colleges and four-year institutions. Ultimately,
it will help lay the foundation for general education science courses at
institutions across the country.
