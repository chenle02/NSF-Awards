A central topic in number theory is the study of diophantine equations, that is,
the search for integer solutions to polynomial equations with integer
coefficients. It has proved highly fruitful to view such equations not only from
an algebraic perspective but also from a geometric one; the field of arithmetic
geometry provides a language to do so. Elliptic curves (and the closely related
genus one curves) are a fascinating class of diophantine equations. The proposed
research bears on basic questions of solvability of algebraic equations that
define genus one curves, as well as other arithmetic-geometric aspects of such
equations. The PI plans to organize a collaborative workshop with specialists
from three different areas of number theory that impact the proposed research;
and a lecture series on recent developments in number theory which will expose
faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates to new and exciting mathematics
in this area.

The basic objects of study of the proposed research are genus one curves and
their rational points.The PI will investigate them from three distinct
perspectives: proving, in joint work with A. Wiles, the existence of solvable
points on genus one curves defined over the rationals; analyzing the structure
of local points on supersingular elliptic curves over Z_p extensions; and
studying the arithmetic statistics of the existence of points on quadratic
twists of elliptic curves viewed as genus one curves.
