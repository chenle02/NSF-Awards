Tibetan Plateau Supporting material for the film will include: o Teacher Guide -
36 to 40 pages of hands-on science activities o Family Guide - to help parents

geography o Geography Museum Trunk - a steamer trunk filled with artifacts,
specimens, activities, and resource materials available for rental to school,
museums, and other groups o Greatest Places On-Line - A World Wide Web site with
activities for youth and adults to explore the interrelationships of earth, air,

comparing and sharing observations with others around the world. o Summer
Educator Institutes - where formal and informal educators will receive intensive
training in utilizing all aspects of the project with multiple audiences. o
Accessibility Guide - which outlines programs and options to provide no- or low-
cost viewing for underrepresented audiences. The project will be guided by
Geography for Life: The National Geography Standards and Expectations of
Excellence: Curriculum Standards for Social Science. Dr. Mel Marcus, Professor
of Geography at Arizona State University, will have primary responsibility for
content. He will work closely with an advisory group of geographers, ecologists,
and formal and informal educators. The PI and Executive Producer of the film
