A field oriented geological science curriculum initiative rooted in hands-on,
discovery-based pedagogical methods has been designed to attract first-year
undergraduate students to the sciences. The program includes a six-week pre-
freshman geology/environmental science field course for under-prepared entering
students that stresses field research, laboratory and analytical methods, and
development of quantitative skills. This is followed by a fall semester freshman
seminar, entitled Geology Outdoors. The principal goals of the curriculum
initiative are (1) to attract more minority students into the geosciences at an
earlier stage, (2) to provide them with an innovative and exciting course of
study in a welcoming and nurturing atmosphere, and (3) to encourage all students
to consider careers in the geosciences as viable and attractive options for the
future.
