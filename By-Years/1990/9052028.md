Psychology majors at Fort Lewis College have previously shown little interest in
independent research or pursuing careers in psychological research. This is
believed to be due, in part, to poorly equipped laboratories in two Core courses
required of majors, Foundations of Experimental Psychology and Topics in
Research. There have not been enough pieces of equipment to conduct well-
supervised laboratories, and there have not been computers available for data
collection and analysis. These deficiencies are being corrected by equipping the
laboratory associated with these two courses with Macintosh computers and
appropriate software for running a variety of experiments. Modernizing the
laboratory in this manner enables students to concentrate on acquiring research
concepts, experimental design techniques, statistical and graphical analysis
skills with little of the frustration and time associated with the use of the
previous outdated system. The college will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
