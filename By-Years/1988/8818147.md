The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Scott Denmark, of the
University of Illinois. Prof. Denmark's work involves examining how a reaction
central to organic synthesis and biochemistry, the aldol condensation, can
result in compounds with unique spatial orientations of atoms. The orientation
in space of atoms can have profound effects on both chemical and biological
behavior of molecules, and it is one of the challenges of modern organic
chemists to understand how reactions result in these characteristics. The
program has three objectives: (a) the examination of the factors controlling
stereoselectivity of reactions of allylmetals with aldehydes and acetals, (b)
the clarification of the nature of the intermediates in these reactions, and (c)
the design, synthesis and testing of novel Lewis acids for their potential as
chiral catalysts. The study involves extensive use of specific model compounds
with unique stereochemical centers.
