A novel accelerator target for the production of high yields of 14 MeV neutrons
will be developed. In this target, a new method will be used to inhibit the
replacement of tritium with beam deuterons and thus prevent the evolution of
tritium gas leading to reduced neutron yield. Usable lifetimes in the thousands
of hours range are expected. In Phase II of the proposed research program, a
compact neutron generator utilizing this novel target will be fabricated and
tested.
