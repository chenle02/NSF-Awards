With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Harold Dibble and Alain Turq, in
collaboration with a large international, inter-disciplinary team, will spend
three seasons of excavation at the Middle Paleolithic site of La Ferrassie
(Dordogne, France). The original excavation of La Ferrassie, which took place
around the turn of the 20th century, revealed a number of Neandertal individuals
and other features that suggested both a deliberate arrangement of space within
the site (possibly with symbolic significance) and deliberate burial of the
Neandertal remains. In addition, La Ferrassie is the eponymous site for the
Ferrassie Mousterian, a relatively rare Middle Paleolithic industry.

The renewed excavations at La Ferrassie will provide new and detailed
information on Neandertal ritual and mortuary behavior, an important yet
controversial aspect of Neandertal life that has tremendous significance for the
evolution of human cultural traits in general. Neandertal treatment of the dead
is a topic that has been debated for decades in paleoanthropological research,
but most of the evidence on this subject was recovered before the advent of
modern techniques of excavation and documentation. Because of the rarity of such
finds, having new data is usually due more to chance than it is to an explicit
research design. It is clear, however, that La Ferrassie has the potential to
provide new information on this subject and thus contribute significantly to the
debate. The new excavations will continue to build on the standards of other
recent work concerning the level of precision, accuracy, and completeness of
data recovery in order to avoid the kinds of ambiguity that has plagued earlier
finds of this nature.

This project will explicitly encourage the participation of undergraduate and
underrepresented students from all over the world in the excavation process,
providing important research experiences and training for the next generation of
archaeologists. Plans are also developed to provide informal public education
through the web and film documentary.
