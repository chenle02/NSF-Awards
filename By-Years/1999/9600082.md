This award provides support Rotafest, a conference in honor of the 64th birthday
of Gian-Carlo Rota. The conference will be held at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on April 17--20, 1996. The subject of the talks is not being
restricted other than that they be connected to the work of Professor Rota. It
is expected that most of the talks will be in combinatorics or algebraic
combinatorics. The main object of the conference is to provide a perspective on
the multitude of work that has taken place in these areas in the past thirty
years and to provide impetus for further work. Combinatorics attempts to find
efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.
The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern
communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those
occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science
deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial
research. In addition, the type of enumerative information being sought in this
project has been of use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in
robotics and motion planning.
