The interaction of foundation materials with the foundation or structure under
earthquake loading can significantly alter the dynamic response of the
structure. Pile foundations are widely used deep foundations and can exhibit
significant soil-structure interaction effects. This research project will
consider and implement the option of an arbitrary seismic excitation into a
computer program for the analysis of pile-supported embedded structures. The
program will then be used to study the seismic response of the foundation system
to non-vertically incidenting body waves and to spatially incoherent seismic
environments. The results of this research project can be used by researchers
and practitioners in the design of pile foundation systems for structures.
