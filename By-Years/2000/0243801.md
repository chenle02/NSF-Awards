0243801 Toutanji&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds a three-year Research
Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Alabama Huntsville
(UAH) that will provide students with a research experience in the area of
advanced composite materials and systems. Student participants, ten each year,
will be engaged in educational and research activities over a period of ten
weeks during the summer. Each student will be assigned to a clearly defined
project that is related to current research efforts at the university. The
students will not only participate in scientific research but will also learn
how to integrate their work into larger projects. Students will be recruited
from the following groups: UAH programs, minority-serving institutions, and
four-year schools that do not have large research programs. This REU Site is
supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
Program.&lt;br/&gt;
