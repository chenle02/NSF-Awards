Abstract 9512979 Joseph The aim of this planning grant is to identify genes
which are uniquely expressed in response to agents which activate the
sphingomyelin pathway. The sphingomyelin is degraded to ceramide which then
activates a protein kinase that is involved in the immune response, inflammation
and apoptosis. In this proposal the technique of differential display reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction will be used to isolate the genes that
are induced or altered in response to treatment with ceramide. These genes will
then be amplified, cloned and identified. This research will attempt to identify
the genes expressed in response to the activation of the sphingomyelin pathway,
which in turn will permit further studies on the role of this path. ***
