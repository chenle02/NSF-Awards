The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop and
demonstrate a fundamental, new distributed sensing capability that combine
intelligent nodes with articulated electromagnetic communication systems,
articulated sensors, and articulated energy collection devices. This program
directly addresses primary, long-standing problems in distributed wireless
sensors with a comprehensive, new approach.

Distributed, networked, wireless sensor systems are being developed and deployed
for diverse applications ranging from physical security to environmental
monitoring. In the past, conventional systems have been deployed in a static
fashion with their critical components (communication, sensing, and energy
collection) being fixed to the sensor node package. This limits the antenna
structure choices and sensor systems to only general purpose, fixed systems that
may operate at far from an optimal configuration with severe limitations on
antenna gain and link energy requirements as well as sensor event detection and
identification capability.

The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop the
principles for a direct solution to these system limitations through a
convergence of actuator principles, energy-aware articulated networking,
articulated distributed sensing, and distributed computing fundamentals. This
will be based on distributed sensor node systems in an open, shared testbed that
include nodes carrying articulated antenna structures (for optimized, high gain
communication), articulated sensors (for optimized and cooperative event
detection), and articulated solar energy collection (for extending operating
life.) The combination of these capabilities promises to impact nearly all the
system characteristics from deployment through detection capability.
