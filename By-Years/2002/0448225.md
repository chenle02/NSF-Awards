The recent years have seen unprecedented deployments of high-speed transport
networking technologies, particularly based on advanced, next-generation
synchronous optical networks (SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing. While
related carrier provisioning methods for these specific technologies have been
well-studied, the emergence of more expansive applications-grid computing,
storage networking, virtual private networks-is driving the need for dynamic
service provisioning across multiple network domains and granularity layers.
This CAREER proposal focuses on research in the area of heterogeneous, high-
performance, high-bandwidth, multi-domain networks comprising hundreds of nodes
and fielding dynamic connection demands, refereed to as "Bandwidth-on-Demand"
Services. The key efforts include scalable inter-domain routing, path selection
and traffic grooming, service survivability, and high-performance network
infrastructure expansion. Overall, this project is expected to yield fundamental
insights into the operation of large-scale, distributed, multi-domain, circuit-
switched infrastructures. As such, it will help accelerating the development of
robust next-generation cyber-infrastructure, thereby facilitating the emergence
of a wide range of new services and applications.
