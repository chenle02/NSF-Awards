The PI is studying a class of geometric objects called symplectic manifolds,
which are related to classical mechanics, modern physics and string theory, as
well are pure mathematics and topology. In the past decades there has been a
large trend toward studying symplectic manifolds using a tool called Fukaya
categories, which measures the geometry and packages the information into
algebraic data which can be quantified and understood more readily than the
geometry itself. This project aims to study the extent to which the Fukaya
category is complete as a measurement, or loses information. The research will
focus on a particularly well-understood case, that of flexible manifolds. The
tools the PI proposes for studying this question come from a number of recent
discoveries in the field. Results from this project will be particularly useful
for bridging the gaps in our our understanding between the geometry of
symplectic manifolds, and their Fukaya categories.

Some of the tools the PI intends to use come from constructable sheaf theory,
partially wrapped Fukaya categories, arboreal singularities, and loose
Legendrians. A naive conjecture is that, if the wrapped Fukaya category of a
Weinstein manifold is trivial, then the manifold is flexible. Though this is
known to be false (due to the existence of subflexible manifolds), related
statements are known to be true by strengthening the hypotheses. A major bridge
the PI proposes is the use of arboreal singularities, where flexibility is
comparatively easy to detect. Additionally arboreal singularities have the
advantage that the Fukaya category can be expressed with finite combinatorial
methods, here using isomorphisms between Floer homology and microlocal sheaf
theory. Various special cases, such as the case of contractible 6-manifolds,
would yield strong results and are potentially easier to approach.
