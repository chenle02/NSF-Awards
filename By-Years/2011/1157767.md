Intellectual merit: From the explosion of sequencing data over the last decade
it is apparent that we have a significant number of genes in common with animals
as similar as apes and as strikingly different as worms and flies. How these
genes are regulated, and when and where they are turned off and on, play a
critical role in proper animal development, response to environmental stress and
fluctuation, and are part of what makes animals with such similar genes so
mesmerizingly different. Proteins called transcription factors regulate genes by
helping turn them on or off. Intriguingly, the same protein can turn a single
gene on in one tissue and off in another. Despite decades of research on gene
regulation we still do not have a strong understanding of how these proteins can
exhibit such diverse, tissue-specific activity. This project will harness a
simpler animal, the worm C. elegans, to explore this biology. The worm is only 1
mm long, consisting of 959 cells, and goes from egg to adult in three days, yet
has a vast number of genes and transcription factors in common with humans. By
studying how a single transcription factor works in three different tissues, in
particular studying the influence of two regulatory factors, insight will be
gained into how tissue-specific gene regulation works.

Broader impacts: This project will establish and sustain a collaboration with
an outstanding woman scientist from eastern Europe, Dr. Masako Asahina, and to
train students from underrepresented minorities who are part of a special
undergraduate research program. Professor Yamamoto shall also use his findings
from this proposed research to broaden and enrich his teaching in a UCSF
graduate course on Biological Regulatory Mechanisms, and in turn, will use the
scope of that course and input from its students to inform our research.
Finally, Professor Yamamoto will use these research and educational
opportunities and outcomes as specific examples to enliven and empower his
science and public policy efforts, and public communication and outreach
activities at the federal level.
