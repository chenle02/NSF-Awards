This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University of Rochester will
focus on the application of a breakthrough membrane technology called porous
nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si) to microscale preparative and analytical
systems. In the first phase, the team will work to include the pnc-Si membranes
in an existing device for portable pathogen detection. In this device the
membranes will be used as a microfilter preventing aggregates from reaching
detectors where they can cause false positive signals. In the second phase, the
team will use the pnc-Si platform to miniaturize each step in the Integrated
Nanotechnologies (INT) process to perform all reaction and detection steps on a
single lab-on-a-chip device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
research are many. The project is expected to decrease the time-to-market for
the INT device, addressing a long-standing need of the U.S. military for remote
pathogen detection from small blood samples. The miniaturized device is expected
to significantly reduce costs of this device and expand its penetration into
nondefense markets. More broadly, the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) will
focus on the use of pnc-Si as a platform technology for pumping and separation
in lab-on-a-chip devices. This is expected to have an impact on diverse
industries, from biotechnology to the food industry, where lab-on-a-chip
solutions are sought to reduce the cost of complex processes. Increased demand
for products from the KEP's industrial partners is expected to spur economic
growth in the Rochester area. The project will also involve students in the
University of Rochester's new Technical Entrepreneurship and Management program
who will develop business plans, conduct market research, and perform risk
assessment. The project will employ underrepresented minorities through the
University of Rochester's McNair program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners at the
inception of the project are Academic: the lead academic institution, the
University of Rochester (Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Simon School of
Business; Center for Entrepreneurship) and an academic partner, Rochester
Institute of Technology (Departments of Electrical Engineering and Biomedical
Engineering); and Small businesses: SiMPore Inc. (West Henrietta, NY), and
Integrated Nanotechnologies (Henrietta, NY). SiMPore is the exclusive
manufacturer of pnc-Si, an ultrathin nanoporous membrane developed at UR. The
devices developed will be based on INT's proprietary process for fully
automated, portable pathogen detection. Both small companies are based in the
greater Rochester area. RIT faculty will provide the KEP with expertise in
miniaturization, electrokinetic flows and LOC devices.
