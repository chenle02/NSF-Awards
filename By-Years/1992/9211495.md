Kim This research focuses on digital filtering in a Block Transform Domain
(BTD). Such an approach can offer performance improvements close to the data
compression ratio without significantly increasing the system cost. This is
because when the number of bits used in the signal representation is reduced,
the errors due to finite precision computations can be reduced through proper
bit allocations within the transform coefficient representations and filtering
computations and by eliminating intermediate steps such as an inverse block
transform. Mathematical descriptions and properties of the BTD filters are being
examined. Minimum roundoff filter design are also being investigated for state-
space and lattice as well as FIR structures in the block transform domain. In
order to implement the resulting nonuniform precision computations, a Block
Parallel, Bit-Serial (BPBS) approach is proposed. The resulting structure is
regular and permits faster computation by taking advantage of the compressed
signal representation.
