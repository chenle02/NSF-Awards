This research project investigates multi-resolution pyramid decompositions for
images, generated by wavelet-type kernels, which are compatible with human
visual system processing and which provide efficient image coding. The
generating kernels and their bases are analyzed for their truncation, entropy
reduction, and rate-distortion theoretic properties relevant to the best visual
result for a given bit rate. Both still and moving (video) images are treated.
