9504835 Haas This is an award to support research the objective of which is to
determine the efficacy of and optimal conditions for the use of a process known
as electroporation as a direct inactivating agent or as a promoter of
inactivation for microbial contaminants of water. The electroporation process as
applied to inactivation of microorganisms suspended in a fluid involves
subjecting the suspension to brief high-density voltage pulses produced by the
decaying discharges from a resistance-capacitance electrical circuit. The
investigator plans on conducting this research on a laboratory scale using cysts
of Giardia muris and oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The investigator plans
on studying the effects of electroporation alone and as a potential promoter of
inactivation in the presence of other disinfectants such as ozone,
monochloramine and free chlorine. Results of this research are expected to
identify conditions under which electroporation can be used alone as a process
for disinfection of water that has been contaminated by organisms exemplified by
those to be studied in this project. Positive results in that respect would
provide the basis for the potential use of this process in environmental
engineering practice with special emphasis on disinfection of drinking water. In
addition, results are expected to provide insights into the structure and
physiological properties of cysts and oocysts of potential use in basic
microbiological or medical research.
