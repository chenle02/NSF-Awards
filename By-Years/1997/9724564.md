Acquisition of operational weather satellite information at high spatial and
temporal scales can be an expensive and time consuming process. While there are
many sources of satellite data available over the Internet, most of these data
have been converted into a format that is easily transferred and displayed as a
picture and are, therefore, not suitable for detailed, quantitative scientific
investigation. With support from the Major Research Instrumentation Program
(MRI), the Principal Investigators will purchase satellite receiving ground
stations and associated processing equipment that will allow them to acquire
data from both the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and
the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The Principal
Investigators will employ this satellite data to study diverse research topics
covering both mesoscale weather and climate investigations. Examples of specific
topics include: - performing observational case studies as a means to classify
and document cloud-top characteristics of mesoscale convective systems,
including tornadic squall lines; - understanding the relationship between cloud-
top temperature and lightning characteristics of clouds, and potential
microphysical interactions (and effects on lightning) among adjacent storms; -
incorporating GOES satellite IR and visible data into mesoscale prediction
models to produce more accurate surface temperature and moisture fluxes and,
hence, improve model skill; - improving regional-scale air pollution models by
assimilating satellite information into photochemical modeling systems, mapping
sea ice and clouds over polar regions; - understanding the vegetation
characteristics of various ecosystems; - detecting and understanding the impact
of jet contrails on regional climate. Additionally, this satellite information
will be used as an integral part of courses in which graduate students are not
only trained how to utilize this information, but are also challenged t o
develop new and improved approaches to meteorological problems.
