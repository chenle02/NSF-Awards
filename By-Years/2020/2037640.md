The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the
development of a novel technology to slow the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
(AD). AD is a common and devastating disease that currently affects 1 in 3
seniors within the United States and will cost the nation over $1 trillion per
year by 2050. The pathology of the disease has remained elusive through decades
of study, and the field is awash in failed drug and device trials. The proposed
technology helps reduce the impact of the disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
I-Corps project explores translation of an implantable technology that targets a
AD pathway adjacent to the disease pathology. It focuses on treatment reduction
rather than curative outcomes. Initial outcome metrics will focus on biomarkers
specific to the mechanism of the device and the longevity of effect. Clinical
outcomes will center on a battery of cognitive testing, including MOCA and MMSE
scores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
