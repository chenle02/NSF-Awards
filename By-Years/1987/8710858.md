Computational geometry has arisen as an extremely important field of
theoretical computer science and is finding applications in many other fields,
such as robotics, computer-aided design, mechanics, computer graphics,
operations research, and VLSI design. While the field of computational geometry
is still young, many recent breakthroughs have resulted in a flurry of activity,
particularly in applications to robotics. This project is designed to identify
important areas of robotics to which techniques of computational geometry may be
applied. It will initially focus on the design and analysis of geometric
algorithms for robotics, particularly those problems related to motion planning
and shortest path planning. The research builds on an existing body of work in
shortest path algorithms for motion in the plane in the presence of obstacles
and "weighted regions." Further research should improve the bounds on the
computational complexity of a variety of fundamental problems. A better
understanding of basic geometric algorithms will lead to efficient and effective
heuristics for solving important problems in robotics.
