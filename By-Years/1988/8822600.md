The second Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP II) is designed to retrieve and
interpret on ice core from the ice sheet in central Greenland. This award
supports the investigation of the composition of the central Greenland ice sheet
at Summitt in order to obtain a historical record of recent and ancient
precipitation chemistry. The primary focus of this work is on methanesulfonic
acid (MSA), an atmospheric oxidation product of dimethylsulfide. In conjunction
with measurements of non-seasalt sulfate and sodium, the MSA data will allow
assessment of the variability in the biogenic sulfur signal, and to
differentiate between the oceanic source and sulfur from volcanogenic and
anthropogenic emissions. The MSA record will be examined 1) in detail over the
last thousand years to assess anthropogenic impact to the sulfur cycle, and 2)
over longer time scales in order to assess the relationship between the biogenic
sulfur source and major climatic and atmospheric chemistry changes during
glacial/interglaical cycles.
