This project is annually awarding 29 scholarships to fulltime students majoring
in computer science, engineering or mathematics. Recipients are academically-
talented U. S. citizens or nationals, refugee aliens or permanent residents with
financial need as established by application of the U. S. Dept. of Education
guidelines. The focus is on students entering their junior year and those
maintaining a 3.0/4.0 GPA are eligible to have the scholarship continued through
the senior year. Faculty members are serving as mentors and encouraging students
to undertake independent research. Travel funds are available to students whose
research reports are accepted for presentation at professional meetings.
