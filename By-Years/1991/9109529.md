The role of innvervation in slow and fast muscle-motor unit formation will be
studied in the chick embryo. Changes in NCAM and N-cadherin, cell surfaces
molecules, in the process during which secondary myotubes partition off from
primary myotube clusters will be investigated. The functional role of these cell
surface molecules will be studied in ovo in the chick and in cell culture using
blocking antibodies or enzymatic degradation. Finally, the roles of myotube
cluster formation, synapse formation and functional innervation will be
investigated in a series of transplantation studies in which small pieces of
quail neural tube are transplanted into chick. These studies are unique in their
approach in that they correlate molecular changes and cell-cell relationships
with onset of neural function.
