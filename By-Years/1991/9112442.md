The Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
Cincinnati will purchase a Fourier-transform Raman spectrometer which will be
dedicated to support research in engineering. The equipment will be used for
several research projects, including use of surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) for investigating the adsorption of block copolymers onto metal
substrates, the non-destructive determination of the molecular structure of
interphase between polymer systems such as polyimides and anaerobic acrylic
adhesives and metal substrates such as copper and gold, changes that occur in
the molecular structure of the polyimides matrix in graphite/PMR-15 composites
during aging in air at 316>C, waveguiding in polymer films as part of a new
thrust area in advanced photonic materials, studies of the microstructure of
semi-flexible main chain liquid crystalline polymers, and research on
intermediates in chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a technique that is widely
used for the growth of important thin films and coatings on a range of
substrates.
