Thermal transport by forced convection is ubiquitous in residential, commercial,
and industrial settings, for example in the heating and cooling of buildings and
the cooling of power equipment, vehicles, and cloud-computing data centers.
Improved thermal transport technologies are an important part of efforts to
improve overall energy efficiency. Common methods of thermal transport
enhancement involve inserting passive or active obstacles in flows or increasing
the roughness of walls. These methods can enhance mixing of fluid both near and
away from heated surfaces but also increase the power needed to drive the flow,
so the net gain in efficiency is often limited. New ways of manipulating flows
may yield superior heat transfer efficiency. This project will develop a
systematic approach to identify useful flows and the forcing that generates
them. The approach adapts constrained optimization methods for partial
differential equations (PDE) that have been used recently to estimate upper
bounds on rates of heat transfer by natural convection. By modifying the flow
domain geometries, boundary conditions, constraints, and numerical methods, this
project will identify effective flows in new settings relevant to engineering
applications and understand the physical mechanisms underlying their
effectiveness. In addition, this project will provide support and research
training for graduate students and summer research experiences for undergraduate
students, and outreach activities for middle and high school students.

This project will discover improved flows for thermal transport enhancement in
four fundamental areas. It will extend the existing steady 2D method to
efficiently compute optimal unsteady 2D flows in benchmark geometries such as
channel flows and closed and open domains between hot and cold surfaces. It will
also develop computational methods for optimal flows in 3D domains that are
analogous to the 2D domains we have studied and determine the gains from 3D
flows relative to 2D flows in comparable domains. In model heat sink arrays, the
heat transferred by Navier-Stokes flows with oscillatory driving to that for the
optimal steady and unsteady flows will be compared. In addition, this project
will also characterize the optimal flows for ?hot spots,? relevant to processor
cooling, by changing the objective function to an approximation of the maximum
temperature in the domain. Finally, the search for optimal channel flows will be
extended to multiple initial optimal modes in straight channels and to channels
with rough walls.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
