The Principal Investigator (PI) will investigate the detailed dynamics and
structure of plasma sheets associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), by
analyzing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data and hard X-ray (HXR) data from
spacecraft. The PI notes that the physics of current sheets is an important
component in our study of CMEs and the magnetic reconnection process, and that
recent spacecraft data provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance this type
of research and to address key scientific questions. To this end, the PI will
specifically use this data to determine how these plasma sheets form, whether
they are pre-existent or are formed only after the onset of a CME eruption,
whether the plasma sheets seen in EUV and the "post-CME rays" seen in white
light are the same structures, and what role these current sheets play in CME
acceleration and solar flare energy release.

Since magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental processes in laboratory,
space, and astrophysical plasmas, this work will enhance our theoretical
understanding of a phenomenon that is crucial to multiple scientific
disciplines. In the solar physics context, the magnetic energy released by
reconnection events in the solar atmosphere drives space weather and a better of
understanding of this process will improve the nation's space weather forecasts
for the benefit of society. The project will support the professional
development of a young solar physicist, and this research will have an
educational impact through its incorporation into the undergraduate curriculum
in classrooms at NJIT.
