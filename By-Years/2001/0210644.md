This scholarship for service proposal supports three 2-year cohorts of 14
students each, with an estimated distribution of eight undergraduate and
graduate students at Georgia Tech, and six undergraduates at the
three&lt;br/&gt;HBCU institutions, Clark-Atlanta University, Morehouse College,
and Spelman College, which are partners in this proposal. The project is
directed by the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC), an NSA
designated Center of Excellence for Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE).
The GTISC educational program includes a comprehensive curriculum that serves a
broad range of students and covers both technology and policy. Six carefully
considered courses dedicated to IA/IS have been developed and offered in the
past year, and these help provide a basis for IA/IS concentrations at all degree
levels. The faculty at Georgia Tech are working with the faculty at the three
partner institutions to introduce IA/IS courses and topics into their curricula,
to take their students into our advanced classes, and to support prospective
IA/IS scholars at these schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IA/IS educational programs
at Georgia Tech and current and planned efforts at the HBCU institutions offer
us the opportunity to recruit, train and graduate a diverse and well prepared
group of professionals who will be able to help protect the computational and
communication infrastructure of the country.
