The factors that control the production and depletion of supercooled water in
the atmosphere are important to a variety of scientific and practical issues
including the production of precipitation and aircraft icing. Under joint NSF
and FAA sponsorship, the Winter Icing and Storms Project (WISP) will be held in
the winter of 1991 in the front range of Colorado. The primary goals of the WISP
are to improve understanding of processes involved in the production and
depletion of supercooled liquid water content in winter storms and to improve
forecast of aircraft icing in winter storms. The Principal Investigator will
participate in WISP by studying the dynamical and microphysical processes in
mesoscale snowbands. The research will have two primary objectives. First of
all, the storm flow fields derived from Doppler radar will be used as input to a
numerical model to investigate the important microphysical processes in
mesoscale snowbands. Additionally, an advanced radar technique, termed
differential reflectivity measurements, will be used in conjunction with in situ
aircraft measurements in diagnostic studies of the storm's microphysics and to
determine the utility of remote sensing of winter storm microphysical
characteristics including the location of supercooled liquid water.
