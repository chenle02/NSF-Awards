A grant has been awarded to the University of Hawaii - Hawaii Institute of
Marine Biology (HIMB), under the direction of Dr. Jo-Ann Leong to renovate an
existing laboratory building which is no longer suitable for its intended use.
In 1961, a fire destroyed the original laboratory building. NSF provided
emergency funding to construct a simple lab-classroom building in 1963. This is
the building to be renovated. Renovations will include replacement of the roof,
repair of spalling concrete walls, installation of new floors and ceiling, and
replacement of benches and sinks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These laboratory
improvements will provide a comfortable, modern learning environment at the edge
of a coral reef. Students will be able to collect specimens from HIMB's research
reserve, keep them in the holding tanks and wet tables on the seaward lanai, and
bring them into the classroom and keep them in small tanks while they work.
Instructors will be able to collect and display live specimens with ease. The
classroom will be used by the Marine Biology Program for five to six weeks a
year. The balance of the year the wet lab/classroom will be used by HIMB's
Community Education Program and visiting researchers and their students.
