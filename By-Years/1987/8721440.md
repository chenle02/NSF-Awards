The principal investigator is a leading researcher in the area of perturbation
theory and reaction diffusion equations. He has done fundamental work on small
random perturbations of dynamical systems and many of his results continue to be
a corner stone in the current research in the field. The project proposes 20
hard and unsolved problems. The subject matter involves both stochastic
processes and partial differential equations. The major areas of application
arise in engineering and biology. In particular, the investigator will explore
the relationships of partial differential equations with Markov processes.
Random perturbations of infinite dimensional dynamical systems and semiflows
will be studied.
