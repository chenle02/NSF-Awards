Under a Career Advancement Award, ROW, a previously developed micromechanical
theory for flow of granular materials will be extended to describe flows of
interacting fluid-solid mixtures. A corresponding experimental project is to be
carried out by the investigator while on sabbatical leave in Sweden. Two-phase
flows of particles and fluids occur in a broad range of mechanical and chemical
engineering systems, and this research will enhance their more accurate
predictability.
