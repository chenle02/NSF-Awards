Tiger swallowtails use a number of plant species that vary in their chemical
composition. These host species differ in their attractiveness to egg-laying
females and their suitability for caterpillar growth. In addition, genetically
different individuals show dissimilar responses on identical host plants.
Potentially, the differential ability of swallowtails to recognize or grow on
different plant species serves to maintain much of the genetic variation
observed in natural swallowtail populations. Although selection tends to
eliminate certain genotypes on certain hosts, it tends to increase their
frequency on other hosts. The proposed research is designed to assess the
genetic basis for the physiological and behavioral patterns of host plant usage
by the tiger swallowtail. The investigators hypothesize that this subspecies is
comprised of a complex of differentially adapted genotypes and populations.
Experiments will compare the responses of three geographic populations and
families within populations on three different host plants. Complementary
analyses will determine the genetic substructure of these populations.
Information obtained from these laboratory and field studies will elucidate the
role of host diversity in maintaining genetic variability among and within
populations of a single species. Such knowledge will help in understanding how
insects adapt to their food sources and will prove useful in developing pest
management programs for commercially important crop species.
