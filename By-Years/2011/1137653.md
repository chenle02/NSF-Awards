The objective of this Workshop proposal, supported by the Energy, Power and
Adaptive Systems program in ECCS is to increase the participation of faculty
across the nation in three workshops planned to disseminate educational material
and approaches developed at the University of Minnesota through the ONR Grant
"Center for Reforming Undergraduate Education in Electric Energy Systems." This
effort was aided by a previous NSF grant "ONR/NSF-Sponsored Workshop: Reforming
Electric Energy Systems Curriculum." Through these two grants, five faculty
workshops were held and three more are planned to promote curriculum reform in
undergraduate education in Electric Energy Systems.
