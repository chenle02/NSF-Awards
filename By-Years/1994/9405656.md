This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing research of
Professor Vernon Parker at Utah State University. Primary objectives are
experiments designed to determine factors that affect both the reactivity and
thermodynamics of reactions in solution that involve organic radical ions and
organic ions. Through the use of electochemical techniques reactions of radical
cations of substituted alkylanthracenes with nucleophiles will be studied to
determine fundamental thermodynamic parameters associated with steric effects on
radical cations. Experiments are designed that will obtain data for carbon- and
hydrogen-heteroatom bond dissociation energies in solution. Electrochemical
methods will be used to measure accurately the strengths of chemical bonds in
molecules for which experimental data is unavailable. These new results will
allow the scientific community to compute with better accuracy the behavior of
molecules by the use of fundamental thermodynamic equations.
