9615864 Magnusdottir Many aspects of Rossby wave dynamics are still poorly
understood. Under this award, Dr. Magnusdottir will investigate how regions of
Rossby-wave breaking, where potential vorticity is mixed and nonlinear effects
must be taken into account to describe the dynamics, affect the rest of the
atmospheric flow. The study will focus on the upper troposphere in the lower
latitudes and the stratosphere. At issue is whether planetary waves are absorbed
or reflected in the wave-breaking regions. Reflection/absorption behavior is
important for understanding of low-frequency variability and, in the
stratosphere , it is relevant to sudden warming events. The principal
investigator will approach this study by analyzing three dimensional numerical
simulations with a mechanistic model used in previous studies. For the research
involving the troposphere, the investigation will focus on the impact of using a
more realistic depiction of the tropopause and the role of the Hadley cell; for
the stratosphere, the focus will be on the role of diabatic processes. Dr.
Magnusdottir also will experiment with using different basic states for the
numerical simulations and assess the impact. Finally, she will diagnose Rossby
wave activity in a more complex general circulation model. ***
