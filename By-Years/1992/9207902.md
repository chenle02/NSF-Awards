Celestial bodies possess a fraction of their own mass which results from their
internal gravitational binding, and celestial bodies have finite size (rather
than being point- bodies). Such bodies undergo their most revealing motions when
located in the strong gravitational fields close to black holes or other highly
compact bodies. The equations of motion of such bodies when located in the
strong gravity environment will be calculated from first principles, both in
general relativity theory and in alternative theories. Perturbation theory will
be applied to the exact, strong field Schwarzschild environment, rather than
working with the perturbations to the empty space Minkowski environment of the
classic studies of this problem of motion. Direct application of the results of
these calculations can be made to interpreting the results of present-day radio
telescope observations of pulsars, and to near-future efforts to detect and
understand gravity wave signals from the cosmos.
