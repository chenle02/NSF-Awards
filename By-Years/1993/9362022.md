9362022 Murphy The objective of this project is to evaluate a concept for
reducing the pollutants emitted by internal combustion engines during the period
before the engine reaches its optimal operating temperature. In this approach, a
method is proposed for rapidly heating the catalytic converter by bleeding
hydrogen into the exhaust system upstream from the catalytic converter. The
hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using energy from the vehicle's
battery and alternator. This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in
response to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program
Solicitation. The results may potentially be applied to design of internal
combustion exhaust systems to reduce pollutants emitted during start-up to
levels produced when the engine and exhaust system are at their normal operating
temperature.
