This proposal requests support for an exhibition on Native cultures of Alaska
and Siberia for travel to Native and non- Native communities in rural Alaska.
The exhibition consists of 200 small artifacts from Siberian and Alaskan
archeological and ethnographic museum collections, archival photographs, Native
craft and traditional arts, 20th century graphic arts, and videos. Curriculum
packets and educational materials and videos will be prepared for use in the
exhibition venues. These instructional materials, including an exhibit
catalogue, will be designed to serve as "stand-alone" components as well. The
Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center has selected "Crossroads of Continents *RFD
Alaska" as a prototype project that will lead toward establishing standards for
museum-based educational outreach programs for use in native communities in
rural regions where professionally staffed museums usually do not exist. This
goal is especially challenging in Alaska, where distances are great, population
centers are small, and there are unique problems of transportation,
communication, security, and language to be overcome. The project is an ideal
one in that much of the basic research for the exhibition has already been
accomplished. What is needed now is to develop a Native education component and
local initiatives to accompany the core exhibit, and to produce the exhibition
and the exhibition catalogue. Once developed, the experience of this project
will serve to guide future programs not only in Alaska, but also throughout the
Circumpolar North.
