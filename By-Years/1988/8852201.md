The Physics Department will develop a laser atomic molecular spectroscopy
laboratory for undergraduate instruction. The facility will include a pulsed
tuneable dye laser, a boxcar averaging system for time resolved detection, a
tuneable CW laser, a double spectrometer for recording high dispersion spectra,
and provisions for upgrading an existing apparatus as a versatile atomic beams
device. The laboratory will make extensive use of computer interfacing and
control. Activities in the lab will cover a wide range from simple
demonstrations and observations to routine experiments associated with our
advanced courses to student research projects and theses. Typical experiments
include Raman spectroscopy, investigations of the optogalvanic effect, atomic
and molecular life time measurements, non- linear spectroscopy, Doppler free
atomic beam spectroscopy, two-step excitation of Rydberg atoms, and observations
of coherent transient phenomena.
