The long-term goal of this work is to develop and evaluate auditory
representations of multidimensional data. For some forms of data (e.g., time
series) auditory displays may be especially well suited to human perceptual
analysis and possibly much more effective than current visual displays. Auditory
data representation is fundamentally a mapping from a data variable to a
property of a sonic event. Where the variable is multidimensional, the measure
on each dimension of the data sample determines the value of the corresponding
sound property of the event, and the values of all the measures together
determine the overall character of the event. For example, if the event is a
simple tone, one data dimension could be mapped to pitch, another to loudness,
and a third to duration. A variety of auditory displays can be created depending
on the kind of data and the kind of analysis to be conducted. Research in
auditory data representation has been severely hampered by the lack of an
appropriate computing environment. The Principal Investigators are building a
prototype computing environment for research in auditory data representation
and, using this environment, to develop several different auditory data
representations and to conduct preliminary evaluations of these auditory data
representations with both real and synthetic data.
