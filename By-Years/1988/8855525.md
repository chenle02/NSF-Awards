Eight museums in the Greater Boston area have collaborated to help 96
elementary teachers from cooperating school districts improve their overall
science literacy and their ability to transmit such literacy to the children
that they teach. The summer institute and school year followup program has
created a professional partnership between classroom teachers and the diverse
resources of the museums, both staff and collections. Such partnerships
contribute to the development of greater knowledge of the processes and content
of science as well as heighten the excitement and improve attitudes towards
science by both teachers and their students. Key summer activities focus upon
helping teachers understand the commonalities among diverse scientific fields
that make each field "science", and developing understanding of the nature of
inquiry and ways to foster it among children in school and out. Teachers also
have the opportunities to actually "do" science and to broaden their
informational background in an area of science of their choosing, since they
select the museum in which they will study. Throughout the school year a variety
of programs help the teachers with lesson planning, resource consultation, loan
materials, and other support activities. The approach is perceived as a
potential model for expanded collaborations among museums and schools in New
England and elsewhere around the nation. An amount equivalent to 28% of the NSF
request has been cost shared by private foundations, museums and school
districts.//
