This project is introducing students within the three-semester calculus-based
introductory physics course at Southwest Texas State University to the utility
of the computer in the laboratory. With each course the level of sophistication
of computer use by the student increases concurrently with their development of
mathematical expertise as they progress from one level to the next.Each
laboratory station is provided with an IBM PS/2, Model 30 computer. Complete
Pasco Experiment Systems in Mechanics, Wave Motion, Optics and Nuclear Physics
with software and interfaces are used by students in the first and second
semester laboratories. The second and third semester laboratory students use Lab
Windows software development and data analysis tools, Lab-PC I/0 interface
boards, and signal conditioning modules.As one indication of Southwest Texas
State University's commitment to the project, the University is providing a two-
to- one match of NSF funds.
