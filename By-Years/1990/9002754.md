This project focuses on the Loma Prieta earthquake. The Institute for Social
Science Research (ISSR) and the School of Public Health at the University of
California, Los Angeles, with consultative assistance from the southern
California Earthquake Preparedness Project (SCEPP), will collect perishable data
from a representative sample of 375 respondents in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The data will be collected by telephone interview. Using an instrument designed
for the collection of data from Los Angeles following the Whittier Narrows
earthquake of October 1, 1987, the data collected will assess community members'
experiences during and after, and reactions to, the Loma Prieta earthquake of
October 17, 1989. Creation of this unique data set will allow for the comparison
of community members in the two most earthquake-prone urban areas of the United
States.
