The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been described as both the quintessential
American wilderness and a battle zone that pits humans against nature.
Controversial issues range from socio-economic concerns (e.g., rural development
and subdivisions) to basic ecology (e.g., the relationship between elk and
vegetation). The future health of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem depends as
much on human decision-making dynamics as on biophysical processes and
environmental change. The long-term goal of this project is to integrate
biophysical and decision-making models into a framework that allows exploration
of future scenarios that include likely social and environmental stressors. This
incubation project will enable a team-building and data-gathering exercise as
part of the larger effort to couple mass balance and bioenergetics models with
cognitive models that represent the decision making process. An
interdisciplinary research team will be assembled to guide model design, and
stakeholder perspectives will be collected during the project.
