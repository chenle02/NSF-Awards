The investigators will undertake a critical reassessment of
acceptability/truth-value judgment tasks in second language acquisition
research, considering the impact of the problems historically associated with
this methodology on the investigation of interpretive knowledge. The initial
hypothesis will be that the truth-value judgment task is the most suitable one
available for the investigation of most interpretive properties, but the
investigators will also consider complementing this task with other task types.
The results of the methodological investigation will provide the basis for
developing stimuli for a series of experimental studies of second language
acquisition, extending the domain of second language acquisition research to the
syntax-semantics interface. The experimental studies will be designed to test
the extent to which English-speaking classroom learners exhibit knowledge of a
particular syntax-linked interpretive asymmetry of the target language that is
neither directly instantiated in English nor explicitly taught in language
proficiency courses. The target languages will include French, German, and
Swahili.
