Lathrop&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0207789&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks
to better understand the generation mechanism for the Earth's magnetic field.
This geophysics grant funds research in a new device designed to self-generate
magnetic fields at parameters close to the Earth. This new device drives liquid
sodium to flow in a three-meter spherical tank. The tank and the enclosed
propellers rotate independently to drive a sodium flow to stretch and amplify
magnetic fields. The goal is to better understand the saturation mechanism,
which determines the strength of the Earth's field, as well as characterize the
dynamics of a saturated self-generating dynamo state (such as reversals). New
diagnostics are planned to better characterize the fluctuations in the magnetic
field and the fluid velocity, including ultrasound velocimetry, spherical
magnetic field sensors, and a magnetic field imaging array. The effects of
rotation and Lorentz forces on the velocity and magnetic fields are specific
issues these diagnostics will probe. This scientific exploration seeks to shed
light on the dynamics of field self-generation on a wide variety of objects
showing active fields (the Earth, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Io) as well as those
lacking self-generation such as Venus.&lt;br/&gt;-- &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
