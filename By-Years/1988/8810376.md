This research aims to develop a simulation testbed to study performance issues
of distributed algorithms in a comprehensive manner. A number of distributed
algorithms have been designed to solve some of the central problems of
distributed computing like exclusion, synchronization, and deadlock detection.
However, little effort has been devoted to studies that attempt to predict the
performance of these algorithms under different operating conditions. The
research will identify a common set of performance metrics and the primary
factors that affect performance of different algorithms. Based on the above
metrics, the simulation testbed will be used to achieve two objectives: for
given problem (example, synchronization) and operating conditions (example,
fully connected network topology) identify "best" available algorithm; use the
performance results to develop a hypothesis to express the complexity of
distributed algorithms and to quantitatively compare different algorithms for a
given problem. The study will focus on a set of problems, which have been solved
by using different combinations and extensions of known algorithms. Performance
models will be developed using a modular, "building block" approach to exploit
the commonality in the solution of these problems.
