This proposal requests funds to purchase a transmission electron microscope that
would replace a JEM-7A, the only TEM in existence at Northern Arizona
University. The microscope will benefit ten ongoing projects. These projects
include: studies on the cellular biology and ecology of secretion and encystment
in hypotrichous ciliates, quantitative ultrastructural analysis of cereal
embryogenesis, identity, ultrastructure and function of a unique gut symbiont
from a Red Sea Surgeonfish, ultrastructural analysis of cyanelles isolated from
glaucocystis, ultrastructural study of bacterial outer membrane sites and their
relationship to ice nucleation, and quantitative ultastructural analys is of
vascular resistance to aphids. Replacement of an obsolescent machine will enable
the investigators to conduct meritorious research. Support is recommended.
