9504041 Hardwick This proposal concerns the use of parallel computers to help
solve computationally intensive problems in statistical design and analysis. The
designs considered are sequential, meaning that a design parameters can be
altered during the experiment in response to the observations already gathered.
Such designs can offer significant cost benefits, but are insufficiently
utilized due to the complex analyses they require and the fact they are
complicated to conduct. This research attacks these difficulties by considering
procedures that are significantly easier to conduct, yet nearly as optimal. The
computations are still a major hurdle, especially because the problem one needs
to solve require combining sequential designs and computationally intensive
bootstrapping.
