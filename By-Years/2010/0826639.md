0826639&lt;br/&gt;Masanobu Shinozuka&lt;br/&gt;University of California,
Irvine&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this research is to develop a sensor-
based real-time monitoring technology for urban water supply systems. Rapid
detection of damage caused by natural and manmade hazards enables an effective
emergency response minimizing human casualties, property losses, and societal
disruption. Using the network serving the City of Westminster (CW), California
as a testbed, a method for identification of pipe damage will be developed and
field tests for verification will be carried out. The monitoring system consists
primarily of advanced power-efficient wireless sensor networks developed at the
University of California, Irvine (UCI). The following tasks will be performed;
(1) develop a low-cost and power-efficient sensor network suited for water
pipeline applications, and (2) field-test the network at the CW water network by
taking advantage of their scheduled maintenance events such as valve
opening/closure and water discharge (as simulated pipe damage). Success of this
project will be derived from synergistic interdisciplinary effort by PI, M.
Shinozuka, experienced in lifeline earthquake engineering and Co-PI, P. Chou
bringing his developmental expertise on advanced power-efficient wireless
network including DuraNodes and Eco MEMS sensors. The partnership with CW will
play an important role in validating the proposed method in real
world.&lt;br/&gt;
