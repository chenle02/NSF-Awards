Recent advances in computing power have dramatically stimulated the development
of methods in statistics and system optimization. Much of the progress is due to
an increased ability to optimize general multiparameter functions--partly as a
result of increased computing power in general, but more because of algorithmic
advances in optimization techniques. So far there has been only sporadic
informal contact between those who develop new methodology and those who develop
optimization methods. This project will support a formal collaboration of
reseatchers in the departments of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering,
Operations Research, and Statistics. Objectives include the development and
implementation of algorithms in the areas of projection pursuit, global
optimization, multivariate smoothing, and decentralized controller design.
Associated with the methodological development will be research into theoretical
and inferential properties, combined with issues of interpretation and graphic
display.
