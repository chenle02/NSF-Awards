The project for "Improving National acceptance of Computing Intensive
Statistical Techniques (INCIST)" is developing, field testing, and disseminating
materials for teaching computationally intensive techniques for almost all of
the topics in introductory statistics. This project is designed to study the
ways in which these materials enable students to develop a deeper understanding
of statistical concepts. These comprehensive modules are web-based, utilize the
low-cost yet computationally powerful statistical software StatCrunch, contain
interactive multimedia presentations for students, and include extensive
instructor materials. While the materials can serve as a stand-alone course,
they are also modular so that parts can also be integrated into a course which
is taught using a typical introductory statistics textbook. The INCIST resources
are useful for statistics instructors at a large number of institutions
including those teaching at community colleges and smaller liberal arts
colleges. This project also holds workshops to train instructors on using the
modules in their courses.
