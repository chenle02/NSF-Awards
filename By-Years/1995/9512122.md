Molecular techniques have revolutionized many areas of biological oceanography.
Research on topics ranging from genetic biodiversity of viruses and fishes, the
molecular regulation of photosynthetic carbon fixation, and stress responses in
foraminifera is being conducted by investigators at the University of South
Florida's Department of Marine Science. Instrumentation is requested to augment
these ongoing studies and to stimulate new areas of research on the genetics and
molecular biology of marine organisms. The instrumentation requested includes a
Molecular Imaging System for quantitative molecular probing, Fluorescence
Microscopy Imaging Systems for rapid analysis of fluorescently stained or
autofluorescent samples, and a Preparative Ultracentrifuge for a myriad of uses
in cell, micro- and molecular biology. None of the requested instrumentation
currently exists on our campus and its acquisition will greatly improve our
capabilities to understand molecular aspects of life in the oceans.
