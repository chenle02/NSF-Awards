ECS-9707927 Dayawansa It is proposed to study two related aspects of the robust
stabilization of a parameterized family of nonlinear systems. The first aspect
has to do with stabilization of a family when the parameters hover around a
nominal value at which the linear approximation has a nontrivial unstable
uncontrollable part. Such systems are referred to as undergoing C-bifurcation.
Proposed research aims at developing analytical tools to systematically study
dynamical behavior of a control system near a C-bifurcation point. Included
among the sought after tools are ways to extract out a low dimensional subsystem
which contains crucial information, definition of pertinent equivalence
relations and group actions and ways to study them via properties of their
linearization, classification, recognition and normal forms of low CO-
dimensional C-bifurcation, and classification of robust stabilizability
properties of such normal forms. The second aspect has to do with parameterized
families where the parameters are time dependent, but in a way in which only
partial knowledge is available a priori. To simplify matters parameter variation
is assumed to be piecewise constant in time. Feedback control laws are sought to
robustly stabilize the family. Proposed research will be carried out within the
framework of differential geometric methods in nonlinear control theory. Basic
tools will come from singularity theory and global differential topology.
