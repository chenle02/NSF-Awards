This research in mathematical gravitation seeks to make Einstein's equations
more useful for numerical simulations of phenomena that may soon be observed by
gravitational wave detectors. It will focus on the study of formulations of the
Einstein evolution equations that are mathematically rigorous and useful for
large-scale numerical implementation and for systematic analytic approximation.
There are also significant improvements in the initial-value equations, the
canonical action principle, and the Bianchi identities. This work will exploit
the methods of hyperbolic partial differential equations from the mathematical
literature, generalized so as to apply to Einstein's theory. Development of
certain fundamental concepts required for the existence of a rational general-
relativistic statistical thermodynamics will also be studied.
