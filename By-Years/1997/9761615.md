*** 9761615 Bhandari This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop single source,cost-effective lanthanum precursors for the
structural composite industry. Oxide fibers within intermetallic or oxide
matrices are being actively investigated for high temperature applications.
LaPO4 is a coating with excellent potential for both intermetallic and oxide
matrices. Such interface coatings are critical, but their development has
suffered from extremely high per pound costs and coating uniformity issues. The
project will provide lanthanum precursors that address both these issues. Phase
I will demonstrate chemistry, liquid source delivery, atmospheric pressure CVD,
and continuous (multifilament) fiber coating technologies for the deposition of
LaPO4 coatings on aluminum oxide fibers. Coated fibers will be evaluated and
processed into matrix composites. Phase II will address process optimization for
a selected coating, in conjunction with processing by a composite manufacturer.
An economical lanthanum CVD precursor for producing high-quality LaPO4 coatings
on continuous, multifilament fiber tows will enjoy an unfulfilled market niche.
Applications of the research include power generation systems, aircraft engines
and hazardous waste incinerators. ***
