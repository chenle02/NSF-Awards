A comprehensive theoretical investigation of the electronic properties and
growth of thin film diamond is proposed. It will employ electronic structure and
ab-initio molecular dynamics methods to study a) novel growth processes for
diamond thin films and b) doping of diamond. The main focus of the growth part
will be on mechanism leading to Atomic Layer Epitaxy for diamond and the
rate=limiting steps in low pressure CVD growth. The impurities and defect part
will concentrate on n type doping and on the possibility of altering the
thermodynamic balance between diamond and graphite by an addition of a
substantial amount of impurities.
