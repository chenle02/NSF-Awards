The objectives of this project are to experimentally examine the effects of
radiative heat transfer on the coagulation rates of soot particles formed in
hydrocarbon flames. Recent theoretical studies micrometer sized, carbonaceous
soot particles in high-temperature gases, indicated that particles cooler than
the gas can have diffusion and coagulation rates one order of magnitude greater
than those predicted from conventional Brownian dynamics. A net radiative
absorption by the particle, on the other hand, can act to decrease or freeze the
coagulation rate. In the proposed work, the theoretical predictions will be
directly examined through measurement of the size, number density, and
coagulation rate of soot particles. Particle measurements will be performed
using non- intrusive laser light extinction and scattering methods.
Demonstration of a relationship between radiation and soot particle dynamics
would provide valuable insight into the factors affecting combustion particulate
transport and growth, and would have important consequences on the scaling of
particle dynamical models from small to large scale combustion, environments. In
addition, the results will e used for the development of new methods of
particulate control and removal from combustion exhaust gases. //
