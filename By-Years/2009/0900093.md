The objective of this research project is to understand the fundamental
mechanisms affecting the salient features of product quality and process
efficiency in Chemical Mechanical Planarization. A consistent multi-scale and
multi-physics approach is pursued. The Chemical Mechanical Planarization process
is viewed as a confluence or a union of wafer, pad and slurry, aided by the
machine. By the interactions inherent in this process, the wafer, pad, and
slurry each modifies the other two, and is in turn modified by them. This
project develops a multi-scale and multi-physics representation of the
intricacies of 3-way fully coupled pad-wafer-slurry interactions, aided by
quasi-coupled interactions with the machine. A concept mapping technique,
augmented via curvature correction is utilized to ensure consistency in multi-
physics and multi-scale representations. Model development will be aided by
mechanistic experimentations as well as full scale planarization tests. The
validated predictive model will then be utilized to conduct a detailed
parametric study and design space exploration of chemical ? mechanical
interactions in a planarization process.

Once validated, the multi-scale simulation tool will be housed in a website and
can serve as a software testbed for process development. It will not only just
check if a process design choice is expected to meet the specifications, but
will also be able to provide advice for generic rectifications when the process
design choices fail to meet the specifications. This will facilitate development
of effective process design and control. It will capture the basic nano-scale
nuances of planarization processes, and relate them to macro-scale design
considerations. Outreach to neighboring undergraduate institutions and high
schools are planned by introducing Concept Mapping principles utilized in this
project to science education at the undergraduate and high school levels.
