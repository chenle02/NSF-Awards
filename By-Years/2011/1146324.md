An international team of researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington,
the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, Broward College, and 15 other institutions
in 11 countries, will fill in a massive gap in global biodiversity awareness
through a large scale inventory of reptiles (snakes, lizards, crocodiles and
turtles) and amphibians (frogs and caecilians) from the Javan and Sumatran
montane forests of Indonesia. As of today, the biodiversity of these tropical
montane highlands is very poorly known. Previous work hints that these areas may
be some of the most species rich on earth, and may contain vast numbers of
endemic species with restricted ranges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These species
represent the largest number of vertebrate animals yet to be discovered and
described by scientists.The survey will likely discover hundreds of new species
from this poorly known area of the world and will result in educational and
research partnerships between Indonesia and the USA. As a benefit to the
scientific community, the project will produce modern specimen repositories and
web-based resources for identification and conservation management, and for
genetic and biodiversity work.
