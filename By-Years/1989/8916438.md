The PI will investigate hotspots and mid-oceanic ridges to constrain their
underlying physical processes, mainly heat and mass transfer. His investigation
of hotspots has confirmed that these features are produced by mantle plumes. In
particular, the shape of hotspots swells, such as that hear Hawaii, is simply
related to the kinematics of flow from plumes. He has constrained the heat and
mass fluxes of plumes globally. He will now extend this work to learn more about
how plumes work and about the dynamics of heat transfer between the plume and
the lithosphere. Some variations in the mantle temperature beneath ridge axes
may be related to ambient temperature variations at mid-mantle depths, not
plumes. His studies of ridge axes will concentrate on modeling features affected
by temperature variations associated with hotspots, such as central rifts. He
will continue to study temperature variations associated with hydrothermal
circulation with emphasis on the downwelling parts of the circulation nearest to
the ridge axis. He will reprocess multichannel seismic data from the back-arc
Valu Fa ridge near Tonga to constrain the location of the crustal magma chamber,
including one line across an overlapping spreading center.
