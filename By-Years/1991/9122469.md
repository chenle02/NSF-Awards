There are three parts to this study of economic growth and the level of
economic aggregates. The first part focuses on adverse selection and aggregate
employment. Preliminary work by the investigator suggests that market
participation will be inefficient in an economy in which it is costly to
distinguish between low and high quality workers. The project develops a general
theory of market participation based on two different strands of theoretical
research: imperfectly coordinated trading and strategic complementarities in
production. The theory is extended to allow people to improve their jobs over
time, to permit organizations such as firms to play a coordinating role, and to
reflect different sectoral locations within markets. The importance of this
inefficiency will be quantified and measured empirically. The second part
develops a growth theory in which learning is the engine of growth. Information
theory is used to derive the properties of the relationship between learning,
technology and economic growth. The third part explores the idea that a society
well-endowed with general skills will more easily take advantage of new
technologies by learning them faster. Skilled labor will concentrate on new
technologies, a result consistent with arguments in the old-product cycle
literature.
