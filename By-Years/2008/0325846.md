The study of bio-terror threats require a significant improvement in our
capabilities to analyze the human response to an attack, both at the level of
the citizens (mobility, infection, and the feeling of well-being) and at the
level of responders and policy makers (coordination, control, planning, and
policy formulation). This project will address these issues using a geography
based synthetic environment with artificial and human agents. Computational
models of artificial agents' position, mobility, infection-susceptibility and
the state of well-being will be developed. Intuitive interfaces will be provided
to human agents to carry out the complex coordination roles. Together, their
behaviors will be used to analyze how a bio-terror attack may spread through the
population and how its impact might be contained by different intervention
strategies. We will use this platform to conduct new and innovative research.
The results of such exercises will also be used to help develop, test, analyze,
and implement public policies and operating procedures. Once implemented, the
models will be extended to include coordination amongst responders in multiple
jurisdictions and for multiple pathogens. An important aspect of the work is to
develop an agent-based scalable software architecture for tera-scale, grid
computing, and to virtually test the prorotype technology and it's effectiveness
on heterogeneous resource availability environements requiring real-tim
eresponse and heterogeneous platform assemblies comprising of diverse systems,
such as GPS, wireless communications, and enabling decision support during
crisis situations.
