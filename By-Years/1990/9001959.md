Professor Iozzi will conduct research in the application of ergodic theory to
the study of group actions on manifolds or more generally on measure spaces. In
particular she will apply techniques from this area, as well as methods of
representation theory and the theory of algebraic groups, to a variety of
questions involving connected transformation groups and their discrete
subgroups. Examples of such questions are invariance phenomena for geometric
structures and related issues on the compactification of algebraic varieties,
orbit equivalence of actions, and the structural study of the diffeomorphism
group of a manifold. This project involves research in ergodic theory. Ergodic
theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems whose
dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.
Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how groups of
abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way ergodic theory makes
contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on homogeneous spaces.
