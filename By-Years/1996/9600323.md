9600323 Oyama This proposal supports the collaboration of Dr. Ted Oyama of the
Department of Chemical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Dr.
Yasuhiro Iwasawa of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tokyo.
Project funding will enable Dr. Oyama to spend one year in Japan, resident at
the University of Tokyo, in order to study the structure and adsorption
properties of single crystal molybdenum carbide. Dr. Oyama has previously
studied the catalytic properties of molybdenum carbide in the form of supported
and unsupported powders. The collaboration with Prof. Iwasawa will allow
fundamental studies of the system using advanced physico-chemical tools
available in Prof. Iwasawa's laboratory. These include ultra-high vacuum
spectroscopies and scanning tunneling microscopy. This proposal brings toeether
research scientists from two countries working in the area of new materials and
catalysis. The U. S. scientist will have the opportunity to become familiar with
research techniques, equipment, and facilities at the University of Tokyo while
carrying out the research mission. This proposal thus fulfills the objectives of
the Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through an
international collaboration. ***
