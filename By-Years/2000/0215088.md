This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
cost-effective, fast-acting sensor for detecting the presence of nitroaromatic
explosives. It involves a unique chemical detection technology in which
colorimetric changes in an array of dyes constitute a signal much like that
generated by the mammalian olfaction system; each dye is a cross-responsive
sensor. This technology has been dubbed "Smell-Seeing". The program is designed
to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the electronic
nose when used to detect nitroaromatic explosives and to integrate the smell-
seeing technology into an inexpensive, portable monitor for real-time detection
of explosive substances.

This work will result in a hand-held, battery-powered device for preventative
surveillance and early detection of these compounds, thereby reducing risk to
the general public, public servants and military personnel here and around the
world.
