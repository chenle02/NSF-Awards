Trumbo, Craig This doctoral dissertation research applies a `social
amplification of risk` framework to understand cancer concerns held by residents
near the Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University. The laboratory ran a small
research reactor up until 1965. Members of the community around the laboratory
now believe that they are part of a cancer cluster, possibly caused by the
reactor -- a fear that has not been borne out by a recent epidemiological study.
Nonetheless, the concern remains. The CO-PI intends to investigate the
determinants of residents' concern in this instance using data gathered through
interviews and focus groups with community members. Particular attention will be
paid to the relative contributions of psychological, sociological, and cultural
factors in shaping the risk perceptions of residents around the laboratory. This
project will add to scientific understanding of risk perception under field
conditions and provide information that will aid in the efforts of risk
communicators. f8 Û-ª þ ; + + Ûª▓ ÑOh ª' +'ª▒0 + + S u m m a r y I n f o r m a t
