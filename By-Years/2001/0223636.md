Abstract ATM-0223636 Atlas, David Unaffiliated Individual Title: Physics and
Remote Sensing of Convective Storms

This grant supports research on the microphysics and kinematics of tropical
convective storms using archival data from NASA TRMM experiments in Brazil,
Florida, and Kwajalein. The data consist of Doppler spectra measured by UHF
profiler, polarimetric radar data, and supporting airborne and surface-based
meteorological observations. Special attention is given to the relation between
the updraft profile in the cloud and the drop-size distributions that evolve
through different growth processes. Key questions center on the existence and
significance of equilibrium drop-size distributions, established when collision-
induced drop breakup is balanced by drop growth, and the interpretation of the
so-called balance level where the mean Doppler velocity for vertical viewing is
zero. Comparisons will be made between the drop-size distribution measured by
profiler and the polarimetric radar measurements. One goal of the study is to
improve the ability to measure rainfall rate by radar. Another is to advance
precipitation physics by synthesizing the data from a unique combination of
observing instruments.
