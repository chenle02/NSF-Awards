Doctoral student Byron Alexander proposes to study the ancestor-descendant
relationships within the bee genus Nomada, using morphological data from the
literature, museum visits, and from borrowed collections. His advisor, George
Eickwort, is a leading researcher on social insects. Both social and parasitic
behavior have evolved from nest-building ancestors in this genus, and it is
unclear whether 1) the social species are a separate evolutionary branch within
the genus, or 2) social behavior has evolved independently several times. A
well-established evolutionary framework for this group would provide the means
for assessing these alternatives. The evolution of behavior is an important
facet of biology, and behavior of certain insects such as bees can have
important economic implications. The proposed research can have subtantial
impact beyond the small community of specialists working on this taxon.
