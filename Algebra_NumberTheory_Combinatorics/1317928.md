The third annual meeting of the Underrepresented Students in Topology and
Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is to be held at Purdue University on April
19-21, 2013. The project was proposed in 2011 by a group of underrepresented
graduate students in the University of Iowa Mathematics Department. The meeting
is now largely run and organized by underrepresented recent math PhD. Speakers
will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra;
these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot
theory, and representation theory. Two distinguished graduate students will give
an hour long presentation, one on a topological topic and one on an algebraic
topic. Also one invited faculty member, Dr. Jennifer Vasquez of Scranton
University, will give a one hour keynote address. Invited undergraduate
participants will give poster presentations on algebraic and topological
research topics.

USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a
platform for collaboration and professional development. Participants are
exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet
underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or
colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and
minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee
is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-
positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The
participants of the USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students
by serving as much needed mentors and encourage students in the mathematical
sciences at all levels to advance themselves and participate in research and
conference events. The conference website is http://www.ustars.org.
