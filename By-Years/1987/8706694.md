Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) plays a central role in the hopothalamic-
pituitary-thyroid axis. Despite nearly twenty years of work, virtually nothing
is known about the regulation of TRH production. Dr. Goodman and collaborators
propose to use a recently isolated TRH cDNA and TRH-producing cell line to
characterize the factors and mechanisms that underlie TRH biosynthesis. He will
use intact animals to compare TRH-like mRNAs in discrete brain regions and a rat
cell line to identify agents that affect TRH biosynthesis and secretion. He will
also test whether the TRH precursor can generate peptides in addition to TRH
that affect pituitary function. Finally, he will use the TRH-producing cell line
to identify the components of the TRH gene that are important for regulated and
tissue-specific expression. Elucidation of the factors and mechanisms that
control TRH biosynthesis and secretion would greatly increase our understanding
of how the brain regulates endocrine function.
