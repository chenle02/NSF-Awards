This project will be supported by a joint award from the Chemistry Office of
Special Projects and the Cellular Biosciences Cell Biology Program. It is aimed
at the development of structural information on tubulin and exploration of the
relationship between tubulin function and structural features. Particular
emphasis will be placed on the the role of tubulin isoforms in the mechanism of
function and control. Monoclonal antibodies will be used to recognize specifc
tubulins. Separation of electrophoretically distinct tubulins will be
investigated using immuno-affinity chromatography, pH gradient chromatofocusing,
and affinity chromatography. Photoaffinity and chemico-affinity studies will be
directed at ligand binding site localization. Thermodynamic and kinetic features
of ligand-binding sites will be probed with particular emphasis on ligand-
induced conformational changes in tubulin and proteolytic fragments. Protein
sequencing of purified isoforms, proteolytic fragments, and affinity-labeled
fragments will be done by mass spectrometric methods. The information obtained
from these studies will be used to develop a model of tubulin and the
conformational effects induced by assembly and ligand binding.
