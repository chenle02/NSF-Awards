DDIG - DEB-010509&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Effects of Increasing Atmospheric CO2
on Plant Defense Against Pathogens&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When grown under
elevated carbon dioxide, plant leaves typically contain lower concentrations of
nitrogen. Because plant defenses against herbivores and pathogens are nitrogen-
intensive, rising atmospheric CO2 may make it more difficult for plants to mount
an effective defense against pathogens, particularly if they are required to
defend themselves against an herbivore at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;I will expose
turnip grown under current and twice current levels of CO2 to a bacterial
pathogen, and measure levels of both salicylic acid (a signal molecule in
pathogen response) and anti-pathogen proteins. I will also simultaneously expose
a subset of plants to simulated herbivory, and measure levels of protease
inhibitors (a nitrogen-rich anti-herbivore defense). Together, these experiments
will allow me to determine whether there is a trade-off between defense against
pathogens and against herbivores, and whether this trade-off will become more
severe as atmospheric CO2 continues to rise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
