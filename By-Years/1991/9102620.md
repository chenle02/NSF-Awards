This proposal is concerned with the development and analysis of a class of
robust adaptive filtering algorithms which can offer effective performance in an
environment of impulsive and other non- gaussian noise. These filters are termed
Order Statistic Least Mean Square (OSLMS) adaptive filters. A special case of
this class is the Median LMS (MLMS) algorithm, derived from the familiar LMS
algorithm by replacing the instantaneous measurements of the gradient of the
mean square error performance surface, used by the LMS filter, with the sample
median of that quantity.
