Alofs/Abstract The objective of this research is the design of a cloud
chamber/low velocity wind tunnel to simulate thermodynamic conditions in cirrus
clouds. This will be accomplished, in part, through numerical simulations of the
air flow in sample configurations of possible devices designed to eliminate or
suppress undesirable turbulence.
