An area of engineering practice that is not well defined is the seismic
response of sites requiring site-specific evaluation because of problematic soil
conditions. This follows from the limited fundamental understanding of the
behavior of soft soils. Deep deposits of soft soils exist in many urban areas
within the United States (e.g., Boston, Charleston, Memphis, New York, and San
Francisco). U.S. building codes require site-specific evaluations at these
sites, but established guidelines for performing these evaluations are not yet
available. This project will develop the data and analyses needed for such
guidelines.

The project intends to investigate the seismic response of deep soft soil sites
by performing advanced cyclic simple shear and triaxial testing of soft soils to
characterize their dynamic properties and by developing advanced numerical site
response procedures that can be used for performing site-specific evaluations of
these deposits. The project?s data and findings will lead to an improved
fundamental understanding of the cyclic response of soft soils and yield
practical guidelines for addressing the special concerns involved with analyzing
the seismic response of these deposits. Outcomes will include correlations of
dynamic soil properties with available in situ test results and simplified
period-dependent site amplification factors for developing preliminary design
spectra for these sites. Critical lessons will be learned from this study,
because the soils and levels of earthquake shaking investigated in this project
cover a wide range of soft soil sites.
