In response to increasing evidence as to the ineffectiveness of the traditional
introductory physics course at improving students' conceptual understanding of
physics and problem-solving ability, a series of workbooks, SPIRALPhysics, have
been developed and used in place of a standard textbook in the introductory
physics course sequence at Monroe Community College (MCC) for the past several
years. These workbooks, designed for use in an active learning environment,
arrange topics such that students receive repeated exposure to concepts over an
extended time interval, each time with an incremental increase in complexity.
The workbooks make extensive use of alternative problem types, such as ranking
tasks, goal-less problem statements, and critical analysis tasks. This project
proposes the expansion and modification of the workbooks to make them a more
attractive and viable alternative to traditional physics instruction at other
institutions. In addition to the increased flexibility afforded by an expanded
workbook series, support materials, including an instructor guide, student
guide, and textbook, will be developed as part of the project. Revision of the
workbooks and support materials will continue throughout the length of the
project, under the supervision of an advisory committee drawn from both the two-
year college physics community and the physics education research community. The
project also gives special emphasis to community college students in Advanced
Technological Education (ATE) programs to ensure that they are provided learning
opportunities using the spiral notebooks.
