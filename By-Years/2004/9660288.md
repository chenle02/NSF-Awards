*** 9660288 Sun This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
address the feasibility for the development of an intelligent measurement-while-
drilling (MWD) devices for downhole monitoring of bit wear and warning of
impending bit failure, including both bearing failure and worn bit. The
operating principle of the MWD device uses artificial intelligence (AI) based
acoustic emission (AE) technologies. This development will considerably reduce
the cost in the current deep drilling operation and may eventually facilitate
the development of smart drilling systems and unmanned drilling processes. In
the Phase I study, a field drilling experiment will be conducted. AE signals
generated at the bit-rock interface will be monitored in different stages of bit
wear during drilling processes. First, the AE signals will be studied with
regard to frequency bandwidth, amplitude of dynamic range, and duration for
further instrumentation development. The feasibility will then be demonstrated
by (1) development of suitable instrumentation for AE signal monitoring, (2)
observation of recognizable features in AE signals from different stages of bit
wear, and (3) using suitable pattern recognition (AI) algorithm to identify the
degree of bit-wear, formation change and impending bit failure by the AE
features observed. After studies are conducted, it is anticipated that a new
device will be developed using AI-based AE technology. The device will be
capable of sensing the degree of bit wear, formation change and warning of
impending bit failure. The device may significantly reduce the operating cost in
deep ocean and land drilling and has very good commercial potential. The concept
developed in this research may be conveniently used in the "smart drilling
system" and unmanned drilling processes. ***
