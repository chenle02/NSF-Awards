This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to further our
understanding of higher-dimensional shifts of finite type (SFTs) and cellular
automata (CA). Broadly speaking, the goal is to describe their dynamics and
identify types of dynamics that cannot occur in them. In recent work the
principal investigator and others have applied methods from recursion theory and
topological dynamics to describe the complexity of some classical dynamical
invariants associated to SFTs and CA, such as their entropy and directional
dynamics (subdynamics). This project represents a continuation of that
investigation. The principal investigator hopes to extend the classification of
subdynamics to co-rank 1 actions (currently only co-rank 2 and higher are known)
and begin a systematic study of the full dynamics, which are related to more
quantitative measures of complexity drawn from computer science rather than the
qualitative ones of recursion theory. He will also study the relation between
SFTs, CA, and other dynamical systems, specifically addressing which actions on
the Cantor set can be approximated by certain types of
SFTs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on the class of dynamical systems
arising from infinite collections of discrete elements in which only "nearby"
elements interact. Such models are widely used as theoretical models and in
simulation in many areas of science and engineering, such as thermodynamics,
fluid dynamics, the theory of quasi-crystals, information theory, and computer
science, to name just a few. In that context, it is a fundamental problem to
determine which dynamics such systems can represent and what their theoretical
limitations are and to identify subclasses that are more amenable to study and
use. Precise results in this field have come to light recently, and this project
aims to continue research in this direction.
