Proposal Number: NSF-0433540&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Security Through
Interaction Modeling (STIM)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael
Reiter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer misuse is often easier to recognize in
particular instances than it is to specify in general, and is highly sensitive
to experience and context. Nevertheless, few computer security technologies, if
any, adequately utilize models of experience and context in defending against
misuse. This research explores the thesis that many computer defenses can be
dramatically improved, in both efficacy and usability, by modeling experience
and context in a way that allows the models to become an integral element for
defending the system. The interactions that can be modeled and potentially
exploited are ubiquitous---they exist among persons (e.g., different user roles
in access control), among computers and networks (e.g., what computers and
networks typically correspond with what others), and even among attacks (e.g.,
what attacks realize the preconditions of others). Developing security
technologies that better utilize such interactions forms the core of the
research agenda in "security through interaction modeling" (STIM). This effort
promises advances in diverse areas of security technology, such as attack
traffic filtering, more usable authorization systems, and intrusion detection
and response. A central goal of the STIM activity is education and outreach. Its
efforts here include the construction of a security education portal and
cybersecurity curricula for many education levels, ranging from children through
college faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
