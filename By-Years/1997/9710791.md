This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is supported in the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program. During the tenure of this twelve-month standard
grant, Professors Ewing and Day and their students at Pennsylvania State
University will attach single oligonucleotide molecules of poly dT to small
monodispersed beads arranged in arrays on a flat substrate. The arrays will be
hybridized with micro samples of messenger RNA and then reverse transcription
will produce an array of cDNAs for differential screening and quantification for
gene expression. Using this approach single gene products can be screened and
identified by sequencing in a single automated process. Many genomic
applications involve either small amounts of sample or expression of low
abundance genes. Amplification by the polymerase chain reaction is then
required. The work of Professors Ewing and Day and their students at
Pennsylvania State University will permit single molecule detection on an array
of cDNAs permitting differential screening and quantification for gene
expression in a single automated process. This work will have immediate impact
on problems in genomic fields.
