9316160 Booker This is a project involving the collection of a continuous tensor
electromagnetic profile (EMAP) across the San Andreas Fault in central
California. The experiment has the potential to resolve targets of direct
relevance to the earthquake process including high conductivity and presumably
high pore pressure regions within the fault zone, resistive and hence
impermeable membranes between the fault zone and the country rock and enhanced
crustal conductivity below the brittle-ductile transition. However, detailed
investigation of electrical structure within the fault zone at seismogenic
depths is likely to require a controlled electromagnetic source deployed in
conjunction with a deep drill hole. Detailed knowledge of the background
electrical structure is a key requirement for design of such an experiment and
providing this information is as important as the potential for direct insight
from the EMAP data. ***
