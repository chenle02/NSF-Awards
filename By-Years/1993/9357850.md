The goal of this research is to develop a tool-based framework for the
specification, analysis and implementation of real-time systems. The research
includes three principal components: (1) a real-time specification language, (2)
analysis techniques for showing that a specification is correct, and (3) a
programming language in which the system is ultimately implemented. The
specification component centers on the CSR paradigm, in which a real-time
system's high-level control structure is entered as a set of Ada-like tasks,
which are then compiled into a state-transition model. For the analysis
component, an automated toolset based on the technique of finite-state
abstraction is developed. The tools include a probabilistic reachability
analyzer, a simulator and a model-checker. The language component is based on
TCEL, a real-time programming language with CSR-style timing constructs. This
feature allows the programmer to embed the real-time requirements within the
program itself. A TCEL compiler is being developed, which rearranges the code to
meet the inferred timing constraints.
