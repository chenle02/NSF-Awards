This is a DMS-EPRSC project in structural graph theory. There are two natural
ways to describe the local structure of a graph: by asking what graphs occur as
minors, and by asking what graphs occur as induced subgraphs. The theory of
graph minors was developed by Robertson and Seymour, and gives a very
satisfactory picture. However, the picture for induced subgraphs is more complex
and much less is known. The goal of this project is to extend the theory of
induced subgraphs. What can we say about the graphs that have no induced
subgraph of some special type? Graduate students will be trained as part of the
project.

A central problem in the field is the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture. It has been known
since the results of Ramsey and of Erdos and of Szekeres in the 1930s that every
graph has a clique or stable set of size at least logarithmic in the number of
vertices. However, Erdos and Hajnal conjectured in the 1980s that forbidding any
induced subgraph H causes a dramatic jump, resulting in cliques or stable sets
of polynomial size. Recently the PIs (joint with two others) settled the
smallest open case, which had been a famous question since the problem was first
proposed in the 1980's; and even more recently they have made substantial
progress on the next smallest case. These two steps both used new techniques,
and it is hoped that these techniques will lead to further progress on this and
related problems. More broadly, what is the structure that results when some
graph is excluded as an induced subgraph? We don't expect to get a structure
that is necessary and sufficient for excluding a particular graph (this already
seems hopeless for excluding a six-vertex graph); but it is more likely that
there is a structure that is necessary for excluding a given graph and
sufficient for excluding some larger graph. This would be the first step towards
a general structural theory for induced subgraphs.
