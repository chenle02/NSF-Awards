Fairfield University will purchase a high-volume, high- resolution gamma-ray
spectrometry system including a lithium drifted germanium detector, a 16,384
channel analyzer, associated electronics, shielding, and data analysis
equipment. This equipment will be used to improve instruction in an advanced
nuclear science laboratory, and for individual projects to be carried out by
advanced undergraduate students. Many of the projects will involve the analysis
of environmental samples using neutron activation analysis. Fairfield University
will match the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds plus $300, and will
provide a Microvax II computer for use with the system.
