Force is developed in muscle contraction by myosin molecule pulling actin
filaments during shortening. The details of this process have been difficult to
establish because of the rapid and unsynchronized nature of the many changes
taking place during the relative sliding of the filaments. Our work is focused
on the structural changes that are thought to be occurring in the head region of
myosin during this interaction. The introduction of molecular biological
techniques in recent years has permitted us to modify the polypeptide structure
of myosin in such a way that reporter groups can be more readily introduced into
the molecule. These groups can be fluorescent probes for spectroscopic studies,
or electron dense probes for direct visualization by electron microscopy. These
methods should provide new information about the dynamics of myosin crossbridge
movement during ATP hydrolysis and actin binding, both in individual molecules
and in muscle fibers during muscle contraction.
