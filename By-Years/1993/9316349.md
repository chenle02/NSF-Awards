9316349 Kohn This study will employ laser probe oxygen isotope analysis and a
recently developed predictive model of mineral isotopic changes during prograde
metamorphism in an intergrative effort to test whether there is a genetic
relationship between fluid infiltration and deformation during metamorphism. The
relationship will be investigated by obtaining oxygen isotope zoning profiles
and/or maps for both metamorphic porphyroblasts and matrix phases. Three
different amphibolite-facies areas (west-central New Hampshire, southwestern New
Hampshire, and Tierra del Fuwgo, Chili) were selected for study because they are
well characterized with respect to their P-T, T-t and deformational histories,
and because they represent a range of tectonic settings and fluid and
deformational histories.
