In the last few years, there has been an increased interest in the study of
multilevel preconditioners for solving elliptic problems in conjunction with the
conjugate gradient method. Part of the motivation is that these methods are
highly parallelizable, in addition to usually possessing good convergence
properties, a combination that most of the classical preconditioners (e.g. SSOR,
incomplete factorizations and polynomial preconditioners) lack. The authors'
previous work in this area has convinced them that this is a very promising
approach for constructing efficient and robust iterative methods for solving
large elliptic difference equations on massively parallel computers. Continued
research in this area, will include a careful study of implementation issues for
massively parallel computers such as the CM.2, a theoretical study of the
relationships among different multilevel preconditioners and the class of domain
decomposition methods, hybrid multilevel methods which retain the nice
properties of incomplete factorization methods with respect to non.smooth
coefficients, and extensions beyond self-adjoint second order elliptic operators
(e.g.indefinite, convection-diffusion and biharmonic operators.)
