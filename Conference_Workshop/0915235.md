ABSTRACT

Principal Investigator: Rojas, J. Maurice Proposal Number: DMS - 0915235
Institution: Texas A&M Research Foundation Title: Texas Algebraic Geometry
Seminar (TAGS) 2009

The Texas Algebraic Geometry Seminar (TAGS), sponsored by Texas A&M University,
the University of Texas at Austin, and Rice University, is designed to enhance
both the educational and the research atmosphere of the growing community of
Texas algebraic geometers and researchers in related areas. This proposal is for
partial funding of this important conference. The conference is committed to
bring researchers of national and international stature to Texas to discuss
research in algebraic geometry and to interact with mathematicians from Texas
and surrounding states. A principal area of mathematics, algebraic geometry is
also the source of algorithms behind much of modern technology. For example, a
thorough technical understanding of cryptography, coding theory, or quantum
computing is impossible without the language of algebraic geometry. The
conference makes it possible for the community of algebraic geometers from Texas
and surrounding states (a large geographic region) to meet and share new results
on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates
productive cooperative efforts between schools. Also, the conference is
dedicated to the development of graduate students and young faculty in algebraic
geometry. Finally, the unique environment at Texas A&M, where classically
trained algebraic geometers work on applied problems with impact in areas such
as signal processing and computer science, insures that the conference will have
an impact that goes well beyond mathematics.
