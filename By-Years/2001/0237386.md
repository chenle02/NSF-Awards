Proposal DMS-0237386&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ko Honda (USC)&lt;br/&gt;TItle: CONTACT
SRUCTURES AND LOW-DIMENSIONAL
TOPOLOGY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses
on the topology of 3-dimensional manifolds via contact&lt;br/&gt;structures.
Over the last several years, the investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;collaborators
(Colin, Etnyre, Giroux, Kazez, Matic) have developed a largely&lt;br/&gt;cut-
and-paste theory of tight contact structures. Taking this program
further,&lt;br/&gt;he plans to conclude the project on finiteness questions for
tight contact&lt;br/&gt;structures (with Colin and Giroux), investigate
Legendrian and transverse knots&lt;br/&gt;(with Etnyre), and explore connections
with foliation/lamination theory (with&lt;br/&gt;Kazez and Matic). More
fundamentally, he seeks to understand the nature of&lt;br/&gt;tightness, and
relations with hyperbolic geometry and finite type invariants
of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a continued study
of 3-dimensional spaces. The 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;spaces we study will
locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean)&lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional space.
These objects may be very complicated globally, but a&lt;br/&gt;local observer
cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether&lt;br/&gt;it is
sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere. In our work, we seek
to&lt;br/&gt;better understand 3-dimensional spaces by employing a new type of
probe, called&lt;br/&gt;a contact structure. Although mathematicians have been
cognizant of contact&lt;br/&gt;structures for decades, a good understanding of
such structures has become&lt;br/&gt;gradually possible only over the last
twenty years. Contact structures are&lt;br/&gt;also intimately connected with
4-dimensional geometry (the geometry of&lt;br/&gt;space-time), quantum physics,
and dynamics (such as fluid dynamics).&lt;br/&gt;
