Basic research programs of the Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute (EORI) at the
University of Wyoming are expanded and incorporated into an NSF
University/Industry Cooperative Research Center for Mathematical Modeling
(CRCMM)> The CRCMM will initally operate within EORI, which has developed a
unique interdisciplinary research program with a dual focus on mathematical
modelingt and laboratory experimentation. CRCMM will then become a separte
center and operate independently. The research underway has direct application
to improving oil extraction technologies, and it thus fosters expansion in a key
domestic industry and reduces reliance on foreign supplies of strategic
resources. Long-range goals call for CRCMM to establish a broader base os
support than that enjoyed by EORI, and for the CRCMM to develop into a center
for the investigation of a wide range of research topics in mathematical
modeling.
