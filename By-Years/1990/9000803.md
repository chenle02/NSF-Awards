Morphometrics is the study of shape and shape change, and it combines aspects
of geometry and statistics. Morphometrics has wide applications in systematic
biology: quantitative description of species and their differences;
characterization of the changes that occur during the development of an
individual organism and the evolution of a lineage; and the study of processes
that impact on these differences and changes. The field of morphometrics has
made rapid advances in the past decade, stemming from the availability of desk-
top image analysis systems driven by microcomputers, and the development of
several new conceptual approaches to the capture of biological shape
information. The limiting factors to the further growth of biological
morphometrics have been the lack of appropriate microcomputer software, and the
high training threshold that investigators face when attempting to use
morphometrics in their research. The Systematic Biology Program of the National
Science Foundation supported a two-week training workshop at the University of
Michigan in 1988, during which 35 faculty-level researchers were given hands-on
training in morphometrics. Since that workshop, a new battery of software
packages have been developed by the instructors, to be published with the
Workshop Proceedings volume in 1990. Dr. Michael Bell and F. James Rohlf propose
a second two-week morphometrics training workshop, to be held on the Stony Brook
campus of the State University of New York. The Proceedings volume and
associated software will be the principal material used in the course, which
will train approximately 30 systematic biology researchers in the latest
approaches to morphometrics. The proposed training workshop will have wide
implications throughout systematic and evolutionary biology. The participants
will represent different taxonomic groups and research philosophies, and they
will return to their host institutions after the workshop prepared to use and
teach the use of an important new research tool. They will be in a position to
write competitive grant proposals for equipment acquisition and morphometric
research. During the workshop, possible new approaches will be discussed and the
place of morphometrics in systematic research will take new form. The workshop
will be an important test of the software prior to publication. Training
workshops such as this are cost-effective ways to disseminate new methodologies
and technologies.
