This project permits undergraduate students to gain experience with a modern
material-removal processes laboratory. The laboratory experiments include topics
ranging from measurement of accuracy of a machined part to measurement of
accuracy of a machined part to measurement of surface finish, cutting forces,
tool wear- temperature/chatter. The techniques employed to measure these
variables include: measurement of forces using active systems such as quartz
dynamometers, measurement of temperature using thermocouples, and measurement of
wear from acoustic signals. The major equipment supporting this lab includes:
profilometer, peize-electric load cell, a CNC mill, a signal analyzer, an
acoustic emission transducer and a data acquisition system. This award is being
matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
