Physics (13) This project is developing a new quantum mechanics curriculum for
junior/senior level undergraduates. The curriculum explains modern formulations
and interpretations of quantum mechanics to undergraduates, and focuses on
fundamental concepts, in particular on quantum states and measurements. The
curriculum is novel in that it unifies laboratory and classroom activities.
Instead of simply talking about gedanken experiments in a lecture, students
actually perform the experiments. This makes quantum mechanics more real and
less abstract. The laboratory experiments have been chosen for their relevance
in the 21st century; they involve studying the properties of single photons,
including experiments that demonstrate existence of light quanta, single-photon
interference, two-photon interference, and tests of Bell's inequalities. The
newly designed laboratory experiments and lecture materials are being made
available on the web and presented at AAPT meetings.
