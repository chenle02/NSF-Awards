The P.I. is developing this project in response to two unrelated events: 1)
recent NSF research initiatives regarding human dimensions of global
environmental change, and 2) an invitation from the Hungarian Academy of
Sciences to participate in a forthcoming international conference that will
examine the relationship between linguistic diversity and various social
problems. The P.I.'s paper in Budapest, September 1989 will examine parallels
between socialinguistic diversity and literacy as they correspond to the social
stratification of health care in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Mexico. The P.I.
plans to extend this research to the domain of environmental change. The nature
of this research requires that the P.I. travel for consultation. The P.I.,
therefore, requests travel funds along with funds to pay research assistants and
to purchase some equipment.
