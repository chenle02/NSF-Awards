Stanley 0108619 - This research offers a rare opportunity to investigate the
effects of dam removal on the physical environment and biogeochemical processes,
including anthropogenic disturbance impacts, ecological succession, sediment
transport, and nutrient retention. This is a poorly understood area with little
reliable data, and the project will capitalize on recent and upcoming dam
removals in Wisconsin's Baraboo River, the longest river restored to free-
flowing conditions in the Unites States. The project will obtain information
critical to understanding and managing dams and dam removals. The study unites
basic science with management objectives by addressing conceptual ecological
models of riverine system function, and how anthropogenic structural alterations
evolve over time into more natural wetland habitats. The models developed during
this project have broad applicability for river management and the advancement
of ecological succession theory.
