8815351 Ahlbrandt The investigator and a collaborator (M. Ziegler) are seeking a
very detailed classification of totally categorical theories. This venture in
abstract model theory, a major branch of the foundations of mathematics,
involves a great deal of algebra. Encouraging initial results have been
published and will be extended.
