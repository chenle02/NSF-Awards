This Science in Developing Countries award will support participation by u.S.
and Latin American researchers in a Research Workshop on Science and the State,
to be held in Los Angeles, California, February 27-29, 1992. Economic crisis in
Latin America has forced both urban and rural households to explore ways to
survive. These strategies include women entering the labor market in growing
numbers, micro-enterprises, production cooperatives, and community-based
emergency organizations. This new community activism, in which women have been
prominent, has given rise to substantial research by Latin and North American
scholars. This workshop will bring together 21 regional scholars from various
disciplines to discuss current topics and compare North and South American
perspectives. It will also explore how responses of Latin American women to
persistent poverty pertain to U.S. poverty workers. Participants will meet with
leaders of Los Angeles Latina communities and discuss women's experiences in
confronting poverty through local efforts to ensure the social reproduction of
new immigrant households.
