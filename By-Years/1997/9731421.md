KANTOR 9731421 The proposer will investigate fast recognition algorithms for
black box exceptional groups of Lie type (research begun with K. Magaard), and
finding the characteristic of a black box group of Lie type (research begun with
A. Seress). These have applications to upgrading all known Monte Carlo nearly
linear permutation group algorithms to Las Vegas algorithms, versions of which
will then be programmed into the group theory system GAP. Other consequences
will be very practical Sylow algorithms for permutation groups, which will also
go into GAP. The field of group theory is the mathematical theory of symmetry
and interacts with many other disciplines, for example physics and chemistry
outside of mathematics, coding theory, number theory and geometry inside
mathematics.The investigator's particular area is finite groups, computation and
applications to geometry and coding.
