ABSTRACT CTS-9532086 A high-resolution electron energy-loss spectrometer
(HREELS) is acquired and installed in an existing ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
chamber. Use includes analysis of thiols and other organosulfur compounds on
molybdenum crystals and on sulfided or carbided molybdenum. These studies are
relevant to hydrodesulfurization (HDS) processes. ***
