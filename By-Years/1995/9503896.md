9503896 Nystuen This technology development project is to test and improve an
acoustic inversion algorithm to measure rain from the ambient sound field within
the ocean. The underwater sound field produced by rain upon the surface contains
information about drop size distribution within the rain. Rainfall is an
important mechanism for exchanging heat and certain chemicals such as carbon
between the oceans and atmosphere, but measurements are sparse and difficult to
make. The technique to be developed will allow estimation of rainfall over a
broad area by using remote ocean drifters and buoys. Rainfall upon the ocean
surface can be detected by underwater sensors and the type and relative
intensity of rainfall may be determined by examining the acoustic
characteristics. The acoustic technique to be validated will be able to
differentiate between rain types (stratiform vs. convective) by drop-size
analysis and provide a rapid temporal response for accurate estimates of
rainfall over large spatial scales. This project involves the placement of
acoustic receivers offshore from two locations where there is doppler weather
radar coverage. Acoustic signals received and isolated from the ambient sound
field in the ocean will be compared with radar images of overlying rainfall so
that quantitative estimates of rain can be associated with specific acoustic
signatures. If successful, acoustic sensors can then be placed in remote areas
of the oceans to greatly expand available data on rainfall amounts that are
important to studies of climate variability.
