Interdisciplinary (99)-Furman University has had a longstanding dedication to
quality liberal arts education. The academic programs and support services at
Furman focus on developing highly creative and talented individuals across all
disciplines. These programs provide a strong pool of students from which to
recruit talented computing professionals. The liberal arts environment is an
excellent place to develop and nurture computing skills in students who don't
initially see themselves as computer scientists. This project provides a model
for recruiting computer science majors through a scholarship program spearheaded
in the introductory computing classes and retaining the students through
tutoring and career services, research and internship opportunities, and
department community-building activities. A total of ten computer science
students are awarded three-year scholarships to pursue undergraduate degrees in
computing. The objectives of the project are 1) to recruit freshmen and
sophomore students to the discipline of computer science; 2) to specifically
encourage women and minority students to consider areas of computing; 3) to
retain these students through graduation by maintaining their interest in the
discipline; and 4) to see these students successfully placed in appropriate jobs
or graduate school programs.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is
evidenced by the wealth of experience of the PIs in the area of gender issues
and support communities within computing and the strength of the liberal arts
environment at Furman University for recruiting and retaining computing
professionals. After assessing the impact of this scholarship program on the
participants at Furman, the broader impact of this program is that it can be a
model that is duplicated in other liberal arts institutions.&lt;br/&gt;
