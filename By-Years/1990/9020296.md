This proposal is to simultaneously probe the HF-modified ionosphere with the
Arecibo 430 MHz radar and a mobile 50 MHz imaging Doppler interferometer (IDI)
radar. With the IDI system, the P.I. plans to make 3-d images of the heated
region. The proposal, which concentrates on studying heating and cooling
processes during HF modification, plans to take advantage of two additional VHF
radar stations to be deployed in the Caribbean as part of the NASA Combined
Release and Radiation Effect (CRRES) program in the summer of 1991.***//
