Abstract 93-53622 Diane Briars Assessment Communities of Teachers (ACT) The
Assessment Communities of Teachers Project uses classroom assessment of students
as a vehicle for professional development. The project supports the enhancement
of classroom teachers in six urban districts - Dayton, Memphis, Milwaukee,
Pittsburgh, San Diego, and San Francisco. The project will increase their
knowledge of school mathematics and student learning through involvement in
classroom assessment techniques. These cadres in each city will share
experiences across the communities and implement teacher enhancement programs
for their colleagues at the local level. The project runs for three years at an
NSF funding of $2,842,463.
