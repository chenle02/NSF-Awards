9529992 Simpson The Earth's interior remains a major scientific frontier holding
the key to understanding the origin of the planet, its evolution through
geologic time to its present structural state, as well as the internal forces
driving plate dynamics, earthquakes, volcanism, and the geomagnetic field.
Inaccessible to direct observation below a few kilometers (the limit of drilling
and exposure by erosion) the Earth's crust, mantle, and core are primarily
studied through their interaction with seismic waves. Recent developments in
seismic sensor design, and the acquisition, transmission and storage of data
have resulted in dramatic improvements in the resolving power of seismic imaging
of the interior. Earthquake research, including rapid and accurate location and
characterization of the earthquake source, its magnitude and a better
understanding of the physical process involved, has also benefitted greatly from
recent technical advances. In parallel with these advances, the science of
seismology has also increased its ability to contribute to the monitoring of a
ban on underground nuclear testing. The Incorporated Research Institutions for
Seismology (IRIS) is a consortium of 87 U.S. universities and not-for-profit
institutions with research and teaching programs in seismology. IRIS operates a
national facility for the development, deployment, and operational support of
modern digital seismic instrumentation to serve national goals in basic research
in the earth sciences, in earthquake research, and in nuclear test ban
monitoring. IRIS is organized in three major program elements: (1) The Global
Seismographic Network (GSN) currently consists of a global deployment of 96
permanently installed very-broad-band, wide dynamic range digital seismic
stations. (2) The Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental
Lithosphere (PASSCAL) manages a pool of portable seismometers which are made
available to the seismology research community for scheduled regional and local
scale studies and rapid response for earthquake aftershock studies. (3) The IRIS
Data Management System (DMS) provides the national and international seismic
research community with timely access to data from the GSN and PASSCAL. It
archives and distributes the data from these programs and facilitates the
standardization of data formats and data exchange protocols. The IRIS DMS is
also a founding member of the international Federation of Digital Seismographic
Networks and is designated as the FDSN's official data repository. This award
will provide support for the operation of the IRIS facility during the period
1996-2001. ***
