The project will enable undergraduate students taking courses in the Climate
&amp; Meteorology Program to have direct experience with climatological
instrumentation. This will affect both majors and non-majors as the intention is
to introduce students to exposure to equipment in the three introductory courses
as well as selected advanced courses. The new equipment will allow students to
undertake measurements in laboratories and to prepare individual research
projects which will link local weather conditions, which they have measured, to
the synoptic conditions. The advanced students will be able to take courses in
measurement theory and techniques, micrometeorology and hydroclimatology, where
they will become familiar with the state- of-the-art techniques for measuring
the transport of energy and water, and the wind temperature and humidity
profiles from the ground to approximately 1.5 km into atmosphere. To permit this
the equipment that will be purchased will consist of introductory weather
stations, electronic micrometeorological equipment, anemometers, psychrometers,
time domain reflectometry soil moisture system, sonic anemometer thermometer,
lyman alpha hygrometer, bowen ratio system, and a tethersonde system. In the
U.S. exposure to micrometeorological instrumentation is relatively limited at
undergraduate level but has been found to be successful in Australia, Canada and
New Zealand, even at first year level. This would permit a similar type of
beneficial learning experience to be had for students taking courses in the
Climate &amp; Meteorology Program.
