This NSF-Europe project involves a strong collaboration between experimentalists
and theorists at Northwestern University in the US, and the Universities of
Camerino, L,Aquila, and Perugia in Italy. Overall focus is on room temperature
ferromagnetic semiconductors for spintronics applications. The US workers will
fabricate and characterize MBE heterostructures based on Mn-doped chalcopyrites;
Italian workers focus on Mn-doped Ge. There is much complementary
instrumentation available to study the materials. Theory is based on first
principles density-functional methods that are used to accurately predict both
electronic and magnetic properties of the semiconductor materials. The
educational aspects are strong, and involve participation of students at all
levels from undergraduate up, and with interchanges of students from the US and
Italian universities. The students and post-docs will receive excellent training
in topics of major current interest in condensed matter physics and
nanoscience.&lt;br/&gt;
