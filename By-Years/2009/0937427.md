Conference support for the meeting "New Technologies for Probing the Diversity
of Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets" to be held in Shanghai, China July 20-24, 2009.

One of the most exciting fields of astronomical research in recent years has
involved the discovery and study of "exoplanets" orbiting stars other than our
sun. A wealth of information has been gathered on these objects which range in
size from planets to larger objects called "brown dwarfs" - stars that are not
quite big enough to shine as more massive stars do. An international conference
to share information about these objects will be held in Shanghai, China from
July 20 - 24, 2009. The conference theme is "New Technologies for Probing the
Diversity of Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets." Dr. Ge is well known for his research
in the field and for the instruments he builds to discover and study these
objects. He and three other American scientists are among the conference
organizers. The NSF will provide funding so that travel grants can be offered to
graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and invited speakers from U.S.
institutions to enable them to attend the meeting.
