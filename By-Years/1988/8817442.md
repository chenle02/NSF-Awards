Atmospheric emissions of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) from the
marine environment represent an important component of the global sulfur cycle.
It is now well established that microbial activity contributes to the production
of VOSCs, but the extent of microbial consumption is unknown. This research will
test the hypothesis that microbial metabolism of VOSC controls its emission from
sediments and seawater. The program will: (1) develop and employ radiotracer
methods to determine turnover rates of dimethylsulfide (DMS) in sediments and
seawater in a salt marsh; (2) determine microbial control over VOSC fluxes from
sediments; (3) study production and consumption of COS and CS2 in sediments; (4)
isolate microbes that metabolize VOSC. This research will provide the first
direct measurements of VOSC turnover rates in sediments and in the water column.
