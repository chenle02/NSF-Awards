40506 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: Establishing an
Advanced Techniques Course in Biotechnology Biotechnology is having an enormous
impact in today's world and is expected to grow. The continued success and
responsible implementation of this technology for our future requires a public
which is knowledgeable about the technology as well as a skilled work force. Six
years ago, the College of Agriculture at the University of Kentucky initiated an
undergraduate degree program to serve these needs and as a means of attracting
and retaining students in an exciting science degree program. The purpose of the
B.S. degree In Agricultural Biotechnology is to train students in modern areas
of cellular and molecular biology and genetic engineering, and to prepare them
either for technical job opportunities in the public or private sectors, or for
advanced degrees programs in graduate and professional schools. Advanced
laboratory techniques courses are essential for a program that emphasizes
technology and its application to scientific questions, and is also an important
means of exposing students to a greater range of scientific endeavors and
concepts. The current application requests support for the acquisition of
equipment for such an advanced techniques course. This course Is designed around
an Interdisciplinary approach to a contemporary issue In biological sciences and
strives to stimulate interpretive thinking skills.
