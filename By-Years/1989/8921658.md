Comparisons of wide ranging observations of gamma-ray line and neutron emission
with detailed theoretical calculations of their expected production by
accelerated ion interactions in the solar atmosphere has greatly advanced our
understanding of solar flare acceleration, propagation and interaction. These
comparisons produced the total number, energy spectrum and angular distribution
of accelerated ions interacting in the solar atmosphere, their probability of
escape, elemental abundances, etc. These calculations have been performed by
developing a complex computer code of Monte Carlo programs. These calculations
will now be expanded to include stochastic acceleration, which will permit study
of the time dependent nature of ion acceleration and propagation in solar flares
and the role of MHD turbulence in such processes.*** //
