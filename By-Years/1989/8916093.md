The increased availability and capability of supercomputers have increased the
utility of rigorous chemistry models and the pool of researchers using them. for
most researchers these models are not central to their studies and they utilize
standard packages such as Gaussian 88 and CHARMM. Keeping such packages up to
date and expanding their capabilities with well vectorized algorithms benefits
both individual researchers and the supercomputing centers by making effective
use of their resources.``This award is a software capitalization supplement to
the cooperative agreement with the Pittsburgh supercomputing Center. It provides
resources to accomplish upgrades of Gaussian and CHARMM to the Cray YMP and to
broaden he distribution to include, as a minimum, users at the NSF Supercomputer
Centers.
