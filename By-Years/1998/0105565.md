This project addresses the challenges of successfully deploying large-scale
parallel I/O servers to meet the demands of modern data-intensive applications
multimedia retrieval, We and database servers, visualization and graphics, and
spatial and temporal databases. The goals are to develop scheduling and resource
management algorithms for parallel I/O systems, and increase our understanding
of the complex underlying resource tradeoffs. These include basic scheduling
issues dealing with parallel I/O, including those related to prefetching and
caching, on -line scheduling, fair servicing of multiple users and deadline-
constrained real-time parallel I/O. Secondly the algorithms designed in this
research will be directly applied to areas like multimedia systems, including
variable-bit rate (VBR) video retrieval, and Web, database and application
servers dealing with large numbers of concurrent, interacting
I/Os.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
