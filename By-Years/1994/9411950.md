9411950 Bull This experimental study examines molecular evolution in recombinant
DNA phages. The recombinant phage are constructed to specifically address two
topics of interest in molecular evolution: 1) the molecular evolution of
essential transgenes (phage capsid and assembly genes) and 2) the evolution of
RNA polymerase-promoter interactions. Transgenic phage will be characterized at
the molecular level via sequence analysis and at the phenotypic level via
fitness levels. The fitness of transgenic phage is initially low, but increases
rapidly when subjected to laboratory natural selections via serial propagation.
After a response to selection for increased fitness is observed, the phage will
be re- characterized at the molecular and phenotypic levels. Initial genetic
manipulations will lead to specific expectations as to which genetic elements
should evolve and how they will change over the course of evolution. This system
of experimental molecular evolution in bacteriophage is a powerful new approach
in evolutionary biology. Transgenic organisms have become increasingly popular
in many areas of biology and industry. This project will for the first time
directly address questions concerning how transgenes evolve, what their effects
are on other genes, and how these combined molecular changes affect evolution of
fitness at the organismal level.
