This award will support collaborative research in physics between Dr. John
Weiner, University of Maryland, and Dr. Francoise Masnou-Seeuws, Laboratory for
Atomic and Molecular Collisions, Orsay, France. The investigators propose a
cooperative program in which experiments (on the US side) and theory (on the
French side) will combine to advance understand- ing of the dynamics of
ultracold collisions in elementary processes. Dr. Weiner and his research group
are currently carrying out experiments on associative ionization collisions in
alkali atomic beams. They have performed measurements of reaction probability as
a function of collision velocity, excited- state alignment and orientation, and
optical-field intensity over collision temperatures, ranging from several
hundred degrees Kdown to less than 1 mK. These results must be interpreted in
terms of the very long-range behavior of potential curves at internuclear
separations from several hundred to more than a thousand atomic units.
Furthermore, close coupling theories of inelastic collisions are indispen- sible
to a proper description of the scattering event. Dr. Masnous-Seeuws, a
recognized world authority in these areas, and her theory group at Orsay, will
apply their expertise to a thoroughgoing interprestation of the experimental
results. The combined effort will lead to a clear understanding of chemical
bond-forming mechanisms at ultracold temperatures.
