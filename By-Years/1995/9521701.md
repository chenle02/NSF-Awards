9521701 Bingham This proposal is to study the current systems, water properties,
and time and space variability north of the Hawaiian Ridge. These studies are
aimed to understand the dynamics of the Ridge and how it fits into, and modify
the subtropical gyre. Results on how the Hawaiian Ridge affects the large scale
circulation will let us understand how typical is the variability observed at
the HOT (Hawaiian Ocean Time series) site and how representative it is of the
variability of the gyre. The study will be based on the analysis of all
available data in the area.
