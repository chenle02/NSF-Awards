HRD- 0401679&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and Education in Advanced
Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clark Atlanta University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI:
Sharouz Aliabadi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With NSF support, Clark Atlanta University
will strengthening its science, technology, engineering and mathematics
educational and research infrastructure by (1) conducting research in the areas
of computational mechanics, computational fluid mechanics, and data mining; (2)
establishing an advanced computing laboratory; (3) revising the computer and
information science and engineering curricula; and, (4) providing student
research opportunities and training in advanced
computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research component has significant
intellectual merit. One of the research projects involves the development of
computational algorithms based on space-time discretization using the
discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for problems with moving boundaries
and interfaces arising in computational mechanics. A second research project
will computationally study the fluid flow and heat transfer in micro-channel
cooling systems using nanofluids that show anomalously enhanced thermal
conductivities. The objectives of a third research project are to develop
evolutionary techniques for learning knowledge bases from large data sets in the
geospatial domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include
advancing fundamental knowledge in&lt;br/&gt;computational science and
engineering and database management; strengthening institutional research
capacity; strengthening the infrastructure in computer and information science
and engineering through the establishment of an advanced computing laboratory
and curricula enhancements and revisions of courses; and increasing the pool of
students who will pursue graduate studies in science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;
