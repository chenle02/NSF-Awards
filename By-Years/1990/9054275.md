The State University of New York College at Brockport, in cooperation with the
U.S. Geological Survey, proposes an Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Workshop
for Teachers of Introductory Courses with Hydrology and Water Resources Content.
The two-week workshop will be held July 22 - August 2, 1991, at the National
Training Center in Denver, Colorado, for 25 selected undergraduate college
instructors of introductory course with hydrology and water resources content.
The major purposes of the workshop are: (a) to bring participants up-to-date on
the science of hydrology and those technologies used to measure, analyze, and
calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and pollutant
loadings and consequences, and (b) to equip and encourage these teachers to use
the latest in water resources information and instructional materials in their
classrooms. Educational materials developed by Workshop participants will be
presented at the Twenty-Eighth Annual American Water Resources Association
Conference in Fall 1992.
