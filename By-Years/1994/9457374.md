This NSF Young Investigator Award from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the
work of Professor Kahr at Purdue University to understand and control crystal
growth. Inorganic crystals with included organic dyes called hour glass
inclusions will be investigated to study their applications for materials
research, non linear optical devices, and solid state lasers. Research into the
factors affecting the rates of crystal growth will be undertaken in order to
control unique features of crystals and to design special crystals from first
principles. With this NYI Award Professor Kahr will study the behavior of
molecular compounds included in solid crystals made up from inorganic substances
such as sodium sulfate or Glauber's salt. These novel mixed crystals will be
studied to see if they can act as solid state lasers or if they exhibit unique
optical phenomena applicable to materials research. This research will advance
the understanding of the control of crystal growth which is important to diverse
areas such as drugs, materials, and semiconductors.
