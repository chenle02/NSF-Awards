Earth Systems Science (40) A series of activities are being undertaken as a
first step in the development of a GIS laboratory at Prairie View A&M
University. Visits to the GIS facilities at the University of Texas-Austin,
Texas A&M University, and Houston Community College are designed to acquaint us
with high quality academic programs and identify exemplary materials for
adaptation. Faculty development activities, including attendance at GIS
workshops, are being undertaken.
