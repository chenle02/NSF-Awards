This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop
pseudoelastic metal nanowires to produce elastomer matrix nanocomposites which
provide desired combinations of electrical conductivity, stiffness, strength,
deformation capacity, and cost for various applications. The proposed Phase I
research will: (i) synthesize pseudoelastic metal nanowires, and produce
elastomer matrix nanocomposites; (ii) Evaluate the structure and key properties
of elastomer matrix/nanowire nanocomposites; (iii) Assess the technical merits
and competitive promise of the technology; and (iv) Devise and verify strategies
for improving the structure and properties of nanocomposites.

Pseudoelastic nanowire/elastomer matrix nanocomposites promise enhanced
elastomeric constitutive behavior, high electrical conductivity (at various
strains), and improved thermo-mechanical performance for use in morphing UAV
skins, conductive adhesives/seals, electromagnetic shielding of mobile
electronics, and electrostatic automotive painting. The nanocomposites could be
designed to offer improved barrier and tribological attributes, and high levels
of hydro-thermal, chemical and UV resistance for enhanced longevity in these
applications.
