the major Siberian rivers in influencing physical, biological, and chemical
mixing processes. The chemical behavior of the radioisotopes selected for study
will permit a "fingerprint" identification of the provenance of contaminants due
to the variability in isotope or elemental ratios in each potential source. The
parallel use of other radioisotope, conservative tracer (delta^18O and delta D),
and biologically modified tracer distributions (nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and
by extension, NO and PO), will contribute to defining particle transport and
water mixing mechanisms, in addition to describing the propagation patterns of
contaminants. ***
