The Mathematics of Quantum Theory, 05/01/14-12/01/15, University of California,
Davis

An international conference focusing on recent developments in topological
quantum field theory (TQFT) and topological field theory will be held on May
23-26, 2014 at the University of California, Davis:

The event will be attended by leading mathematicians and theoretical physicists
and dovetails with a U.C. Davis Department of Mathematics celebration of sixty
years of spectacular contributions to mathematics and physics by Professor
Albert Schwarz. Indeed TQFTs were first constructed by Schwarz in the 1970s.
Witten's solution of Chern--Simons TQFTs then laid the foundation for rapid
progress connecting quantum field theory to rigorous mathematics, especially in
the arena of the topological string theories that lie at the heart of unified
String and M-Theory models. Concurrently, these ideas have led to profound
advances in the mathematics of low dimensional topology; enumerative, symplectic
and algebraic geometry; knot theory and even non-commutative geometry. The
conference will be a unique opportunity for researchers to disseminate their
latest results in these areas as well as for graduate students to see scientists
of the highest calibre in action.

To understand the fundamental importance of this type of research, one can begin
by considering the latest results coming from collider experiments. The
discovery of the Higgs particle (and Nobel Prizes for its prediction) confirms
once again that quantum field theory correctly describes our universe at the
very largest and smallest scales. Members of the public might be surprised to
learn that such an important theory as quantum field theory can still not be
exactly defined mathematically. In fact, the main progress in this direction has
been in special cases of topological theories that depend on the global shape of
space and time (but are insensitive to small local phenomena). This conference
addresses this gaping hole in our current understanding. A rigorous mathematical
understanding of general quantum field theories will lead to an explosion of new
mathematical and physical results likely to revolutionize science as we know it.
