Part of the movement toward innovation in engineering education is determining
if new approaches to instruction help students engage in innovation themselves.
This project is developing a survey-style instrument that can measure key
processes related to student innovation, subsequently termed ?innovative
engagement.? The project is 1) developing a testable theoretical model of
innovative engagement specific to engineering education, 2) developing an
instrument to measure innovative engagement in engineering classrooms, and 3)
disseminating the instrument to engineering educators in the form of a technical
manual. The instrument is being aligned with ABET student outcomes orientated
toward problem solving and is meant for accreditation assessment and engineering
education research.
