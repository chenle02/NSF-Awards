The relative pseudoisotopy of any two-connected map of spaces will be studied
by means of the "calculus of functors," a general homotopy-theoretic method
which was invented by the principal investigator primarily for this purpose. One
emphasis will be on refining this calculus. Another will be on the general
problem of computing the relative algebraic K-theory of a nilpotent or connected
ideal in terms of some sort of cyclic homology or S1-equivariant homotopy.
Advances in this research will have application to subtle geometric questions
about deformations of geometric spaces known as manifolds, which in turn impact
research in theoretical physics.
