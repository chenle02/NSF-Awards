9706916 B. Fornberg Pseudospectral (PS) methods - a high-accuracy alternative to
finite difference (FD) and finite elemnt methods - are particularly effective
for solving convection-dominated PDEs over long times and in relatively simple
geometries. Both the algorithms themselves and their analysis have usually been
closely tied to expansions in different classes of orthogonal functions. The
recent book "A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods" (by the present
investigator) notes that a large body of generalizations, enhancements and
insights can be gained by viewing PS methods instead as special cases of FD
methods. These opportunities will now be explored further, in particular with
the aim of combining the PS approach with domain decomposition for time-
dependent computational electromagnetics. Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first
proposed in the early 1970's (in connection with meteorology and turbulence
modeling). They are now routinely used in many fields such as nonlinear wave
motions, weather forecasting, fluid mechanics, computational chemistry, and with
time-domain computational electromagnetics (TD CEM) emerging as a new and
potentially major application area. This present investigation will explore how
a series of new leads for PS methods can be developed further and then brought
to bear on applications, in particular in the field of TD CEM. Such applications
include simulations of the radar visibility of objects and of how
electromagnetic fields are generated by/ interact with components on integrated
circuits.
