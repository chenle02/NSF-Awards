9314497 Gouldin This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
in combustion and thermal physics among research groups at Cornell University,
the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) laboratories at
Orleans and Poitiers, and Cambridge University, United Kingdom. The project
leaders are Frederick C. Gouldin, Cornell, and Iskender Gokalp, CNRS/Orleans.
The objective of their research is to improve combustion models for premixed
turbulent combustion systems. The collaboration brings together experimentalists
at Cornell and Orleans with theoreticians at Poitiers and Cambridge University.
The project takes advantage of new methods for making critical measurements of
important properties of premixed turbulent flames developed by the U.S. and
French researchers. This data will be used for model validation and refinement
in cooperation with the modelers at Poitiers and Cambridge. Premixed turbulent
combustion is of considerable practical importance, and premixed combustion
systems account for a significant fraction of fossil fuel consumption worldwide.
This project will lead to new models for premixed turbulent combustion which in
turn can assist in the design of efficient, low-emission combustors. ***
