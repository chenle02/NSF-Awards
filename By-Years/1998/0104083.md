Professor Mark E. Welker in the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest
University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
his studies on the development of exo-selective and/or enantioselective Diels-
Alder reactions that are catalyzed by transition metals. Series of chiral
ligands, transition metals, and reducing agents that do not react or react very
slowing with the dienophile carbonyl and double bonds will be screened for their
efficacy in the catalytic cycle. This methodology will be used to synthesize
several cis-decalin ring systems related to biologically significant compounds.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Welker is
investigating new ways to form six-membered rings with precise control over the
three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the substituents. These reactions will
be catalyzed by small amounts of transition metals. By using catalytic amounts,
savings in terms of material and waste disposal costs will be realized. The new
methodology also will be utilized to prepare the bicyclic core structures of
several biologically active organic compounds.
