1341341&lt;br/&gt;PI: O'Hern&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for a
workshop on granular materials to be held in June at Yale University. The
workshop will bring scientists and engineers working on dense granular materials
together to share their recent work on vibrational models and nonlinear
responses of dense granular materials, to explore new collaborations, and to
define outstanding research questions in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granular materials such as powder, soil, and pills
in the pharmaceutical industry are commonly encountered in many natural and
industrial processes. The particles exert forces on each other mostly through
the enduring contacts with their neighbors. Understanding and predicting their
flow behavior is important in designing equipment for handling such materials.
