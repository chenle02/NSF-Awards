This research is for a cooperative project with Soviet scientists to conduct
detailed seismic measurements at the Kola super-deep borehole. This project
involves personnel from the Ministry of Geology of the USSR, the Institute for
Physics of the Earth of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the University of Wyoming,
the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of
Bergen. Seismic data to be collected include a vertical-seismic profile in the
borehole, a common-depth-point profile over more than 100 km, and a detailed
refraction- reflection line using large shots for mantle as well as crustal
investigation. The Soviets are to cover costs of data acquisition of over $2
million. The results of the research will be invaluable to interpretation of the
numerous crustal seismic studies ongoing throughout the world.
