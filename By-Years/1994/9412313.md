9412313 Bromberg This grant supports a program of research in elementary-
particle physics with the inrernational collaboration CDF that studies
properties of proton-antiproton interactions produced in the Fermilab colliding-
beams accelerator complex. Topics of interest include fundamental quark, lepton
and vector-boson properties, and tests of predictions made within the standard-
model theoretical framework. Included is support for further development of data
acquisition with fiber optics to improve the capability of the complex CDF
detection apparatus. ***
