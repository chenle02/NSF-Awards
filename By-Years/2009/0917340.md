The scale and complexity of highly distributed data intensive systems is
approaching a point where traditional performance evaluation techniques are
becoming difficult to apply. Specifically, use of traditional stochastic
performance evaluation methods encounters difficulties in (1) complexity (i.e.,
scale of the models and intractability of corresponding solution techniques) and
(2) parameter estimation (i.e., needed by the models).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this project we seek to address these two challenges through the use of machine
learning techniques. Such techniques have not been traditionally employed in
this area, but have emerged recently as a possible direction. We envision that
this will lead us not only to better machine learning approaches but will also
facilitate merging of machine learning-based techniques with more traditional
approaches to performance evaluation, where we anticipate obtaining better
results than can be obtained through either approach
alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work will be to enable a
deeper understanding of the role, advantages, and limitations of machine
learning approaches in performance evaluation of large-scale systems as well as
their relationship with more traditional approaches. Broader impact also
includes improved interdisciplinary education at the graduate and undergraduate
levels and diversity efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
