The objective of the research is to develop next-generation ultra-sensitive,
low-power, multi-component chemical sensors utilizing gallium nitride (GaN)
nanowires. The approach is to realize highly-oriented arrays of GaN nanowires by
utilizing dielectrophoresis and functionalize them with metal and metal oxide
nanoclusters. After studying the electro-physical interactions of chemical
species with these functionalized nanowires, ultra-sensitive, low-power sensors
capable of operating in extreme conditions will be realized.

Commercial thin film sensors have significant limitations in terms of
sensitivity, selectivity, and reliability. The proposed ?hybrid? devices will
provide numerous active sites for adsorption of molecules and subsequent
catalysis of chemical reactions. By combining the enhanced catalytic properties
of the nanoclusters with the sensitive transduction capabilities of the
nanowires, an ultra-sensitive and highly selective chemical sensing architecture
will be created. Post-growth assembly and functionalization will enable the
development of sensor arrays in a single chip for multi-component sensing.

Successful completion of this project will advance our understanding of the
fundamental interactions of various chemical species with nanoscale surfaces,
which is essential for the development of ultra-sensitive sensors. Nitride based
highly selective gas/chemical nanosensors could have multitude of applications
including environmental monitoring, biological detection for clinical purposes,
and for detection of chemical and biological threats. Results of this research
will be incorporated into a graduate level course on nano-electronics. Students
from underrepresented groups and undergraduate students will be recruited to
work on this project. A science teacher and students of a local Science and
Technology magnet high school will be involved in the proposed research.
