This work will study the evolution of communication in populations of agents,
situated in simple, artificial environments. The primary research methodology is
experimental and task-oriented in nature, involving the simulation of
populations of male/female ANNs, using genetic operators (i.e. recombination,
mutation and selection) that are applied to initially random populations of
genotypes (which specify ANN connection weights and biases). Current simulations
are being done both on computer workstations and a 16K Connection Machine
(CM-2), whose massive SIMD parallelism is particularly suited to such
simulations. These initial simulation studies will be headed in several
direction -- ones that will support the evolution of more complex forms of
communication. These directions include: (a) evolving more complex ANN
architectures, (b) introducing multiple, distinct species in the environment,
(c) adding simple forms of learning, metabolism and morphology, (d) augmenting
our instrumentation for analysis and interpretation of the "meaning" of the
dialects that evolve, and (e) increasing the complexity of the terrain and
physics of the environment.
