This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) is in the fields of chemistry
and biochemistry. For a three year period beginning April 1989, nine (9)
undergraduate students will each spend ten (10) weeks engaged in "hands-on"
research under the direction of one of 19 faculty members who will be matched
with a student. The unique aspect of this proposal is its focus on the very high
concentration of minority students enrolled in community colleges in Los Angeles
and other large metropolitan areas. The objective of the program will be to
provide a comprehensive research experience for these minority community college
students, who have little if any prior exposure to research. Preference will be
given to those minority students who have already applied for admission to
4-year colleges and universities. Each student will select his/her own research
advisor, and the nature and scope of the research project will be arranged to
suit the student's level and interests through consultation between the advisor
and student. The students will be able to select from areas of chemistry
including biological catalysis, chemical analysis, chemistry physics, chemical
transformations, separations, ecology, electrochemistry, reaction mechanisms and
microbial conversions.
