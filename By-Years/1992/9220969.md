The objective of this research is to examine the effect of major ion
constituents arising from acid deposition on soil structural properties. Acid
deposition effects the composition of the soil solution and the migration of
constituents through the soil. Recognizing that the chemistry and mineralogy of
soils are transformed by acid deposition, it is postulated that acidification
alters physical properties of soils including the behavior of cementing agents
perhaps even in well buffered soils The effects of acid deposition on soil
morphology and structure will be examined in two kinds of laboratory
experiments. Prolonged leaching of different soils in long columns, and leaching
of soils contained in shallower pans subjected to different treatments,
including wetting and drying. For controlled experiments, two kinds of cement,
carbonated and iron-aluminum oxides will be used in mixed natural and artificial
soils. In evaluating the importance of selected cementing agents to soil
structure, physical properties of the soil including hydraulic conductivity,
cohesion and aggregate stability will be examined by comparing acid and control
treatments under different buffering conditions. To the extent possible, non-
destructive X-ray, gamma ray or CT-scan observations of the internal structure
of the soil will be made to relate changes in internal structure to measured
physical properties. Because soil relates to soil chemistry and hydrologic
processes, understanding the interrelation among them should improve our ability
to predict how different environments respond to acid deposition.
