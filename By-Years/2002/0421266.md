This award supports the acquisition of a confocal laser scanning microscope
(CLSM) equipped with spectral imaging capabilities, and an environmental
scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to be used in plant sciences studies at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. The instrumentation will enhance research
efforts at scales ranging from molecules to populations, and on applied and
basic aspects of development, physiology, evolution, and taxonomy. The
instrumentation will also add new dimensions to education and training
endeavors. By integrating the equipment into the laboratory components of
undergraduate structural botany classes, graduate training, and an outreach
program focused on high schools, the microscopes will have an impact that
&lt;br/&gt;extends significantly beyond the research lab. &lt;br/&gt;
