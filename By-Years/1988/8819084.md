There are three research topics in the award. First is to continue the study of
quarks in nuclei. Second to look for explanations of the anomalous electron
positron pair peaks seen in heavy ion collisions in terms of binding of
electrons in a stressed state of the QED vacuum; and third to investigate, with
Ms. Hu, muon catalyzed fusion.
