The objective of this project is to integrate models of various aspects of the
legal system with oligopoly models in order to obtain a more complete
description of how various features of the firms' economic and legal environment
influence their decision- making with respect to product quality, safety and
environmental quality. In particular, four features of the economic and legal
environment will be examined: (1) market structure in the product market; (2)
who benefits and who is potentially harmed by the production and use of the
product; (3) legal rules which influence the outcome of settlement negotiations
and/or trial in the event of harm; and (4) the impact of asymmetric information
among participants in the product's development, testing, sale and use, and
among potential litigants in the event that the product causes harm. The methods
to be used include applied game theory and information economics. Intended
applications include products such as therapeutic drugs with potential side
effects and by-product problems such as chemical "runoff" (e.g.,
herbicides/pesticides, acid rain and ozone depletion) with the potential for
generalized toxic effects on the environment and on third parties.
