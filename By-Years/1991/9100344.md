This project is concerned with several problems in matrix theory. The principal
investigator will investigate G-norms and G(c)-radii; unitary similarity orbits,
numerical range and numerical radius; and linear preserver problems. This
research is in the general area of matrix theory. A matrix is a rectangular
array. Matrices can be used to represent a wide variety of situations in
mathematics, engineering, statistics, physics, economics and the life and social
sciences.
