This research spans two areas of computer engineering that are currently
considered quite far apart. The research is aimed at problems in the design and
implementation of operating systems, computer architecture and digital circuits.
And the research is based on the algebraic theory of Moore machines (state
machines with output). A new method for defining, composing, and reasoning about
very large-scale Moore machines and their products was developed in prior work.
The research uses this method to analyze and validate (or invalidate) some
interesting systems and design principles - including bus protocols, fault
tolerance and scheduling mechanisms, and asynchronous circuit design rules. The
research goals are to: clarify understanding of the examples. Clarify or develop
design principles for reliable systems, and investigate the basic mathematical
properties of real-time sensitive and concurrent state transition systems.
