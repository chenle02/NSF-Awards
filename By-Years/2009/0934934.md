This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MOEBIUS project is addressing the
serious shortage of highly qualified secondary mathematics teachers by
recruiting, preparing, placing and helping to retain mathematics teachers in the
greater Los Angeles area. The MOEBIUS project is combining an innovative
curriculum with an effective support network to increase success of students
interested in teaching careers resulting in an additional 40 STEM teachers.
MOEBIUS is coupling the Three R's framework (Rigor, Relevance and Retention)
developed for this project with the newly established Blended Mathematics
Teacher Preparation Program at California State University, Los Angeles to
improve the preparation and retention of students. The Blended program is
preparing students in a considerably shorter time by combining requirements for
the undergraduate degree in mathematics and those of the California Single
Subject teaching credential. The Three R's framework is providing students with
much needed support for future success via three professional development
modules. Upon completion of the program, Noyce scholars are being placed in
schools of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest school district
in California. MOEBIUS is demonstrating the effectiveness of these novel
approaches toward teacher preparation and retention, and is providing a national
model for best practices in mathematics teacher training. In addition, MOEBIUS
is increasing the diversity of this highly qualified teacher workforce by
effectively engaging, recruiting, training and placing students from this
minority-serving institution.
