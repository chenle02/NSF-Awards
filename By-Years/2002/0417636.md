Abstract

Proposal Title: 2004 International Conference on Inorganic Membranes Proposal
Number: CTS-0417636 Principal Investigator: Jerry Lin Institution: University of
Cincinnati



This grant will provide financial assistance to U.S. students and young
researchers to participate in the Eighth International Conference on Inorganic
Membranes (ICIM8) in Cincinnati, Ohio, July 18-21, 2004. The objective of the
Conference is to bring together international researchers and industrial
practitioners to present and discuss their results on the science and technology
of inorganic membranes and to gain better understanding of the synthesis,
characterization and application of inorganic membranes. The previous three
conferences of this series were held overseas in China, France, and Japan. The
ICIM8 Conference will cover both theoretical and experimental aspects of
inorganic membranes relating to separation and membrane reactor technology. The
total number of participants is expected to be about 300 with approximately
120-160 from the U.S., 60-80 from Europe, and 80-120 from Japan, China, Austria
and other Asia countries. The NSF funds will support about 30 U.S. students and
young researchers to participate in this conference. In terms of the broader
impacts, participation in the ICIM8 Conference by U.S. students and young
researchers will provide training for the workforce in inorganic membrane
science and engineering. Their exposure to the international community of
membrane scientists and researchers will greatly enhance the U.S.
competitiveness in the emerging area of inorganic membrane technology.
