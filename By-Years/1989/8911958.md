It is proposed to extend a dimensional scaling treatment to multielectron atoms
and molecules, by recasting conventional electronic structure calculations to
incorporate the properties exactly calculable in limits of dimension D one and
infinity. In the two electron atom such a treatment leads to accurate electronic
energies, and from this perspective the poor performance of conventional methods
is chiefly due to failure to conform to the dimensional limits. Correlation
energy is nearly linear in inverse dimension; the Hatree-Fock treatment can be
modified to become exact in the infinite dimension limit and this modification
accounts for most of the correlation energy in the three dimensional case.
