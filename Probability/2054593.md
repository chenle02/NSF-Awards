Models of human activities often involve randomness. Randomness is used to
understand DNA, image restoration and recognition, communication and social
networks, and the behavior of financial markets. It is an important tool for
efficient computations and for scientific simulations. In all these
applications, the behavior of the model's random process is constrained by the
combinatorial or geometric structure underlying the system under study. This
project is concerned with the fundamental properties of such stochastic
processes and how they relate to the global geometric structure of their
environment, be it discrete or continuous. The project provides training
opportunities for graduate students. The project focuses on random processes
that are defined by a related geometric or algebraic structure. The global
behaviors of these processes are determined by this global structure. In some
cases, these behaviors are useful to obtain information on the underlying space.
This research lies at the interface between analysis, geometry, and probability,
with the notion of group playing a key part. Partial differential equations and
potential theory, i.e., the study of harmonic functions and solutions of the
heat equation, are also at the center of many of these considerations. Brownian
motion on a Riemannian manifold and random walks on Cayley graphs of finitely
generated groups provide key examples.
