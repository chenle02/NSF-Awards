String Matching algorithms play an essential role in the solution of many
problems of molecular biology. This project will be concerned with slgorithms
for the DNA superstring problem and algorithms for dictionary matching. It will
also be concerned with compression metrics as a measure of entropy for detecting
boundaries within a DNA seguence and for measuring the relatedness of two DNA
sequences, and with the notion of periodicity in computer vision.
