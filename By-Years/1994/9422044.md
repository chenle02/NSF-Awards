9422044 Fischer This award is to purchase high-performance networking and
computing equipment which will be dedicated to support research in computer and
information science and engineering. The equipment will be used for several
research projects, including the following: Video compression algorithms will be
developed for packet-switched networks, emphasizing robustness to packet loss
and development of quantization methods that achieve most of the available
granular and entropy gains. Distributed algorithms for computer vision will be
developed, including techniques for parallel verification of hypotheses in
three-dimensional object recognition, and techniques for high-performance
sampling of discrete Markov Random Field models. A "virtual reality VCR" system,
which was proposed as a mechanism for image-based recording and immersive
playback of virtual environments, with particular emphasis on scientific
documentation, will be prototyped. Finally, new techniques will be developed for
recurrent design and automatic recurrent modeling of shapes in natural images.
