This award provides support for the travel of young scientists, especially women
and minority scientists, to the Third International Conference on Intelligent
Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) in Cambridge, England. The conference
focuses on applying computational techniques drawn from artificial intelligence,
machine learning, intelligent databases, qualitative and quantitative modelling,
parallel computing and robotics to biological problems in the areas of genetics,
sequence analysis, protein structure, molecular evolution and development. The
conference will bring together computer scientists with biologists for cross-
disciplinary exchange of results and ideas. The conference will include refereed
papers, posters, demonstrations, an archival proceedings, tutorials and invited
speakers.
