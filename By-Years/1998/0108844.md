This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
small, portable, low-power amperometric biosensor to detect phenol in
wastewater. A renewable, robust biosensor integrated into a microfluidic system
is proposed and will be designed to specifically detect phenol in aqueous
solutions based on an enzyme-based biosensor. This method will allow analysis of
phenol without significant dilution or reduction in the sensitivity of the
detected species. The microfluidic biosensor will use sol-gel modified, screen
printed microband electrodes which will enhance the sensitivity and limit of
detection of the device compared to electrodes of conventional size. The device
will also use a simple pump and valve system for both electrolyte and analyte
introduction into the sensor and proven electrochemical instrumentation for
phenol detection. The proposed sensor will be applicable to real time, on-site
monitoring of phenol concentrations in wastewater.

The commercial application of this project will be in industries such as pulp
and paper, petroleum refining and plastic resins that need a cost effective and
robust device to detect phenol in wastewater.
