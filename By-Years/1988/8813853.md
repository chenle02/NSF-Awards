This conference on genetics of the chemical senses brings together experts on a
variety of chemosensory systems, on cell biology, and on genetics, to discuss
genetic and molecular approaches to chemosensory mechanisms. The diversity will
expose these top-caliber scientists to new developments and ideas in areas
relevant to their research. The issues addressed are of great current interest;
the discussion and publication will have significant impact, and show directions
where future research can be particularly fruitful, exploiting current
technological advances. Stronger interactions should result between the fields
of chemoreception, genetics, and immunology, with important potential for the
fields of clinical medicine, agricultural applications for insect pheromones,
and human genetics.
