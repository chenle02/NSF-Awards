&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) series on Polar Marine Science
provides an international forum for presentation and discussion at the frontier
of polar research. The overarching goal of the conference will be to bring
together marine scientists from wide ranging disciplines to better understand
the implications of large-scale marine dynamics in polar regions. The 2009 GRC
will approach themes within the context of a long-term, integrated system. To
this end we will have speakers representing many disciplines of marine science,
working in Arctic, Southern, and non-polar oceans. Invited speakers include
scientists who have not historically participated in this GRC series, including
those from the Palmer LTER and the recent Oden expeditions. The meeting has been
moved to Italy in an effort to enhance international participation. The planned
Conference will take place directly following the 2007-2009 International Polar
Year (IPY), which has been one of the most significant internationally
coordinated efforts yet undertaken in polar research. This conference seeks, as
do all GRCs, to gather together leaders in the field and to bring them into
contact with each other and with junior scientists (specifically graduate
students and early career scientists) in an effort to seed new thought across
this field. Funds will be used to enhance further the participation of early
career scientists, particularly those from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;
