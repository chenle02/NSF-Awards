9352839 Lamagna A computational environment for students of calculus is being
developed. The system, called Newton (formerly The Calculus Companion), runs on
Macintosh computers and combines symbolic and numerical computation with
interactive computer graphics. Formulas are easily edited and manipulated,
appearing exactly as they do in textbooks; mathematical operations are selected
from menus. Interactive dialogues have been constructed to guide students
through important computational techniques. A series of discovery style
laboratories are used to illustrate the concepts of calculus using the software.
This approach enables students to concentrate on learning calculus, while
freeing them from tedious and error-- prone calculations. Particular attention
is given to the use of the system as a vehicle for creating interactive teaching
materials, and to finding ways to exploit the advantages that this approach can
have on student learning.
