This research proposal centers on two unique types of Precambrian iron-
formations. The first, of Archean age, is in the Serra dos Carajas region of
Brazil and is considered the largest Archean deposit of high-grade iron ore in
the world. The second, is the iron and manganese region of Urucum which is of
late Proterozoic age. These two iron- formations which are very different in
age, in sedimentologic setting, and in extent, have been selected for detailed
geologic, petrologic and geochemical studies (major elements, trace elements,
REE, total organic carbon, and C isotopics where approximate). In cooperation
with Professor Eduardo A. Ladeira. Results from these studies will allow for
much improvement in the database for Precambrian iron-formations, and any
conclusions as to their origin, for occurrences on a world-wide basis.
