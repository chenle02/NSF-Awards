The computational resources available to the brain can be summarized in terms of
a number of numerical parameters. These include the number of neurons, the
average number of neurons each neuron synapses with, and the basic response time
of a neuron to its inputs. A fourth parameter is the strength of influence that
a neuron has through its synapses on a typical neuron with which it synapses.
Given the limited resources that the brain has, as summarized by these four
parameters as currently understood, it turns out to be highly challenging to
explain how the brain can perform even the most basic information processing
tasks. In particular, the sparsity of the interconnection pattern in conjunction
with generally weak synapses appears to impose very considerable constraints.
The aim of the proposed research is to explore, using abstract computational
models, how information processing is possible at all under these constraints.
In particular the challenge is to explain how multiple tasks, such as
memorization, association and inductive learning, can be supported together in
such a system.
