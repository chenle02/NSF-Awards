The Bioinformatics Training with Industry Support and Engagement (BITWISE)
project will provide financial, academic, and career support for academically
talented, low-income students while enrolled in a new interdisciplinary Master
of Science program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Saint Louis
University. The project will leverage the university's midtown location within a
vibrant community of biotechnology industries in the Greater St. Louis area.
Community partners provide a broad network for placing students into internships
while completing their master's degrees and into careers upon graduation. Local
industries will invite groups of BITWISE scholars on location through a series
of field trips during the academic year, and industry mentors will participate
in on-campus activities such as research seminars and career panels.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct outcomes of the project will include improved
educational opportunities for both the BITWISE scholars and future generations
of students who follow a similar educational pathway, and the enrichment of the
biotechnology workforce in a field of great local and national need. Further
impact of the project will include establishing and assessing a model for a
robust university-industry partnership in support of a professionally-oriented
master's degree in an interdisciplinary STEM field, and for using both common
courses and extracurricular activities to develop a cohesive interdisciplinary
cohort from an initial population of students who arrive with diverse
backgrounds ranging over more discipline-specific undergraduate fields of study.
