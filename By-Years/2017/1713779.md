This project will investigate the variations in bumblebees as elevations
increase in a mountain in the Himalayan region of China. Bumblebees are
important pollinators of agricultural crops contributing billions to the global
economy and to the stability of the world's food supply. The Himalayas are the
most diverse region of bumblebees and yet the region's bumblebee populations are
largely understudied. This project will be accomplished through a collaboration
with Dr. Zong-Xin Ren, an expert in pollination ecology, at the Kunming
Institute of Botany. The project will study changes in the diversity of
bumblebees at different elevations and how their morphology and behavior change.
This will be accomplished specifically by collecting bumblebee specimens,
identifying them, and taking several measurements from them and the plants they
pollinate.

Bumblebee tongue length is an indicator of likely foraging behavior. Long-
tongued bees tend to be specialized to forage from specific flowers with long
floral tubes while short-tongued bees tend to be generalists that visit many,
more open-faced flowers. As elevation increases, temperatures tend to be lowered
and the growing season tends to be shorter. During shorter seasons, we would
expect bees to be more generalized in their foraging behavior as they are trying
to capture the maximum amount of resources in a limited time frame. This project
aims to create a network model demonstrating which bumblebees pollinate which
flowers, this will give scientists a greater understanding of the current
functions of bumblebees in the Himalayas and might aid in the identifying of
functional mismatches due to shifting weather patterns that would likely cause
shifts in bumblebee ranges.
