Kieron Burke is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program
to carry out studies of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) that
are aimed at extending and testing its useful range in quantum chemistry. First,
a new TDDFT approach to low-energy electron molecule collisions is being
developed into a standard tool for molecular calculations. This energy range is
very difficult for traditional wavefunction methods, due to strong bound-free
correlations. Second, time-dependent current DFT, a powerful but complex theory
that includes nonlocal exchange-correlation effects, is being tested and
developed with the ultimate aim of improving approximations of properties such
as intermolecular charge transfer. This project also addresses the demand for
pedagogical tools and training in the field of density functional theory in
quantum chemistry, with the completion and publication of a textbook that will
make DFT accessible at the advanced undergraduate level. &lt;br/&gt;
