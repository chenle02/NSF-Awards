This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida
State University to help purchase equipment for the establishment of a computer
laboratory which will teach undergraduates quantitative analyses and computer
literacy skills. The integration of quantitative exercises using these computers
in undergraduate courses is a major goal of this project. Three preliminary
computer exercises have been developed that integrate quantitative analyses with
biological phenomena. These exercises focus on the global problem of
biodiversity and then use the quantitative skills from that exercise to examine
problems in relative growth and the size and shape of animals. These exercises
will be expanded and additional exercises will be developed. The new laboratory
will serve more than 1000 undergraduate biology majors as well as the more than
100 students in the new interdisciplinary major in Secondary/Science/Mathematics
teaching. Faculty in the department believe that computers should be a tool used
for the acquisition of basic knowledge in undergraduate biology in the same way
that they are used to acquire new knowledge in research. The new laboratory and
exercises will move toward this goal. The department will provide complete
maintenance thorough its two electrical engineers, and supervision and
installation will be provided by a full-time computer specialist assigned to
this laboratory. The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.
