Winnicki will study estimation problems for the branching process with
immigration. This research builds on his unified theory, which allows inference
regardless of the range of parameters. Open questions to be resolved involve
asymptotic properties. Tools to be used include functional convergence and
stochastic calculus. General optimality questions will be studied using methods
of estimating equations and quasi- likelihood. Extensions to non-homogeneous
nearly-critical and multitype branching processes will be considered. This
research will contribute to the developing field of statistical inference for
stochastic processes.
