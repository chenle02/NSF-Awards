This is a study of the location and demographic characteristics of households
that have purchased earthquake insurance in California. The location of a sample
of households with and without earthquake insurance for both northern and
southern California will be compared with geologic characteristics (such as
proximity to the San Andreas fault) to determine the existence of adverse
selection. This portion of the study will utilize a major geographic information
system to plot the location of 5000 or more households and compare them to
geologic characteristics as well as census tract information. The second part of
the study will involve a sample survey of households with and without insurance
in order to ascertain the economic and demographic characteristics that
differentiate these two populations. The two portions of the research will
provide important baseline data upon which a better understanding of recent
shifts in household-level decision-making with respect to earthquake insurance
purchase will be obtained and will also provide information on which more
enlightened policy can be based.
