Building on the success of the 2012 Conference, Algebraic Statistics in the
Alleghenies at Pennsylvania State University, a four day conference on Algebraic
Statistics at the Illinois Institute of Technology, May 19-22, 2014 will provide
a focus for the further development and maturation of this exciting area of
research as well as its interconnections. The unifying theme for the proposed
workshop is provided by the common mathematical tool set as well as the
increasingly close interaction between algebra and statistics. The program will
allow researchers working in statistics to interact with those working in
algebra, algebraic geometry, and discrete mathematics, and make fundamental
advances in the development and application of algebraic methods to statistics.

Algebraic statistics advocates polynomial algebra as a tool for addressing
problems in statistics and its applications, and it motivates further
developments in theoretical and computational algebraic geometry. The program
will foster international collaborations between U.S.-based participants and
their international counterparts. This funding will allow junior researchers to
attend the meeting and present their work, and interact with the broader
community of researchers in algebraic statistics.
