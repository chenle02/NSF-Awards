This project will continue investigations of the phase equilibria of a number of
minerals that can provide information as to the temperature, pressure, and
oxygen fugacity under which the rocks containing them crystallized. An important
new thrust is the inclusion of melting phenomena to provide essential
information for thermodynamic modelling of melts. The approach is to perform
reversed phase-equilibrium experiments and then to apply thermodynamic solution
modelling to the results of those experiments. The solution models permit
application of the results to compositions, temperatures, pressures, and oxygen
fugacities not covered by experiment.
