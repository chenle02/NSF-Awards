Many problems in engineering, science, economics, and social sciences involve
complicated systems that can be represented as graphs. For example, road
networks, the human brain, social networks, and interactions between proteins
can all be represented as graphs. These graphs contain valuable information
about the original problem, but they also tend to be so large that it can be
hard to work with them. One technique to study such large graphs is to
understand them locally by determining how prevalent certain small subgraphs
are, for example through homomorphism densities. Moreover, many questions from
extremal graph theory can be viewed as certifying the validity of inequalities
involving homomorphism densities, a theme that is central to this project. This
project also seeks to make higher-level math, in particular discrete
mathematics, accessible to a greater segment of the population. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to determine the strengths and
limitations of the sums of squares method to certify such inequalities involving
homomorphism densities, to capitalize on its strengths to solve longstanding
problems in extremal graph theory, and to provide better certificates whenever
sums of squares fail. More specifically, the PI will (i) investigate whether
rational sums of squares form a strictly stronger method than sums of squares,
(ii) study the tropicalizations of graph profiles and sums of squares profiles
to better understand binomial inequalities involving graph homomorphisms, (iii)
use these tools on extremal graph theoretical problems such as Sidorenko's
conjecture and graph homomorphisms between trees, and (iv) compare how other
certificates of nonnegativity fare, in particular sums of nonnegative circuits,
a method based on relative entropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
