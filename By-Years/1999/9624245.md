9624245 Butler A balanced career development program is proposed which
integrates a research plan focusing on the design and development of an
incipient failure detection and predictive maintenance system and an education
plan which utilizes that research in enhancing undergraduate and graduate
courses. This research proposes the design and development of analytical signal
processing techniques, new heuristic and probabilistic techniques, and an expert
system method which will perform incipient fault detection and predictive
maintenance for distribution systems. This system will reduce unscheduled down-
time, increase quality up-time, and decrease overall maintenance cots. The
proposed education plan includes the enhancement of the undergraduate power
systems courses to expose and train students to use new power system
technologies. These revitalized courses will be made available to universities
with small power programs through distance learning technology. ***
