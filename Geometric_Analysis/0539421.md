PI: Joseph M. Landsberg Title: Geometric applications of exterior differential
systems

ABSTRACT

Dr. Landsberg will work on two projects: the dual defect conjecture and the
classification of Legendrian varieties and contact Fano manifolds. The second
project originates with a question in differential geometry, the classification
of compact quaternionic-Kahler manifolds, which, thanks to work of LeBrun and
Salamon, is essentially equivalent to the classification of contact Fano
manifolds. Inside the tangent space of a general point of a contact Fano
manifold is an immersed Legendrian variety and knowledge about such varieties is
important for the contact Fano problem. The Salamon conjecture is that all
contact Fano manifolds are homogeneous. The first project is to show that the
dual variety of a smooth variety of codimension less than half its dimension is
a hypersurface. This question is of importance in algebgraic geometry as part of
the investigations motivated by Hartshornes's conjecture on complete
intersections. The techniques that will be developed to solve this problem are
as important as the problem iself- a combination of exterior differential
systems and representation theory that will be useful for other problems in
geometry and other areas of science such as computational complexity and
algebraic statistics (Baysean networks).

Dr. Landsberg will use techniques from partial differential equations (more
precisely, exterior differential systems) and representation theory (of simple
Lie algebras) to study two problems in geometry related respectively to dual
varieties and contact Fano manifolds. In addition to the importance of these
questions to the mathematical community, the techniques that will be developed
will be applicable to problems in other fields such as computational complexity
and algebraic statistics (Baysean networks).
