This project will investigate how the stratosphere acts as an integrator of
high-frequency-wave forcing from below, creating long-lived circulation
anomalies in the lower stratosphere which feed back to affect tropospheric
weather and climate. Three major questions to be addressed by this research are:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) What are the stratospheric effects at Earth's surface?
&lt;br/&gt;2) As climate changes, what will the effects be on climate?
&lt;br/&gt;3) By what mechanisms are stratospheric effects communicated to
Earth's surface? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be performed using a
combination of observations and models, and will focus on understanding those
dynamical mechanisms via which stratospheric circulation anomalies are
communicated to the Earth's surface. Direct and indirect effects, coupled with
planetary and synoptic-scale waves, are believed to make significant
contributions. The relationship of stratosphere-troposphere coupling to the
quasi-biennial oscillation, the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and the position
of the subtropical jet, will also be studied. This project is expected to result
in further advances in understanding the long-term changes in weather and
climate, and therefore has important practical benefits to society.
