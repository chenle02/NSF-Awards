The project is developing and documenting a methodology to aid CCLI project
investigators in disseminating their educational innovations using the NSDL. The
investigators are convening a one and a half day workshop to identify key issues
related to developing adaptable materials and to disseminating these materials.
Participants are being selected from CCLI awardees that have authored web-based
learning resources. The team is preparing a guide for incorporating quality into
web-based instructional products and for connecting CCLI materials to the NSDL
framework. Central tenants of the guide are the effective use of NSDL
disciplinary pathways and recommendations for building a community of users who
actively and continuously assist one another in the effective use of innovative
teaching and learning processes and materials. The dissemination guide is being
distributed to all CCLI awardees, posted on a web-site to allow future awardees
access to it, and described at major STEM education conferences.
