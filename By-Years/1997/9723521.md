9723521 Bradbury The adaptive design of many animal sound production systems is
strongly influenced by selection for increased call amplitude and efficient
projection of those sounds in the direction of intended recipients. In some
systems, specific structures have profound effects on both volume and
directionality. One such structure which appears as an accessory organ in the
sound production systems of many diverse vertebrate groups is an inflatable air
sac. While this adaptation is clearly an important feature of these systems,
very little is known about how air sacs affect sound volume and directionality.
Using newly developed multitrack recording techniques, this study will focus on
several species of lekking grouse to clarify the relationship between display
call amplitude, the directionality of the call, and the shape and number of
vocal sacs. We have chosen grouse because of the degree of interesting
variations in air sac position and operation in the different species. Some
grouse have paired external air sacs. Preliminary evidence suggests that sage
grouse males may use their two-sac system to beam certain components of their
mating displays toward females regardless of the males' relative orientation.
These data will also be used to re-examine the role of amplitude in mate choice
of female sage grouse. Sage grouse leks are one of the best studied systems in
which females choose mates solely on the basis of male phenotype; call amplitude
is the only parameter which has remained resistant to proper measurement. We now
have the means to make these measurements and complete the analysis. Our hope is
that this comparative study will generate models that can be applied to vocal
sac function in other groups and, more broadly, contribute to our understanding
of the importance of amplitude and directionality in female choice biased mating
systems.
