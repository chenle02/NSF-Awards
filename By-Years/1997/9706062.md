9706062 Heizler This grant provides $49,055 as one-half support of the costs of
acquiring a UV laser ablation system for the Ar/Ar
geochronology/thermochronology lab at New Mexico Tech. A UV laser will allow
these PI's to conduct in situ 40-Ar/39-Ar analyses on spot sizes as small as 50
microns, allowing for higher resolution studies than currently achievable with
their CO2 laser used for step-heating and total fusion analyses. The use of a UV
laser coupled with rare gas mass spectrometery has a great deal of potential for
dating and geochemical analyses of individual fluid inclusions, dating
alteration phases and overgrowths in economic mineral deposits and for studies
of micro- scale Ar diffusion systematics and undoubtedly will be heavily used by
these productive PI's. ***
