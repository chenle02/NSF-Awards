Chicago Chemical Laboratory Technology Education Partnership Truman College, one
of the City Colleges of Chicago, is establishing a partnership of secondary
schools, community colleges, universities, and industries that focuses on
Chemical Laboratory Technology education with an emphasis on such education for
minority students. The project is: (a) coordinating the chemistry curricula of
secondary schools, community colleges and universities in Chicago, (b)
recruiting students from the secondary and community college level into the
program, (c) providing chemical technology enhancement opportunities for
secondary school teachers and community college faculty, (d) developing
curriculum for advanced Chemical Laboratory Technology education, in particular
a course in instrumental analysis, and (e) integrating the program with Chicago
area industries and professional societies. This project is creating an urban
model for advanced technology programs, addressing both the unique problems of
inner city students, and their preparation for entry into high tech careers.
