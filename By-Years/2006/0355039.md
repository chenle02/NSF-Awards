The proposed activities concentrate on the few body dynamics via a direct
solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation on a numerical lattice. The
theoretical and computational efforts will address the dynamics of continuum and
Rydberg states in few-body atomic and molecular systems. Extensive use of a
variety of massively parallel computing platforms will be made.
