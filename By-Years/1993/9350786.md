A Physics/Physiology Laboratory will be established with fourteen computerized
lab stations for shared use by students in undergraduate Physics and Physiology
transfer courses. This equipment will facilitate the addition of three new
dimensions to the present science curriculum:l. Physics students will be
provided with real-time acquisition and display of data gathered from
experiments in the areas of motion, heat, sound, electricity, magnetism and
light;2. Physiology students will be provided with hands-on experiences
recording basic electrophysiological phenomena such as EMG, EEG, ECG, nerve
conduction velocities, blood flow rates and respiration rates and volumes;3.
Physics and Physiology students will be provided with interdisciplinary lab
experiences through their work on team assignments.In addition to the
pedagogical advantages offered by hands-on experiences and real-time data
acquisition and display, grouping of physiology and physics students together
into inter-disciplinary teams will increase students' retention and depth of
understanding of concepts by providing opportunities for cooperative learning as
well as increase students' understanding of the interrelatedness of science.
