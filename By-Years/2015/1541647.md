This travel grant will support for US-based participants at the first meeting on
Algebraic Vision to be held at the Technical University in Berlin from October
8-9, 2015. Algebraic Vision is an emerging research area at the intersection of
computer vision and mathematics that seeks to develop the algebro-geometric
foundations of fundamental geometric problems that arise in the reconstruction
of 3-dimensional scenes and cameras from noisy 2-dimensional images. This
structural understanding will allow the possibility of designing specialized
algorithms for the many practical problems in vision on the one hand, while also
exposing pure mathematicians to rich and structured algebraic problems that
arise in applications. This exchange has the potential to benefit and enrich
computer vision, algebraic geometry and polynomial
optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the meeting is to
initiate connections between researchers in computer vision, algebraic geometry
and polynomial optimization so as to identify a core set of problems that can
benefit from established tools in the three fields. For this purpose, the
meeting agenda will revolve around short talks by experts from both sides with
plenty of time in between for discussions. Young researchers will have the
opportunity to be exposed to this new exchange of problems and ideas which will
create the possibility of training a new generation with a common set of
sophisticated and useful skills from these three closely related fields.
