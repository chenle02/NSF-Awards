This award supports participation of U.S.-based mathematicians, including
graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty, in the ?Fifth
Workshop on Nonlinear Dispersive Equations,? held November 8-11, 2022, at the
Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This is a
collaborative meeting in the area of analysis and nonlinear differential
equations that is geared towards creating international connections, especially
for junior mathematicians, by bringing together North and South American
researchers in the field. The workshop will provide collaborative, educational,
and networking opportunities for a significant number of researchers working in
nonlinear wave equations and offers unique professional opportunities to early-
career U.S.-based researchers, including those from historically
underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences. This is the fifth such
meeting in its series; previous meetings have been increasingly successful in
promoting research that studies nonlinear models, waves, turbulence, and
singularities arising in various practical applications, including rogue waves
and air turbulence, optics and communication, and mechanics. The field of
nonlinear evolution equations has been experiencing dramatic growth over the
last thirty years. New ideas and techniques have enabled mathematicians to
explore questions that previously seemed intractable, and the work has led to
advances in understanding several fundamental nonlinear wave equations such as
the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Benjamin-Ono, and nonlinear Klein-
Gordon equations, including their various generalizations and extensions.
However, some important questions, such as the description of stable and
coherent structures, are yet to be fully explored. The conference will focus on
common questions associated with the mathematical description of nonlinear
dispersive models and the latest advances in the field. Additional information

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
