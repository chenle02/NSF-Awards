Chemistry (12)

The Department of Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science is instituting
curricular changes over a 3-year period that will enhance student learning of
local environmental issues through the integration of Ion Chromatography (IC)
into the undergraduate curriculum. The project is impacting more than 400
students per year and is being used in General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry,
Ecology, Instrumental Analysis, Environmental Chemistry, and Undergraduate
Research within the Department. The goals of this project are to: 1) enhance
student learning about the local environment through field experiences and
laboratory exercises using IC; 2) increase student understanding of
instrumentation selection and sensitivity; and 3) allow students to gain
experience using currently important instrumentation.

The curricular modifications are modeled after successful experiences with IC at
Calvin College and Western Carolina University. Particular experiments are being
adapted from the educational and research literature and standard EPA protocols
and are being implemented to fit our curricular requirements.
