This project will: (a) Investigate the effects of weathering and hydrothermal
circulation on Re-OS isotope systematics; (b) Test the potential for high-
precision geochronology on young rocks using the Re-Os dating system; and (c)
Investigate the degree of involvement of the continental crust during the
formation of flood basalt. Results from this investigation should bear
significantly on the use of the Re-Os isotopic system as a chronometer and offer
new information for the Os isotopic composition of the mantle and crust.
