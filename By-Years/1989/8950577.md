The goals of this project are to enhance capabilities in the field of animal
behavior to 1. provide laboratory experiences which illustrate and test
hypotheses of animal behavior, communication, and ecology that are included in
lectures of seven courses, 2. to provide advanced undergraduate research
opportunities in animal behavior, communication, and ecology, and 3. to upgrade
the animal behavior, communication, and ecology center existing at the college.
The addition of computerized capability to analyze statistically video images of
behavioral movements used for communication, a video editing system, and
computerized weather stations to identify the environmental stimuli instigating
certain types of behavior, is the next logical step for enhancement of existing
capabilities which include radio telemetry, video taping, and sonagraphic
equipment. The college will provide 50% matching funds.
