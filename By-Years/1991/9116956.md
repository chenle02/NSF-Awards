The problem of fluid flow within the Earth's core, and its resulting dynamo-
generating capability, will be investigated from a new point of view, relying on
a specific model of the fully developed flow in the core driven by
compositionally buoyant fluid released at the base of the outer core as the
iron-rich inner core continues to solidify. In this model compositionally
buoyant plumes emanate from 'chimneys' piercing the partially molten outer layer
of the inner core. The research will study the nature of flow driven by these
small-scale compositionally buoyant plumes and blobs in a rotating, electrically
conducting fluid, and the role this flow may have in the generation of the
Earth's magnetic field.
