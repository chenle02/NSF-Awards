This research addresses optimal scheduling, resource allocation, routing and
flow control problems in networks. The resource allocation and scheduling models
incorporate issues such as task priorities and deadlines, switching delays and
network interconnections. The principal investigators will determine optimal
scheduling strategies for interesting classes of problems and study the
interplay among task priorities, switching delays, service distributions and
queue lengths under such schedules. In routing the PIs will investigate the
nature of optimal strategies under decentralized information, and determine how
qualitative properties of optimal policies may be useful in the design of
routing protocols. In flow control they will investigate optimization problems
that arise in the performance design of the hop-by-hop layer of computer
communication networks.
