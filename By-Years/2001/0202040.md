John Protasiewicz, Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program to
investigate new compounds containing multiple bonds to phosphorus. The project
has three main goals: 1) to develop new and better methodologies for the
synthesis of phosphaalkenes, diphosphenes and other P=X bonds; 2) synthesize and
study new ligands containing several low coordinate main group elements; and 3)
characterize extended systems having interesting optical and electronic
properties. The fundamental chemistry of phosphinidenes will be examined
following their thermal or photochemical generation from phosphinidene
precursors. In addition, phosphinidene precursors will be used to construct
discrete oligomers and ultimately polymers with desireable properties.
Phosphorus-containing analogs to poly(phenylenevinylenes), PPV, and
poly(phenyleneethylenes), PPE, are two of the polymers to be prepared and
studied.

Conjugated oligomers and polymers are technologically important as organic
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), molecular wires and molecular switches.
Incorporating phosphorus or related main group elements into the backbone of
these polymers can change the properties in many ways. Students and researchers
trained to work in this project will gain a broad knowledge in inorganic and
organometallic synthetic methods as well as interdisciplinary areas such as
polymer chemistry and molecular electronics.
