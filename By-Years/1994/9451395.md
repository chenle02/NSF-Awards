9451395 Endres A pulsed laser system will be used to upgrade several upper level
chemistry laboratories. This is a very versatile system which demonstrates
modern techniques in spectroscopy and allows a wide range of chemical and
physical phenomena to be explored. A nitrogen laser will provide very short
ultraviolet light pulses suitable for initiating spectroscopic and kinetics
studies. The electronics will permit students to follow process on the
nanosecond and microsecond time scale. A dye laser accessory extends the output
throughout the visible range. The primary use will be in an upper level
integrated Analytical-Physical Chemistry laboratory course. The students will
study the lifetime of excited states through fluorescence. They will observe
short lived reaction intermediates and will study the kinetics of the quenching
of fluorescence. The apparatus will enhance current student work; for example,
we will use Raman spectra to complement the current Infrared spectroscopy
module. Several experiments are directed at areas of Materials Science including
time resolved studies of photoconductivity in polyacetylene, the luminescence of
microporous silicon, and the study of quantum size effects in the fluorescence
of metal sulfide clusters.
