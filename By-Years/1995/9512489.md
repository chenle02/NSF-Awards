Abstract Pepigger 9512489 This proposal is for the acquisition of an ultra high
speed diagnostic system which consists of the following: (1) a high rep-rate (76
MHz) Ti-Sapphire laser with 80 femtosecond pulse width, (2) a 30 kHz rep-rate
copper vapor laser with 10 to 40 nanosecond pulse width, (3) a high speed video
camera (5kHz), and (4) a dedicated image analysis/visualization computer system.
The requested system will enable the production, visualization and analysis of
phenomena that exhibit disparate characteristic time scales and that are
commonly encountered in plasma, combustion, and surface physics phenomena.
Research application areas include laser induced plasmas, combustion, non-linear
optics and time resolved spectroscopy, photodetectors, single molecule
detection, arcjet thrusters, laser welding, solidification, laser-induced
joining and coating, laser machining, transient fluid mechanics and real-time
image analysis.
