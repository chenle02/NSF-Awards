The focus of this research is to develop a model that simultaneously captures
the yield and reliability/availability of VLSI (very large scale integration)
and WSI (wafer scale integration) systems. The results obtained will enable the
design tradeoff between yield improvement and reliability/availability
improvement. The layout of different multicomputer and multiprocessors is
carried out to compare their area-delay and yield characteristics. Various
multicomputer and multiprocessor structures are compared based on the proposed
yield/availability models.
