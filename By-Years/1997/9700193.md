This research is on a method to detect faults in fabricated integrated circuits
(ICs). The method is based on the ability to identify and assess extremely low
levels of electromagnetic radiation produced by the IC during its dynamic
operation. An electromagnetic radiation (EMR) "signature" can be collected from
an IC during its operation, and it is hypothesized that a distinction between a
faulty and fault-free IC can be made using the EMR signature data. Thus, EMR
data is being collected from fault-free ICs, analyzed, and then stored in
memory. Faults are being injected into the same ICs and the EMR data collected,
analyzed, and compared with the fault-free data. Observed differences between
the fault-free and faulty EMR signatures are being categorized, and a
methodology for detecting faults in ICs is being developed.
