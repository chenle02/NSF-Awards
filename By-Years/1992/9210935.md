Schreier Delta-sigma modulation forms the foundation for the highly linear and
manufacturable analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters known as
"oversampled noise-shaping" converters. These circuits find application in
narrow band systems such as digital audio equipment and medical and geophysical
instrumentation. At present, there are no adequate tests for stability of these
nonlinear systems - designers can only use extensive computer simulations and
hope that the simulations exercise the circuit adequately. This research is
developing a quick and completely rigorous method which combines analytical
techniques with numerical algorithms to prove the robust stability of a delta-
sigma modulator. The idle-channel noise of delta-sigma modulators is a second
research topic. How to guarantee aperiodic behavior in delta-sigma modulators is
being shown, but this alone is not sufficient to guarantee an absence of tones.
Listening experiments using data derived from simulations need to be performed
in order to judge the effectiveness of the technique. The results of these
investigations are being incorporated into a computer program for the automated
design of delta-sigma modulators.
