This award provides funding to help enable students and researchers whose
careers have only recently begun to attend the 7th Gordon Research Conference on
RNA Editing, which is being held Sunday, January 11, through Friday, January 16,
2009, at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas. This biannual conference is the
only regularly scheduled meeting devoted exclusively to RNA and DNA editing and
modification. Scientists investigating these diverse processes face similar
theoretical and technical challenges, and thus need to interact at a single
meeting to discuss their recent findings in the context of the central questions
in the field. The conference brings together scientists at all professional
levels, ranging from students to established leaders, for five days in a casual
setting that fosters an informal and relaxed exchange of ideas among
participants. To promote cross-fertilization between the editing and
modification communities, the conference program is organized in thematic
sessions focused on questions of common interest. A number of important and
exciting breakthroughs are expected to be presented at the 2009
meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major goal of the conference is to advance
discovery and promote learning. The conference is the only scheduled meeting
that provides a current overview of this rapidly growing field. It also provides
a unique opportunity to discuss new hypotheses and models, exchange information
about new experimental strategies, generate ideas for future projects, and
initiate collaborations. To stimulate new ideas and strategies, several
prominent scientists from outside the field will be invited to present their
recent groundbreakings studies on similar questions in related systems. Of the
47 confirmed speakers, 10 speakers are new to the conference. As is the
tradition of this conference, the organizers strive for gender balance and an
ethnically and geographically diverse group of speakers. The Co-Chair and Co-
Vice Chair, along with 6 out of 10 discussion leaders at the 2009 meeting are
women. A major goal of the conference is to foster education by encouraging the
participation of junior scientists. All attendees are invited to present a
poster. To promote junior scientists, the organizers choose several graduate
students and postdoctoral fellows from the submitted poster abstracts to give
oral presentations. In addition, junior faculty (assistant professors or
equivalent) are included among the invited speakers. Junior scientists represent
approximately 22% of the presenters.
