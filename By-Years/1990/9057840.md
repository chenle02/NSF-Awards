This Presidential Young Investigator Award given in the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program provides support for the work of Dr. Banita
White Brown at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. This work is
focused on nitrogen-pivot lariat ethers which possess one or more sidearms
appended to the nitrogen atom(s) of a macrocyclic azacrown ether. These lariat
ethers will be evaluated for efficacy as mimics of naturally occurring
ionophores. The goal of this research program is to synthesize several peptide
derivatives of one- and two-armed nitrogen-pivot lariat ethers in order to
evaluate calcium(II) binding constants using circular dichroism measurements and
to characterize the sequence of binding.
