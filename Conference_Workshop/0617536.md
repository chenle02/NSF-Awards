Abstract: Conference on Hyperbolic Systems and Oscillations University of
Bordeaux, France May 18-20th, 2006.

The proposal is for the support of some American speakers in a 3 day Franco-
American conference on Hyperbolic Systems and Oscillations.

The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together the leading US and
French analysts in this area to discuss their current work and possible future
directions. They will also sponsor the participation of minority and junior
researchers in the conference. Hyperbolic equations govern a wide variety of
physical phenomena and many of the talks will describe how these phenomena may
be described mathematically.
