This research is concerned with the theoretical aspects of algorithmic
algebraic geometry and its applications to geometric modeling, modular
computations with combinatorics with a special emphasis on the following topics;
boundary representation, singularity analysis and resolution, implicitization
and parametrization, Chinese remaindering and polynomial interpolation,
polynomial GCD and polynomial factorization, multivariate resultants,
enumerative combinatorics of Young Tableau, positive Diophantine solutions, and
commutative algebra, and central trajectories in representations of matroids.
