With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Isiah
Warner, Min Li, and David Spivak of Louisiana State University are exploring the
use of various ionic liquid media for chiral separations. Key objectives entail
the design, synthesis, and characterization of chiral ionic liquids (CILs) along
with evaluation of their effectiveness in chiral separation applications. Novel
magnetic nanoparticle-supported chiral ionic liquids are being prepared as
adsorbents for chiral separations. Development of fluorescent sensors based on
molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) particles is also involved.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work addresses separations issues of key importance
in applications including organic and especially pharmaceutical synthesis. It
also addresses replacement of conventional solvents with environmentally
friendly, readily available, and inexpensive alternatives. Education, research,
and training opportunities are provided to a diverse group of high school
through postdoctoral level research investigators.&lt;br/&gt;
