In this proposal, Professor Stoll of Georgetown University will synthesize and
characterize nanostructured electron doped magnetic semiconductors. The work is
supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the
Division of Chemistry. A new route was discovered to produce both nanoparticles
as well as nanorods of lanthanide chalcogenide semiconductors, which is easily
adapted for doping studies. These novel materials may have useful applications
in microelectronic devices, and should provide important mechanistic details of
electronic and magnetic coupling in these unusual materials. Nanoparticles have
been prepared by solution thermolysis of molecular precursors to form Eu1-xGdxS
materials. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature can be increased by tuning the
doping level, x. In addition, using hydrothermal synthesis it is possible to
synthesize Eu2O3 nanowires and nanorods that can be chemically converted into
EuO nanomaterials maintaining morphology and single crystal structures. This
procedure should provide a route to forming Gd doped EuO materials. This
proposal will study the effect of electron doping (Gd) on magnetic
semiconductors EuS and EuO, as well as the effect of morphology (nanoparticle
diameter and nanowire structures).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves
the study of magnetic semiconductors which have applications in both data
storage and information processing. The work is highly interdisciplinary between
chemistry and physics, and involves both the synthesis and characterization of
novel nanostructured magnetic materials. The team spans the educational ladder
from high school seniors to senior graduate students, who work in a
collaborative laboratory setting. In order to fully characterize these
materials, a new collaboration has been established with a faculty at the
University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris. The PI is also involved in
outreach programs as co-Director of Science in the Public Interest, which
introduces science students to science policy in government.
