9625658 Recently some progress has been achieved in the construction of the
basic theory of (mixed) motives. The PI is in possession now of a number of
techniques which make it possible to approach at least some of the "hard"
motivic conjectures. These conjectures can be divided into two classes depending
on whether they deal with rational or finite coefficients. The goal of the
research described in this proposal is to understand the structure of the
"Motivic world" for finite coefficients. It turns out that the usual "motivic
t-structure" intuition does not work in the finite coefficients case. One of the
possible replacements for it seems to be the "chromatic" intuition which was
very successfully employed in algebraic topology in the last decade. This
approach was used in the recent PI's preprints where it was shown that a number
of standard conjectures about motives with finite coefficients could be solved
if we had a good definition of algebro-geometrical analogs of the higher Morava
K-theories. To construct these theories seems to be a nontrivial but relatively
straight forward problem. The steps to be taken include the description of the
cohomological operations in motivic cohomology, construction of algebraic
cobordisms through an algebro-geometrical analog of Thom spectrum, computation
of its "coefficients ring" using "motivic" Adams spectral sequence and finally
the formal construction of algebraic Morava K-theories from the algebraic
cobordisms. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic
geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had
a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated
figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely
polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but
from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those
fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics .
