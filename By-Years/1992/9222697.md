The focus of this research is the development of two methods for the preparation
of equatorial glycosidic linkages with an emphasis on 1,2-cis-equatorial and
2-deoxy-equatorial linkages. Both approaches, one involving free radical,
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction and the other involving copper ion promoted
substitution of picolinate glycosyl esters, rely on inversion at the anomeric
center of a readily prepared axial isomer. %%% With this award, the Synthetic
Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. David Crich of the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Ilinois at Chicago. Professor Crich will focus
his work on the synthesis of the oligosaccharide portion of glycoproteins. These
proteins are implicated in processes ranging from the binding and transport of
enzymes, hormones, antibodies and lectins through cell-cell recognition.
