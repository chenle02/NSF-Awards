With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program, Professor James A. Ibers will explore the chemistry of soluble
transition metal compounds of the chalcogenides, that group of elements which
includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium. A practical reason for studying
these species is their close relationship to metal sulfides and selenides which
are used as electronic materials. The project will emphasize the chemistry of
soluble transition metal selenides. Mixed-metal complexes of tetraselenido-
tungstate(II) and of tetraselenidomolybdate(II), as well as of the higher
cogeners, such as hexaselenidoditungstate(II), will be synthesized and
characterized. Solution methods will be used to synthesize new transition metal
selenide complex ions with metals other than tungsten or molybdenum, as well as
new mixed alkyl selenolate/selenide species. Solid-state routes to new
transition metal chalcogenide ions will be investigated also. Finally, the
reaction chemistry of the soluble chalcogenide species will be studied, with
initial emphasis on their reactions with activated acetylenes.
