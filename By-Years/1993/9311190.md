Gray Tree-structured vector quantization is an approach to image compression
that applies ideas from statistical clustering algorithms and tree-structured
classification and regression algorithms to produce compression codes that trade
off bit rate and average distortion in a near optimal fashion. This research is
examining the explicit combination of these two forms of signal processing,
compression and classification, into single tree-structured algorithms that
permit a trade off between traditional distortion measures, such as squared
error, with measures of classification accuracy such as Bayes risk. The intent
is to produce codes with implicit classification information, that is, for which
the stored or communicated compressed image incorporates classification
information without further signal processing. Such systems can provide direct
low level classification or provide an efficient front end to more sophisticated
full-frame recognition algorithms. Vector quanitization algorithms for
relatively large block sizes are also being developed with an emphasis on
multiresolution compression algorithms. In order to improve the promising
performance found in preliminary studies or combined compression and
classification, it will be necessary to use larger block sizes or, equivalently,
more context. Multiresolution or hierarchial quantizers provide a simple and
effective means of accomplishing this. Other related issues are being explored,
including improved prediction methods for predictive vector quantization and
image sequence coding.
