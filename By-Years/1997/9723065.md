Boily 9723065 The basal metabolic rate is the energy expenditure of adult
animals while fasting and resting at a comfortable temperature. It's a very
important physiological variable because of its large (3080%) component of
average daily metabolic rates (total daily energy expenditure of an animal).
Yet, the adaptive significance (how it affects survival and fitness) of
variations in basal metabolic rates that naturally occur in animal populations
is unclear. One hypothesis suggests that variations in basal metabolic rates
reflect a balance between two evolutionary forces: one to increase basal
metabolic rates to favor a high maximum metabolic rate (critical for athletic
performance), the other to lower basal metabolic rates for energy conservation.
In this project, we will obtain measurements of basal, maximal and average daily
metabolic rates in wild armadillos to test this hypothesis. Armadillos are
perfect animals for this study because females always give birth to genetically
identical quadruplets, which will simplify our investigation of the genetic
component of metabolic variations. While this research is mainly aimed at
investigating basic biological principles, it also has potential applications in
wildlife management (population energy budgets), conservation biology ("value"
of biodiversity), and nutrition science (control of energy expenditure in humans
and domestic animals).
