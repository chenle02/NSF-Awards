This project will improve the knowledge and teaching backgrounds of 20
elementary and secondary teachers of biology in the states of Oklahoma, Kansas,
and Missouri. The project workshop is intended to provide: 1) methods,
materials, and experience for practical laboratory exercises in biotechnology,
and 2) current information and materails. The project will be conducted as
separate four-week workshops for each of two years. Lecturers from university
and industrial settings who are currently using high-tech biology will present
to the participants the newly- developed ideas and methodologies in biology.
