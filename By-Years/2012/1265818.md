The PI will study questions related to global existence and long-term dynamics
of smooth solutions of certain evolution equations. More precisely, the PI will
consider several quasilinear models, such as the Euler-Maxwell system, the
Euler-Poisson system, and the irrotational water wave problem in dimensions 2
and 3. The main problems to be considered have to do with the global stability
of certain equilibrium solutions of these equations. The PI will also continue
his work on the global existence of Schrodinger maps and other spin field
systems, in the case of large data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
equations considered in the project describe physical phenomena, such as plasma
evolutions, ferromagnetic models, and fluid dynamics, and their relevance is
often verified numerically. The PI proposes to study the solutions of these
equations rigorously, and recover quantitative and qualitative information about
their behavior as mathematical theorems. An important aspect of this proposal is
to support the training of graduate students and to foster collaborations with
researchers in related fields, such as Physics and Engineering.
