Sociology (86)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is adapting the Integrating
Data Analysis (IDA) approach to undergraduate education that has been developed
by the American Sociological Association and the Social Science Data Analysis
Network. The IDA project is designed to address the scientific literacy gap
among undergraduate students in sociology by incorporating data modules into
non-research methods courses. In working with these data modules, students
engage in investigative research and gain experience testing hypotheses and
interpreting statistical data. The proposed project is incorporating a variety
of well-designed research experiences into a range of sociology classes from the
introductory ones through the most advanced electives. The common thread that
defines this approach to sociology is that students are engaging in empirical
research and critically evaluating data throughout their college program. Our
adaptation of the IDA approach is meeting the special needs of a teaching-
oriented sociology program with a high student/faculty ratio, large enrollments
by non-sociology majors, and a substantial number of evening and weekend
students at a non-residential Hispanic-serving and minority-serving institution.
