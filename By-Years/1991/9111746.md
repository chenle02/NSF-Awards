An upgraded Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) will be used in studies of
deposition processes in optical fiber manufacturing, vortex dynamics in
rectangular combustors, flame structure for combustion chemistry studies, and
atomization processes in liquid rocket motors. The upgraded instrument will be
capable of measuring velocity from zero to +- 200 m/sec under a variety of
conditions. For the deposition study, particle velocities will be measured under
the influence of electric field enhanced deposition conditions for comparison
with modeling calculations. In the asymmetric combustor study, velocity
distributions will be measured in a rectangular dump combustor with acoustic
forcing. In the combustion chemistry studies, velocities normal to the test
burner will be measured to aid in determining kinetic behavior. In the
atomization study, liquid drop size and velocity distributions under
oscillationing flow conditions will be measured. Acquisition of the upgraded
equipment will lead to a more quantitative assessment of a variety of combustion
process, and should positively impact the optical fiber, jet engine, and rocket
motor industries.
