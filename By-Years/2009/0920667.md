Intellectual Merit Bacteria are usually considered to be simple life forms, but
some species are known to possess compartments within their cells. While some
compartments serve to separate physiological processes from the rest of the
cell, the function of others is undetermined. The significance of membrane-bound
compartments containing genomic DNA (superficially resembling eukaryotic nuclei)
is particularly elusive. Planctomycete bacteria have an unusual cell plan, with
the genomic DNA and ribosomes restricted to one of two cellular compartments.
Even greater complexity is found in the planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus,
which possesses an additional network of double-layered membranes surrounding
the genomic DNA. The goal of this project is to determine whether the additional
G. obscuriglobus membrane network is functionally equivalent to the eukaryotic
nuclear membrane. The main research focus is the potential uncoupling of
transcription and translation (a hallmark of eukaryotic cell biology, but not
known to occur in Bacteria), and identification of membrane transport
mechanisms. The experimental approach involves localization and characterization
of proteins in the different cell compartments, using electron and fluorescence
microscopy, as well as physical separation of the compartments. The project
provides a unique opportunity to explore an apparent exception to the rule of
coupled bacterial transcription and translation, and determine whether this
complex microbial cell organization can be used to support models of eukaryotic
cell evolution.

Broader Impacts The project will promote teaching, training, and learning
through classroom instruction, research training (one postdoctoral fellow, one
graduate student, two undergraduate researchers), and an initiative for high
school teachers. Teachers will participate in research apprenticeships and
workshops, leading to the implementation of new curriculum in their classrooms.
The project will therefore contribute to future science and technology
capabilities in the United States.
