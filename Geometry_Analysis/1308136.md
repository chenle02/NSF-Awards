The primary goal of this project is to develop fundamental analytic tools for
fully nonlinear equations airing from problems in differential geometry. The
first project will build on the PI's work with Dinew and Zhang which proved the
interior Holder continuity of the second order derivative for the weak solution
of complex Monge-Ampere equations. This estimate is essential in studying the
Kahler metric whose potential is of weak regularity. The PI proposes to
establish this regularity estimate under more optimal condition. Along this
direction, the PI will also study some interior estimates for the complex Monge-
Ampere type equations. In the second project, the PI is determined to extend his
recent work with Wang about the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) estimate on
general Riemannian manifolds. The PI will investigate more interesting
applications of this ABP method that is not broadly exploited in geometric
analysis yet. It is possible to apply this technique to study the first proposed
project on the complex Monge-Ampere equations. The third project concerns the
mean curvature flows for Lagrangian submanifolds with boundaries which is
related to a boundary value problem of a fully nonlinear equation. If the
analytic parts were well understood, it would provide a powerful tool to
construct special Lagrangian submanifolds with boundaries and to study the
existence of the area-preserving minimal maps between bounded domains.

This project aims at studying problems arising from differential geometry via
fully nonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations. The goal is to better
understand relations between geometric quantities and properties of these
important geometric fully nonlinear equations. The innovative techniques
developed in this proposal will lead to the solutions of important problems in
geometry and enriching the existing theory of fully nonlinear partial
differential equations in general. In the process, this work is having important
consequences in both physics and applied sciences.
