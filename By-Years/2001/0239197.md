This Small Business Research (SBIR) Phase II project is concerned with the
development and commercialization of electrochemically operated devices that
will revolutionize the disinfectant industry by providing on-site, on-demand
generation of extremely potent dual disinfectants. Peroxyacids are well known
disinfectants that remove even resistant microorganisms (i.e. spores) by
attacking S-S and S-H bonds on cell walls. The conventional method of
manufacturing peroxy acids involves mixing concentrated hydrogen peroxide, an
organic acid, and a catalyst (usually concentrated sulfuric acid), and involves
the transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. During the Phase I, the
feasibility of a novel approach for the generation of the dual disinfectant was
amply demonstrated. In this process, reactants for converting organic acids to
dual disinfectants are generated within the device, avoiding problems associated
with storage. All the criteria of success specified have been successfully
accomplished and a well-known industrial partner has shown a keen interest in
commercializing the novel devices. In Phase II, further optimization of the
electrochemical devices will be followed by fabrication of prototypes of three
devices for demonstrating their efficacy for a variety of disinfection
applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a considerable need for devices
that produce potent disinfectants that are biocidal against a broad spectrum of
microbes including spores and viruses. These devices that produce potent
disinfectants on-demand have commercial potential in domestic health care and
food service establishments as well as in infection control applications in
hospitals and nursing homes. It is estimated that revenues of the entire
cleaning/sanitizing industry will be $31 billion in 2007. &lt;br/&gt;
