Novel aersol techniques for the fabrication of optical lightguides have been
developed in the Laboratory for Lightwave Technology. These represent a new way
to fabricate multicomponent glasses. These techniques to develop optical fibers
for second harmonic generation, and for fibers that exhibit high values of the
third-order nonlinear susceptibility. These latter fibers may well play a role
in nonlinear Fabry-Perot devices related to ultra-fast soliton switching. Also
studied will be the effects of electric field induced anisotropies on the
optical properties of optical fibers. This will be accomplished by polling
fibers doped with polarizable ions near the glass transition temperature and
subsequently cooling with the field applied to freeze in these material
anisotropies.
