Students are exploring the effects of varying environmental stimuli on plant and
animal systems with the assistance of two new Conviron E15 Plant Growth Chambers
acquired through this project. The controlled environmental chambers are
complementing the Department's greenhouse and nature preserve in ways that
improve the laboratories in five courses -- as well as expanding undergraduate
research options. The chambers are making it possible to conduct experiments at
the cellular, organismal and population level on the effects of varying
temperature, light and humidity. A new array of questions now can be asked in
the undergraduate lab courses, the answers to which are providing students with
a more complete understanding of how an organism functions in its native
environment, and how abiotic factors affect the physiology and behavior of all
living things.
