In the mid-1980's, Denver Audubon Society developed a model Urban Education
Project. The Project engages thousands of 8-12 year olds and trained volunteers
in hands-on investigations of neighborhood plants, animals, and ecological
relationships each year. With NSF support, we have helped seven other cities
establish similar projects and have proven that the project model is highly
successful and adaptable. This proposal requests funds to develop a kit of
strategies and materials that will enable us to further disseminate the model in
a time-and cost-efficient manner. The dissemination kit will be tested as
experienced project leaders from established projects help eight new cities
start local projects. Their feedback will direct us in revising the kits. By
1993, the completed dissemination kits will give experienced project leaders the
tools necessary to help parents, informal education institutions, and concerned
citizens across the country establish similar ecology education projects in
their communities.
