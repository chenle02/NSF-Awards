This award provides support for a symposium focused on recent advances in
seismology and their implications for interdisciplinary research. The aim of the
symposium is to bring together Earth scientists from a broad range of
disciplines for an in-depth discussion of the current state of seismology and
how it can contribute to the understanding of Earth processes in
general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significant progress has been made in the field of
seismology in recent years through new theory, techniques, and availability of
high-quality data. These advances in seismology complement progress in other
fields of Earth Sciences, and new results from different disciplines are
beginning to close the gap between fields. This convergence is allowing broad
interpretation of seismological results to answer important interdisciplinary
questions such as temperature and compositional heterogeneities within the
mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium is designed to include speakers from
a wide range of disciplines (seismology, geodynamics, mineral physics, geodesy,
and geochemistry) with substantial time set aside for discussion. The oral
sessions will be complemented by poster sessions which will facilitate further
interaction of participants and further opportunities for future
collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The budget includes cost of participation
of 20 early-career scientists including graduate students and postdocs. This
symposium will be an excellent opportunity for their education and research. The
entire symposium will be videotaped and photographed for broader distribution
through the symposium webpage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will honor
Prof. Adam Dziewonski?s retirement from Harvard University. Adam Dziewonski?s
research has been fundamental in many of the subjects discussed at the
symposium, making it appropriate to dedicate the meeting in honor of his
retirement.
