This project is concerned with the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory which deals with Kac-
Moody algebras and groups, their representations, and combinatorics of Bruhat
ordering on Coxeter groups. The principal investigator will work on problems
involving combinatorics of Bruhat ordering, geometry of Schubert varieties, and
highest weight representations of Kac-Moody algebras. This research is in the
general area of Lie algebra. The principal investigator is concerned with the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials which are combinatorially defined objects having
deep connections with structures in geometry and representation theory. This
work is important in both mathematics and physics.
