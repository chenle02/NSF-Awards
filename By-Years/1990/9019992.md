This proposal focuses on the role(s) of DNA methylation in the regulation of
pyelonephritis-associated pili (pap) gene expression. Pap pili expression is
subject to a phase variation regulatory mechanism which involves DNA methylation
and specific methylation blocking at two GATC sites within the pap regulatory
region. This mechanism appears to be distinct from other phase variation systems
previously studied. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the
mechanism by which the methylation of two "GATC" DNA sequences within pap is
blocked by the papI and methylation blocking factor (mbf) gene products and how
these two genes products regulate pap pilin transcription. To accomplish this
overall objective I propose to first modify DNA sequences both nearby and within
the GATC deoxyadenosine methylase recognition sequences which are located
adjacent to the pilin promoter. The effects of these mutations on pilin
transcription will be determined using both pap-lac gene fusion constructs and
quantitative analysis of pap mRNA. A second objective will be a combined genetic
and biochemical approach to overexpress and purify the PapI and MBF protein (s)
which are required for pap transcription as well as GATC methylation blocking.
Both in vitro and in vivo protein-DNA interaction analyses will be carried out
to determine how MBF and PapI interact with pap DNA sequences to block
methylation and facilitate pap pilin transcription. The role(s) of Dam methylase
in this process will be examined by determining the effect(s) of in vitro
methylation on protein-DNA interactions. The experiments proposed are important
and significant because they explore a new area in bacterial gene regulation;
the epigenetic modulation of gene expression by DNA methylation.
