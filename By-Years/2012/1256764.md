Real-time citizen interaction is transforming society's response to crisis
situations. George Mason University (GMU) is working with MITRE Corporation to
conduct the Citizen's Emergency Response Portal System (CERPS) Simulation
Experiment (SIMEX), which is investigating the hypothesis that citizen
participation in crisis response decision-making can improve crisis outcomes.
The research is also establishing a baseline for future research to examine the
factors leading to successful crisis outcomes and supporting the design of tools
and processes for using crowdsoucing for crisis response. GMU student volunteers
play the role of citizens impacted by the emergency. Participants use
crowdsourcing technology to view a map depicting incident reports, send reports
about their situation to the operations center, participate in Twitter-like
message exchanges, and experience the unfolding situation through a simulated
sensory environment. The experiment is measuring how citizen inputs contribute
to crisis outcomes and generating a research agenda on crowdsourcing in decision
support. Research questions include: (1) how to fuse citizen-provided
information with other available information to compensate for biases and
improve accuracy of situation assessment; (2) understanding the new planning
space and designing new planning processes to capitalize on the benefits of
crowdsourcing; and (3) how to provide timely and useful information to citizens
while preventing panic and chaos. This research has potential for broader impact
on society's ability to respond effectively and efficiently to disaster
scenarios. The project lays a foundation for a program of research to address
the effective use of citizen interaction for disaster response decision-making.
