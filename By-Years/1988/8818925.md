In recent years the availability of new detectors, especially charge-coupled
detectors (CCDs), on large telescopes has made possible more detailed and
revealing studies of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and related galaxies than was
possible in the past. For the first time observers have begun to see extensive
interactions between theoreticists and observers concerning the nature of the
central energy sources. In the past, the major connection between theoretical
work and observational results had been in the area of modeling the emission
line regions, but recent observational work has provided more information about
the nature of the central objects themselves. For example, considerable effort
has been spent on understanding the continuum energy distribution in terms of
the radiation expected from an accretion disk. Recently, researchers have taken
another approach to obtaining observational insights into the structure of
active galaxies and QSOs: the use of spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry
to derive information not obtainable by conventional spectroscopic methods. In
the past four years a new polarimeter which uses a CCD for a detector and has
been put into a operation and the performance has been excellent. This new
spectropolarimeter will be used to conduct observations of QSOs and related
galaxies.
