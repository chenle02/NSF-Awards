Although banks and other such institutions are included in much theoretical
writing within the social sciences actual research on this topic is minimal. And
yet banks are important centers of wealth, with considerable impact on the
economic development of a country. The proposed research directly addresses the
role of banks in Brazil, a country burdened by the crisis of debt and the
problem of capital accumulation. Using data from variety of sources -- including
archives, surveys, and case studies -- the project will examine the organization
of financial institutions within Brazil, how they evolved over time and the
implications of various organizational structures for economic development
within the state. This research will provide a fuller understanding of the
relations between economic and social forces by shedding light on a little
understood institution: banks. Moreover, it will illuminate these connections
within the context of a Third-World Latin America setting in which financial
settings have taken on critical importance.
