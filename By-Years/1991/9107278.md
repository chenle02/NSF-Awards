A single celled alga, (the diatom Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis) originated in
Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming from about 12,000 to 8,000 years ago, apparently from
its nearest relative, S. niagarae which lives in nearby lakes. The significance
of the research goes far beyond a detailed description of diatom speciation. The
proposed research speaks to a broad range of questions from factors controlling
origin of new species to global climate change. The project integrates 3 lines
of evidence: paleontological, morphological, and genetic. Sediment records from
some of the largest high altitude lakes in the world (Yellowstone Lake and
Jackson Lake in northwestern Wyoming and a series of lakes between them) will be
collected. From these sediment records a detailed record of regional climatic
change (using pollen, diatoms, oxygen isotope, grain size and other features as
available) will be obtained. The information will be compared to an
extraordinarily well detailed and CONTINUOUS record of this new species within a
4,000 year period (the early Holocene, a time of significant global warming).
Among other results, we expect to obtain a detailed record of change in species
as a response to entire ecosystem change in response to global warming. This
study will help serve as a basis for predicting changes in the earth's biota in
response to possible future global change, anthropogenic and/or natural.
