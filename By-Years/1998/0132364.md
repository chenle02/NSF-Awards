SURFACE TREATMENT OF FIBERS USING NEW SILICONE BASED SURFACTANTS

Fibers and fabrics used for the manufacture of various protective barriers are
normally subjected to finishing operations for desired modification of their
surface properties. Although many of these processes have been practiced, for
example for over 30 years in the fabric industries, there are significant
process variations. The process development and formulation optimization are
established mostly through empirical approaches without the understanding of the
fundamentals of these processes. This creates a lack of general guidelines for
modifying different new fibers/fabrics/membranes as they are introduced into the
industries. The objective of this exploratory project is to develop a basic
understanding of the finishing processes used and to elucidate the role of the
parameters responsible for its surface characteristics and performance
properties. This will involve measurement of the reagent adsorption/adhesion,
molecular conformation and orientation of the adsorbents, interactions among
reagents such as polymers and surfactants, nano-structures of the surface
aggregates formed by these reagents and correlation of the results to the fabric
surface properties such as surface charge, hydrophobicity and fluid penetration.
As the proposed research has the objective of controlling the surface properties
using a new class of surface modifiers based on silicones, the outcome should
make a significant contribution to the advancement of fabric/membrane products.
Testing of these compounds is admittedly a high risk attempt but if perfected
should lead to safer and eco-friendly products with enhanced performance.
Towards this purpose, the next step will involve study of interactions of
designed nanoparticles with fabrics and their crosslinking for superior finish,
fire resistance, durability and chemical and biological agent resistance.
