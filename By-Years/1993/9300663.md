In 1993 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will operate the research vessels
ATLANTIS II, KNORR and OCEANUS in support of NSF- funded scientific research.
KNORR will finish the WOCE work began in 1992 i n the southern Pacific and then
depart for the Atlantic for ONR supported cruises. NSF supported Marine Geology
and Geophysics will be done from the KNORR in the later part of the year.
OCEANUS will support NSF-funded biological and physical oceanography in the
Atlantic. Late in the year OCEANUS will begin a mid-life refit. ATLANTIS II
provides support for the Deep Submergence Vehicle ALVIN, all 1993 cruises are in
support of the submersible. NSF- supported cruises will be in both the Atlantic
and Pacific for biological and chemical oceanography and marine geology and
geophysics.//
