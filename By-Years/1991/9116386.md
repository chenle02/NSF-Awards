The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project between
Dr. Tamas Szekely of Kossuth University, Debrecen, and Dr. Timothy DeVoogd of
Cornell University, Ithaca, is to examine and compare contrasts between six bird
species exhibiting very different song characteristics. The researchers will
study the interconnected brain nuclei responsible for song acquisition and
production in order to determine how song system nuclei differ between species
or whether variation in anatomy between species is systematically related to
differences in song. Results should contribute to our fundamental understanding
of the relationship of brain and behavior by drawing upon complementing
strengths in evolutionary biology and neurobiology. Funds for the project are
awarded through the US-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with
established guidelines. This project in zoology fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United
States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
