The goals of the proposed research are to develop key technologies in the fields
of epitaxial growth of low-dimensional nanostructures by molecular beam epitaxy
and materials processing to make possible the fabrication and characterization
of functional nanodevices with dimensions smaller than existing devices. It is
expected that this dimensionality will lead to the observation of new quantum
and ballistic effects which will in turn lead to novel devices with higher
performance and operation above liquid nitrogen temperatures. It is our vision
that the completion of this research should lead to 1) new insight into
innovative growth and regrowth methods, 2) new insight into characterizing
ultra-small heterolayers and interfaces 3) more advanced nanofabrication
technologies, 4) an understanding of new physical effects in nanoscale
structures and devices, 5) improved and innovative nanodevices.
