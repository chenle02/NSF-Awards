PROPOSAL NO.: 0230734 PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Pezeshki, Charles INSTITUTION
NAME: Washington State University TITLE: Engineering Informatics, An Integrated
Approach Toward Analysis and Design

Abstract

This proposal describes an approach to implement a mechanical and materials
engineering informatics. environment for education, integrating the diverse
disciplines present in the field of mechanics, materials, heat transfer,
thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, dynamics, and control systems around a common
set of problems and design issues centered on MEMS technology.

In order to implement this curriculum overhaul, planning monies are requested
for four essential thrusts. These are: Identifying key software that can be used
with current coursework that will facilitate understanding of fundamental
physical phenomena. Training faculty in the use of that software so that all
faculty have a baseline competence with current engineering tools in their
discipline. Developing a set of canonical examples for each discipline that are
easy-to-use, error-free, appropriate for visualizing the desired physical
principle, have some ability to be modified parametrically for use in design
studies, and also have some degree of hierarchical parentage so that they can be
used for ABET evaluation purposes. Developing a database, accessible over the
Internet, for use in our distance education program that enables students in
both our main campus and branch campus environments to complete examples and
share results with both professors and fellow students.

Implementation of such a curriculum change would enable the university to mimic
the most sophisticated design/build processes present in industry today at
minimal cost, the university equivalent of the .paperless airplane.. Further, it
is the environment that our students will be practicing in as sophisticated
software becomes ubiquitous in the next ten years.
