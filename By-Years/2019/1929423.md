This award will contribute to the advancement of national health, prosperity and
welfare by studying transitions from inpatient hospital units to skilled nursing
facilities (SNFs). SNFs are a promising, cost-effective care alternative to
expensive inpatient hospital rehabilitation, but poorly coordinated transitions
can lead to poor health outcomes and higher costs via hospital readmissions.
This project develops analytical methods to improve care transitions to SNFs.
The research outcomes will help support guidelines for transfer decisions from
hospitals to SNFs and will also be useful in guiding transitions between other
hospital units. These guidelines have the potential to reduce cost and save
lives. Collaboration with physicians and health services researchers will enable
this project to achieve real, beneficial improvements in clinical care. The
project seeks to increase the diversity in STEM through outreach, teaching, and
dissemination and includes an outreach program to undergraduates from under-
represented backgrounds, mentorship of PhD students, and integration of new
methods into courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project combines a data-driven
approach based on observational studies with a stochastic decision-theoretic
approach to determine patient transfer strategies that minimize readmissions.
The sequential decision-making framework is based on a finite horizon, arm
acquiring, and non independent and identically (iid) Restless Multiarmed Bandit
(RMAB) problem. Theoretical and computational methods for the optimal control of
arm acquiring and non iid RMABs are active areas of investigation. Readmission
rates are estimated by individual SNF using large datasets from several states.
The project will validate the methods developed via simulation of a large
academic hospital and nearby SNFs and use the simulation to analyze policies for
allocating patients to SNFs with respect to utilization, readmissions, and other
costs of care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
