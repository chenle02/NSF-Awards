The P. element transposon of Drosophila melanogaster is of importance for
transformation of the fruitfly but is also of intrinsic interest as a biological
phenomenon. It has been described at the molecular and genetic level by several
laboratories. The transposon moves only in somatic cells although it is present
in germ line cells. The answer to that mystery was found to lie in the
processing of the transcript. The transcript contains three introns and in
somatic cells, all three are processed out to form a mature mRNA. In germ line
cells, one of the introns is not processed out and the mature message is not
completed. The present study is directed towards understanding the genetic
control of P. element transposition using an integrated approach utilizing
genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. An attempt will be made to develop
an in vitro system in order to study the biochemical mechanism of transposition
as well as the factors involved with differential splicing events. This study
should result in greater insights into gene regulation at the cellular and
genetic levels.
