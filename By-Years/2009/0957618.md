This project targets the development of synthetic strategies, based upon the
chemistry of N,O-acetals, that efficiently lead to Fmoc-protected unnatural
amino acids. Synthetic methods that provide access to achiral, Fmoc-protected
alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids will be explored based upon activation of
N,O-acetals using trimethylsilyl halides, a strategy that complements
traditional approaches using Lewis acids. Stereoselective strategies for the
synthesis of unnatural alpha- and beta-amino acids using thiourea-based
organocatalysts will also be investigated. These studies provide undergraduate
students with broad experience in organic synthesis and asymmetric reaction
development and expose students to issues in chirality and bioorganic chemistry.

With the support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor
Timothy J. Peelen, of the Department of Chemistry at Lebanon Valley College, is
exploring the synthesis of unnatural amino acids. Amino acids are the primary
components of proteins and peptides, which are important molecules in biological
research and potential therapeutic agents. Amino acids containing unnatural
sidechains or alternative backbone configurations allow chemists to engineer
unnatural, protein-like oligomers with properties not found in their natural
counterparts. The synthetic approaches in this project target more efficient
routes for making the unnatural amino acid building blocks in an environmentally
friendly manner. This project provides excellent training for undergraduate
students in chemical research.
