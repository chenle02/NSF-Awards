MCB 0507087 LeAnn Lindsay and Jerry Hedrick Specific objectives for the project
are to: (1) complete the cloning and expression of ovochymase cDNA to determine
its primary structure for structure-function correlation with other members of
the serine active site protease family; this information will define its
proenzyme form, active site, substrate specificity and potential mechanisms for
regulation of its enzymatic activity; (2) define the cleavage site(s) of
ovochymase's vitelline envelope substrate (gp69,64) by determining the
glycoprotein's amino acid sequence by peptide sequencing and recombinant DNA
methods, and search for homologies with other extracellular matrix
glycoproteins, particularly the mammalian zona pellucida glycoproteins; (3)
confirm the perivitelline space location of ovochymase and ascertain its
extracellular location before and after fertilization using antibody prepared
against the expressed protein and immunocytochemical methods; (4) establish if
expressed and purified ovochymase will hydrolyze its substrate gp69,64 in situ
in the egg envelope and effect a block to polyspermy. The results of this study
will provide an increased understanding of the regulation of cell-cell
interactions through proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix. %%%
This project will study the influence of cell surface molecules on sperm and egg
interactions during fertilization using frog cells. The DNAs for an enzyme which
hydrolyzes proteins, a protease called ovochymase, and its extracellular protein
substrate, will be cloned. The extracellular location of ovochymase before and
after fertilization will be determined. This information will provide a means to
understand how cell-cell interactions are regulated by modification of cell
surface molecules. ***
