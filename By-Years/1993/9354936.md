9354936 Person Fluid circulation, composition, interaction, and history are of
fundamental importance in understanding crustal dynamic processes as diverse as
the evolution of mid-ocean ridges, basin formation, collision tectonics, climate
change, ocean history, paleolimnology, and the fate of pollutants. The GEOFLUIDS
program embraces this commonality on a global scale as a unique organizational
concept for multi-disciplinary graduate training and research in crustal- scale
geohydrology at the University of Minnesota. A candidate who masters the
underlying principles and global linkages will be especially prepared for
academic and societal contributions in the 21st century. The Winchell School of
Earth Sciences recently established the endowed Gibson Chair and Gibson Visiting
Professorships in hydrogeology, along with state-of-the-art modeling facilities
and matching support. Coupled with the recent growth of the Limnological
Research Center, new directions in stable-and heavy- isotope geochemistry, and
exceptional analytical facilities, critical mass now exists for collaborative
guidance of new educational initiatives and interdisciplinary research
opportunities in crustal-scale geohydrology for Graduate Research Traineeships.
The Ph.D. program combines Geosciences and a University Water Resources Minor,
GRT students will gain unique experience through collaboration with national
laboratories and international research efforts. The GEOFLUIDS program includes
proven strengths in effective scientific management of university- wide
interdisciplinary graduate reseach training as well as recruiting and outreach
to attract outstanding undergraduates. Recruitment plans include a weekend short
course for undergraduates and training workshops for their professors from
Midwestern colleges, partnerships with historically Black institutions with
professorship, and a lively interdisciplinary seminar forum. Matching funds
totaling $20,000/year will be used to fac ilitate the administration and
recruitment of the GEOFLUIDS program. ***
