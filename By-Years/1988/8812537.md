The main goal of this research is to characterize the properties, processing
and function of prominent membrane-associated proteins of the nerve growth cone.
Some of these proteins, in particular pp46/GAP-43, pp80ac, pp60c-src and
5B4-CAM, may be involved in mechanisms of cytoskeleton-membrane-substratum
interactions. These studies will make use of a variety of techniques of protein
chemistry, immunochemistry, subcellular fractionation, cell culture and other
cell biological methods. The results are expected to lead to new insights into
the functions of major growth cone membrane proteins and, perhaps, into the
regulation of growth cone motility.
