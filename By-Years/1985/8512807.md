The primary objective of this study is to develop an optimal, recursive strategy
to predict new soil sampling based on successive past observations and to
identify the random field parameters necessary for probabilistic foundation
design at the site. The research will develop computer software and optimal
sampling strategies that will prove useful in soil exploration.
