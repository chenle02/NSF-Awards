With rapid changes and new developments in nanotechnology, bioscience,
corrosion, and green technologies, as well as in more traditional areas of
metals, plastics and composites, industry need for qualified and educated
technicians who understand the basics of materials technology has grown. As
such, it is imperative that educational and training programs keep abreast of
these advances and have a resource to identify and articulate the linkages
between materials science and manufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
National Resource Center for Materials Technology Education (MatEdU)
(www.materialseducation.org) strives to be the focal point where industry,
education and community collaborate to meet the materials technology workforce
needs. MatEdU partners with high schools, community and technical colleges, and
universities, including official partnerships with sixteen 2-year and 4-year
institutions, and over thirty-five other collaborators. MatEdU is contributing
to the body of knowledge in material science by providing instructional
resources, up-to-date core competencies, faculty professional development
workshops, and technician education to meet the skill demands of employers.
These efforts are especially important as new materials and processes continue
to emerge. The expanded use of technology is enabling MatEdU to have broader
reach, including to underrepresented populations. Enhanced dissemination of
MatEdU products to professional societies, industries, educational institutions,
and community organizations is impacting the numbers of educated technicians
prepared to enter the workforce in this field that is crucial to U.S. global
competitiveness.
