This proposal concerns the initiation of a one-year collaborative research
program between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the U.S. Army Electronics
Technology and Devices Laboratory in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. The work will
focus upon the growth of n-type "delta- doped" layers in GaAs by molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE). It is intended that these layers approximate fixed charge sheets
when depleted, so minimum thickness and maximum electrically active donor
concentration are primary growth objectives. Although problems concerning
material growth will receive primary emphasis, some simple electrical
measurements are planned in order to anticipate future device applications,
particularly the Bipolar Inversion-Channel FET (BICFET) and shallow ohmic
contacts to n-GaAs.
