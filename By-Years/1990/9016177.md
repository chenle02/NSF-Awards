The group of investigators listed in this proposal have developed, over the
years, many techniques for examining various aspects of membrane structure and
function. Steady state fluorescence measurements are a fundamental measurement
which is ideally suited to membranous systems and this application will describe
several diverse techniques which have been, and will be, used to investigate a
series of membrane problems from the most fundamental lipid-lipid interaction to
the most complex of cell signalling processes. These projects include: the
formation of compositional lipid domains in multilipid systems, the conformation
of membrane-bound proteins, the mechanism of protein-lipid interactions, the
role of lipid physical properties in the functioning of an integral membrane
protein and the mechanism of intracellular signalling. In many of the projects
involving membrane proteins, advantage will be taken of site-specific
mutagenesis to produce modified proteins with more favorable fluorescent
properties.
