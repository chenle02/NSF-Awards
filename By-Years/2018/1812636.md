It is uniformly agreed that civics education is an important way to teach the
responsibilities of citizenship. However, little is known about how teachers
navigate this subject in a time of changes in government. History teachers and
Government teachers are being taught how to teach their subjects during a period
of governmental changes in Kenya, and this research will examine how these
teachers then actually teach these subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civic
education has been seen as a stalwart for democratic processes. This research
examines how civic education might be changed as a function of teacher
experience. It will examine how changes in government structure are communicated
to teachers in charge of teaching civics, and how they in turn teach civics to
their students. The research contributes to citizenship-formation theories and
democratization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
