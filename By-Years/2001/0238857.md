The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to
leverage the success in polarized strip development. It will also advance two
configurations for 2D and 3D capable auto stereoscopic display products, and
initiate customer evaluation of these products. Specific objectives of the
project include: completion of the technical developments necessary to produce
2D/3D products using the proprietary Strip Polarizer Parallax Barrier (SPPB)
technique for flat panel displays; collaboration with a target customer to
design and develop a market specific product; initiation of a pilot-
manufacturing run to produce prototypes for initial market feedback;
qualification of the initial prototypes in terms of performance, quality,
manufacturability and acceptance; and continuation of research efforts needed to
produce full resolution 2D/3D products. A successful Phase II program will
advance the technology to prototype and initiate market feedback in target
applications. Phase II prototypes will embody the majority of the technology
needed to produce the full resolution products and will serve to firm up
manufacturing processes while establishing initial market demand in those
segments where natural upgrades to full resolution will increase market
penetration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The direct commercial potential of the
projects lies in autostereoscopic products that will be manufactured using the
proposed technology. Such display products will find widespread use in
scientific and medical visualization applications, CAD, industrial inspection,
and remote vision applications. Consumer based applications may include
electronic commerce and computer gaming. &lt;br/&gt;
