There are several broad goals of the proposed research. The first is to produce
a molecular phylogeny of 18 superfamilies of the more advanced groups of moths
and butterflies (Lepidoptera) and of various groups (families and subfamilies)
within two of the most conspicuous and widely studied superfamilies, true
butterflies and noctuoid moths. Second, by assessing the nature and rate of
evolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genes the research will contribute to the
fields of molecular biology and evolution. This research is of fundamental
importance not only because it will contribute new insights into the systematics
of Lepidoptera, but because it will provide a framework for inferences about
evolution, biogeography, and speciation. To resolve phylogenetic relationships
at higher taxonomic levels in Lepidoptera, a molecular viewpoint is required
because of the paucity of morphological structures that define groups. For
example, butterflies have undergone a tremendous amount of adaptive radiation
but exhibit few unique biological characteristics that link them with any
particular moth group. At least six moth groups have been proposed to be
butterfly ancestors. A molecular phylogeny should resolve these unanswered
questions about the origin of butterflies.
