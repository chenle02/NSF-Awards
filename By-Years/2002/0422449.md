This project creates the Cordia Karl Scholars Program with special opportunities
and scholarships for academically talented women with demonstrated financial
need, enabling them to complete the B.A. degree in mathematics, computer
science, computer information systems, or engineering. The College of Notre Dame
is a liberal arts college for women with a high percentage (31%) of students
from underrepresented groups, and can play a significant role in diversifying
the area's high-tech workforce. The project expands educational opportunities
for students majoring in these fields; increases retention of students to degree
achievement in these fields; and strengthens partnerships with the Baltimore-
Washington, D.C. high-technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual
Merit: The project is based on research on how institutions can best support
women in the sciences, and is based on the college's deep experience in
educating women for leadership in CSEMS fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact: The Cordia Karl Scholars Program is a model program because of its
innovative design and because of the unique full-time undergraduate student body
served by the college. Scholars serve as role models for other students, and in
turn become role models in their workplaces and as alumnae.
