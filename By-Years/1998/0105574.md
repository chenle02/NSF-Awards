The research focuses on the design and implementation of a
framework,&lt;br/&gt;called the ADaptive Object RE-optimization (ADORE) system,
to evaluate&lt;br/&gt;the effectiveness of dynamic binary re-optimization, and
to study the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between architecture/micro-architecture and a
dynamic&lt;br/&gt;binary re-optimizer. The topics studied include: efficient
profiling&lt;br/&gt;techniques; runtime hot region selection and formation;
light-weight&lt;br/&gt;runtime optimizations; code patching and region linking
techniques;&lt;br/&gt;architectural and micro-architectural support for dynamic
binary&lt;br/&gt;optimization; and runtime specialization and value
profiling.&lt;br/&gt;The first implementation of the ADORE system will be based
on&lt;br/&gt;two different implementations of the IA-64 architecture,
the&lt;br/&gt;Itanium and the McKinley. The performance of application
code&lt;br/&gt;optimized for Itanium will be tested on McKinley using
the&lt;br/&gt;ADORE system.&lt;br/&gt;
