Studies of static and dynamics of surfaces, interfaces, and networks will be
continued. Specific focus will be on the following areas: (1) The role of
entropy in generating elasticity and rigidity in tenuous networks such as
polymers and gels. In particular, two dimensional polymeric sheets present a
challenging and potentially fruitful area of study. The effects of steric and
Coulomb interactions in membranes and other networks will be explored. (2) The
role of dynamically generated nonlinearities on non-equilibrium surfaces.
Formation of cusps during growth in expansion, and deposition processes will be
examined. Similarly the roughness of a surface subject to longitudinal driving
fields will be studied. (3) The pinning and roughening of domain walls and
linear defects due to impurities in magnets.
