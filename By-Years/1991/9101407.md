This project splits into two major portions. The first portion concerns the
study of permutation representations. The principal investigator will classify
all monodromy groups of primitive branched coverings of Riemann surfaces which
are sufficiently large in terms of the genus. The second portion is concerned
with how various properties of matrices and representations over a commutative
ring are affected by extending the base ring. A group is an algebraic object
having a multiplication defined on it. Groups occur naturally in many areas of
mathematics, as well as chemistry and physics. This project is concerned with
classifying monodromy groups.
