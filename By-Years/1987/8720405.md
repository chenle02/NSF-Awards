This award supports the International Geological Correlation Program (IGCP). It
is submitted by the American Geological Institute on behalf of the U.S. National
Committee for IGCP. Established in its present form in 1973, IGCP is a
multidisciplinary scientific program sponsored jointly by the International
Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Its principal goal is to promote
international cooperation in research on global geologic problems, with emphasis
on the nature and sequence of major geologic events, on geologic hazards, and on
energy and mineral resources. Program work is carried out through 49 individual
research projects, 25 of which have U.S. working groups. Another 12 projects
have active U.S. participation through individual scientists.
