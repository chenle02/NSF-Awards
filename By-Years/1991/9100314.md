This is a grant to support travel of 12 graduate students to the 1991 Gordon
Research Conference on the Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies, to be
held March 4-9, 1991, in Oxnard, California. The conference focuses on the
chemistry and physics of organized media, such as normal and reverse micelles,
bilayers, monolayers, polymeric surfactants, nucleic acids, proteins, and
microemulsions. Gordons Conferences provide an unusual opportunity for young
scientists and engineers to obtain a valuable perspective on their fields and
also to meet and talk with major researchers.
