Historical perspective is essential in order to understand the nature of the
relationship between human activity and the environment and to evaluate long-
term productivity of sustainability or impact. The introduction of livestock
into Mexico in the sixteenth century modified the subsistence strategies of the
indigenous population as well as the pre-existing dynamic equilibrium among the
population, production systems, and the environment. This doctoral dissertation
research will document the development of the livestock industry in the
Coixtlahuaca Basin of northwestern Oaxaca, Mexico, and it will examine that
industry's impact on the way of life of the population and on the regional
environment over the last 450 years. This project will combine data from field
observations with information derived from archival research. The investigator
will map current and past land uses and will establish and date depositional
sediment and paleosol sequences along several stream channels. He will review
ethnohistorical sources from which information on land uses, economic
activities, community boundaries, resource availability, droughts, crop
failures, diseases and populations of the area will be extracted, and he will
compare these data with those of the present. Our understanding of long-term
processes relating to environmental and cultural systems remains limited. This
study is unusual in its effort to delineate the man-land relationship in the
past and to carry the relationship through to the present. The research will
contribute to the scientific basis of our understanding of human-environmental
relationships. The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a
promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
