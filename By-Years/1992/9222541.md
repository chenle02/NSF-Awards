The nature of the superconducting vortex lattice in high-Tc materials will be
investigated by a new experimental approach based on scanning probe
microscopies. Low-temperature magnetic force and scanning tunneling microscopes
will be construed to provide direst imaging of the superconducting flux-line
lattice in a wide range of materials of scientific and technological importance.
The technique will potentially yield direct imaging of structure and properties
of the flux lattice, including two- and three-dimensional melting, glassy
behavior, correlated motion, and other topics of modern condensed matter
physics. %%% The behavior of superconductors in magnetic fields is of great
scientific and technological importance. Understanding the physics of these
materials will aid in designing new materials capable of carrying large currents
which will enable major new technologies, devices, motors, etc. The properties
of the superconductors are being investigated by a novel microscope capable of
imaging the magnetic fields in the superconductors. This information is not
available by other techniques and will provide new knowledge about the factors
that determine the current carrying capabilities of the materials.
