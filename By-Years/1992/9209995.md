ABSTRACT This research will assess the impact of the motivational and cognitive
consequences of affect on the processes underlying effective persuasion. From a
processing perspective, persuasion can be modelled as an information processing
sequence that culminates in an attitude judgment. That judgment is determined by
subprocesses that encode, elaborate on, and integrate some subset of the
attitude-relevant information available. From the processing approach, affective
states have cognitive and motivational consequences that influence the extent
and valence of encoding, elaboration; and integration, and thus of persuasion.
Past research in this domain is extended in three directions: (a) the impact of
affective states on reception and integration processes as well as on
elaboration is investigated, (b) specific tests of the role of cognitive and
motivational variables as mediators of the relationship between affective
states, persuasion subprocesses, and persuasion are performed and (c) the
processing perspective is extended to the investigation of the impact of
negative (sad) affect. The first set of proposed experiments assesses the impact
of affect on the nature and extent of reception, and its concomitant effect on
attitude change. Experiments in Set 2 examine the motivational and cognitive
mechanisms through which affect influences elaboration and thus persuasion. The
experiments in Set 3 begin to explore the impact of affective states on
integration processes in attitudinal judgments. This research will add to our
understanding of the impact of affect on persuasion.
