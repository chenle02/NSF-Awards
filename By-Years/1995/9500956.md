DMS-9500956 Vanden-Broeck This proposal is concerned with the study of waves
propagating at the surface of a fluid. An important example is the train of
waves generated by an obstacle (i.e. a ship) moving at a constant velocity at
the surface of water. Existing theories are based on a number of simplifying
assumptions. It is proposed to extend and improve existing theories by removing
some of these assumptions. It is expected that the research will uncover new
families of solutions. In particular it is proposed to study the effect of a
layer of mud on ship waves. The proposed approach consists of replacing the
classical assumption of a rigid bottom by an appropriate boundary condition
derived from lubrication theory. It is also proposed to calculate periodic and
solitary waves in presence of vorticity and surface tension. Previous and
preliminary calculations have shown that there are many different families of
solutions. It is intended to study them further and to calculate numerically the
interaction between solitary waves.
