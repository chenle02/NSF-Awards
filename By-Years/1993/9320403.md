9320403 Sparke Galaxies are widely believed to have unseen 'dark' halos
containing much of the mass of the system. The halo is more extended than the
luminous material, and its mass distribution is best probed by studying the
outermost orbits of stars and gas. Models for warped disks in spiral galaxies,
and for polar rings around SO galaxies, show that these can be understood as
self- gravitating structures in the potential of the massive halo. The form
expected for the warp or the polar ring, and velocities of orbits within these
structures, depend on how mass is distributed within the unseen halo: on the
central concentration, on the flattening normal to the disk plane, on whether it
is significantly triaxial. Support will be provided both for theoretical
modeling and observations. Theoretical work on warps will address the effect of
a galactic bulge, warps with different azimuthal dependences, and the eventual
damping of warps due to interaction with the halo. Optical and HI observations
of warped systems will also be made. Dynamical modeling of polar rings will
concentrate on the effect of triaxiality, and on detailed models for particular
observed systems to establish parameters; the observational program includes
high-resolution HI mapping of the rings, radio surveys, and optical imaging and
spectroscopy
