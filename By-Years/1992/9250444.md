This project introduces a laboratory component to an existing Neurobiology
course and adds computer capability to promote independent student projects in a
current Animal Physiology course. The equipment added includes Macintosh IIsi
computers, a data acquisition and analysis system (MacLab), and supporting
hardware and software. The Neurobiology course focuses on the medicinal leech
and covers such techniques as intracellular recording with microelectrodes,
voltage clamp measurements of ionic currents, and computer-assisted data
acquisition and analysis. Equipment includes anti-vibration tabletops, Leitz and
Huxley micromanipulator, A-M Systems intracellular amplifiers, an Axoclamp
voltage clamp amplifier, and a Flaming- Brown microelectrode puller. In both
laboratories students, working in teams of three, first learn a basic technique
or principle and then formulate and test their own related hypothesis either by
designing a mini-independent research project or redesigning the parameters for
the basic laboratory.
