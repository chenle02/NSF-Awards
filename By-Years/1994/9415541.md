Duke University requests funds to enhance the National Phytotron. To obtain
fundamental understanding and to develop predictive models of the processes that
mediate plant activities and exchanges requires access to sophisticated
controlled environment conditions. The Phytotron, an NSF-supported national
research facility established in 1968, consists of 40 artificially lighted CE
growth chambers and 6 glasshouses that provide more than 477 M2 of controlled
environmental space for advanced research in environmental plant biology. The
Phytotron hosts students, postdoctoral scientists, and senior scientists, most
of whom are off - campus users. The CE units are used to reproduce different
types of environments -- ranging from the arctic to the desert to the tropics.
This allows researchers to have precise control over environmental conditions,
e.g., air temperature, irradiance, carbon dioxide, relative humidity, and
nutrient concentration, thereby allowing for research on the complex
interactions between plants and their environment, which is virtually impossible
to do under natur al uncontrolled field conditions. This proposal would provide
for new monitoring equipment for the CE units, new growth chambers to meet newer
demands for environmental controls, upgraded glasshouse materials and control
units, and salaries for technical and oversight needs. The continued support of
the National Phytotron enhances NSF s investment in ecological research,
including graduate and postgraduate education, and will allow the National
Phytotron to remain one of the most important centers for controlled environment
research in ecology in the United States.
