Disproportionately few Native Americans obtain baccalaureate science degrees and
become employed as scientists. A major reason for the scarcity of Native
Americans with baccalaureate science degrees is the relatively low number of
Native American science majors at tribal colleges. The project goal is to
increase the number of Turtle Mountain Community College students majoring in
science, and to produce attractive, effective modular materials in
interdisciplinary science that can and will be used at other tribal colleges.
The projects objectives are to enhance science laboratories with: multimedia
materials, materials with increased cultural content, greater emphasis on local
natural resources, and improved pedagogical design, particularly increased
cooperative learning. This project will design a module on fish species
composition, another on fish life histories, and a third on effects of water
quality on fish. Turtle Mountain fish species will be the focus of all modules.
In each module, students will perform field exercises (in local lakes) and
laboratory exercises in cooperative groups. Students will learn to pronounce the
Ojibwa an Metis names for each fish and learn Ojibwa legends about fish. The
final product will be a CD-ROM-based interactive program for beginning biology,
chemistry, ecology, language, and wildlife courses. Students and an external
evaluator will evaluate the curriculum. The design of the field and laboratory
exercises will be evaluated and baseline data will be collected. The results and
products of this work will be disseminated using presentations at professional
meetings, mailings to other tribal colleges, and the assistance of the American
Indian Higher Education Consortium AIHEC.
