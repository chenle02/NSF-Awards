9512748 Frantziskonis (PI) Meisner (co-PI) This award supports a 12 month Japan
Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. George
Franziskonis (PI) and Mark Meisner (co-PI) , Department of Civil Engineering and
Engineering Mechanics, University of Arizona to complete research at Saitama
University, Saitama, Japan. Drs. Franziskonis and Meisner will work with
Professor Eiichiro Tsuchida, professor in the Department of Engineering at
Saitama University, on a research project entitled, "Mechanics of Failure in
Metal Matrix Composites." The proposed research will consist of basic research
to determine the fundamental factors governing the reliability of continuous
fiber, metal matrix composites in aggressive, high temperature environments.
Analysis will focus on certain metal matrix composites containing ductile
metallic fiber-matrix interface layers. The principal modeled subject materials
will be various phases blended titanium aluminide matrices reinforced with
continuous fibers. Variables such as having ductile interface layers of
refractory or noble metals will be modeled and investigated. The topics being
investigated are currently relevant to the scientific community and the benefits
to be obtained from collaborative research valuable. The Experimental Center for
Engineering Materials at Saitama University and the Composite and Heterogeneous
Materials Center at the University of Arizona are both excellent research
facilities and their cooperation on this project -- considered by both parties
to be the initial stage of a long term partnership - - will likely yield results
for both the United States and Japan as well as the international scientific
community as a whole. ***
