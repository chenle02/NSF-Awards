The Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University will use this award from
the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a mass
spectrometer system. The areas of chemical research that will enhance by the
acquisition include the following: 1) Diels - Alder Chemistry of Activated
Cyclobutenes, 2) Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products and Molecules of
Biomedical Interest, 3) Organic Molecule Fragmentations on the Surfaces of Nano-
scale Metal Oxide Particles, 4) Performance of SMAD Catalysts Organic Precursors
to Carbon Monosulfide (CS), 5) p-Phenylenediimido-Bridged Dimers and Polymers. A
New Class of Conjugated Inorganic Systems, and 6) Toward a Hydrocarbon
Ferromagnet: Polyarylmethyls. Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe
intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic molecules. When combined with a
high performance liquid chromatograph, the resulting system affords the chemist
one of the most powerful tools available for the separation and characterization
of compounds. The acquisition of a mass spectrometer is essential for the
prosecution of frontier research in many fields of chemistry.
