PI: Williams, Brian The Akron Public Qchools CPMSA project is intended to
improve the achievement of all students in mathematics and science and to
significantly increase the number of African American students who are prepared
for university studies in mathematics, science and related fields. Recognizing
that the key to student achievement is an excellent teaching force, the project
will concentrate on improving the instructional strategies of all teachers with
emphases on content training for elementary teachers and secondary mathematics
and science teachers. This initiative is based on the understanding that
systemic reform- in a large urban setting must be accomplished building by
building and cannot be superimposed on a staff. A leadership team from each
school, including parents and administrators, will be trained to conduct action
research aimed at improving student achievement in mathematics and science. The
plan takes advantage of extensive state and locally funded initiatives to 1
enhance the use of technology to improve teaching and learning. This project
will attempt to overcome the barriers to minority achievement and obstacles
presented by poverty by providing a system of student support including summer
institutes and career exploration, Saturday enrichment programs, facilitated
peer support, individual tutoring, exposure to real-world applications of math
and science and increased parental involvement.
