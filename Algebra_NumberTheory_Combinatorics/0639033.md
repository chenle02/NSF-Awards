The investigator will study two different intersection theories in algebraic
geometry: the arithmetic Chow rings of varieties defined over the integers and
the quantum cohomology rings of complex manifolds. The varieties considered are
homogeneous spaces of Lie groups, and the goal is to understand the arithmetic
and quantum Schubert calculus. This allows one to effectively compute numerical
invariants such as heights, on the one hand, and Gromov-Witten invariants, on
the other. A further aim is to answer related questions about the combinatorics
of modern Schubert calculus and the polynomials which represent degeneracy loci
of vector bundles.

The study of the symmetries observed in geometric objects has been a meeting
point of mathematics and physics for a long time. The many experiments and
computations made in the 19th century eventually led to the cohomology and
intersection theories of 20th century mathematics, which were applied to solve
important open problems in both fields. At present, we face a similar situation
in modern number theory and string theory, and computations of concrete examples
are crucial to guide our intuition and to better understand the general
theories. The investigator studies two new intersection theories, Arakelov
theory and quantum cohomology, in many examples which are good testing grounds
for both of them. The potential applications are a better understanding of
Diophantine equations and approximation, used in coding theory and theoretical
computer science, and the enumerative geometry of curves, related to classical
algebraic geometry and quantum field theory in physics.
