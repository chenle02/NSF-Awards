The objective of this project is the development of robust methods for enhancing
speech in real-world noisy environments. A neural network approach is developed
for time-domain enhancement. The availability of only the noisy signal is
assumed, in contrast to previous neural network approaches. Effectively, a
sequence of neural networks is trained on the specific noisy speech signal,
resulting in a nonstationary model that can be used to remove noise from the
given signal. Two related frameworks are developed: (1) a neural state-space
approach based on nonlinear extensions to Kalman filter theory and (2) a direct
neural mapping from noisy speech to enhanced speech. This research represents
fundamental enabling technology for interactive systems requiring robust speech
communications. More traditional methods are often effective under ideal
situations, but tend to degrade for real world nonstationary noise sources.
