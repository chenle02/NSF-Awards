This career advancement award supports mathematical research in the field of
iterative methods for large systems of equations arising in image processing.
Application to image processing and medical imaging is planned. The central
problem of image restoration is the estimation of the original image, given a
version of the image degraded by noise and blur. Work will be done developing
and analyzing new fast algorithms for the computation of the estimated image.
Two different approaches to image restoration predominate, (i) algebraic
restoration, viewed as a linear, possibly ill-conditioned, system of equations
and (ii) stochastic restoration where one regards the problem of estimating
vectors subject to random disturbances. Numerical methods for both approaches
will be developed. Either approach yields linear systems of equations that have
a structure that can be used in the development and analysis of efficient
algorithms for image restoration. The structure depends on the assumptions made
on the image and the noise. The matrices in these systems are typically quite
large. The computational work, even with efficient methods, is demanding. Since
many applications require real-time image restoration, the development of
algorithms for parallel computers is important. Work done on this project
focuses on the development of iterative methods that lend themselves will to
implementation on multiprocessors.
