This award provides continuing support for the study of selective binding of oxo
metal cations by Dr. Kenneth N. Raymond of the Department of Chemistry,
University of California, Berkeley. Shape selective ligands for cations such as
osmyl and vanadyl will be developed. These ligands will be designed to stabilize
the high oxidation state metal center through normal coordinate binding, while
at the same time incorporating hydrogen bond donors for interaction with the oxo
cation. Preliminary results show that the hydrogen bonding interaction can be
significant if carefully oriented, rigid ligands can be developed. Ligands to be
investigated include aminocarboxylates, catechol amides, catechol phenols and
amidates. The resulting compounds will be characterized by crystal structure
analysis, vibrational spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and solution
thermodynamics studies. Both the specificity and complexing ability of the
ligands will be tested. %%% The goal of this project is to develop effective and
selective agents for scavenging metal oxo cations. A new approach involving the
positioning of hydrogen atoms on the complexing agent in such a way as to bind
to the oxo group associated with the metal will be tried. The research has
implications for separation methodology, including that for members of the
lanthanide and actinide families which are found in radioactive waste.
