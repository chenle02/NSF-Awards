Covert channels are channels not intended for information transfer. A
subliminal channel allows one to hide a secret message inside an authenticator.
An abuse enables a participant to us a cryptosystem for a different purpose than
intended. In this project, techniques guaranteeing that such abuses are
impossible are being studied. The main open problems addressed are: (1) can
unconditionally secure authentication schemes be made subliminal- free, and
generally, which systems can be made abuse-free; (2)which non-trivial systems
can be made abuse-free when using only a passive warden; (3) can the results be
extended to analog and digital covert channels?
