Systems with feedback control are ubiquitous components of many modern devices,
industrial processes, and scientific experiments. However, outside the realm of
the control engineer there is little understanding of the power available and
the limitations incurred when control is imposed on free systems. Even less
generally appreciated are the artifacts generated when computers are improperly
employed. This project is designed to improve the teaching of linear control
theory and, in particular, the teaching of the methods of direct digital control
by computers. Improved simulation methods will be introduced to upgrade the
instruction regarding the theoretical aspects of control strategies. An expanded
laboratory course will be established in which students will be able to
experiment with the control strategies that they have developed. The equipment
employed will be that which is now coming into widespread use both in industry
and in scientific laboratories. The methods of networking and concurrent
programming will be taught. The audience for the course will be undergraduate
physics, chemistry, and computer science majors, and a few engineers from local
industries. The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.
