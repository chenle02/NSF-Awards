This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I SBIR project will demonstrate
the feasibility of a MEMS-based measurement device, capable of measuring the
growth and reproduction of individual mammalian cells and micro-organisms such
as bacteria in fluid environments. The device is based on a suspended
microchannel resonator (SMR), a microfabricated vibrating beam which measures
minute changes in mass based on shifts in the resonant frequency of the
vibrating beam. If successful, the device is capable of femtogram (10-15 gram)
resolution, and can therefore measure the growth of individual cells rapidly,
before they undergo mitosis. Because of its high resolution, the device can be
used to measure the susceptibility of the organism to various therapeutic
compounds, such as antibiotics, by detecting changes in the growth rate
directly, in a matter of minutes, without having to wait for the culturing of
colonies of such cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of
this project is that it can be used in diverse applications in medicine and
biomedical research, such as drug susceptibility and pathogen diagnosis
technique. Currently, the diagnosis of many infectious diseases is accomplished
by culturing a sample of the suspect pathogen, staining the sample and observing
the sample under a microscope. For slow growing bacteria such as Mycobacteria
tuberculosis (TB), the necessity of waiting 4-6 weeks for culturing and
diagnosis delays the treatment, furthering the spread of disease, and
exacerbating the growing threat of drug-resistant strains. If successful, the
device is targeted to have the capability of speeding the TB diagnosis and
treatment to hours, rather than weeks, by directly identifying the pathogen and
the optimum course of treatment to be administered to the infected individual.
The technique has broad applications including directly assessing antibiotic
compounds, drug promoters and inhibitors, cancer treatments as well as immune
and allergic responses.
