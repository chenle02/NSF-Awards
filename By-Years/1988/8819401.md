The longterm goal of this work is to elucidate the mechanistic basis and
regulation of an antagonistic interaction between Oomycete fungi and a strain of
Bacillus cereus. A strain of B. cereus has been identified that prevents
infection of seedlings by a variety of Oomycete fungi. The ability to prevent
infection is associated with a low molecular weight, extracellular peptide. The
objectives of the proposed research are to purify the antifungal peptide,
determine its structure, begin to determine its mode of action on the fungus,
and to identify the genes required for its biosynthesis. The genetic analysis
will involve identification of transposon mutants that lack antifungal activity,
and cloning of the wild-type genes that restore activity to the mutants. An
alternative approach to identify the appropriate genetic sequence will be to
shot-gun clone DNA from the antifungal strain of B. cereus into either E. coli
or B. subtilis, and identify the desired recipients by screening for antifungal
activity. Identification of the genes involved in production of the antifungal
agent will provide the basis for elucidating the pathway and regulation of its
biosynthesis. The results of this research will provide important basic
information about biochemical mechanisms involved in plant- microbe
interactions. This fundamental information may, in the future, be useful in
developing ecologically sound methods for protection of plants from fungal
pathogens.
