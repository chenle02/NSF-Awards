Professor Michael Sipser of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be
principal lectuter at an NSF-CBMS Regional Conference to be held at the
University of Chicago, on June 25-30, 1989. The lectures will deal with circuit
complexity. Substantial mathematical problems are present in this field with
applications to some of the deepest questions in theoretical computer science,
e.g., the P=NP problem.
