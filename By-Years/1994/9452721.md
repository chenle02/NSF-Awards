strategies to accomplish systemic educational reform and economic development in
a region characterized by high poverty and lack of resources. The supervisory
Steering Committee will establish Task Forces which will conduct a series of
town meetings to facilitate local and regional partnerships, collect and analyze
baseline data, and provide recommendations to the Steering Committee, for the
development of an integrated plan for sustainable education reform throughout
the region. The Steering Committee will hold a series of four area conferences,
to inform and include local representatives in the planning and development
process.
