To address the need for economic diversification and the expansion of a well-
educated, highly-skilled technology workforce, the Community College of Southern
Nevada plans the establishment of an ATE Regional Center for Information and
Telecommunications Technology. A Technology Education Alliance advisory board
organizes the development of a strategic plan to build upon investments already
made by the State of Nevada. The plan pulls together business, economic
development, and secondary and postsecondary schools to foster relationships to
launch an effective educational system for producing workers highly-qualified
for the workforce. The Alliance increases industry input into higher education
programs, coordinating an analysis of core competencies needed for emerging
technologies. Plans are made for academic support services to increase the
recruitment and retention of women and other groups underrepresented in
technological education.
