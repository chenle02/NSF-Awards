A grant has been awarded to the University of Hawaii's Institute of Marine
Biology (HIMB), under the direction of Dr. Jo-Ann Leong, to improve the HIMB's
linkage to the internet, and therefore the larger research community. Because of
its location on a small island off Oahu, HIMB must negotiate daily with issues
of transportation and communication. Communication links with other members of
the research community both on the main campuses at the University of Hawaii in
Manoa and Hilo as well as our collaborators on the mainland United States and
the international community are critical to the success of the institute, its
faculty and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This grant will help to improve
HIMB data management and communication systems and provide vastly improved
electronic communications. Gigabit microwave dishes, provided by the
manufacturer, will soon connect HIMB to the University of Hawaii communications
system via Windward Community College. This grant will provide high speed
switches and routers on HIMB and allow the institute to take full advantage of
the new high speed microwave connection to the internet. A new server will
enhance HIMB's data management and reduce software costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The upgraded communications system will not only enhance HIMB's ability to
communicate with colleague and collaborators the world over, but it will allow
the high speed data transfer which is necessary for bioinformatics and the
broadband communication needed for real time transmission of video. This NSF
grant will HIMB to take full advantage of the opportunity created by the
donation of the high speed microwave radios.&lt;br/&gt;
