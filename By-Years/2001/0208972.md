The GRIDLOCK hypothesis is that use of a globally specified and locally
interpreted policy language for specification of access-control policy can
provide a new, unified approach to securing network applications. In particular,
this approach can be used to specify network access-control policies and host
access-control policies in combination to provide "virtual private services."
GRIDLOCK simultaneously provides more security to applications, greater
scalability, and unification of network access control and host access control.
Policies are specified in a new policy-expression language, modeled on the
KeyNote trust-management language. This design supports compliance checking,
with which credentials provided by a client can be validated to provide access
to a resource. The applicability of this layer-crossing approach to multiple
virtual private services is investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research
focuses on the development of formal semantics for the unified access-control
policy, as well as a rigorous experimental investigation, using multiple example
applications. The expected results include both the new policy-expression
language and the demonstration that a scalable access-control model for
networked applications is practical.
