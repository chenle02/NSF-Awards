This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project will develop a
fully integrated process for applying a well-bonded, bioactive coating to the
stem of an orthopedic hip implant by a novel Cold Gas Dynamic Spray (CGDS), or
Hyperkinetic Deposition process. The new process is a potential major advance in
the state-of-the-art for surface modification of medical implants. The medical
community hitherto has relied primarily on plasma spraying to activate implant
surfaces. Plasma spraying is a cost-effective means of applying the coating
material but is far from ideal. In particular, the high temperatures experienced
by the hydroxyapatite feed powder during plasma spraying can seriously degrade
its compositional integrity and thus its bioactive properties. The cold spray
process eliminates this problem, and enables, for the first time, high-surface-
area nanostructured hydroxyapatite powder to be incorporated into the implant
surface without sacrificing its intrinsic bioactivity. As an added benefit the
implant surface is left in a state of compression, which should extend the
service life of the implant by eliminating the possibility of surface cracking
caused by low-cycle fatigue.

The commercial applications for this project will be to improve the life of
implants.
