In order to integrate manufacturing-related courses into mechanical engineering,
a comprehensive curriculum restructuring and laboratory development plan has
been generated. A crucial element of this plan is establishing an Advanced
Manufacturing Laboratory, consisting of a turn-key GEM cell, a SCARA robot, a
machine vision system, and four CNC machines.
