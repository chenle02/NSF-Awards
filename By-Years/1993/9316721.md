9316721 Altaner This award will support collaborative research between Stephen
Altaner, University of Illinois, and Antonio Pozzuoli of the University of
Naples, Italy. The proposed research has two general objectives: 1) Improved
understanding of the mechanism of the smectite to illite reaction through study
of a suite of illite- and smectite-bearing samples from Ponza island, Italy, and
2) assessment of the nature of hydrothermal alteration of the Green Tuff and
overlying breccia of Ischia (Italy), designed to lead to improved evaluation of
volcanic risk on Ischia. Professor Pozzuoli is a specialist in the mineralogy
and petrology of clay minerals, particularly those of the Ponza bentonite. He
and his colleagues are also experts in the geology of Ponza and Ischia, critical
to the collection of appropriate samples. Professor Altaner and his colleagues
bring to the collaboration expertise and facilities for integrated state-of-
the-art analyses of geologic samples, including K/Ar dating, NMR, oxygen isotope
geochemistry, XRD, and TEM analyses. ***
