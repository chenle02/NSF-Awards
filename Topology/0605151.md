One of the central goals in the geometric theory of 3-manifolds is understand
the connection between the topological, combinatorial, and geometric properties
of 3-manifolds. It is important to have explicit, quantitative information about
a geometric structure and to understand how it is connected with the
combinatorial and topological properties of the manifold. The model manifolds
constructed by Minsky and used in the solution of the Ending Lamination
Conjecture in Kleinian groups are determined by combinatorial data and reflect
geometric properties of the mapping class group. These models should be useful
in studying closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. On the other hand, techniques that
have been successful in studying closed manifolds, like hyperbolic Dehn surgery,
deformation theory, and ideal triangulations should help provide further
refinements in our understanding of Kleinian groups. The goal of this project is
to combine the analytic and geometric techniques developed over the last several
years by the PI and his collaborators with some of the new ideas that have
emerged during the recent solutions of major conjectures in Kleinian groups.

The study of 3-dimensional manifolds combines geometric, algebraic, and analytic
tools. It can be a very approachable subject because the objects of study
include things like knots that are easy to describe and visualize geometrically.
Even the deeper properties, like hyperbolic structures, can be presented in an
inviting manner with current graphical capabilities. On the other hand,
understanding knots and 3-manifolds can have significant consequencesin other
areas of mathematics and even in physics and biochemistry.
