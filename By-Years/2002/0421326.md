Functional Genomics of Early Events in Ectomycorrhizal Symbiosis: A fungal
Perspective&lt;br/&gt;Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonize roots and establish
beneficial relationships with a wide variety of tree species. These fungi extend
the absorptive capabilities of the root system, improve the host plant's
abilities to tolerate biological and environmental stresses and support plant
health under conditions of nutritional deficiency. The dynamic signaling and
cross-talk events and genes involved during the pre-infection stage, before the
physical contact is established between the fungus and the plant host, determine
the direction and ultimate success of the formation of ectomycorrhizal
association. The PI's lab has identified and well characterized an interaction-
specific and signaling related LbRAS gene and also identified expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) coding for GTPases and receptor kinases from the ectomycorrhizal
fungus Laccaria bicolor. The PI will use these genes and yeast two-hybrid
interactions to characterize the genes and begin to unravel signaling pathways
involved in the establishment and maintenance of ectomycorrhiza by L. bicolor.
This project also involves development of new tools for the functional genomic
studies of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer
into L.bicolor. This work provides educational and research-training
opportunities for both undergraduate and postdoctoral students to integrate
various functional genomic approaches and develop tools to study a very
important yet understudied beneficial interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
