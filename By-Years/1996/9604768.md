Two-photon excitation, using a red to infrared wavelength femtosecond laser, is
a newly-developed technique that overcomes some of the problematic features of
conventional confocal laser scanning microscopy. This is joint proposal by a
group of 17 developmental and cell biologists at UCSD to acquire a two-photon
laser scanning microscope (TPLSM) for monitoring the dynamics of cellular and
subcellular events in living cells and organisms.
