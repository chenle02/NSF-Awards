9733410 Shin Protein recognition of specific sequences of duplex DNA is an
essential step in numerous biological processes. Understanding the determinants
of this binding specificity is one of the central challenges in the study of
protein-DNA interactions. Examination of how a dimer of alpha-helices interacts
with short DNA duplexes promises to be a tractable, informative strategy to
dissect the complex mechanism employed by full proteins. To this end, an alpha-
helical protein dimer has been synthesized and attached to a column that is
utilized to select specific binding sites from a random DNA library.
Quantitative information about selected protein-DNA complexes will be gained
through a multi-pronged approach involving thermodynamic, kinetic, and
structural analyses in conjunction with computational modeling. This
quantitative information about alpha-helix recognition of the major groove will
provide a tool for prediction and design of bZIP-based proteins that bind to
specific DNA sequences. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve a deeper quantitative
understanding of the energetics of bZIP-DNA complexation, and to propel further
research into the global field of understanding specificity in protein-DNA
interactions, especially those involving larger, more complicated systems.
