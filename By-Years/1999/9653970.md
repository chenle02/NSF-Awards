This is a collaborative effort among the two-and four-year public and
independent colleges in Oregon to promote reform in the teaching and learning of
mathematics and the sciences in the preparation of teachers of science and
mathematics for grades K - 12. The project will strengthen the curriculum, field
and other out-of-class experiences , and selected science, mathematics and
education courses so as to reflect current research on teaching and learning and
to encourage cross disciplinary conversation. Science, mathematics, and
education courses will be designed to be consistent with NCTM and Science
Standards and will be developed within the context of improving the
institutions' program for prospective teachers. The project will also stress
recruitment and retention of promising students in the teaching profession, with
particular attention to students from underrepresented groups. Further, the
project will establish mechanisms to enable the science, mathematics and
engineering faculty and mentor teachers to learn about and implement new
techniques in pedagogy.
