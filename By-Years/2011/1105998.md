****Technical Abstract****

The goal of this project is to explore the coupling of superconductivity into
the conducting surface modes of Topological Insulators (TI) such as Bi2Te3,
Bi2Se3, and other related compounds. By making samples with superconducting
electrodes separated by the TI, the behavior of superconducting pairs in the
spin-orbit correlated surface state can be studied. Such two dimensional systems
have been predicted to exhibit p-wave superconductivity and have vortex cores
that contain bound Majorana Fermion states, which may form the basis for
topologically protected qubits. The samples are fabricated in two coupled
molecular beam epitaxy systems, one specializing in the growth of the TI
material and the other dedicated to the growth of niobium films. Since the
sample remains under ultra-high vacuum conditions during the growth of all
layers, the interface is free of contaminants and very transparent junctions
between the two materials are obtained. Students working on this project are
trained in advanced materials synthesis, nanoscale device fabrication, and low
temperature measurement techniques. This provides them with a broad technical
background that is useful for work in many areas of materials science and
technology.

****Nontechnical Abstract****

A Topological Insulator (TI) is a new kind of material in which the bulk of a
sample is not conducting, but a two dimensional layer on its surface is.
Moreover, the conducting surface state is made up of only half of the electrons
that a normal conductor has - for an electron with a given momentum, only one
spin is present. When superconducting pairs are introduced in such a 2D system
with momentum-spin correlations, a new kind of state has been predicted to
emerge, a so-called Majorana Fermion (MF). According to theory, this state can
be used to construct a long-lived qubit, a quantum bit that can be processed by
a quantum circuit that is also topologically protected from decoherence. To
study this effect, samples of TIs are made using ultra high vacuum deposition
technology. Then superconducting films are deposited on top to introduce
superconductivity into the surface modes. Devices are made using nanoscale
lithography and advanced etching technology, and they are measured at low
temperatures to search for MFs. The students working on this project receive
training in a wide range of advanced science and technology preparing them well
for developing technologies of the future.
