In 1977 the National Science Foundation established the National Research and
Resource Facility for Submicron Structures (NRRFSS) at Cornell University.
During the past decade, this national facility has made advance resources for
microfabrication available to researchers from universities, industry and
federal laboratories across the nation. Several hundred research programs from
ten different fields of science and engineering have utilized the submicron
facility, more than fulfilling the vision expressed by the founders at several
workshops between 1976 and 1978. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the
NRRFSS it is appropriate to hold a symposium both commemorating the
accomplishments in microscience and technology made possible by the NRRFSS and
looking forward to the next decade of research in small structures. Whereas
submicron dimensions were the focus of research in the past decade,
nanofabrication, that is concentrating on dimensions less than a tenth of a
micrometer, will be the focus of the next decade. Distinguished researchers from
academia and industry will assess the opportunities made possible by
nanofabrication in many fields of science and technology. The day-long symposium
will set forth a vision for the future of nanofabrication research and the
partnership of universities, industry and federal agencies in fulfilling that
vision.
