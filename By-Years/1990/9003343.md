Professor Packer will study two topics under the general heading of twisted
crossed product C* algebras: (i) the topological structure of the primitive
ideal space of twisted group C* algebras related to nilpotent groups, and (ii)
K- theoretic invariants for certain twisted crossed product C* algebras. The
notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear
transformations on a space. These transformations can also be thought of as
having values in the states of the space, and the property of this family which
is responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by
transformations whose values in these states are real numbers. The fact that
these objects appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make
them important to study.
