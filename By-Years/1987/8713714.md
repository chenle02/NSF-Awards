The Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) program was established in FY
1987 to provide substantial resources to upgrade the research capabilities of
the strongest and most productive predominantly minority institutions. This
planning grant project lays the foundation for a plan that will increase the
institution's quality of research and research-related training. Specifically,
support for this project will permit the establishment of an MRCE advisory
committee of scientists and engineers, local leaders, and industrial
representatives who will assist the institution in evaluating its current and
future potential for performing meritorious research during the next five years.
Morgan State University will conduct assessments to strengthen its relatively
new School of Engineering. The institution plans to address the problems of
enlarging the pool of minority engineers and strengthening the capability of
those students who choose to study engineering as a career. This institution has
the facilities and personnel to do a comprehensive planning study. The
Foundation has supported this project because the proposed work can lead to an
increase in the participation of minorities in science and engineering.
