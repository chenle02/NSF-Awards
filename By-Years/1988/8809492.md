This research aims at developing an extensive collection of statistical
estimates and hypotheses testing procedures for data generated by the negative
binomial distribution. The types of estimates and testing procedures to be
developed are, for the most part, analogous to those that exist for data
generated by a normal distribution. This work is made possible by the existence
of inexpensive computational power. This research will produce the statistical
methodology appropriate for analyzing many types of "counting" data including,
for example, automobile accidents, communication failures, and a changing
population's size. The standard practice for analyzing these data is to use
mathematical approximations that are only valid as the number of items studied
goes to infinity. The impact of this research will be to provide a collection of
accurate statistical tools so that these approximations need not be relied upon.
