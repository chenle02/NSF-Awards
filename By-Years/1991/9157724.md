This project is funded by a Presidential Young Investigator award, and involves
fundamental research studies of the mechanism and kinetic behavior of oxygen
diffusion from thin film encapsulants into gallium arsenide. The effect of
substrate dopant concentration and the behavior of buried impurity profiles and
defect structures exposed to surface oxidation will also be considered. Matching
funds from industry, when secured by the principal investigator, will be applied
to a related study of spatially resolved current-voltent measurements of
Schottky barriers using a scanning tunneling microscope. This work on
fundamental microelectronic materials issues is important for improving our
general understanding of microscopic features of synthesis and processing of
materials and is of vital importance to the electronics industry.
