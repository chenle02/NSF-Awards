This dissertation research project investigates the use of immigrant labor in
the information technology industry, an industry that is recruiting foreign
temporary workers in increasingly large numbers. Ethnographic research using
interviews, participant-observation, and archival techniques will be conducted
over the course of 12 months in Dublin, Ireland, the largest software-exporting
region in the world. The main objective is to construct a model of how rapid
technological change, the employment policies of IT firms and the career related
attitudes of IT professionals are contributing to an intensification of labor
migration in the industry. This investigation will offer significant new
insights into processes within the IT industry that create the supply of and
demand for immigrant workers. This knowledge can be used to inform decision
making about future policies for managing the immigration of IT professionals.
In addition, by documenting the ways that careers in the IT industry are
changing as the pace of technological change quickens and firms reorganize
around more flexible forms of production, the knowledge gained from this project
can assist policymakers in evaluating future prospects for careers in an
industry that will provide many of the jobs of the 21St century.
