A two year project to develop and implement two introductory lab courses in
psychology is proposed as a vehicle for improving scientific and technological
literacy and for attracting students to science careers. The project includes
the development of twenty lab exercises, which facilitate development of
scientific thinking and demonstrate the process of science in the context of
demonstrable psychological phenomena. In the second year the labs will be
implemented, and a laboratory manual produced.
