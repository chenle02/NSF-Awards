This grant is a continuation of the Research Experiences For Undergraduates
site that was run at Oregon State last summer. Although the Principal
Investigator's plan to be flexible, they have also established some carefully
defined research projects for the students. They will work individually or as
teams on projects involving computer exploration of number theory, numerical and
population dynamics, percolation models, and other similar projects. The
projects are intended to introduce participants to methods of mathematical
research and to emphasize the use of experimentation, computation, and teamwork
as means of attacking complex problems. They also seek to give participants
tools which are playing increasingly important roles in modern mathematics.
Participants will work closely with the principal investigator, the co-principal
investigator, a faculty associate and other members of the research staff. They
will be exposed to diverse areas of mathematics through a seminar and special
events. In particular a mathematician and educator form the University of Oregon
will give a series of lectures, and participants will have the opportunity to
attend appropriate seminars and lectures on campus.
