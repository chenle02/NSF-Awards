Laboratory facilities will be upgraded to provide students with laboratory
experiences which will introduce them to state-of-the-art technology in the
areas of biochemistry, cell biology, and cell physiology. The acquisition of a
high speed refrigerated centrifuge and other equipment needed to investigate
contemporary techniques in protein and DNA analysis, will allow students to
investigate this important area of biology. The acquired skills will give them
more choice in selection of independent research projects, and will help female
students to gain skills and confidence to continue their studies and/or be
competitive for employment in laboratories where such instrumentation is used.
The college will provide 50% matching funds.
