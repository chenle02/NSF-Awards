The productivity and well-being of the American workforce is much affected by
hostile work environments that encourage or actually constitute sexual
harassment. At the same time, suits from disgruntled employees who allege sexual
harassment against firms that have not engaged in that illegal behavior can
threaten profitability, productivity, and efficiency. The legal standards used
to judge what constitutes a hostile work environment remain controversial. This
study will examine the relationship between national and organizational legal
cultures and the construction of sexual harassment law within organizations. It
will be built upon three detailed case studies of domestic and multinational
organizations spanning the United States and Austria. It will bring to
comparative sociolegal studies a consideration of the impact of international
legal environments that has been lacking in previous studies of the ability of
organizations to integrate law into their work. The project will promote
understanding of how individuals interpret and use sexual harassment law within
t he contexts of their organizations.
