The subject of symplectic topology goes back to Poincare's work on celestial
mechanics. The first result in this area was the so-called "Poincare's geometric
theorem," proved some twenty years later. Recent progress in symplectic topology
started in the early 1980's with proofs of some of Arnold's conjectures which
had remained unresolved for twenty years. Major developments have occurred in
the last several years; modern symplectic topology is intimately linked with
Morse theory of functionals unbounded from above and below, the theory of
pseudo- holomorphic curves in almost-complex manifolds, the theory of
instantons, low-dimensional topology and knot theory. This project will support
the Conference on Symplectic Topology to be held from April 9-11, 1992 at the
University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The conference will focus on recent
developments and will represent different approaches to the problems of
symplectic topology and provide an opportunity to exchange ideas on unresolved
problems.
