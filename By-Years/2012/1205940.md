Searches for evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model can be addressed
through direct searches at the Energy Frontier at High Energy Colliding Beam
Facilities such as the LHC and through a complementary technique of indirect
searches at the Intensity Frontier, in experimental measurements of very-rare
decay modes of known particles. This project focuses on continued research with
the NA62 experiment at CERN, which is a measurement of the rare decay of the
charge K meson through the process, K+ -&gt; pi+ nu nubar. This decay is well-
predicted in the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and a precision
experimental measurement of the actual rate could provide evidence for new
physics, if the observed rate differs significantly from the theoretical
prediction. The experimental challenge is occasioned by the very small branching
fraction predicted by the Standard Model for this decay mode of 0.85 x 10-10.
Despite its small size, the GMU group is engaged in all aspects of NA62, with
responsibilities in event trigger logic, trigger hardware and front-end
electronics communication, slow controls, CEDAR (a special differential
Cherenkov counter for the detection of kaons in the beam line, for which GMU has
made significant contributions) and Muon Veto hardware
components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The George Mason group is making an impressive
effort in broadening the participation in fundamental research at the intensity
frontier, through its participation in QuarkNet and through a separate NSF IRES
(International Research Experience for Students) grant that brings up to five
undergraduates to CERN each summer, with applicants selected from a consortium
of universities and colleges in the Washington DC Metropolitan Area.
