Union College has established a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
Scholarship program for students with demonstrated need in these disciplines
over a four-year period. A total of 29 students over two years are selected be
selected from a freshman pool meeting the financial criteria, with further
selection based on interest in the major and academic promise. Financially
disadvantaged, but academically talented students, from under-represented groups
and women (CS and Engineering) are given special consideration. The underlying
goal enhances students training in these fields so that more students graduate
with a background in one of these disciplines.

In achieving these goals, a combination of efforts that extend and build upon
existing programs and services (Academic Opportunity Program, Career Development
Center, Writing Center); as well as incorporate initiatives to enhance student
support through our NSF-STEP grant (enhanced communication and study skills
development, career exploration, internship opportunities, alumni mentoring,
earlier summer research experiences) providing a strong foundation of education
and support. In addition, the CSEMS students are among the first students to use
electronic portfolios, and have specific opportunities to participate in off-
site visits to regional technology companies, interact with alumni and
professionals, and attend topical seminars. By using scholarship funds to
relieve the burden of work-study as part of their financial aid package,
students are also offered the opportunity to become part of an "ambassador"
team, visiting local middle schools, where they talk with students and give
short presentations and/or demonstrations about their college experiences, or
help mentor students as part of an organized program.
