9512968 Farkas This U.S.-Argentina collaborative research effort will carry out
computer simulation studies of the effects of impurities in intermetallic
alloys. More specifically, the effects of interstitial impurities in causing
defects will be simulated, first with hydrogen in intermetallics, then with
carbon in metals and intermetallics. The project will be led by Diana Farkas of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Eduardo Savino and J.
Abriata of the Comision Nacional de Energia Atomica (CNEA) in Argentina,
building on an established collaboration. Savino works at CNEA Buenos Aires,
where the Centro Atomico Constituyentes has expertise in interatomic potential
development, whereas Abriata works at CNEA Bariloche, contributing expertise in
the area of hydrogen effects in metals. Combined with the computer simulation
skills of the PI, the collaboration provides greater potential than the
individuals alone. ****
