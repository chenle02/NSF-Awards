Atmospheric frontal zones, the transition zone between relatively warm and cold
air masses, are highly turbulent. In the this zone, kinetic energy is dissipated
and internal waves are generated which may result in severe convective activity
or turbulence far from the front. Both of these processes have implications for
atmospheric predictability. The principal investigator will employ two
approaches in the study of frontal zones. He will analyze observations taken
during a recent field program designed to investigate frontal processes known as
STORM-FEST, and will use wavelet decomposition as his principal analysis tool.
He will also conduct a number of modeling experiments with the goal of isolating
the physical processes important for frontal evolution. Many of the important
physical processes that govern the behavior of weather systems occur on scales
which are not explicitly resolved in numerical prediction models. The ultimate
goal of this study is to provide information which will allow the development of
representations of such and, thereby, improve numerical weather forecasts.
