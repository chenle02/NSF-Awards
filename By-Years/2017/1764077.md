An abundance of data in science, engineering, national security, and health care
has led to the emerging field of big data analytics. To process massive
quantities of data, developers leverage data-intensive scalable computing (DISC)
systems in the cloud, such as Google's MapReduce, Apache Hadoop, and Apache
Spark. While DISC systems help to address the scalability challenges of big data
analytics, they also introduce an enormous challenge for data scientists in
understanding and resolving errors. This project addresses the severe lack of
debugging support in DISC systems today, which makes it difficult for data
scientists to understand their applications, determine the causes of identified
errors, and ensure that such errors are properly repaired. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The research provides two kinds of debugging support for big data
processing programs in modern DISC systems like Apache Spark: new interactive,
real-time debugging primitives for large-scale distributed processing and tool-
assisted fault-localization services for big data. Technical approaches include
a new data provenance technique for providing fine-grained visibility into
large-scale distributed data processing and runtime optimizations for iterative
development and debugging workloads. Tool-assisted fault localization services
leverage these underlying provenance and optimization techniques to pinpoint and
characterize the root causes of errors efficiently. Big data analytics is
increasingly important in the 21st century, where daily lives leave behind a
detailed digital record and decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to
government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. The research
contributes to improving productivity and correctness of big data applications,
which is crucial for many disciplines that distill terabytes of low-value data
into high-value insights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
