To function correctly in the nervous system, each nerve cell must produce an
appropriate neurotransmitter, the chemical it uses to communicate with other
nerve cells. Little is known about the mechanisms that govern this choice within
developing nerve cells. The work proposed here will identify genes that control
neurotransmitter choice, the decision of a neuron to produce a specific set of
proteins that synthesize and handle a specific neurotransmitter. Since the same
neurotransmitters are used by organisms throughout the animal kingdom, the same
types of genes probably regulate neurotransmitter decisions in simple and
complex organisms. Therefore, this problem will be studied in a simple organism
which is readily amenable to genetic and molecular analysis, the nematode. We
can easily mutate the genes of these animals and observe the results of such
mutations. By isolating and analyzing mutants that lack the neurotransmitter
serotonin, genes that are required for the specification and function of
serotonin containing neurons can be identified. If genes are identified that
control neurotransmitter choice, it is very likely similar genes control such
decisions in higher organisms.
