This starter grant award to the University of Massachusetts will support the
research of Professor Ricardo B. Metz. The research focusses on spectroscopy and
photofragmentation dynamics of transition metal cation-organic molecule
complexes. Gas-phase transition metal cations are powerful catalysts, able to
activate carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in alkanes at room temperature.
Very little is known about the adduct, a metal cation-organic molecule complex.
The present research uses a dual time-of-flight photofragment spectrometer to
characterize the adducts, determining the thermochemistry and bonding of the
ground and low-lying excited electronic states. The information is then used to
control reaction pathways in the adduct. This research will contribute
fundamental insights into gas-phase metal ion chemistry toward the goal of
enabling design of more effective heterogeneous catalysts.
