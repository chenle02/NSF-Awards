Data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
can help to understand dark matter halos, regions of space that contain
gravitationally bound matter that is very hard to detect. This project will use
the Rubin Observatory as a "dark matter telescope" to study these halos at sub-
galactic scales across cosmic time using gravitational lensing (the bending of
light as it passes a massive object), allowing investigators to identify dark
matter halos that have such low mass that they do not host visible stars. This
will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental properties of dark
matter particles. This project also involves the continued development and
support of an undergraduate research fellowship honoring Dr. Hubert Mack
Thaxton, the fourth African American to receive a PhD in physics in the United
States. The Thaxton fellowship provides paid physics research opportunities to
multiple students each year.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigators will use
two observational techniques, namely strong gravitational lensing anomalies and
stellar stream perturbations, to study the abundance and properties of low-mass
dark matter halos. For the strong lensing component, investigators will combine
Rubin Observatory data with radio surveys and very long baseline radio
interferometry to achieve milli-arcsecond scale resolution imaging of strongly
lensed radio-loud active galactic nuclei to maximize sensitivity to low-mass
dark matter halos. These halos offer unique advantages to constrain the
microphysical properties of dark matter because their evolution is less affected
by complicated baryonic physics and because many non-minimal dark matter
properties leave the most conspicuous signatures on low-mass
halos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
