This Biological Facilities Center proposal requests funds to expand the
capability and flexibility of the stable isotope laboratory within the
Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,
Massachusetts. A second mass spectrometer specialized for the measurement of
carbon and nitrogen isotopes and controlled environmental chambers will be added
so that the basic mechanisms leading to the changed isotopic abundances may be
investigated. This instrumentation will be used for research spanning a wide
range of issues in environmental research: marine and aquatic food webs,
terrestrial biogeochemistry, and sulfur cycling in air and water. The
combination of advanced analytical capabilities with precisely controlled growth
chambers will provide a unique flexibility for addressing ecological questions.
Currently there are only a few centers of multidisciplinary research on
ecosystems; the Ecosystems Center is one of the largest of these. The facility
will serve not only the scientists of the Ecosystems Center but also
investigators from outside Woods Hole.
