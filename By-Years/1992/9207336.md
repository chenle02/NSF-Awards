Research in nuclear structure will be carried out. Most of the near term
experimental effort will be done at Florida State University's Nuclear Structure
Lab, with some planned work to be done at Livermore and Berkeley using the
GAMMASPHERE detector array. Permanent octupole deformation, intrinsic and
rotational excitations, and superdeformation in heavy nuclei will be studied. A
search for hyperdeformation in lighter nuclei will also be carried out. The
techniques of particle and gamma counting will be used as well as particle-
gamma coincidence counting. A review of all data for odd-A and odd-odd rare
earth and actinide nuclei will be conducted, with emphasis on systematics. The
adequacy of current microscopic theory as it applies to such systems will be
evaluated.
