The most recent report that surveyed issues facing the mathematical sciences was
NSF's Report of the Senior Assessment Panel for the International Assessment of
the U.S. Mathematical Sciences (Odom Report) a decade ago. Since the issuance of
that report, much has changed at NSF including a doubling of the Division of
Mathematical Sciences' budget, significant diversification of the DMS portfolio
of research and training awards, and increased connectivity of its funded
projects with the larger science and engineering enterprise. At the same time,
the landscape of the mathematical sciences has changed significantly: demand for
the use of mathematics and statistics in science, technology, and the economy
has heightened, intellectual opportunities in the mathematical sciences have
greatly expanded and the discipline has become ever more highly
internationalized&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will produce a
forward-looking assessment of the current state of the mathematical sciences and
of emerging trends that will affect the discipline and its stakeholders as they
look ahead to the quarter century mark. Specifically, the study will assess (a)
the vitality of research in the mathematical sciences, looking at such aspects
as the unity and coherence of research, significance of recent developments,
rate of progress at the frontiers, and emerging trends; and (b) the impact of
research and training in the mathematical sciences on science and engineering;
on industry and technology; on innovation and economic competitiveness; on
national security; and other areas of national interest.
