Heat pipes are devices which transport heat with only a small thermal
resistance. This characteristic is the result of phase change processes--
evaporation and condensation--which occur at either end of the pipe. Critical
issues in the efficient operation of a heat pipe are the transport of vapor and
liquid between the ends. The proposal deals with three fundamental issues which
affect the operation of heat pipes: (1) the distribution of noncondensable gases
and other gaseous or vapor species, (2) condensation of vapor in the wick
structure that is placed in the heat pipe to facilitate liquid transfer, and (3)
transient effects during start-up, shut-down, and changes in heat load. The
proposed research consists of a succession of modeling efforts, each structured
to include previously unaccounted phenomena. To facilitate the inclusion of
these effects, the integral forms of the conservation equations will be used
rather than the more complex differential forms. Experiments will be performed
to support and verify the analytical predictions.
