The long range objective of the Computer Science Department at Long Island
University's Brooklyn Campus, by means of the five-year infrastructure grant
(II-MI), is to build research, educational, and experimental laboratory
capabilities in the area of post-conventional relational DBMS technology VIZ,
knowledge base management systems (KBMS) and object-oriented data base
management systems (00-DBMS). Research activities in these areas will focus on
the development of models, techniques and tools for extending (or transforming)
conventional relational database systems. Implementation of these extensions, in
the form of interfaces or modifications to the conventional relational data base
system, will be carried out in an experimental computer laboratory located
within the department. These research and implementation activities will coupled
with and feedback to the computer science curriculum. The curriculum will be
enhanced to include advanced material and new courses in disciplines related to
these research activities (eg, advanced artificial intelligence, advanced data
base systems, expert and knowledge base systems, expert and knowledge base
systems, object-oriented programming and object oriented-system design). In
addition, a Laboratory Research Projects Course will be introduced whereby some
of the extensions and modifications, resulting from research activities, will be
implemented. Research and implementation activities will be conducted by
Department faculty with the close cooperation and assistance of Ph.D granting
Computer Science Departments in the metropolitan area, viz, Polytechnic
University, New York University and/or Columbia University.
