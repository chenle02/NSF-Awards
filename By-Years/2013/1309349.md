This action funds George Livingston of The University of Texas at Austin to
conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at
the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Japan. The project
title is "Using Microcosms to Test the Effect of Disturbance on Spatial Food
Webs." The host scientists are Noriko Takamura and Kayoko Fukumori.

This award implements an experiment testing spatial ecological theory using
aquatic microbial microcosms. The experiment is aimed at testing the combined
effects of dispersal and disturbance on the matching between species and their
optimal environments, food webs, and ecosystem function. This is accomplished by
manipulating the rate at which patches are destroyed in landscapes with low
levels of dispersal. Humans are dramatically reducing connectivity in many
landscapes, resulting in the decline and collapse of food webs and ecosystem
services like pollination and pest control. This experiment will help provide
general mechanisms for landscape-level food web decline.

Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow will engage in two outreach
seminars at universities in Japan and network to establish future collaborations
with two research groups beyond the primary host scientists.
