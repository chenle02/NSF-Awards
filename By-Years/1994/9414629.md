9414629 Tan This project deals with the dynamic modeling of coupled crankshaft-
belt drive system used in automobile power transmission, their vibration ad
stability analysis, and a development of computational algorithm for design. The
analysis uses the Hamiltonian principle, local linearization, and a distributed
transfer function approach. The results of this research lead to a better
understanding of fundamental response characteristics, and improved design
guidelines for optimization of front end accessory drive system of an
automobile. The design guidelines are also useful for other high-speed, axially
moving mechanical systems. Ford Motor Company is providing partial matching
three-year support for this research project. ***
