The manufacturing of substances of biological origin using genetic engineering
methodology depends on efficient separation and purification techniques. This
proposal seeks to systematize a purification methodology based on a biomolecular
partition between two or more immiscible phases in an aqueous system. The
specific objectives of this proposal are to: - Characterize aqueous biphasic
systems using polymer solution thermodynamics. - Predict partition coefficients
using the properties of proteins at surfaces. The success of these studies will
strengthen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and interactions of
aqueous two-phase systems. In addition, it will provide engineering principles
for selecting the proper system for effective separations at analytical and
commercial scale operations. The PI is considered to be well qualified to carry
out the proposed research and I recommend funding of this proposal.
