Following on the outcomes of an NSF-funded conference to this project's
principal investigator, a team of educators, scientists, and communication
experts from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, University of Massachusetts
Boston, Hofstra University, the Boston Museum of Science and other professionals
is implementing a full-scale development project to investigate the impact of an
Out-of-Home Multi-Media (OHMM) exhibit on adults riding Boston's subway system
(the "T"). The project's goal is to design, implement, and study the efficacy of
an OHMM model for free-choice science learning about our changing climate. A
rotating exhibit of twelve specially designed placards, posters, as well as
virtual, web-based learning resources linked to the exhibit content will
potentially engage over 420,000 adult riders per day along two of the T's four
lines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless access throughout light rail systems and
the rise of smart phones represent a confluence of factors making an innovative
form of engagement possible. The work is positioned to test this new model for
informal science education and potentially could be expanded in Boston and into
other cities around the country.
