&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research involves the synthesis of polyfuran and
co-polymers of polyfuran, pyrrole, and thiophene, doped with various
concentrations of p-toluene sulfonate, trifluoromethyl sulfonate and
perchlorate. The thermal and mechanical stability as well as electrical
conductivity of the polymers will then be characterized and compared to undoped
counterparts. The research will be carried out by undergraduates in order to
help prepare them for graduate school and careers in science and
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this RUI award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Rose M.
McConnell of the Department of Natural Sciences at the University of Arkansas,
Monticello. Professor McConnell will focus her work on developing methods for
the synthesis of a series of doped polymers which will be investigated for
interesting physical properties. The research will be used to train
undergraduate students in research skills not normally available in an
undergraduate institution. &lt;br/&gt;
