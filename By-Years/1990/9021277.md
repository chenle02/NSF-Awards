The eclipse occurring during July 11, 1991 passes directly over the Mauna Loa
Solar Observatory, Hawaii. This permits the rare opportunity to obtain a direct
cross-calibration between the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) K-coronameter,
located on Mauna Loa, and the HAO coronal camera, alleviating many of the
uncertainties which have compromised comparisons in the past. The eclipse will
permit the solar corona to be measured simultaneously by both instruments under
identical viewing conditions, thus permitting a measure of the stray light, and
a more accurate absolute calibration of the K-coronameter then previously
attainable. The high altitude observing site, favorable meteorological
conditions and the eclipse characteristics all promise a high probability of
successful observations by both instruments. Recent laboratory calibrations of
the photometric standards used by these instruments suggest that a significantly
improved absolute determination of the coronal brightness, polarization-
brightness product, and resultant electron density will be possible.
