PI: Land IBN 9603964 A central question in development of the brain is how
precise sets of functional connections are made between particular groups of
nerve cells. Model systems to study this question often involve a well-defined
sensory organ and the target areas in the cortex of the brain that receive the
sensory signals. The development of correct central connections and of normal
sensitivity by central neurons both often depend on normal sensory experience
during development; with deprivation, there often are physiological and
biochemical changes in the target neurons in sensory cortex. This study uses the
tactile whiskers of rodents and their characteristic "barrel fields" of target
nerve cells in the cortex as a model, because the system has a clear anatomical
organization that facilitates comparisons between the normal and deprived
conditions. The whiskers are easily trimmed at different times to provide a
painless and easily reversible form of sensory deprivation in a local area.
Physiological, biochemical and anatomical techniques will be used to investigate
the effects of deprivation on a particular type of excitatory nerve terminals in
developing barrel fields. Results from this model system will be relevant to
understanding how specific sets of connections between chemically defined
neurons are established during development, and how activity levels in these
neurons affect their development. The results will have an important impact on
sensory neuroscience as well as developmental neuroscience.
