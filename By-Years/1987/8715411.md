Description: In a joint research project Dr. S. M. Chitre of the Tata Institute
of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India and Dr. David Schramm of the University
of Chicago will study the phenomena of supernova. The physics of supernova has
been a theoretically-dominated field for centuries, but recent events, namely
the supernova that occurred on February 23, 1987, have added a new dimension
through the observations that have occurred, especially in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. The project will seek to study the physics of the core of the supernova,
as well as the nucleosynthesis products of the supernova, and the evaluation of
massive stars and their subsequent production and dispersion and supernova
explosions. Significance: The two scientists who are eminent in the field in
their respective countries plan to collaborate in theoretical studies and
analysis of observational data made worldwide in 1987, to study the interest
phenomena of supernova. The results of advances in this field are wide-ranging
in the understanding of physics of matter, astronomy and astrophysics.
