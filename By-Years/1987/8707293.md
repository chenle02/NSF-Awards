Fission track thermochronology in the Wind River Range in the Rocky Mountain
foreland of western Wyoming has shown the potential to measure the timing and
the rates of tectonic uplift that occurred in Oligocene/Eocene time. The PI will
use fission-track thermochronology to: 1) determine time of uplift initiation
and apparent uplift rate for basement-cored uplifts in the Rocky Mountain
foreland; 2) estimate depth of basin fill in the associated basins; and 3)
indentify faulting if it is present in the cores of other ranges as it is in the
Wind Rivers. In addition, field studies will be conducted to determine the age
of this core faulting and whether it is compressional or extensional. The
significance of this project lies in its implications concerning fundamental
cause. Most theories for foreland deformation relate to horizontal subduction of
the Farrallon plate and/or rotation of the Colorado Plateau. However, specific
constraints are lacking inasmuch as our understanding of the timing of
deformation is only general, our models of the geometry do not include young
uplift of the cores and we are not sure how deep the associate basins were
filled. This study is designed to provide the specific temporal and geometric
information needed to constrian theories of Rocky Mountain foreland deformation.
