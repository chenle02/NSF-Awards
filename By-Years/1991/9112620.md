In plant species with chromosomal sex determination, one would expect the ratio
of males and females to be 1:1. To characterize fully the significance of a
known unbalanced populationsex ratio, processes which cause the bias are of
primary interest, not only in terms of explaining a population condition, but
elucidating fundamental differences in the selective pressures affecting the
different sexes. A series of experiments to study mechanisms affecting the sex
ratio of the dioecious perennial Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) are
proposed. The proposal will address a set of main factors potentially
responsible for the initiation and maintenance of a sex ratio bias:
discrepancies between numbers of X- and Y- containingpollen in males, death of
XY or XX zygotes, differentialsurvivorship within the seed bank, and sex
specific mortality schedules. The experiments described will provide valuable
information on when males and females experience divergent selection pressures.
This knowledge, in turn, will help us address the ecological and evolutionary
significance of such biases.
