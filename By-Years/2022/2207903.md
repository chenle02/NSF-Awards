This project will study quantum fluctuations of energy density and of gravity
and related physical effects. Recent work has shown that the probability of very
large energy density fluctuations is much larger than had previously been
thought. These energy density fluctuations can also lead to large fluctuations
of the gravitational field, which are a type of quantum gravity effect. This
project will seek a deeper understanding of these large fluctuations. It will
also study similar effects in condensed matter and atomic systems which may be
possible to observe in the laboratory. The results of this investigation may
have broader impacts on other areas of science, mathematics, and possibly
technology. The basic principles and techniques to be explored are expected to
have application beyond the specific set of topics to be studied. The project
will contribute to education, and to human resource development through the
involvement of students. Both graduate and undergraduate students can
participate in various aspects of the project, and to improve their skills in
scientific analysis and communication. The project will also create examples
that will be useful to explain subtle concepts in quantum theory and gravity to
students at various educational levels and to the general
public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A better understanding of large energy density
fluctuations and related effects are expected to lead to a deeper understanding
both of quantum physics and of gravity. The effects on the gravitational field
are quantum gravity effects, and their study can be one of the paths to a more
complete quantum theory of gravity. This project will explore quantum
fluctuations of nonlinear operators such as the quantum stress energy tensor. Of
particular interest is the possibility of producing primordial black holes in
the early universe this way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
