This award supports summer research by undergraduates at the University of
Kansas department of Biochemistry. Students pursue research related to ongoing
faculty research programs, including collaborative efforts in classical
structure analysis of proteins, genetic engineering and physical biochemical
approaches to understanding the structure, function and regulation of enzymes
and of membrane proteins. Students will participate in various group activities,
including seminars and journal clubs, in addition to individual research.
