Creating semi-solid structures between water-oil interfaces is critical in many
fields, including drug delivery, tissue bio-mimicking, and energy applications.
Amphiphiles, comprising water-loving and water-hating parts, could be used to
construct organized microlayers between liquid-liquid interfaces. The
interfacial microlayer in such systems forms instantaneously at the interface
yet continues to grow gradually, making it challenging to create a well-
controlled thickness at the interface. The current award aims to address this
challenge by investigating and understanding the underlying mechanisms that
control interface growth and dynamics experimentally. The interdisciplinary
nature of this award will provide opportunities to develop undergraduate and
graduate curriculum, design educational outreach activities for the general
public, and expose high school students with STEM subjects.

Stabilizing oil-water interfaces to create hierarchical functional structures
between fluidic interfaces has been a significant area of study in various
material sciences and engineering fields. However, stabilizing and structuring
fluidic interfaces by surfactant self-assembly has not been extensively
explored. Creating a smart complex is advantageous and unique compared to the
other relevant systems and can revolutionize many fields. First, surfactants are
inexpensive and commercially available; thus, no special and time-consuming
synthesis is needed. Furthermore, no other “all-liquid systems” can create meso-
architectural morphologies, such as lamellar or hexagonal, except surfactant
self-assembled systems. This award aims to investigate an aqueous surfactant
system with oil cosurfactant to 1) identify spontaneous emulsification mechanism
and control its kinetics rate; 2) control the microlayer growth and tune its
viscoelasticity; 3) to integrate associative components to create reconfigurable
interfaces, and 4) enhance the accessibility of STEM education for local
underprivileged high school students. To accomplish these goals, experimental
methods including interfacial tension measurement, shear and dilatational
rheology, and microscopies will be utilized.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
