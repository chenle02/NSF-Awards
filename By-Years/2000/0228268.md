This award supports a study to determine the feasibility of developing and
employing a broad variety of indicators that will enable monitoring of project
outputs and outcomes at the program level for the Partnerships for Innovation
Program. The study will examine which types of project outputs and outcomes
should be monitored; which specific indicators will be useful and valid for
monitoring the program; and how to resolve whatever difficulties the awardees in
the Partnerships for Innovation Program would face in regularly collecting and
reporting the data. The study will develop and validate an array of quantitative
and qualitative indicators needed for monitoring the full range of activities
supported by the Partnerships for Innovation Program. The current awards will be
analyzed to categorize its goals, progress, outcomes and impacts. Indicators
will be developed to measure proximate outputs at the project level. A sample of
the awards will be selected for interactive input to test the validity of the
indicators as well as to obtain input of the investigators on potential
methodologies to obtain the data. The sample will be selected by the range of
activities in the award. Participation by the awardees will be on a voluntary
basis.
