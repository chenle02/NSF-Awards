This project involves the study of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial
differential equations from both analytical and numerical points of view, with
emphasis on problems from Plasma Physics and the Vlasov-Maxwell system. Particle
Methods for higher-dimensional systems will be studied, with the goal of
obtaining convergence as well as higher-order accuracy. Collisional effects
(e.g. those from the LANDAU system) will also be included. Many of the
presently-used numerical schemes have little (if any) theoretical justification.
For those few that are well founded, the known accuracy is relatively poor. Thus
from a practical point of view, much improvement is possible. Moreover, at this
time there are no rigorous studies (neither theoretical nor computational) of
collisional effects. These studies will have application in areas such as fusion
energy.
