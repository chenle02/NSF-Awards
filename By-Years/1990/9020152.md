This award will support a required workshop in experimental high energy physics
to be held in Guanajuato, Mexico. Organizers for this event are Professor
Clemens Heusch of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Professor
Clicerio Avilez of the University of Guanajuato. The purpose of the workshop is
to discuss Inter-American collaboration in xperimental physics, with special
emphasis on work related to the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). A review
of physics motivations and goals, and detailed description of the status of
machine design and civil engineering progress will precede a discussion of all
modes of U.S./Latin-American Collaboration in the realization of this project.
Key representatives of experimental collaborations that have entered expressions
of interest in SSC detector construction and of appropriate Latin-American
industries, will be invited to participate. Other projects of binational
collaboration will be included in this discussion, as well as broader issues
arising from international efforts in collaborative work in High Energy Physics.
