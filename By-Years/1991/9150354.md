The objective of this proposal is to develop, evaluate, and publicize a
curriculum in quantitative studies for undergraduates in the life sciences. This
curriculum will emphasize the great utility of quantitative approaches in
analyzing biological problems, will utilize many examples from recent biological
research, and serve a dual role of both introducing new quantitative methods and
reinforcing key concepts in modem biology. A variety of software will be
evaluated and utilized in the curriculum to enhance the problem-solving aspects
of the courses. This will enable students to experiment with alternative key
biological assumptions in mathematical models and analyze the resultant
quantitative and qualitative behavior of these assumptions. The curriculum to be
developed will include an entry-level sequence as well as a second-year set of
courses. A workshop of researchers and educators in quantitative biology will be
held as part of the initial stages of the development in order to develop a set
of basic quantitative and biological concepts that should be included in the
curriculum. A few of the attendees at this workshop will serve as an advisory
board for the remainder of the projected proposal period. Over the three years
of the proposal, the new curriculum will be developed, appropriate software
evaluated, pilot studies run, and results of the project publicized. A monograph
compiling detailed syllabi, lesson plans, and software evaluations will be
published and distributed to quantitative and life science departments
throughout the U.S.
