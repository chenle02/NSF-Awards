Title: Collaborative Research: Continuous Compilation: A New Approach to
Aggressive and Adaptive Code Transformation&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Today's
challenge for optimization research is to develop new techniques and approaches
that yeild performance improvements that were typical of early optimization
research-20 to 40 percent and more. In this research, we address this challenge
by investigation and developing an innobative system or applying optimizations.
Our system, the Continuous Compilation System (COCO), applies optimizations both
statically at compile-time and dynamically at run-time using optimization plans
developed at compile time and adapted at run time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To
demonstrate the practicality and utility of our approach, initially we will
apply COCO to several large, long-running applications. Examples of such
applications include ecological simulations, weather simulation, architecture
simulators, and VLSI routing and placement applications. As we gain insight and
experience with the application of continuous compilation, we will investigate
its effectiveness on other types of codes such as multimedia applications,
signal processing applications, and web servers.
