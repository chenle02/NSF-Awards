A new technique for coating surfaces using plasma-enhanced deposition followed
by electroplating, forming a transitional buffering interface (TBI), provides
for excellent adhesion characteristics for a wide range of base materials and
very close control of film thickness, flatness, and roughness. These
characteristics greatly influence the thermal contact conductance. It is
proposed to investigate how the conductance varies with these parameters, and to
develop a strategy to minimize contact resistance. The thermal resistance which
exists between discrete objects such as those present in electronics packages
poses a severe limitation on the heat which can be dissipated. A high surface
conductance coating which maintains structural integrity would be highly
desirable, with applications to thermal control in the aerospace and electronics
industries. Successful completion of the proposed research would be a
significant step in the right direction.
