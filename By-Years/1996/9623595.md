9623595 Adanur Being able to rapidly produce aligned polymer fiber composite
structures today limits their use in mid to high volume products. This CAREER
award will investigate new approaches that draw on textile manufacturing
technologies to produce net shape resin impregnated composite preforms rapidly
and reliably. The educational program of course and curriculum development will
complement the research program, but also build the infrastructure at Auburn
University for a Textile Engineering program accredited by the Accreditation
Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The research plan calls for
modeling and experimental investigation of two innovative new thermoplastic
composite manufacturing processes. One process involves spreading the fibers in
the yarns so that they can be more easily impregnating with resin, which is
followed by returning the fibers to yarn that is made into a preform and cured.
The other process uses a new concept for resin impregnation just before braiding
and weaving. A well thought out curriculum development plan emphasizes
engineered textiles as a product, but also the machines and systems needed to
produce them. A structural textile composites laboratory will complement and
connect the research and education aspects of this project. Technical
breakthroughs in making near net shape composite structures will greatly reduce
the cost and potential for high performance aligned fiber composites. The
educational plan will develop a new look in textile engineering curriculum that
prepares textile engineers for new opportunities.
