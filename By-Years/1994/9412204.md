9412204 Silfvast We believe that not only will this conference serve to focus
the attention of the industrial and academic communities on new applications of
UV and VUV lasers, but that it may perform a service to the funding agencies as
well. It is expected that, as a result of this meeting, a clearer picture of
"where we need to go to enhance technology" will emerge. A brief proceedings of
this meeting will be published. In addition, we believe that this conference
will aid the commercialization of these sources and their applications at time
when new products are badly needed by US industry. The support provided by NSF
will be used specifically to enable university faculty and students to attend
this conference. This will encourage more work in a field expected to become
vital in electronics, optics and medicine. ***
