The main objective of this expanded cross-industry survey/study is to assess and
compile key development, commercialization and integration trends for a
significantly larger cross-section of companies involved in the rapidly evolving
nanomanufacturing industry, which are estimated to number around 800 companies
in the US (per an industry compilation by Small Times magazine). NCMS is aiming
to obtain at least 300 representative industry responses from established
conventional manufacturing industry, new nanomanufacturing industries, and other
start-up companies in North America. NCMS will make its best efforts to amplify
industry information via an on-line survey questionnaire, as well as identify
new success stories and emerging in-progress efforts in applications of
nanomanufacturing towards commercialization. NCMS will first distribute the
survey to its corporate membership (numbering over 150 organizations from
aerospace, automotive, machine-tool, electronics and advanced materials) and
then to the nanomanufacturing industry at large during the spring and summer of
2004, for which the database will be provided by NSF. NCMS will also disseminate
the survey solicitation more widely through its web publications, periodic
newsletters and alliances in order to encourage participation in the survey, as
well as contact leading media, regional and technical business organizations to
encourage responses.
