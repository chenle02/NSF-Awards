This award by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) site at North Carolina State University for the summers of
2009-2011. The program director is Elon Ison who is assisted by co-PI Reza
Ghiladi. Eight students each year, recruited from outside institutions which
themselves lack significant research facilities, will be selected for this ten
week program in chemical research. The primary focus will be to expose
undergraduate students to, and educate them in, one of many possible independent
research topics in the fields of materials science, life science, and catalysis.
By taking advantage of the geographic location of North Carolina State
University (NCSU), this REU program will: 1) engage in a series of effective
strategies for recruiting students from underrepresented groups, in particular
those from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the southeast
region and from the University of Puerto Rico system; 2) provide students with
additional exposure to career opportunities in non-academic settings in the
Research Triangle Park (RTP) area; 3) actively enroll students in the social and
professional activities provided on campus and to encourage student interactions
with other undergraduate REU programs at NCSU. Special efforts will be made to
assist students in making professional and academic decisions by broadening
their perspectives on chemical research careers and by providing research
opportunities for students of all backgrounds with demonstrated academic
excellence.This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership
with the NSF REU program.
