AST-0113571&lt;br/&gt;J. Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product of this research
will be an improved general purpose solver for astrophysical gas dynamics,
including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and radiative cooling effects. It
will be a successor to the PI's widely used ZEUS code and will be a new
generation code exploiting new hardware and software capabilities. Solvers
optimized for scalar processors able to run on distributed memory parallel
machines will greatly enhance the range of astrophysical problems addressable
with direct numerical simulation. The project is interfaced to the graduate
program of the Center for Scientific Computation and Applied Mathematical
Modeling, which will allow hands on graduate training in numerical simulations
for astrophysics and in use of numerical algorithms for parallel architectures.
