The Mathematics and Computer Science Departments at Wofford College are
undertaking a project to enhance learning with extensive use of computer
graphics through the development of a laboratory with 13 workstations. Each of
three classrooms are equipped with a workstation so that the technology is
integrated into the class lectures, and faculty also have access to computers in
their offices. To enhance many of its courses from the freshman to the senior
level the Mathematics Department is incorporating the Mathematica symbolic
algebra system and other software with high-quality graphics. Through innovative
use of the new technology, students gain a conceptual understanding and
appreciation of the importance of many subjects and are more able to concentrate
on problem solving instead of tedious details of computation. THe Computer
Science Department is increasing and upgrading its offerings with new courses in
computer graphics and programming projects, each taught using modern graphics
displays. Implementation of this project accomplishes two major goals at Wofford
College: (1) improves and extends computer science education leading to the
possibility of a computer science/mathematics major, and (2) strenghthens and
enlivens mathematics education through computer technology.
