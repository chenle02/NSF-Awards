This project centers on use of the Rice Convection Model (RCM) to study the
Earth's magnetosphere and its coupling to the ionosphere and thermosphere.
Computer experiments based in interactively combining the RCM with numerical
models of the thermosphere should allow determination of whether thermospheric
winds can substantially affect the injection of the magnetosphere's storm-time
ring current. Combined magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere simulations will
also be directed at the dynamic behavior of the low-mid-latitude ionospheric
electric fields, which move the ionospheric F-layer and affect its structure.
Utilizing newly developed computational machinery for representation of
radiation-belt particles, field-aligned potential drops, charge exchange with
neutrals, auroral precipitation, and substorm-associated collapse of the
magnetotail magnetic field, computer experiments with the RCM will probe the
effects of these processes on basic magnetospheric phenomena, particularly
substorms and storms.
