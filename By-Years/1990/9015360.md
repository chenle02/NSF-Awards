The workshop is aimed at working research scientists who have basic knowledge of
the field and need to become better acquainted with computational modeling
strategies. The sub-title of the workshop: programs, methodology, selection,
troubleshooting, emphasizes this point. Speakers from academia and industry will
describe current new methodologies, compare parameterization schemes, and share
strategies. NCSA with its strengths in visualization and supercomputer
applications will address a critical need for comparison and evaluation of high-
performance computing methods and capabilities. The workshop will help transfer
high performance computing technology from front-line modeling research
laboratories, both academic and industrial, into the hands of a wider audience.
In general, the workshop will address the needs of researchers interested in
using modeling methods as a tool to solve biological problems.
