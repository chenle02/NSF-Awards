The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-
UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students and faculty at HBCUs.
Texas Southern University will host a Conference on Invitation to Mathematics at
Texas Southern University on September 8-9, 2018. About forty faculty and
students from Prairie View A&amp;M University and Texas Southern University will
attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the activities of this
conference, undergraduate students will be exposed to mathematics research and
techniques and gain a perspective on relations between mathematics and and other
fields of science. Areas of mathematics to be discussed are: statistics,
operations research, mathematical biology, and algebra. The conference will
consist of research talks by mathematicians, a poster session for students, and
a panel discussion with researchers and representatives from industry. The
conference is to bring together scholars, researchers, educators, students and
professionals. A key objective is to provide undergraduate students the
opportunity to interact with a group of researchers and to learn about research
and career opportunities in various fields of
mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
