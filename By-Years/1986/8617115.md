Dr. Cooper's project will attempt to elucidate the regulation of synaptic
transmission. A factor has been isolated from brain, tentatively referred to as
Substance B, which does not affect the evoked release of acetylcholine from
nerve preparations, but which prevents the presynaptically modulated release. In
both guinea pig ileum synaptosomes and intact preparation, Substance B reverses
the release of acetylchone that is inhibited by muscarinic, purinergic and
adrenergic agonists. In preliminary experimensts, Substance B also increases the
EPSP in hippocampal slices and reverses the inhibition in firing rate produced
by clonidine in locus coeruleus slices. This factor, currently being purified,
is a low molecular weight hydrophilic compound that is present in heart and
ileum as well as brain but is absent in liver and kidney. When the identity of
this novel regulator factor has been established, he will determine its
subcellular distribution, its biochemical and electrophysiological mechanism of
action, and its effect on transmitters other than acetylcholine.
