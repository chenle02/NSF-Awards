Symmetry is a pervasive concept in mathematics, giving rise to beautiful and
interesting geometric objects, as well as providing an essential tool in
geometry and topology. Classically, research has focused on globally defined
symmetries, but recently it has been realized that symmetries of local
structures offer vastly more examples and connections to other areas of
mathematics. This project will study local symmetry, its applications to the
study of self-similar geometric objects and related algebraic problems, and
recently discovered geometric constructions of efficient networks (so-called
expander graphs).

The relationship between the geometry of an object and the algebraic structure
of its group of automorphisms has been intensely studied in the past, but in the
last decade, progress has been made on a much richer theory of symmetries that
only appear after passing to a cover, i.e. are "hidden'" The project aims to
study this notion in several contexts, such as Riemannian geometry (especially
nonpositive curvature) and geometric structures. Further, rich phenomena are
expected when the symmetry arises from self-similarity, i.e. in the case of
self-covering manifolds, particularly in situations of geometric interest such
as Kaehler or affine geometry. Finally, the project aims to study coarse
geometric objects associated to group actions (so-called warped cones),
especially in the case of actions with spectral gap, where these yield expander
graphs.
