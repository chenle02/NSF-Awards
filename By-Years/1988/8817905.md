This award provides 50% of the travel expenses for the invited plenary speakers
to the Seventh International Conference on Fracture (ICF) which will be held in
Houston, Texas, 20-24 March 1989. Since its first conference in Sendai, Japan in
1965, ICF has become the international forum for discussing the most recent
advances in fracture mechanics. The study of fracture provides engineers with
means for designing more sound structures and scientists with the macro- and
micro- mechanics involved in crack propagation.
