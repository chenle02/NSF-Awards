Proposal Number: ECS-9615799 Principal Investigator: Jin Au Kong Title:
Analytical and Monte Carlo Studies on Electromagnetic Interactions with
Nonspherical Dense Media In this research, a basic theoretical and computational
investigation of methods which are adequate for use in situations where
nonspherical complexity is introduced in electromagnetic interactions with
terrain-type scatterers (remote sensing) is proposed. This is a nontrivial
outstanding problem. Almost all branches of remote sensing, terrain, atmospheric
and ocean, will benefit from an effective formulation which includes this
realistic effect. Remote sensing, as part of the general field of global
resource assessment, is felt to be a strong area, which is vital to the United
States.
