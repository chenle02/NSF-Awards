This research investigates natural language comprehension by computer systems.
Specific targets are to: 1) Describe how the ambiguity of words used in natural
language may be resolved from context and "semantic relations" - the underlying
structures connecting the possible alternative meanings of words. 2) Develop a
computer system, meta5, which automatically carries out natural language
processing, using the semantic relations approach. A key feature of this
development is the use of parallel processing, with many computing elements
operating simultaneously to analyse the natural language input. The significance
of this research is that natural language processing systems, for machine
translation, user interfaces, and knowledge based systems, must overcome the
fundamental problem that ordinary words have many meanings, and the right one
must be found for each occurrence. The processing requirements of this task make
it essential to explore parallel processing and other means of greatly
increasing the computing power brought to bear on the problem.
