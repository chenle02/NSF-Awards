The overall goal of this project is to study learning through imitation and
endow robots with the ability to learn in this manner. This cross-disciplinary
project has two major goals. The first is to create models for imitation
learning in robots that combines techniques from Artificial Intelligence and
Bayesian machine learning with insights from cognitive and psychological studies
of imitation. The project will use these models to develop a humanoid robot that
can learn by watching humans perform specific tasks. The second is to determine
what characteristics of a humanoid robot can cause human infants and toddlers to
imitate it. This will help shed light on the question of whether infants ascribe
intentions to robots. The PI will collaborate with cognitive psychologist, Dr.
Andrew Meltzoff also from the University of Washington. The project will foster
collaboration between students from both of their labs and provide them with
training in carrying out interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;
