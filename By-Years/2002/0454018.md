Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Program: NSF 04-588 CISE Computing Research
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Title: CRI: Developing the Lemur Toolkit into a
Community Resource &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: CNS 0454018&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jamie
Callan&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie-Mellon University &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The PI will build on the Lemur Information Retrieval Toolkit, a
researcher oriented toolkit developed at the University of Massachusetts and
Carnegie Mellon (See http://www.lemurproject.org/) to create a new community
resource that a broad range of computer scientists can use. Uses of the resource
include information retrieval research and education activities such as search
engines, text retrieval, indexing, and user interfaces. The project will add
capabilities need by human language technology researchers. It will address
usability, resource needs, and documentation. Compute science education will be
fostered by creating tools that can be used in classes. A large-scale server
with Internet access via client-server programs will support a wide range of
institutions. This will be an open-source project enabling a wide community to
engage in improvements and use.&lt;br/&gt;
