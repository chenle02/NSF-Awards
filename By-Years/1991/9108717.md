Since the late 1970's, increasing international competition, technological
change, a deep recession, and changes in the composition of demand haver led to
the displacement of millions of workers from their jobs because of plant
closings or large-scale reductions in operations. The adaptability of displaced
workers, is an important component of the economy's overall response to
structural change. The purpose of this project is to analyze the determinants of
industrial and occupational mobility and post- displacement joblessness and
earnings. Differences between blacks and whites in industrial and occupational
mobility will also be examined. The study will analyze job search with a two
sector model which will be estimated using data from the Displaced Worker
Surveys. Questions of industrial and occupational change introduce sample
selection issues and these concerns will be addressed in the empirical analysis.
This research is supported under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions
Program, and the project is important because it may provide new insights for
the design of labor market policies.
