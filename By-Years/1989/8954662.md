In previous work by this project, experiment have been developed to illustrate
the use of laser techniques in demonstrating and understanding chemical
principles. Emphasis was placed on the use of a helium-neon laser source which
is inexpensive, safe, and readily available. These experiments have been
designed for use in the classroom or for lecture demonstrations or for use by
highly motivated high school students or beginning undergraduate chemistry
students. Although the use of lasers to demonstrate optical phenomena is fairly
well advanced, their counterpart in chemical applications remains in a highly
primitive state, even though laser techniques are revolutionizing chemical
research. The product of the work being supported through this project will be a
monograph of approximately 250 pages describing all successful experiment
performed over the summers of 1985 through 1988 in a form usable by the teachers
of general chemistry classes. This support will also allow dissemination of the
monograph so that it can be shared with other educators in the field.
