The purpose of this project is to focus analytical work on the Central and
Modern Volcanics of Seguam Island, using samples that were collected during a
previous project which concentrated on the older Southern Volcanics. The PIs
will be performing major, minor and REE analyses, microprobe and Nomarski
characterization of the lavas, and Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic analyses. The goal of
the project is to understand the control which tectonic processes, such as
extension and subduction of the Amlia fracture zone, exert upon the magmatic
processes and the sources of arc lavas. Only rarely has the temporal evolution
of magmatic processes been documented at individual island arc centers. By
extending this study of Seguam to the Holocene, they will have a petrologic
record that spans the entire period of volcanic activity which they can then
evaluate in terms of changing tectonic environments over time.
