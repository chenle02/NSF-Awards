9554188 Austin This project will determine how transactional writing, i.e.,
writing used to develop, construct and express mathematical understanding,
effects females' achievement in, and attitude toward, their college and middle
school mathematics classes. The project will target three different groups of
student participants in the basic and intermediate college algebra sequence, as
well as in one group of participants in a three-year middle school mathematics
sequence. College level achievement will be measured by the Elementary Algebra
Skills test; the Stanford Achievement Test will measure achievement on the
middle school level. Attitude toward math will be measured by the Revised
Mathematics Attitude Scale. Teams of mathematics and English faculty
investigators, and their female students, from a large, urban two-year college
and participating middle schools from a large, urban public school system will
create an academic community through the use of the college's electronic
bulletin board. The project will intervene at the two critical points that
hinder girls staying with and succeeding at mathematics and hence, women
successfully pursing mathematics-based careers and reaching higher income
levels: lack of achievement and poor attitude. Transactional writing can be an
instrument in the construction of knowledge and the reshaping of beliefs.
Writing about math helps students more easily learn mathematical concepts.
Students from middle schools and a community college will use a technique called
transactional writing to make them active learners. This, along with mentoring
and career counseling, will help them become more interesting in math and
science careers. ***
