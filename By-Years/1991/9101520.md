The primary objective of this proposal is to begin to determine the degree of
intra-specific variability in the social behavior of the black lemur (Lemur
macaco macaco) of northwestern Madagascar. There is some information on the
behavioral characteristics of this species. Yet, it is well known from studies
of other nonhuman primates that great variability may be encountered between
conspecific populations due to ecological and other causes. The PIs will begin
to assess the level of behavioral variability by observing four groups over the
course of eighteen months. As two of the populations reside in relatively
undisturbed areas and two in areas significantly disrupted by human activity,
there will be ample opportunity to observe the range of black lemur behavior.
The project will aim to document the responses to habitat disturbance. Most
specifically, disturbance leads to an altered distribution of food sources,
which in turn may affect ranging patterns and male migrations between groups.
The latter will also be documented in reference to mating patterns. As female
lemurs dominate males, the effects of migration on female choice of mates and
other aspects of mating strategies will be of interest.
