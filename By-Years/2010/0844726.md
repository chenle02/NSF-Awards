This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Malcolm Vidrine (LSU in Eunice)
donated his private collection of 22,000 specimens of freshwater mussels to the
LSUS Museum of Life Sciences. This award will fund the purchase of additional
museum cases for the proper storage of this valuable collection, a server for
the internet, and for staff to complete the curation. Most of the Vidrine
collection has not been organized and is presently unusable. This proposal is to
complete the sorting and organization of this collection. During that curation,
additional data (identifications, classification, and other specimen
information) will be computerized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As one of the largest
freshwater mussel collections in the U.S., the collection is an irreplaceable
resource for scientific study. With more than 40 years of sampling, it
represents most of the drainages in the southeastern U.S. and many of the
populations represented are now extinct. This collection will become more
valuable as we understand the environmental changes in aquatic ecosystems
throughout the south. The Vidrine collection is a valuable resource for
biologists, students, environmental engineers, and governmental agencies. Public
outreach includes answering questions for the public and a shell collection on
display. Upon completion the collection will be available for scientific study
and on the internet at www.lsus.edu/lsusmus/.
