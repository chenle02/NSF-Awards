Description: This award supports cooperative research by Dr. K. Gopalan of the
National Geophysical Research Institute, in Hyderabad, India with Dr. Douglas
Macdougall of Scripps Institute of Oceanagraphy. The work covers geochemical and
petrogenetic research in the Deccan basalts of India. The field research is to
be carried in three areas, in Gujarat in western India, in the Rajasthan and in
eastern India. Each of these areas contains a different geologic structure and
possesses a unique relevance to the general field of mantle geochemistry.
Samples will be collected and shipped to the U.S. where laboratory work will be
done at Scripps. Scope: Drs. Gopalan and Macdougall have collaborated in this
research area for several years with significant published results and with a
number of U.S. graduate students obtaining samples and data, for their Ph.D.
research, from the field in India. The collaborative effort is productive and
the results of high quality. Dr. Macdougall is currently funded under two
grants: INT8613485 for field expenses in India; and EAR8618554 for research
costs in the U.S. This action is being funded under INT8722661 to National
Geophysical Research Institute and INT8813233 to Scripps Institute.
