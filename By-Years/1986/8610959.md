This research program, which involves collaboration between the University of
Maryland and the Universidad Nacional Autonama de Mexico (UNAM), will utilize
the Random Decrement Technique to determine the damping properties of soil at
different strain levels using measured seismic records. The ability to determine
damping properties in-situ will permit a more reliable calculation to be made of
site response to earthquake loading.
