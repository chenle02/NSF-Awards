This project is concerned with sequential decision problems under partial
information. In such problems, decisions must be made sequentially in time. The
decision maker has access to an observed component of an ergodic Markov process,
but the cost of her decisions is determined also by the unobserved part of the
process. The decision maker aims to minimize the long time average cost by the
choice of a strategy that is adapted to the filtration generated by the
observations only. The goal of the project is to characterize the fundamental
properties of optimal decisions, such as pathwise optimality and ergodic
theorems, and to investigate certain sub-optimal decision algorithms which can
be efficiently implemented in practice. The research will build on and extend
recent advances in the ergodic theory of nonlinear filters.

Partially observed stochastic systems are ubiquitous in a wide range of
disciplines including signal processing, communications, navigation and
tracking, robotics, data assimilation and forecasting, bioinformatics, physics,
economics and finance. In such problems, one is faced with two major
difficulties: uncertainty in the dynamics of the system of interest, and the
limited availability of information. This project aims to understand how one can
best make decisions in an uncertain environment when only partial information is
available. The development of a mathematical theory characterizing the
properties of optimal decisions can help elucidate the fundamental limitations
one faces in making decisions with limited information, as well as lead to
practical algorithms for making near-optimal decisions which can be used in
applications.
