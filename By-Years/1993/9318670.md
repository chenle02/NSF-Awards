9318670 Murhammer This project is to study the effects of suspension cultures on
the growth and product formation of insect cell/baculovirus expression systems.
Many insect cell lines that are not easily adapted to suspension growth have
significantly higher product expression levels than cell lines that are easily
adapted to suspension growth. This phenomenon is to be investigated by: (1)
determining the effect of suspension cultures on uninfected insect cells; (2)
investigating the genetic basis of suspension growth; and (3) determining the
effect of suspension cultures on the viral infection process. The results of
this project are to provide information necessary for the improvement of insect
cell culture scale-up in which the yields of recombinant proteins and viral
insecticides are maximized. ***
