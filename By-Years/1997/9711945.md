Through a comparative analysis of African American/white and West Indian/white
interracial couples, this study will refine our understanding of identity
construction as a process that is conditioned by interactions with social
institutions and social networks, including peers, co-workers, and family
members, as well as the ethnic background and resources of each partner. In-
depth interviews will be conducted to understand how conditions within and
surrounding interracial families affect the daily behavior and social
affiliations of the parents and their mixed-race offspring.
