The purpose of this conference, to be held March 17-18, 1993 at MIT, is to bring
together engineers, scientists, mathematicians and computer scientists, active
in the developing world of discrete elements, to present their work, discuss
relevant issues and document the current state of Discrete Element Method (DEM)
technology. The DEM offers a complimentary approach to solving complex
engineering problems occurring in many fields and offers a methodology
unavailable in classical continuum analyses.
