This project investigates the problems of volume computation, sampling from
geometric domains, integer programming, and some basic, but not yet well
understood, problems such as containment between convex bodies. The goals are to
develop new algorithms, to test implementations and, parallel to this, to
explore theoretical bounds on the efficiency of algorithms. The main tool in the
design of these algorithms is randomization, in particular random walks and
Markov chains.
