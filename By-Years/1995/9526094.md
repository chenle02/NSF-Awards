ABSTRACT CMS9526094 "Intelligent Renewal of Urban Wastewater Systems" PI: Mau,
S. T., University of Houston This research is a three-year comprehensive study
to be completed as a collective effort of scientists (political, social, and
natural) and engineers from the University of Houston, officials from the City
of Houston, and pipeline contractors which will develop new technologies for the
physical renewal of the Greater Houston Wastewater System and produce a paradigm
of policy formulation regarding the sharing of responsibilities between public
and private sectors. The project will study mechanisms of microbially-induced
corrosion, and quantify the rate of deterioration of concrete pipes, plastic
pipes, plastic linings and coatings. New methods of corrosion assessment will be
developed based on electromagnetic wave technology. The research will identify
new evaluation methods for the viability of new coating materials and plastic
linings for pipe rehabilitation and new material mixes to be used as bedding and
backfill in placing new pipes. Physical and computer models will also be
developed to address the problem of air- hammer in pipelines that results in
environmental hazard. The research will also develop and apply a process which a
low-income, minority, inner-city community can follow to renew its wastewater
lines. The final task is to develop an integrated system and decision-making
methodology for intelligent renewal of wastewater systems. The technical and
non-technical findings of the study, as well as the methodology for decision-
making concerning community responsibilities, will serve as new paradigms not
only for future works in Houston, but also for similar programs in other urban
communities throughout the U.S.
