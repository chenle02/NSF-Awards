Increasing computerization of the process of acquiring and storing diagnostic
images requires more sophisticated approaches to image retrieval in order to
optimally use the images for improved health-care delivery, physician education
and research. A content-based image retrieval system is being developed that
takes a human-in-the-loop approach, because completely automated approaches are
not feasible for radiological images in which the clinically useful information
may consist of gray level and texture deviations in highly localized but
difficult-to-segment regions of an image. In this approach, a physician manually
delineates the pathology-bearing regions in an image. The CBIR system then
analyzes these regions for their properties and uses a graph representation,
augmented with the spatial relationships of the pathology bearing regions to
anatomical landmarks, to index the images into a database and retrieve similar
images typically with known diagnoses. This project focuses on the domain of
high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images in patients with a variety of
lung diseases. Regarding scientific goals, the project addresses: (1) the
computational complexity of retrieval and its mitigation by the use of
appropriate heuristics; (2) selection of similarity criteria to use for
comparing the pathology-bearing regions of the query and indexed images; and (3)
the design of a physician-friendly software architecture that allows for
extension to other disease categories.
