9509015 Miller Baker The purpose of the research is to assess the levels of
deleterious t haplotypes in house mouse populations in order to test basic
assumptions by modellers of the transmission ratio distortion phenomenon. In
this study the PI will use DNA sequencing to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
of segregation disorder. The proposed research is one of the few field studies
of segregation disorder. In addition, the PI will be studying the impact of
dispersal, social structure and mating behavior on population genetics. This
investigation of female choice will be of interest to behavioral ecologists and
population geneticists studying sexual selection.
