This proposal combines circuit design, material growth and characterization, and
device test capabilities of Oregon State University with the industrial circuit
fabrication facilities of TriQuint Semiconductor, Inc. to build and test high
speed devices and circuits from strained pseudomorphic III-V ternary materials.
InGaAs/GaAs and InGaAs/AlGaAs pseudomorphic HEMT structures will be grown by
molecular beam epitaxy at OSU using a variety of structural parameters to
optimize material properties. In particular, the investigators propose to grow
ordered ternary material by growing binary superlattices; they will also grow
both n- and p- channel material. The MBE material will be extensively
characterized by optical and electrical measurements. The wafers will then be
processed into a variety of test devices and integrated circuits at TriQuint at
no cost to the National Science Foundation, after which the device and circuit
performance will be fully tested and characterized using the facilities of both
TriQuint and OSU. Based on the complete characterization new mask sets will then
be designed at OSU and fabricated at Tektronix in order to optimize circuit
performance.
