This proposal sets forth an approach for developing and testing a causal model
that will link health care resource utilization with physicians' interpersonal
styles and cognitive and emotional responses. The topic is considered to be
important for both theoretical and applied reasons: from a theoretician's
perspective very few studies have successfully linked personality variables with
revealed decision behavior, and from a practitioner's perspective it would be
very useful to understand why some physicians use more, or use more expensive,
health care resources than do other physicians. Earlier work by the principal
investigator has demonstrated his ability to conduct this type of research, and
the focus of this proposal on questions of generalizability, reliability, and
empirical validation fits extremely well with the overall goals of the DRMS
program.
