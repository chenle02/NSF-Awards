Building on recent progress in applying algebraic methods to traditional
problems of computational and combinatorial geometry, the PI will explore
further use of the tools of algebraic geometry in this subject. In particular,
the PI will develop novel algebraic techniques&lt;br/&gt;-- as an alternative to
random sampling,&lt;br/&gt;-- for addressing geometric incidence
problems,&lt;br/&gt;-- for tackling range searching questions,&lt;br/&gt;-- for
making progress on the problem of repeated distances in the plane,
and&lt;br/&gt;-- to facilitate multilevel partitioning schemes, &lt;br/&gt;by
extending the ideas of Guth and Katz, and of Sharir and co-authors, combining
algebraic tools such as Bezout's theorem, fast Fourier transform, and Veronese
lifting with existing methods from computational and combinatorial
geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will significantly expand the arsenal
of tools available to researchers in computational and combinatorial geometry.
The techniques of this field, in turn, have wide-ranging applications in a
variety of practical subjects, such as computer graphics, geographic information
systems, machine learning, and robotics path planning, amongst
others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI's home institution (Polytechnic Institute of
NYU) has historically had a very diverse student body. Education is much more
effective when in the classroom students encounter easily accessible research
problems that remain open to this day. Such problems have been and will be
discussed in computational geometry and algorithms courses taught by PI,
increasing accessibility and public appreciation of the somewhat nebulous
"research in theoretical computer science."
