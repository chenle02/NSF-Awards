9523316 Rogers The aim of the research effort is to develop an understanding of
the fundamental scientific aspects of a recently developed qualitative non-
destructive evaluation sensor systems. I relies on tracking the high-
frequency(typically &gt; 50 KHz) pointimpedance of the structure to identify
damange. At such high frequencies, the techniques such as comparable in
sensitivity to the most sophisticated traditional NDE techniques such as
ultrasonics and is capable of qualitiatively detecting incipient type damage by
looking at changes in structural impedance. This technique overcomes all of the
critical limitations of model and "low frequency" NDE approaches
