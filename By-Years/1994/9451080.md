9451080 Beatty This proposal seeks funds to enrich the undergraduate
neuroscience laboratory experience at UCLA by extending current exercises and
experiments into the domain of the neuron and the genome. Two new neuroscience
laboratories -the Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Laboratory and the Behavioral
Neuroscience Laboratory -will benefit from the grant. The requested
instrumentation will give students experience in intracellular microelectrode
recording from cultured Aplysia neurons, the source of much basic knowledge of
neuronal function; patch-clamp recording from PC-12 and N1E1-15 cells studying
ion channels and receptors; and restriction analysis of DNA and DNA sequence
analysis for identifying a series of clones that are expressed primarily in the
brain. Patch-clamp and molecular biological methods will bc used together to
study the properties of expressed receptors, channels, pumps, and other
important membrane proteins in the Xenopus oocyte system. All these exercises
are at the forefront of contemporary neuroscience and technically are well
within the grasp of university undergraduates. Both the departmental and the
interdisciplinary neuroscience laboratories are team taught, with each faculty
member teaching a module in his or her own area of expertise. Up to date
documentation and instructional material for all laboratory modules will be made
available to all colleges and universities over Internet.
