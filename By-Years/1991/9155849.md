Chemistry and BiologyThis project expands the interactive component of an
integrated freshman chemistry/biology curriculum. The project involves the
creation of an interactive computer learning library that incorporates
educational research findings into its design. Curriculum integration comprises
themes such as energy transformation and dynamic equilibrium, which span and
unify the sciences. Linked materials will span several levels of sophistication,
allowing a diverse student population the opportunity to explore relationships
among concepts in a nonlinear self-paced fashion. Reading assignments from
handouts and the HyperCard library will drive discussion-based classes. This
will allow more time to engage students in developing specific thinking skills
necessary to become independent learners. The Thinking- Aloud Pair-Problem-
Solving Method (TAPPS) will be used to help students gain qualitative
familiarity with concepts and encourage them to examine their own approaches to
constructing solutions to problems.
