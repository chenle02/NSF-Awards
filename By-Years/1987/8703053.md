The GaAs materials and device development has reached the stage where material
non-uniformities limit device performance to the extent that circuit yields are
so low that only occasionally is a perfectly working chip attainable. A great
deal of research is devoted to material growth development. However, very little
effort is devoted to gettering in spite of the fact that it is well known that
complex Si chips are only possible through extensive use of gettering. It is
very likely that complex GaAs will similarly only be attainable if effective
gettering methods are developed. The objective of the program is the development
of one effective gettering method and an understanding of gettering in GaAs.
During the first year of this three year program the PI will measure the effect
of damage-induced and stress-induced gettering to determine the best method.
During the second year the PI will choose the most promising method and optimize
it. Most of the work during the first two years will be done on semi-insulating
substrates in order to study the basic gettering mechanism. During the third
year the PI will extend the research to directly ion-implanted n-layers to study
the gettering effectiveness on these layers.
