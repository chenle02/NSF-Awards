The difficulty in developing reliable software has been an obstacle in using
distributed systems. This project will study and advance the use of formal
techniques in distributed protocol design. The objective is to develop a
framework which allows a complex protocol to be structured as a composition of
simpler protocols. The project will develop notations for specifying the
interactions between the component protocols, develop a proof system, and build
a software tool supporting our methodology. The framework will be applied to
various domains such as design of adaptive protocols, reconfigurable protocols,
and structuring of control protocols. The educational component of the CAREER
prooject will involve students in the protocol development. This will include
emphasis of formal techniques in courses, increasing laboratory component to
provide experience and forming alliances with the industry to re-train computer
professionals (via television courses), and involving undergraduates in
research.
