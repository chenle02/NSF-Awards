There is a widely recognized need for improved user interfaces that will make
computers easier to use for people with no technical training, and that will
improve the general efficiency and ergonomics of many computer applications
where the conventional keyboard is too limited. One promising approach is based
on handwriting and gesture recognition, which will enable people to use common
handwriting skills to communicate with computers for a wide range of
applications such as text edition, form filling, and interactive graphics. But
what is needed before handwriting/gesture interface can become widely popular is
accurate and reliable recognition of normal cursive handwriting. The Phase I
study examined a new cursive handwriting recognition system consisting of a
front- end Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm, extensions to the DP algorithm to
find the vest match and all plausible alternatives, dictionary matching, rules-
based discrimination to resolve "confusions," and syntax constraints. Prospects
for eventual commercialization were judged to be very promising based on tests
with a data base of cursive words which resulted in 99.2% correct recognition in
user-independent mode, and 99.9% in user-dependent mode. Phase II will perform
the basic research needed to fully develop the recognition system for eventual
commercialization. This includes collecting a comprehensive data base of cursive
handwriting, further algorithm research and testing, human factors design, and
development of a real-time engineering prototype.
