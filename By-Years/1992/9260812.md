Use of the Escherichia coli Beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS) as a fusion marker
for analysis of gene expression in transform plants has been demonstrated
(Jefferson, et al. 1987). The synthesis, by chemical and enzymatic methods, of a
series of glucuronic acid conjugates of plant regulatory substances is proposed.
In Phase I, we will be we will synthesize conjugates of herbicides and toxins
and test these conjugates for the ability to specifically ablate tissues and
cells expressing GUS activity. Conjugates will be assayed in tissue culture and
in whole plants for the ability top cause localized cell death in a promoter
dependent manner. Such compounds will be of general use for plant research into
the control of development and gene expression and have the potential to produce
agriculturally important sterile plant species in a reversible manner, through
the use of selective application of substrate and choice of GUS-fusion promoter.
