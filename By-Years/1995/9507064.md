The 1995 Aspen Winter Elementary Particle Physics Conference will, for the first
time, devote a fourth week, January 22- 28, 1995, to a conference on
Gravitational Waves and their Detection. The Conference provides for
approximately 65 participants, six days of close interaction where problems and
recent results can be discussed in detail. The Aspen Winter Conference on
Gravitational Waves and Their Detection has several aims. One of these is to
involve physicists from other fields. To this end, physicists from the frequency
stabilization, quantum optics and elementary particle physics communities will
participate. In order to familiarize the newcomers with the status and aims of
the field, the program will begin with overviews of gravitational wave physics,
of astrophysical sources, and of detectors such as interferometers, resonant
bars and space based detectors. Another aim is to bring together gravitational
physicists who have varying perspectives on how to best accomplish the task of
detecting gravitational waves. The program, will thus include detailed
discussions of acoustic detectors-both bar and spherical, as well as a
historical perspective.
