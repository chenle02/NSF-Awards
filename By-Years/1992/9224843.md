This Americas Program award will support the participation of U.S. and Latin
American scientists in the first school of theoretical physics and mathematics,
to be held in Pointe a Pitre, Guadaloupe, May 30-June 13, 1993. This activity is
jointly sponsored by the American Mathematical Society, with Dr. James W.
Maxwell as organizer, and the Societe Mathematique de France. The School will
present recent progress in non-commutative geometry, infinite dimensional
geometry and operator algebras, with applications to quantum statistical
mechanics and quantum field theory. About 15 graduate students and recent
doctorates from Latin America and U.S. will participate. The subject of the
conference is timely and of great interest; the topics covered are extremely
important and the lecturers are of the highest international calibre in their
fields. This exposure to high level mathematics will give the young and emerging
scientists valuable added professional training and the opportunity to interact
with eminent mathematicians and physicists.
