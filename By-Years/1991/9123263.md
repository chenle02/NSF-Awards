This project continues a line of research on bargaining behavior. The specific
purpose of this study is to apply recently developed strategic theories of
bargaining with private information to data on wage settlements and strike
duration. The broader aim of this research is to develop a theoretical framework
which is consistent with the facts, and which can eventually lead to systematic
empirical analyses of important policy issues in collective bargaining. Some of
these policy issues include the treatment of eligibility for unemployment
compensation and other welfare benefits for striking workers, and proposals to
mandate cooling off periods before a strike can commence. The core of the
research is a model of repeated negotiations in which the firm has private
information which includes both transient and permanent components. This model
will be applied to a sequence of labor contracts negotiated by each bargaining
pair with a view to explaining empirical results showing that strike incidence
and duration in the last contract negotiation have a substantial effect on
whether a strike occurs in the current negotiation. The model will be tested
with a sample of U.S. and Canadian labor contracts.
