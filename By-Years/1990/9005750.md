Dr. Cassidy will use this award, made through the Small Grants for Exploratory
Research program, to experimentally test the hypothesis that certain minerals
found in meteorites could have grown metastably. Laboratory equipment and
facilities for these studies are available at the Westinghouse Science and
Technology Center in Pittsburgh. Diamonds and SiC grains have recently been
identified in most classes of primitive stony meteorites. These materials
probably condensed in the crystalline state from vapor. They may not have
crystallized under equilibrium conditions, however. The possibility of
metastable crystal growth has been raised by the discovery that crystalline
diamond can be produced artificially in a plasma at very low pressures and
moderate temperatures. Other high temperature minerals occur in primitive
meteorites and, by analogy, these may also have grown metastably. Dr. Cassidy's
research will explore the metastable growth of these minerals. If the research
is successful, certain assumptions about the condensation theory of cosmic dust
grains will have to be reexamined.
