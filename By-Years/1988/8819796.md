The objective of this research is to elucidate mechanisms of boundary layer
friction and lubrication at the molecular level. A microscopic friction
apparatus has been developed in which crossed cylinders of curved, atomically
smooth mica surfaces can be moved relative to one another with separation
maintained at extremely small levels. Variables of interest include number of
molecular layers, actual surface area, chemistry of the surface and of the
boundary layer, normal load, adhesion and frequency of deformation.
