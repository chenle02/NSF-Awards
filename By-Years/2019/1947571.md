This project examines how the dramatically increasing role of a new external
sponsor of economic development, with a novel orientation, affects the lives of
ordinary people. The opportunities and limitations of this shift in development
policy will be assessed. In particular, this research focuses on how the new
development affects social opportunities related to demographic characteristics.
This project, therefore, contributes to a central aim of development, namely the
improved well-being of individuals in the poorest areas. Findings will have
relevance for development practices, national security concerns, and economic
competitiveness. The project also will offer unique and valuable educational
opportunities and enhance an underdeveloped research
infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data for this project will be collected
through ethnographic observation and interviews at three sponsored development
projects: a hydroelectric dam, an industrial park, and a large-scale
agricultural project. These field sites represent the main categories of
sponsored projects: infrastructure projects, industrial zones, and agriculture
projects. Six months of ethnographic fieldwork will be conducted over the course
of the project and will focus on observing everyday social interactions at the
sites. Approximately 350 interviews will be conducted with a wide range of
informants, including workers, government officials, and business people. By
comparing social dynamics across the three field sites, this project will show
how the three types of sponsored projects differ with regard to benefits and
costs for ordinary people. More broadly, this research will provide a much-
needed comparison between the new sponsored development and long-standing
development efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
