Objective: The objective of this program is to explore the feasibility of
photonic devices on paper substrates, with the ultimate goal of developing a new
paradigm of ultra low cost photonics printed on paper using roll-to-roll
approaches.

Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in combining of one of the oldest
and most widely utilized natural materials ? paper (cellulose) ? with one of the
newest and most exciting categories of devices ? photonics. Paper is a very
attractive substrate material for selected device applications: very low cost,
available in almost any size (from pre-cut to roll-to-roll), versatile (surface
finishes can greatly alter its properties), portable (light weight) and
flexible. The photonics-on-paper is a transformative concept that has
possibility of revolutionizing the field of photonics by enabling ultra low cost
fabrication of integrated chips on the most ubiquitous renewable and
biodegradable material.

Broader Impacts: The broader national impacts are: (a) potential revival of the
American photonics industry, which has experienced loss of initiative and market
share to Asia-based competitors, through close collaboration with American paper
companies; (b) potential for using low-cost photonics in the developing world,
where cost is paramount; (c) significant step forward in the development of
?green? devices through the use of a renewable natural material as a major
component. The broader local impacts are: (d) involvement of undergraduate
engineering students in research projects through specifically designed capstone
?senior projects? in Electrical Engineering; (e) increase in underrepresented
student participation through the Emerging Ethnic Engineers Program and the Rowe
Center for Women.
