The purpose of this project is to advance the principal investigator's research
in the development of various aspects of harmonic analysis and partial
differential equations. The main foci of the project will be the study of
"critical elements" in critical nonlinear and wave equations, the study of
universal profiles for blow-up solutions, the study of defocusing energy
supercritical wave equations, the development of the connection between issues
of uniqueness of solutions to parabolic and dispersive equations with Hardy's
uncertainty principle for the Fourier transform, the study of local and global
inverse problems, and the development of the theory of homogenization for
elliptic equations and systems on Lipschitz domains.

Many of the topics under study in this project have their origins in problems
coming from physics, engineering, and biotechnology. It is hoped that the
proposed research will have a synergistic effect between those fields and the
mathematical fields of analysis and geometry. One prominent feature of the
proposal is the principal investigator's collaborative research with female
mathematicians. The broader impacts of the project reside in the wide
dissemination of the results obtained, through publication of articles and
monographs and through lectures, courses, and web-sites, in the training of
students and postdocs, in the increased participation of underrepresented
groups, and in the many connections with other fields of science and technology.
