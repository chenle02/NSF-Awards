What are the nature and consequences of genetic and body-shape differentiation
in natural populations of fishes? This empirical system involves body shape in
small fishes exposed to varied predation risk from larger fishes. Preliminary
results indicate that at least four species of livebearing fishes from disparate
regions diversify in a similar manner across predatory environments. This shared
axis of differentiation explains 37% of shape variation among all fish,
regardless of species. Preliminary performance data suggest that the strong axis
of shape change between predator-prone and predator-free habitats is positively
correlated with explosive swimming speed, but negatively related to endurance
swimming. This tradeoff (divergent natural selection) is a likely cause of
diversification. The goals of this project are to develop a general method for
partitioning genetic and phenotypic differentiation into shared (general) and
unique (species- or population-specific) responses. This theoretical framework
stem from an important group of fishes that face many conservation challenges
involving at least three extinctions and seven endangered or threatened species
in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is the core of a larger
project that establishes an international collaboration with a molecular
geneticist and a community ecologist. Mexican scientists and their students will
work collaterally and be trained in morphometrics by the PI. Synergistic efforts
will also involve an environmental physiologist and graduate student in the
mechanisms of the tradeoff in performance. A graduate student, technician, and
undergraduate students will be trained during this project. &lt;br/&gt;
