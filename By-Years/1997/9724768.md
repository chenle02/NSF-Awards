9724768 Leng This award will support a planning visit by Professor Russell Leng
to New Zealand to consult with Professor Jacob Bercovitch of the Department of
Political Science of the University of Canterbury, Christchurch on the
development of collaborative research on mediation in militarized crises. They
will develop the research design for an investigation of the effects of
different mediation strategies, occurring within different contexts, on the
evolution and outcomes of interstate crises. Professor Leng's data set provide
detailed, act-by-act descriptions of the evolution of crises. Professor
Bercovitch's data provide important descriptions of the context in which
mediation was undertaken. The integration of the two sets will provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the problem and solutions.
