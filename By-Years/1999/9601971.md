9601971 Shirts Brigham Young University This award from the Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry &amp;
Biochemistry at Brigham Young University acquire a server for the existing
computer system. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) statistical mechanics of liquids and colloids
including inhomogeneous liquids using higher-order integral equations (2)
molecular modeling of macrocyclic ligands for separations and semiclassical
quantization of rovibrational spectra of highly-excited polyatomic molecules (3)
molecular modeling of enantioselective binding of organic guests by cyclodextrin
hosts, and (4) molecular dynamics of selective cation binding to charged and
polar sites in proteins. A network of fast , modern computer workstations is a
new way to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a
"computer network" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical
codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization
facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel
processing.
