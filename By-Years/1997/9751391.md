This project is a response to recent national mandates for improvements in
undergraduate science education with innovations in teaching and laboratory
experiences for students. The goals of this project are to integrate modern
instrumental and computer methods throughout the chemistry curriculum in order
to receive ACS accreditation for our program. An older EM360 NMR is being
upgraded to a Fourier transform (FT) instrument with C-13 capabilities.
Experience with this instrument is better preparing students to enter the
workplace or to go on to graduate school. Students are using the instrument in
organic laboratory as a routine method of structure determination as well as an
analytical tool to help them solve assigned chemical puzzles. In advanced
laboratories they are investigating chemical kinetics and doing more complex
analyses using methods such as 2-dimensional NMR. Finally they are using the FT-
NMR as a tool in their research. Thus, the instrument should provide motivation
for students and better prepare them for careers in chemistry or related fields.
