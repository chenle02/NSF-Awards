This renewal award, made to the University of Utah in support of the research of
Professor John Gladysz, deals with the structure, bonding, dynamic behavior and
reactivity of transition metal/main group element complexes. Specifically,
complexes of a chiral rhenium nitrosyl fragment with alkyl halides, amides,
sulfides and sulfoxides will be prepared, characterized and their chemistry
investigated. The chiral metal center will facilitate mechanistic studies and
the development of applications in asymmetric organic synthesis. Alkyl halide
complexes will be tested as asymmetric alkylation reagents, amide base complexes
will be screened for asymmetric deprotonation and sulfide complexes will be
screened for asymmetric oxidation to sulfoxides. %%% A comprehensive study of
transition metal/main group element complexes will provide insights into their
structure and reactivity patterns and possibly lead to a variety of applications
such as precursors to solid-state materials and as catalysts or reagents for
asymmetric organic synthesis.
