This Ocean Sciences Instrumentation Development project will continue
development of a submersible chemical analyzer (Scanner) that can be widely used
for oceanographic studies. The new instrument will be suitable for deployment on
profiling instruments or research submersibles, as well as on platforms such as
benthic flux chambers and deep towed vehicles, and on moorings for longer term
(up to four-month) deployments. The proposed design is simple and flexible,
which will allow it to be used for both macro-nutrients, as well as trace
elements. This new generation of the existing Scanner requires a new pumping
system and other refinements. Micro-solenoid pumps will be used that are smaller
and lighter than previous peristaltic pumps and they can be individually
controlled. The flexibility of individual microprocessor control of each flow
stream allows variable flow rates (including no flow) for each reagent, sample
and standard. This will facilitate assay optimization and make it possible to
access several different analyses on the same Scanner system. The goal of this
fourth generation scanner is a substantially simpler and more robust system than
previous versions that can be used in a greater variety of studies. There is a
clear need for improved instruments capable of performing chemical measurements
in situ. The science plans for many large scale research projects call for this
capability.
