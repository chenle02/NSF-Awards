This award funds a new approach to the study of game theoretic equilibria in two
player repeated strategic situations with imperfect private monitoring. In such
strategic situations, the players receive only noisy private signals about the
past actions of the opponents. A simple example is a dynamic price-setting
duopoly, where each firm can offer a secret price cut to the consumers. A firm's
price choice is thus unobervable to its competitor and the sales level of each
firm is its private signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of this class of
games poses significant challenges because players face a complicated
equilibrium inference problem. The PIs develop a new class of equilibria which
generalizes previous equilibrium concepts and addresses some of the shortcomings
of these concepts. The PIs use mathematical techniques to prove several results
about this class of equilibria. In particular, they seek to establish that the
equilibrium has a tractable recursive
characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many real world strategic situations are
best modelled as repeated games with private monitoring. A tractable way to
analyze and predict equilibrium behavior will have a wide range of applications,
especially to macroeconomics and to the analysis of how firms compete for
consumers.
