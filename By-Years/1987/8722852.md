Boundaries (ecotones) are transition zones between ecological systems.
(communities, ecosystems, biomes), having a set of characteristics uniquely
defined by space and time scales and by the strength of the interactions between
adjacent ecological systems. Recently there has been increasing recognition of
the importance of patch boundaries. This importance is based on several
suppositions: the potential significance of boundaries for prudently managing
the biosphere; the number of putative characteristics of boundaries that are
significant in understanding ecological systems in general; and the recognized
relative paucity of data from boundaries. This award funds United States
participation at an international symposium on the "Role of Ecotones in Aquatic
Landscape Management and Restoration." The workshop will be held in Sopron,
Hungary, 23-27 May 1988. The funds will be used for travel of U.S. scientists
actively participating in the workshop as plenary speakers or discussion group
leaders, for defraying some local (U.S.) costs for planning, and for partial
salary support for the principal investigator while editing the workshop
proceedings to be published by Cambridge University Press.
