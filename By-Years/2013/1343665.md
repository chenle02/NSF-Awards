This project will build upon the successful development of models, algorithms,
and software for planning and job scheduling systems developed during previous
NSF research. The product is designed to allow organizations to schedule their
operations in real-time and generate the optimal plan to maximize their
operational targets. Through prior research, the project team created new
planning and scheduling algorithms, a software prototype, and successful
empirical studies using the newly developed methodology of Nested Partitions.
After creating and proving this methodology, the team plans to further develop
the technology for widespread use.

The proposed scheduling and planning tool could enable companies to communicate,
collaborate, and integrate their planning and scheduling functionalities to
obtain optimal results throughout their enterprise and their entire supply
chain. It is expected that coordinated use of these tools could eventually
create an integrated cyber-infrastructure for American manufacturing firms and
create more efficient supply chains through the use of effective scheduling that
will enable these firms to be more competitive and flexible in the global
marketplace.
