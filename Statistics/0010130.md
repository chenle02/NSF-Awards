Abstract: DMS-0010130 PI: William Schucany

This award provides funds to partially support the conference Nonparametrics in
Large, Multidimensional Data Mining. The money is used to support junior
researchers and Ph.D. students who will attend the conference. Women and
minority young investigators and Ph.D. students will be actively recruited and
encouraged to apply. The two-day conference will be held at Southern Methodist
University, Dallas, Texas, on January 12-13, 2001, and will bring together a
group of experts from industry, computer science and statistics to discuss
cutting-edge research activities in the areas of data mining and knowledge
discovery in databases. This holistic approach is necessary to push the research
frontiers in these important disciplines. Leading researchers will present new
nonparametric developments in an environment that is conducive to the
development of new human resources.
