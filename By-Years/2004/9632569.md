*** 9632569 Snodgrass A wide range of database applications manage time-varying
information. Such applications typically use conventional relational systems,
which include little support for temporal applications, other than date and time
data types. The research community has done a remarkable job of incorporating
the many novel ideas of twenty years of research in the consensus temporal query
language TSQL2. The SQL3 committee has started the process of transferring the
facilities of TSQL2 into the standard by approving a new part, SQL/Temporal. As
a part of this GOALI project, TSQL2 validation suite is being designed.
Secondly, a functional prototype for the entire language is being developed;
this prototype can be tested with the validation suite. A set of case studies
comparing SQL and TSQL2 solutions utilizes the prototype to provide an
evaluation of the practical utility of the language constructs. These artifacts
will be made available to the standards bodies and to vendors interested in
enabling via their products the development and productions gains made possible
with temporal database technology, thereby ensuring a direct transfer of
insights from the temporal database research community to industry. ***
