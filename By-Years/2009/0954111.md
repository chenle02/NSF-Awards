This CAREER project will investigate future memory systems that are scalable
with processor technologies and application demands. It identifies memory
architecture as a key issue in developing next-generation memory systems that
are scalable in terms of performance, power-efficiency and cost, and support
heterogeneous memory devices. A Scalable and Universal Memory Architecture
(SUMA) is proposed to replace the overly restrictive and homogeneous memory
architecture in current computer systems. The project will further investigate a
set of innovative techniques to improve memory scalability, including adaptive
memory organization, heterogeneous memory management, proactive memory power and
thermal management, and flexible memory error protection schemes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a scalable and universal architecture, computer
memory may scale cost-effectively and power-efficiently from gigabytes now to
hundreds of terabytes in the future. Many memory-bounded computing problems will
be solved at a much larger scale, and many previously intractable problems will
become solvable. The proposed education component will expose undergraduate
students to the complex performance, power, and thermal issues in the multi-core
era, with a focus on memory systems.
