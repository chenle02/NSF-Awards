9418046 Vincek The major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) is one of the key
elements the clonal immune response that protects advanced vertebrates from
parasites. Because of its central role in an individual's immune response, the
Mhc has been studied extensively by immunologists and geneticists. However, the
information concerning its evolution is rather scant. Whether the Mhc and indeed
clonal immunity, exist in primitive vertebrates, non-vertebrate chordates, and
invertebrates is not known. The question of the emergence of immunity in
phylogeny is of considerable interest because if alternatives exist to the
immune response protecting advanced vertebrates, they may not be without
significance to humans. %%% The isolation and characterization of Mhc genes from
zebrafish will provide valuable information concerning the primordial function
of the Mhc, and increase our knowledge regarding the evolution of immunity. ***
