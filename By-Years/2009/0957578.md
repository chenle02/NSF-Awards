This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering research award to the
National Academy of Engineering will increase visibility of a more positive and
accurate image of the engineering profession by translating the recommendations
of the NAE 2008 report, "Changing the Conversation: Messages for Improving the
Public Understanding of Engineering," into an action plan. This project will
increase the impact of that report through development and support of a
coordinated national messaging campaign. The two components of this effort will
be a workshop for engineering thought leaders and an online toolkit for
messaging resources. Our continued economic and technological development
depends on attracting, retaining, and educating more engineers. Improving the
image of engineering as a profession and systematically correcting public
misconceptions about what engineers do and who can become an engineer will help
increase the number and diversity of engineering students and the future
engineering workforce. This work will have a significant impact on advancing
that goal.
