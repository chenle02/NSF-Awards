9628349 Berger Feasibility tests are proposed for a new technology for dating
volcanic glass shards in source-distal tephra beds. Optically-stimulated
luminescence (OSL) offers an alternative and potentially technically simpler
means for luminescence dating. We propose to investigate the feasibility of
employing green laser light to stimulate luminescence from glass shards. If
large signals are observed in several samples, then to G-OSL age determinations
will be carried out. A selection of 20-30 documented tephra samples will be
used. Optical dating may be applicable to tephra over 300-400 ka, the present
limit of TL dating of glass shards.
