This project will study optimal control and symmetry principles of nonlinear
systems. In optimal control the principal investigator will attempt to develop a
formal procedure to calculate the cut-loci between surfaces consisting of
endpoints of trajectories with different switching structures. These cut-loci
are the dominant geometric feature for local optimality of trajectories near a
reference point. In symmetry principles the principal investigator will try to
extend to singular systems recent results on the calculation of feedback
functions. These studies will lead to further understanding of the optimal
design of mechanical systems where symmetries (e.g. rotational) are present.
