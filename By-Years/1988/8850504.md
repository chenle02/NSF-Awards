A Model Science Enrichment In-Service Program Designed for Elementary and
Middle School Teachers in the State of Virginia is a three year project for 180
elementary and 180 middle school teachers (120 per year). The courses to be
offered were developed through the interdisciplinary cooperation of the School
of Education and the of teachers in Tidewater, Western and South Central
Virginia. Two courses will be offered at each location each summer in life
science and earth/physical science. The courses stress science content and
process through an activity oriented approach using cooperative learning. An
amount equivalent to 4.6 percent of the NSF award is being contributed by
Hampton University as cost-sharing.
