A Presidential Young Investigator Award will support studies to define
molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal differentiation. Cell lines derived
from cerebellar granule neurons and the embryonic carcinoma cell line, P19, will
be used for subtractive hybridization studies to begin to identify genes that
are specifically expressed in differentiated or undifferentiated cells. Cloning
of homologous genes will be used to identify other genes important to
differentiation. Gene transfection will be used to study function of those genes
identified. In addition, factors involved in transcriptional regulation of
GAP-43, a neuron-specific gene protein, will be identified. These studies are
fundamental to understanding the mechanisms underlying brain development.
