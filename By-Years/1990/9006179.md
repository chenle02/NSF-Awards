The problems to be studied are among the kernel problems of symplectic
topology. The topics include: Classification of contact structures and,
especially, fillable contact structures on 3-manifolds; influence of the
topology of a pseudoconvex (or contact type) boundary on the topology of a
complex (or symplectic) manifold; classification of Legendrian knots; definition
and study of capacity-like symplectic invariants for contact manifolds; Smale-
type theory for plurisubharmonic functions; metrical properties of the
symplectomorphism group; developing the technique of filling by holomorphic
discs and its applications. It is important that these problems are at the
frontier of several complex variables and symplectic geometry, so both fields
will benefit from progress in this direction. Profound connections to
mathematical physics also lie in these areas of analysis and geometry.
