The principal investigator proposes to address the problem of pole placement by
dynamic compensation for time-invariant linear control systems. One goal is to
find sufficient and almost necessary conditions for the pole placemnt map with
real dynamic compensators tobe onto, giving exact bounds for the minimal order
real compensator. Another is to study various topological questions related to
the space of multivariable linear systems with a fixed McMillan degree leading
to a comparative analysis of physically natural compactifications. The pole
placement problem is fundamental in linear systems theory. Linear systems remain
important in many applied situations.
