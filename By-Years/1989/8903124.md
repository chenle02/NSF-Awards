This project represents an intensive collaborative research effort directed
towards a comprehensive revision and simplification of the classification of the
finite simple groups. A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.
It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as physics and chemistry. The
fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of
the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the classification of
finite simple groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal
pages. The research supported is a joint effort to produce a self-contained,
simplified and coherent treatment of this proof.
