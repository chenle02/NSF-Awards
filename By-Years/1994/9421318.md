9421318 O'Neil The research focuses on the physics of single-species plasmas-
pure electron and pure ion plasmas. It includes both experiment and theory and
places a great deal of emphasis on characterizing the fundamental properties of
these systems. The plasmas are magnetically trapped in simple geometrical
configurations where by a combination of theory and experiment it is possible to
extract information crucial to a physical understanding of the plasma state of
matter. ***
