The goal of this project is to broaden our understanding of many topological
aspects of spatial graphs, and make it possible to answer larger questions about
its external three-dimensional space (or three-space) and biological mechanisms.
A graph is a set of points called vertices and curves between the points called
edges. A spatial graph is a graph that is sitting in three-space. A spatial
graph can be very complicated and knotted. Spatial graph theory is a recent
field which grew out of knot theory, the study of knotted circles in three-
space. In addition to contributing to our understanding of connections between
spatial graphs and their surrounding three-space, this project has direct
applications to biological questions. Knot theory has become important within
the life sciences, in the field of DNA Topology. Most of the DNA that is worked
with in laboratories is in small circular molecules that are called plasmids.
Circular DNA also appears in nature. Plasmids can naturally be modeled with
knots. With every cell division the DNA is copied in a process called
replication. This is a complicated process that involves a number of enzymes.
After replication the two new plasmids are linked (or catenated) and sometimes
knotted. The reason for knotting is not completely understood. In the middle of
replication DNA forms the more complicated structures, that of a knotted graph,
this is an area of DNA topology that has yet to be investigated by
mathematicians. This project will have immediate contributions to our biological
understanding of DNA replication.

In particular, the PI will focus on three main projects centering around
spatial graphs: First, the PI will study a number of aspects of Legendrian
graphs. Central results in contact geometry use Legendrian graphs in their
proofs. Thus this opens an exciting new area with great potential. These
projects will increase the overall understanding of Legendrian graphs, further
increasing their potential to use Legendrian graphs as a tool to understand
3-manifolds, and potentially distinguish contact structures. Second, the PI will
develop new invariants and better understand existing invariants of spatial
graphs and knots, including graph Floer homology. Third, the PI will begin
classification of unknotting number one theta-graphs to understand unknotting in
DNA replication intermediates.
