This project will complete the computerization of the Florida Museum of Natural
History mollusc collection by 1996. This collection has international importance
to the malacological studies and the FLMNH is a leading center for malacology
research. Computerization and curation of this collection will enhance its use
in biodiversity studies, systematic and ecological research and conservation
efforts.
