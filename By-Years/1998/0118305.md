This grant will provide support towards a conference to bring together the
leading researchers in metaheuristics, both from the U. S. and abroad, to report
their latest research tat is providing advancers in the important and fast-
growing domains of scatter search and tabu search. These combined domains have
proved responsible for providing significant improvements in our ability to
solve complex real world optimization problems in many areas, including
telecommunications, transportation, information systems, data mining,
biomolecular design, resource management, financial planning, logistics CAD/CAM
systems, water remediation, environmental systems and many others.

The conference will be held March 08 - March 10, 2001 at the University of
Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi.
