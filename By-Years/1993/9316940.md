9316940 Logan It has been known for sometime that pore fluids can dramatically
affect the strength of fault zones, but a variety of possible explanations for
the phenomena have not been fully resolved. This study will combine experimental
deformation experiments on fault materials with detailed field studies and will
focus on chemical weakening of clay-rich fault zones. Experimental results on
changes in mechanical strength and sample chemistry with changing pore-fluid
composition, temperature, pressure, and strain rate will be related to
corresponding change in microstructures of the fault gouge. Experimentally-
generated fault-zone fabrics will be compared with those in the field. Result
will allow evaluation of the relative importance of fluid chemistry on rock
behavior in the vicinity of fault zones.
