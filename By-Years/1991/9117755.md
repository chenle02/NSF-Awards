This award provides matching funds for equipment to be used in the principal
investigator's high-temperature-pressure laboratory recently established in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Items of
equipment include a high-temperature furnace with provisions for mixed gas
atmosphere regulation, a petrographic microscope, and special tungsten carbide
anvils for the lab's multi-anvil, high-pressure apparatus. The fully equipped
laboratory will be utilized by the principal investigator, colleagues, and their
graduate students in studies of geologically relevant materials under deep earth
conditions in order to elucidate the early planetary transformations that have
produced the modern Earth.
