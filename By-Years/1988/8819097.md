This project is a joint research effort with scientists at AT&amp;T Bell Labs,
Murray Hills, New Jersey. They will investigate the evolution of events that
follow electronic excitation of an insulating solid by energetic particles, with
particular emphasis on the condensed gas solids. Initial electronic excitations
will be created by kilo electron volt and million electron volt ions or by kilo
electron volt electrons. Experiments that detect the ejected particles and
luminescence, as well as IR studies of the bombarded solids, will be used to
develop models for describing the energy transformation processes.
