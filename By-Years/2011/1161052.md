Outreach Programs and Science Career Intentions
(OPSCI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With increased public concern over the economic
impact of unfilled STEM job openings this three-year STEP Type 2 research
project focuses on the impact of pre-college outreach activities undertaken by
STEP programs on students' intent to pursue a STEM career. Using
epidemiological-type methods, this retrospective cohort study examines the
extent to which activities that target first-year students influence career
aspirations. Activities under examination include STEP-supported science clubs,
bridge programs, supplemental instruction, tutoring, internships, engineering
competitions, and high school visits from students and faculty in STEM. This
effort brings together researchers and practitioners in an effort to increase
the use of research-based evidence in the implementation of effective practices
focused on the transition from secondary to post-secondary education. The study
examines factors that pre-dispose students to STEM with an emphasis on
underrepresented minorities and young women. Controlling for background
variables, SES, careers of parents and other adults familiar to students,
standardized exam scores, and high school course-taking and grades, as well as
self-reported career intentions at three earlier times (middle school, start of
high school, end of high school) allows for the construction of predictive
models that isolate the effects of pre-college STEP program exposure. Drawing on
epidemiological-type methods to enable strong conclusions, the study includes
students interested in STEM careers and those who are not. Findings from the
study provide baseline information on students' interest in STEM at entrance to
college and build a foundation for addressing issues associated with students'
interest in and leaving STEM during their undergraduate studies.
