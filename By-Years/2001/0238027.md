EIA-0243796&lt;br/&gt;Darko Stefanovic&lt;br/&gt;University of New
Mexico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deoxyribozyme-deoxyribozyme Logic, a new
computational substrate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deoxyribozymes (nucleic acid
enzymes) are the basis for a family of molecular-scale elementary logic gates
which have input and output signals of the same kind, as concentrations of
oligonucleotides, and which operate in solution. Chemical-kinetic properties of
these gates are being studied through collaborative experiments, analytical
modelling, and computer simulation. Dynamic properties of larger circuits
composed of elementary gates and capable of autonomously carrying out complex
Boolean functions (decision-making) as well as other computational tasks are
being studied, including the reliability of communication between gates, in
order to characterize the functional behavior and performance of such circuits.
Analysis and synthesis tools tailored to deoxyribozyme-based logic are being
developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this work, the state of
knowledge about large-scale chemical kinetics modelling, oligonucleotide library
design and other combinatorial problems is being advanced, and interdisciplinary
collaborations between computer science and biochemistry and nanotechnology are
being established. Through involvement in research and through curriculum
development, undergraduate and graduate students are being trained in the
emerging area of bioinformatics. Finally, foundations are being laid for
diagnostic and therapeutic applications in which individual cells can be
analyzed according to Boolean criteria, so that diseased cells can be reliably
distinguished from healthy ones and specifically
treated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
