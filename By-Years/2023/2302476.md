This grant provides support for a two-day mini-school for graduate students the
weekend of June 3-4, 2023, followed by a five-day software development workshop
for Macaulay2 the week of June 5-9, 2023. The mini-school and workshop will take
place at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Macaulay2 is a leading
computer algebra system for supporting research in commutative algebra and
algebraic geometry. It is open source, and researchers can extend its
functionality by contributing their own code in the form of packages. The
workshop will be an opportunity for new users to learn from experienced
programmers how to develop high quality packages that will be made publicly
available to support future research. The first two days, which will be targeted
at graduate students and postdocs with limited Macaulay2 experience, will
consist of introductory lectures and computational problem sessions to
facilitate a smooth onboarding process for less-experienced participants to the
projects of the following week. The workshop will also include professional
development activities for early career mathematicians, including the
opportunity to present on their research, and a panel discussion on jobs.

Workshops that support the intensive development of Macaulay2 packages have an
immediate impact on the research programs of both package developers and
researchers worldwide. A cursory search for "Macaulay2" as a reference in
MathSciNet shows 1643 matches, with 123 from the year 2022 alone. This is just
one highlight of the importance of computer experimentation to current work in
algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, and adjacent research areas, as well as
the role of Macaulay2 in advancing the state of knowledge in these subjects.
Maintaining this status requires developing new software packages, enhancing the
performance and usability of those that already exist, and training new
generations of mathematical scientists. Each component of the mini-school and
workshop is designed to meet one or more of these goals. More details are
