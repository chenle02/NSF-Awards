The investigator develops a mathematical framework together with fast
computational schemes for nonlinear signal representations that are "optimally"
compatible with observed data (e.g., a set of signals, images, or videos). The
data can be finite or infinite and the models can live in finite- or infinite-
dimensional Hilbert or Banach spaces. The framework can be viewed as an
extension of the standard least squares to a nonlinear setting. The investigator
uses this framework to unify, extend, and complement some of the techniques used
in compressed sampling theory, the generalized principal components analysis,
and the dictionary design problem. He applies the results to several problems in
engineering and biomedicine including data classification and segmentation
(e.g., face recognition, brain morphology, DNA sequence comparison, movement
tracking), and signal modeling (e.g., for signals with finite rate of
innovation).

Many of the new technologies use digital signal processing techniques in their
functioning, e.g., telephone and computer networks, medical imaging devices,
audio equipment, etc. These technologies, which are producing greater and
greater volumes of data, gave rise to new nonlinear techniques and paradigms for
acquiring, processing, analyzing, and transmitting the data. In order to take
advantage of these novel techniques, a thorough understanding of the structure
of the underlying signals and data is fundamental. This project develops
techniques for learning the nonlinear data structure from a set of observations.
It has direct applications in data mining, data classification, segmentation,
and tracking moving objects in video sequences. It also has direct applications
in data compression, noise removal, and data transmission.
