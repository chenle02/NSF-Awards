This award is for the renewal of the Materials Research Group at Case Western
University on the topic of low pressure growth of diamond and diamond-like
materials. The principal experimental program areas are: (1) studies of the
nucleation and growth of diamond and diamond-like materials including the nature
of the molecular precursors, the origin and role of defects during growth, and
heteroepitaxial growth, (2) fundamental structural and property measurements
including mechanical properties, transport properties, influence of doping and
hydrogen. The theoretical studies include: (1) molecular orbital studies of
nucleation and growth, (2) electronic structure calculations of interfaces and
surfaces, (3) Monte Carlo computer modelling of growth, and (4) reactor
modelling. The diamond and diamond-like films are characterized using ion beam
analysis, electron microscopy, Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Raman
scattering. The experimental and theoretical efforts are highly interactive.
