This award provides travel funds for students and young faculty to travel to an
important meeting in the field of microelectromechanical engineering. The
meeting is the 1991 Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Workshop, which will
be held in Nara, Japan, in January of 1991. These travel funds will make it
possible for many graduate students to prepare and present papers at this
conference, and it will enable young faculty beginning their research careers to
attend an important meeting. Participation by students and young faculty at
previous meetings has been highly beneficial both to the people involved and the
field. This field is very young, and not many researchers are well established
with research support. Thus, these travel grants play a key role in the
development of the field.
