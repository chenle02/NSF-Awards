Many organisms exhibit circadian behavior. A familiar illustration of this can
be seen in people who have regular sleep habits. Such individuals wake up and
become sleepy at regular intervals. Most of our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of circadian behavior has come from the study of Drosophila fruit
flies. Although Drosophila and mammals are outwardly very different, the
mechanisms that underlie circadian behavior are very similar. Drosophila and
mammals both have pacemaker neurons in their brains, and respectively, all
pacemaker neurons examined thus far in all animals contain a molecular circadian
clock that runs at a roughly 24 hr period. Scientific discoveries in Drosophila
are rapidly translated in a cost effective fashion towards understanding similar
processes in humans and other mammals. Dr. Holmes's laboratory recently
discovered that electrical activity in pacemaker neurons in Drosophila has a
much more important role for circadian behavior than suspected previously. While
earlier work has shown circadian fluctuations in pacemaker neuron electrical
activity, a clear link between the circadian molecular clock and pacemaker
neuron electrical activity has not emerged until Dr. Holmes's recent published
work. These discoveries provoke a new and exciting set of questions including
the question of which proteins are present in pacemaker neurons that might
regulate pacemaker neuron electrical activity, and whether fluctuations in
pacemaker electrical activity provides a output mechanism for the circadian
molecular clock. The broader impacts of this work are far ranging. The Holmes
laboratory has developed, and continues to develop a general set of molecular
tools in the form of modified ion channels that can be applied to study many
other neural circuits. The Holmes laboratory has been responsive to requests
from other scientists who wish to use scientific materials that they have
developed. Lastly, this work augments the training of students and postdoctoral
fellows in the Holmes laboratory, including minority students.
