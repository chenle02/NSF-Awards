The principal investigators will conduct research in various aspects of
dynamical systems. The investigators will concentrate primarily on low
dimensional systems. In particular they will study attractors for unimodal maps
of the interval, determination of asymptotic properties of the renormalization
operator, and the problem of topological exponential maps. They will also
consider iterations of homeomorphisms of the annulus and the dynamics of flows
on three manifolds. This award will support research in the general area of
dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to understand locally
can become extremely complicated, nonlinear, and difficult to analyze globally.
Dynamical systems is the study of this local to global relationship. Many
physical systems can best be modeled using this area of mathematics including
fluid flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical systems, and
chemical reactions.
