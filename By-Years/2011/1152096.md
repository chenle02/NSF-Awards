Funds from this award will be used to support travel-related expenses for
participants in a workshop on "Beyond the Standard Model in Nuclear Physics," to
be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, October 15-17, 2011. The goal of
the workshop is to initiate the development of a framework for interpreting low-
energy tests of fundamental symmetries and studies of neutrino properties in
nuclear physics in terms of possible physics beyond the Standard Model. We
anticipate that the workshop will lead to a journal publication as well as a
website that provides updates to the interpretive framework. Expected
participation includes approximately 12-15 nonUW Madison researchers plus 8-10
UW Madison researchers.

The broader impact of this workshop will be to enhance the visibility of the
nuclear physics fundamental symmetries and neutrinos program in related fields
of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and to enhance the
opportunities for training of junior researchers in the field.
