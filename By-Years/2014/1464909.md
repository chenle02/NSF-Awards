This award supports graduate student travel to the 14th Workshop on the Physics
of Dusty Plasmas to be held at Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama in May 2015.
The field of dusty plasmas constitutes a fully developed interdisciplinary field
with direct connections to astrophysics, nanoscience, fluid mechanics and
colloidal physics through experimental, theoretical and computational studies.
This workshop will bring together researchers from around to the world to (1)
provide a review of recent advances in the field of dusty plasmas, (2) help to
define new and existing research questions and challenges and (3) help to
strengthen the interaction between dusty plasma researchers and facilitate
interactions between the field of dusty plasmas and other related research
disciplines. The involvement of graduate students will contribute to the
formation of the next generation of scientists working in this area.
