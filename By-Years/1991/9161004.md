Aquanautics Corporation synthesizes and characterizes oxygen binding complexes.
These compounds are intended for commercial applications ranging from oxygen
removal (for example, beverage oxygen filters) to low power oxygen production
(for example, the "artificial gill"). This project is to exploit some of these
compounds as agents to facilitate oxygen flux to Saccharomyces cerevisae
(Baker's yeast) and mammalian cells. The objective of this proposal is twofold.
One is to show that protozoan and metazoan cultures are compatible with
transition metal binding compounds. The other is to demonstrate that such an
additive will enable the maintenance of higher cell densities or higher cell
metabolism rates. If this research is successful, the cell genetic products can
be produced more economically.
