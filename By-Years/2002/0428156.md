This award provides support for student attendance at the 35th annual meeting of
the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American
Physical Society. The meeting will be held at the University of Arizona, May
25-29, 2004. This is the principal meeting covering principles of AMO physics
held each year, and this award gives students the opportunity to participate in
DAMOP sponsored events. As part of the activity, conference organizers will hold
a special pre-conference symposium for students to hear special presentations on
topics of particular DAMOP interest.
