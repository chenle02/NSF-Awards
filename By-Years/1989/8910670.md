The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Dr. Zwier to investigate
the structure and dynamics of a general class of weakly bonded mercury
complexes. The information obtained will enable the bonding energies of such
systems and their reaction paths to be determined. The systems being
investigated are bound only by van der Waals forces in the ground state, but are
chemically bound in some excited states. The rotationally resolved spectra of
such mercury complexes as Hg-water, Hg-ammonia, and Hg-ethylene are being
studied by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the binding
energies and vibrational frequencies in both the ground and excited states. The
dynamics of relaxation and reaction are being probed by fluorescence lifetime
studies.
