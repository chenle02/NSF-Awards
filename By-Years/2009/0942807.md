Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, a
collaborative effort between Texas Southern University and Prairie View A &amp;
M University -- two HBCUs, is revamping laboratories to provide virtual and
remote (V-R) access and preparing instructional material for this type of
laboratory. The project team is developing the framework and website for the
laboratory and web-based experiments for courses in digital signal processing
and in robotics. The web-based framework is scalable so that faculty members can
gradually add more VR-Lab courseware to benefit more courses and more subjects.
Developing this laboratory is setting the stage for infrastructure sharing
between different institutions. The evaluation effort, which is being led by an
outside evaluator, is using surveys and utilization statistics to monitor
progress toward the project outcomes. The project's material and results are
being disseminated through website postings, conference presentations and
journal papers. Broader impacts include the emphasis on minority students, the
dissemination of the instructional material, providing laboratory experiences to
remote and non traditional students, and K-12 outreach through existing programs
