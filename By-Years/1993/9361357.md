9361357 Barnes The research objective will be to conduct a feasibility study.
This study will be conducted with the following specific objectives in mind. 1)
Identify the components contained in the state of the art (LCD) Life Cycle
Design technology that have applications in medical device design. Decide what
classes of medical devices would benefit from such technology. 2) Study the
possibility of enhancing and adapting these practices to medical device. 3)
Investigate the implications of the current device law and identify the issues
that will effect the design and development of such devices. Begin to form
guidelines for documentation and design that integrate these findings. 4) Become
aware of the trends and possible direction of future legislation in order to
keep modularity and adaptability of the end product a reality. 5) Gather input
from current medical device manufactures in order to get a feel for their
current design practices and what they could really use and need as an end
product. 6) Study the possibility of implementing state of the art
telecommunications such that the end product could act as the link between the
designers/manufacturers and the regulating body. Investigate any related
database and artificial intelligence systems that have analogous applications.
7) Begin to narrow the structure of the above objectives and focus on the
relevant issues. Prepare a model design "walk through" of an example medical
device. Accomplishing these objectives would provide the necessary background
information required to start specifying the actual design tool. These goals are
rather academic in nature but relate directly to the innova tive aspects of the
identified opportunity. This feasibility study will shape the follow on research
needed as well as providing substantiated results that will be useful in
soliciting commercial funds.
