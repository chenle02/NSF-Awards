*** 9625820 Porter This project addresses several important issues regarding the
short-term and long-term corrosion and aging characteristics of fiber composite
(FC) materials. These types of materials are excellent candidates for rebars and
prestressing tendons in marine environments, and other civilian and military
infrastructure uses. These materials show great promise because they are non-
metallic and therefore are believed to be generally free of the corrosive
problems to which steel has been susceptible. The objectives of the research
involve examining the load- carrying and strength loss characteristics of a
variety of proposed FC material that have intended applications in the
reinforcing bar and prestressing tendon uses FC reinforcing bars and
prestressing tendons constructed using long-fiber glass strands and aramid or
carbon-fibers embedded in a vinyl ester or epoxy matrix will be examined using
analytical techniques for accelerated aging. The accelerated aging technique
currently used at Iowa State University has shown great promise in predicting
the long-term durability of FC materials. This research will evaluate the
accelerated aging process itself, the most recent and highest-performance
candidate FC materials, and FC-alkaline chemical reactions in general.***
