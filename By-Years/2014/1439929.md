This project provides participant support for the 2014 Transportation CPS
Workshop, enabling a broad range of leading researchers spanning academia,
industry, and government to develop an ambitious research agenda at the
intersection of transportation systems and cyber-physical systems, together with
a workshop report that crystallizes this agenda. The workshop addresses an
important area of exploration problems of great impact to society: cyber-
physical systems in the automotive and aerospace domains, including connected
vehicles and their security, safety, and verification, stand to save time, fuel
costs, and lives lost to accidents. The project supports community building and
ensures multiple and diverse perspectives are included.
