This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science
and Engineering" (NSF 01-157). This research project aims to demonstrate the
feasibility of using carbon nanotubes for nanodimensional optoelectronic
devices. Preliminary results have shown that optical activity in the visible
spectrum is induced with additions of ruthenium to multiwall carbon nanotubes
(MWNTs). This project will focus on in-situ doping MWNTs with other optically
active materials, in particular rare earth elements, by introducing proper
organic precursors during the chemical-vapor-deposition growth. Through this
chemical vapor deposition process, rare-earth elements will be introduced into
the nanotube architectures, leading to luminescent behavior in the visible
spectrum. The advantage of using a nanotube host is that the luminescent
particles can be confined to dimensions of a few nanometers. Since the
deposition temperatures are low (~600 degrees C) it will also be possible to
directly deposit the materials directly onto display glass and other device
substrates. The research program will support the involvement of an
undergraduate and graduate student, who will have a unique opportunity to pursue
research at the cutting edge of nanoscience and
nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since nanotubes can be patterned on various
device substrates such as silicon and glass, revolutionary advances in
nanodimensional optoelectronic devices, such as high-resolution information
displays are now possible. The research program will educate both undergraduate
and graduate students from the Pennsylvania State University in the emerging,
interdisciplinary field of nanoscience and nanotechnology. Since these areas are
high priority ones in the academic, industrial, and government laboratory
sectors, these students will be highly competitive in these and related job
markets. &lt;br/&gt;
