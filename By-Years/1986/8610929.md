This research project will combine a field study of building cladding
performance during the Mexico earthquake of 1985 with supporting analytical and
laboratory experimental studies of cladding/connection systems typical of
practice. The primary objective of the research is to develop a functional
understanding of the role that nonstructural cladding and interior partitions
play in the structural performance of buildings under severe ground motion
conditions. The research effort consists of a nonstructural damage survey and
evaluation for selected buildings in Mexico City; laboratory testing of
identified representative cladding connections; and an analytical study of two
case study buildings for cladding-structure interaction effects.
