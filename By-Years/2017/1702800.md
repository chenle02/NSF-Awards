Wearable electronic devices for advanced applications like augmented or virtual
reality typically generate large amounts of data. Using wireless links to
deliver such data avoids the need for cumbersome cables, yet conventional
wireless technologies do not support the gigabits per second throughput
envisioned by these emerging applications. Millimeter wave communication is one
solution to provide wearable electronic devices with higher data rates and lower
latency. This research is aimed at providing a rigorous and systematic design of
the key aspects of a millimeter wave wearable network. The emphasis is placed on
designing important aspects of the system that will permit operation in crowded
areas with many people using wearable devices. Broader impacts include teaching,
mentoring, participation of underrepresented groups, community outreach through
demonstrations and videos, and technology transfer through collaborations with
industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses the
fundamentals of communication in millimeter wave wearable links at the physical
layer and medium access control layers. On the theoretical side, this project
develops new mathematical tools for estimating millimeter wave channels and
devises new algorithms for communicating in millimeter wave multiple antenna
channels incorporating array constraints. It also creates new protocols, which
are designed from the ground up to include multiple antenna capabilities not
found in existing millimeter wave medium access control protocol work. On the
practical side, this project creates channel models that incorporate array
geometry, orientation, and blockage effects tailored to the wearable setting. It
also implements key aspects of the algorithms in a testbed to validate the
theoretical hypotheses and provide refinements to models. Outcomes of this
research include rapidly re-configurable and robust high bandwidth millimeter
wave communication links for wearable devices.
