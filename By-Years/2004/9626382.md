9626382 Mazzeo This proposal is in the general area of geometric and microlocal
analysis. The investigator intends to continue the development of degenerate
pseudodifferential techniques and to apply them to scattering theory and
spectral analysis of elliptic partial differential equations. These techniques
involve explicit geometric constructions of parametrics and generalized inverses
for degenerate elliptic operators. Many problems in physics and geometry can be
described by systems of partial differential equations. Elliptic partial
differential equations - describing, for example, various heat flow phenomena -
form a particularly well-developed branch within the theory of partial
differential equations. The proposed research deals with the 'singular' aspect
of elliptic differential equations which are theoretically more difficult than
the smooth case.
