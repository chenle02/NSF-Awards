This proposal will examine a method of internal temperature compensation in
bonded rare-earth permanent magnets. Emphasis will be on neodymium-iron-boron
magnets, which have a strong temperature dependence of the spontaneous
magnetization in the range of 0 to +150 C. Coarse powders of the main magnetic
constituent will be blended with a second hard magnetic material that displays
an opposite temperature coefficient of magnetization. Suitable alloy
compositions will be identified, a model developed, and blends tested in Phase
I.
