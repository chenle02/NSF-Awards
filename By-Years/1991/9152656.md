This project results in the addition of automatic identification equipment
(primarily bar code equipment) to the present manufacturing systems design lab.
The equipment is used to enhance the treatment of integrated materials handling
systems design and real-time tracking and control, and enables students to work
with various bar code technologies including scanning, printing, and data
encoding.
