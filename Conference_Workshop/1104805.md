Wasatch Topology Conference takes place twice a year in Park City, Utah. It
brings top researchers to Utah, who disseminate their latest results. The topics
cover a broad range, from geometric topology and homotopy theory, to low
dimensional topology, geometry, and geometric group theory.

The last 25 years or so have seen an explosion in the study of geometric objects
and their symmetries. Both University of Utah and BYU are among the centers of
this endeavor. There is no doubt that past Wasatch Topology Conferences,
organized by the faculty at these two institutions, have contributed to this
success by featuring top research in this field. Being exposed to top research
is particularly significant for graduate students and early career
mathematicians. Many of the speakers at the conference were from
underrepresented groups. The conference website is located at
