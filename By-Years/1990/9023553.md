A research workshop will be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on
November 12-13, 1990. This workshop topic is "The Impact of a Less Regulated
Utility Environment on Power System Control and Security". This workshop will
bring together approximately 35 individuals from academic and research
institutions to examine the consequences that a less regulated, more distributed
utility environment will have for research directions in electric power systems.
In particular, the impact of structural changes on the nature of power system
control as well as likely changes in the methodologies for maintaining secure
and reliable power. The workshop will be organized around five major panel
discussions, with an organizer and a small panel making presentations and
leading discussion in each session. Participants will be asked to prepare a
short "brainstorming" paper for distribution during the workshop to stimulate
discussion in these sessions. Each panel will collaborate on producing a summary
paper from the panel's work and from discussion, for inclusion in a workshop
proceedings. The workshop organizers at the University of Wisconsin will
assemble these proceedings and produce 400 copies for distribution to document
the results of the workshop.
