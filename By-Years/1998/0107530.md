Funding is provided as travel grants for the participation of about 20
scientists from lesser developed countries to attend the upcoming International
Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean and International Association
for Biological Oceanography (IAPSO/IABO) Joint Assembly in Mar del Plata,
Argentina. The target audience for support is scientists from Latin America,
Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Former Soviet Union. The travel grants
will emphasize partial support for registration fees, on-site subsidence, and
partial travel support in that order.
