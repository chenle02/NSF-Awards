9504177 Freidlin Abstract We study random perturbations of dynamical systems
with conservation laws. The evolution of the first integral leads to a diffusion
process on a graph corresponding to the first integral. This allows progress in
a number of PDE problems with a small parameter. The two-dimensional Navier-
Stocks equation with a large Reynolds number, for exampke, belongs to this class
of problems. We study also large deviations for the diffusion-transmutation
processes. These results help to describe the asymptotic behavior of wave fronts
and other patterns in reaction-diffusion equations. Mathematical models of real
processes sometimes,turn out to be too complicated for analysis. But very often
some of the parameters included in the model are small (or large) in comparison
with the others. This allows us to simplify the model and often to obtain the
solution in a form convenient for applications. We study small random
perturbations of dynamical systems, large scale approximation in reaction-
diffusion models and other problems related to an interplay between random and
deterministic factors.
