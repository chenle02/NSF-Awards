Current neuromuscular systems in vertebrates are the descendants of previously
existing systems, modified to serve new functions. The ancestral condition and
the details of modification are important aspects of their function. The goal of
this project is to study the neuromuscular basis for functional shifts during
the evolution of feeding behavior in frogs. This is an excellent model system
because: 1) evolutionary relationships of frogs are well understood and the
behavioral diversity among species is high; and 2) sensory processing associated
with feeding behavior has been well studied in frogs, but motor output has
received less attention. The experiments to be performed by Dr. Kiisa Nishikawa
focus on seven species chosen to permit phylogenetic analysis of functional
shifts in the feeding system. Musculoskeletal anatomy, innervation, organization
of motor nuclei, and cytoarchitecture of motor neurons will be studied.
Kinematic analysis will be used to study the sequence and duration of
neuromuscular events. Muscle function will be studied using denervation
experiments. In total, these experiments will identify evolutionary changes in
the neuromuscular system during phylogeny, and elucidate their anatomical and
physiological basis.
