The research will investigate simultaneous adaptive control over two variables
of the welding process, seam tracking and weld penetration control. This will be
accomplished by using advanced infrared sensing techniques to monitor the
thermal field in the vicinity of the weld pool. While both theoretical solutions
and experiment agree sufficiently to enable dynamic control of either seam
tracking or penetration control, the simultaneous identification, sorting and
correction of two or more perturbations presents an immense problem in
theoretical and practical analysis. This research will develop the theoretical
and experimental tools to identify, sort and understand changes in surface
temperature distributions resulting from simultaneous, intentionally induced
errors in weld penetration and torch position. Theoretical models of heat
transfer will be advanced to describe the surface temperature distribution for
simultaneous perturbations in the process. Computer hierarchial methods of
analyzing the thermal fields and the implementation of the control responses
will be developed. The ultimate result of this research will be the advancement
of the scientific basis upon which future machines may be produced that are
capable of eliminating defective welds and increasing the productivity of the
welding process.
