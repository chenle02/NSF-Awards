Funding is provided to examine the tropical response to orbital forcing.
Specifically, the researchers plan to address three science questions: 1) How
does the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) vary on orbital timescales? 2)
How does the El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) respond to orbital forcing? and
3) What mechanisms control tropical temperatures on orbital timescales?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include cross-institutional
collaboration, participation of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
(GFDL) in a paleoclimate modeling exercise, and the training of a graduate
student and post doctoral scholar.&lt;br/&gt;
