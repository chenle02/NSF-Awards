The formation of transfer films in sliding contacts between steel polymers with
filler compounds will be studied. The filler material will be chosen from low-
melting inorganic compounds of three metals which readily dissolve in steel. It
is anticipated that the flash temperatures at asperity contacts will promote
decomposition of the filler compounds and that subsequent diffusion of the metal
into the steel will promote bonding between the transfer film and the steel
surface. Parallel sliding tests will be run against glass surfaces and against
surfaces of different roughness to determine the relative amounts of mechanical
and chemical bonding of the transfer film to the steel. The composition and
structure of the transfer film will also be studied.
