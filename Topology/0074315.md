The investigator studies connections between knot complexity and polygonal knot
spaces, and develops effective methods to quantify and and characterize knots.
The project involves computation and software development as well as analysis
and experiments. With colleagues and students, the investigator explores
relationships between various experimental measurements of complexity of knots
in physical materials, such as DNA and polymers, and mathematical
characterizations of knot complexity. Previously defined functions, such as
energies and rope-length, are compared to new quantities, such as measurements
of the convex hull and of a "smallest" box containing the knot, to capture
various spatial characteristics. These quantities predict the types of knots
that are encountered as one moves through knot space. They also are used to
understand changes that occur in small and large-scale knotting in polygonal
knot space as a result of perturbations. From DNA replication to unraveling
one's garden hose, knotting and tangling are a part of many physical systems.
Some knots are easier to tie (i.e. less complex), and thus more likely to occur
in these situations. How does one quantify the complexity of a knot? What
measurable attributes fully explain the complexity of a mathematical knot (i.e.
a closed loop in space)? Mathematicians have defined several functions, called
"knot energies" that quantify the "tangledness" of knots. Simultaneously,
scientists have completed physical experiments on knots made of real materials,
such as DNA and polymers, that determine other measures of complexity. To what
extent are the theoretical and experimental quantities related? Are the
quantities delivering the same information or does each number reveal something
different about the knot? In particular, can one use these functions to create
more realistic physical models of DNA? In this project, the investigator,
colleagues, and students explore the quantification of knot complexity and its
relation to spaces of polygonal knots by integrating theory with computer
simulation. Previously defined theoretical measures, such as energies and rope-
length, are compared to new quantities, such as the surface area and volume of
the convex hull, to capture various spatial characteristics related to the knot.
Physical experiments and computer simulations are performed and statistical
analysis applied to understand their interrelations. These quantities also
predict the types of knots that are encountered as one moves through polygonal
knot space and explains changes that occur in small and large-scale knotting as
a result of perturbations. This provides scientists with a better understanding
of the mathematical models that are currently employed and suggest refinements
to improve these models.
