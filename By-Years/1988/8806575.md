This equipment grant provides a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer to conduct
research which requires the simultaneous measurement of particle size and two
components of velocity. The instrument is basically a two component, two color
Laser Doppler Velocimeter which has been enhanced to perform particle size
measurements. The device provides a diagnostic non-intrusive tool capable of
making point measurements of particle size distribution and velocity. This
equipment will be part of many thermal science projects including studies of
heat and mass transfer in rotating systems, materials processing, non-Newtonian
flows, fuel spray atomization and dispersion, spray ignition and combustion,
sampling of fluid suspensions, and others. The ability to measure both particle
size and velocity in such problems will enhance the understanding and
development of the processes.
