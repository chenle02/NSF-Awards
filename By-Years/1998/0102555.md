0102555&lt;br/&gt;Kimmerer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from NSF, the SUNY
College of Environmental Science and Forestry will provide an intensive academic
experience of mentoring, research and community outreach to 32 students from
traditionally underrepresented groups. The goals of the project are to provide
students with a meaningful independent research opportunity that may stimulate
pursuit of graduate study and a career in environmental biology. The program is
designed to expose students to the range of scientific career opportunities and
to offer preparation and encouragement for pursuit of those opportunities. The
program explicitly incorporates multicultural perspectives into the research
theme in order to enhance cross-cultural competence in the academic community.
The unifying theme of the program is Biodiversity Conservation. Through a 2-year
sequence of seminars, field research and opportunities for international travel,
students will gain expertise in the concepts, skills and career opportunities in
the science of biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biodiversity research is
recognized as a critical area of investigation by federal and international
agencies. The accelerating rate of species loss and the increasing impact of
humans on global ecosystems provides urgency to the complex task of conserving
biodiversity. All over the world, conservation biologists and policy makers are
realizing the importance of incorporating local and indigenous knowledge into
conservation efforts. Cross-cultural competence thus becomes an important
component of functioning effectively in the global scientific
community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
