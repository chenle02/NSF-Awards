The goals of this evaluative research project are: 1) to review how partnership
performance is evaluated in the STEM educational community and also in a variety
of other settings drawn from other policy contexts, industry, and not-for-
profit; and 2) to develop and test a model exploring how degrees of embeddness
among partners influence the process by which STEM educational outcomes are
pursued and achieved. A panel of STEM evaluation and education experts will
participate in an online Delphi panel whose goal is to develop an evaluative
model for linking embedded partnership relations to educational outcomes. This
model will be tested with up to four systemic initiatives for retrospective
insights into partnership activities and with at least two ongoing Math and
Science Partnership projects.
