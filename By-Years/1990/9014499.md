The project will study snow drift loads on multilevel roofs, building on the
results of previous work, and with the objective of broadening the existing
knowledge base. This will be accomplished by taking into account environmental
factors, namely wind and driftable snow, for the quantification of this hazard.
Existing and measured wind and snow information will be used for this
quantification. A second task of this work involves a field investigation of the
mechanics of drift formation. The results of the project will be used in the
structural design of roofs that will not collapse under these extreme snow
loads.
