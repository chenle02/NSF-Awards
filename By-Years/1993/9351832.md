9351832 McClenon Students are gaining hands-on experience on a gas
chromatograph-mass spectrometer, one of the most important tools used in the
determination of the structure of molecules. The instrument is being
incorporated into the organic chemistry laboratory and into our advanced
laboratory which serves all upperclass majors. We also are introducing freshmen
chemistry students to the technique in the second semester. Organic experiments
previously performed by students have been enhanced and more modern and richer
experiments are being added to the curriculum. The instrument also is having a
major impact on student research by allowing more interesting and sophisticated
projects to be undertaken. ***
