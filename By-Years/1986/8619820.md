The award would allow Professor Frank J. Sciulli, Columbia University, and other
American scientists to collaborate with Dr. Guenter Wolf, Deutsches Elektronen-
Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, and Professor Erwin Hilger, University of Bonn,
Germany (FRG). They will work with other scientists at DESY to construct a
250-ton uranium-scintillator barrel calorimeter to be incorporated as a major
component of a detector (ZEUS) for scientific research with an electron-proton
collider (HERA). HERA is under construction in Hamburg and is scheduled to begin
operation in 1990. To design and construct ZEUS, the U.S. group must visit DESY
to work on shared technical problems concerning components of HERA that are
being designed elsewhere. Professor Sciulli's group is responsible for the
electronic readout system of the entire calorimeter system. They will require
the use of specialized electronic components which must be designed, made into
prototypes, and tested. His group will develop the components in collaboration
with private industry in the U.S. The success of this project could have
important consequences for high energy physics and electronics engineering.
