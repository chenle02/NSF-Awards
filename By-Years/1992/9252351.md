In 1988 the Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy of Drake University embarked
on a major revision of its undergraduate curriculum for majors. The introductory
two years have by now been completely reformed to stress computer usage and
investigations, both in the lectures and in the laboratories. This project is
extending the computer intensive curriculum into upper-division courses. The
department is inheriting additional laboratory space in its current building to
be vacated by the department of chemistry. The project has acquired six
Macintosh IIci computers with Mathematica software, as well as six Tennelec PCA
Multiport-E multichannel analyzer boards with IEEE-488 interfaces. The Macintosh
computers are located in a computation laboratory which also serves as a
classroom for physics instruction. The use of Mathematica is being introduced
into several upper-division classes. The microcomputers are also being used in
an astrophysics laboratory based on image processing, and in undergraduate
research participation. They are being used in a nearby nuclear radiation
laboratory for lab courses during approximately one-half of one semester per
year. There, coupled by cable to the Tennelec interfaces, they are functioning
as multichannel analyzers.
