Abstract for NSF Proposal DMS - 0102279 The Topology of Open Manifolds with
Nonnegative Ricci Curvature Christina Sormani

Dr. Sormani proposes to study the topology of complete manifolds with
nonnegative Ricci curvature and their limit spaces. In particular she plans to
investigate various approaches to Milnor's conjecture that the fundamental group
of an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature is finitely generated. She
also plans to study the higher dimensional homology of these spaces. Techniques
which will be employed involve Gromov-Hausdorff limits, the almost rigidity
theory of Cheeger-Colding, and Busemann functions. In particular, the properness
of Busemann functions on these manifolds will be investigated. It should be
noted that there are direct applications of this project to the theory of
topological censorship in general relativity. The condition of nonnegative Ricci
curvature on space-time is called the null energy condition and it arises in the
Einstein equation.

Roughly speaking, Dr. Sormani proposes to study the existence and prevalence of
holes in a space which has no boundary, extends to infinity and has a condition
imposed upon the way in which it can bend. The universe we live in is such a
space. Simpler examples are cylinders (i.e. tubes) and paraboloids (i.e. bowls).
The cylinder has a hole but the paraboloid does not. The spaces studied in this
project are of arbitrary dimension and so the holes come in various dimensions
as well. The universe is one such higher dimensional space and its holes, which
may or may not exist, are often called wormholes. By furthering our
understanding of this geometric problem, it is hoped that we will further our
understanding of the universe.
