This award provides NSF support for the 2019 Brightest Light Initiative (BLI)
Path-Forward Workshop to be held at the Optical Society headquarters in
Washington, DC on March 27-29, 2019. The workshop will be organized in two
tracks to define (1) the scientific research needs for intense ultrafast lasers
emphasizing parameters beyond the current state of the art in areas critical to
frontier science, and (2) the technology research needs to realize these
parameters, including peak power, repetition rate, pulse duration, wavelength,
and focusable intensity. A workshop report will summarize the findings of the
workshop and recommend a path forward on a roadmap for
action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will aim to: &lt;br/&gt;(i)
Articulate a community response to the 2017 National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine report on Opportunities in Intense Ultrafast Lasers:
Reaching for the Brightest Light; &lt;br/&gt;(ii) Identify compelling science,
fundamental and applied research opportunities constituting priority research
directions that exploit high-intensity lasers leading to high impact over the
next decade and beyond;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Define new and upgraded facility and
laser capabilities that will enable compelling science, emphasizing parameters
beyond the current state of the art; and&lt;br/&gt;(iv) Identify laser research
and development to realize both ultra-high intensities for basic research and
high repetition rates, as well as high-average powers needed for
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
