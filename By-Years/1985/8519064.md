This grant is to provide partial support for the First World Congress on
Computational Mechanics, organized by IACM, to be held at the University of
Texas, Austin, Texas, in September l986. Over 500 scientists and engineers
working in computational methods and mechanics will attend to provide a forum
for the exchange of new ideas and results in computational mechanics. The impact
of the conference will be the interchange of knowledge from the widest possible
spectrum of sources. The result is that those doing research will be able to
perform their work utilizing the latest knowledge. The impact on current and
future research in computational mechanics will be significant.
