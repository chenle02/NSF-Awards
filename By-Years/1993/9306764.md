This project is centered on studies of soil microorganisms growing at relatively
low temperatures (five degrees centigrade). The properties of the enzyme
betagalactosidase are being studied in these organism in order to understand how
protein structure dictates the temperature optimum of an enzyme's activity. The
genes encoding these activities are being cloned from Arthrobacter strains and
compared with information found for other microorganisms with higher growth
temperatures. Creative selection procedures are also being developed to isolate
microorganisms with other novel betagalactosidases. %%% The dominant environment
of the earth and its oceans is below twenty degrees centigrade, and there is a
rich source of diverse microorganisms which have evolved to grow in the cold.
Enzymes active at low temperatures could be used in food processing,
bioremediation, and molecular biology.
