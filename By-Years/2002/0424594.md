Funds are provided to complete taphonomic and paleobiologic work on a series of
highly significant bonebeds containing the largest concentration of Late
Cretaceous dinosaurs and associated vertebrates found in either ancient polar
region. These paleontologic studies will be integrated with the development of a
sequence stratigraphic framework, including a description of fossil soils and
fluvial sedimentology, to provide comprehensive documentation of an ancient
Arctic terrestrial/coastal ecosystem during a "greenhouse" period in Earth's
history by: 1) testing hypotheses from previous paleobiologic, taphonomic,
paleobiogeographic and paleoclimatic work regarding the ancient arctic
terrestrial ecosystem; 2) establishing high resolution litho- and
chronostratigraphic framework for the dinosaur-rich succession within the Prince
Creek Formation; 3) integrating multidisciplinary data to produce a much-needed
framework for a greater understanding of the paleoenvironments within which
abundant, diverse, and long-standing paleo-arctic dinosaur populations thrived;
and 4) better understanding Earth history at a critical time of biological
diversity, mass extinction and climate change in the ancient arctic.
