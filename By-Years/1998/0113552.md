This proposal expands the capacity of our current educational program already
producing high quality graduates in information assurance primarily through 30
fellowships and a unique support infrastructure. The broad-based program
includes faculty from computing, engineering, political science, mathematics and
management information systems to provide students with a broad range of course
opportunities and career foci. As well, faculty from the education and library
colleges help to design courses and other activities to ensure student success
and leadership skill development. The fellowship program includes both
undergraduate and graduate students leading to increased numbers of information
assurance professionals.&lt;br/&gt;
