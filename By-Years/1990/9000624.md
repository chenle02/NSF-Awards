In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates project, six students will work
with faculty advisors relating advances in computational technology to
mathematical research. The emphasis of the work will be on computational aspects
of two areas: group theory and dynamics. Following initial orientation, students
will break up into teams, concentrating on one of the two themes. The interplay
between experimentation and theory will enable the students to deal, at an early
stage, with complicated examples which cannot be done by hand. These will lead
to a better understanding of groups, dynamical systems and their underlying
structure. Students concentrating on group theory will be introduced to
fundamental concepts of computational group theory through permutation groups
and exposure to CAYLEY and other programming languages capable of symbolic
manipulation. Dynamical systems will build on students' basic courses in
calculus and linear algebra to investigate properties of orbits such as period
doubling and saddle node bifurcations, Mandelbrot sets and the generation of
fractal images using iterated functions systems. As the students become more
familiar with computer experimentation, they will be exposed to problem areas
and unsolved problems on which they will focus their attention for the remainder
of the activity. Interspersed with the research program will be an evening
lecture series in the sciences, history and literature.
