The molecular basis for substrate adhesion in fibroblastic cells will be
analyzed in terms of two distinct adhesive cell- substrate contacts, the close
and focal contacts, and at the level of three interacting components-the
cytoplasmic, cell surface, and substrate ligands. An adhesion defective mutant
cell line will be used to probe for critical components in contact formation. A
time-resolved analysis of changes in structure and protein composition of the
cytoplasmic precursor of the focal contact that occur before and after contact
is made will define a sequence of potential functional interactions at the
cytoplasmic face of the membrane. An analysis of the ability of natural matrix
substrate-ligands to elicit focal and close contacts will define the role of the
matrix in controlling expression of the contacts and identify different cell
surface receptors involved in contact formation. The myosin affinity technique
will be used to selectively isolate, on the basis of transmembrane linkage to
actin, cell-surface glycoproteins functional in these two contacts.
Collectively, the studies will provide an understanding of the molecular basis
of adhesion that will permit future experiments on the regulation of adhesion at
the level of transmembrane interations, and on the control of cell movement in
development, through changes in adhesion.
