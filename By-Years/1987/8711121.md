This award will support the analysis of the interaction of infragravity-band
wave motions (periods 20-200 seconds) and barred topography. Data were obtained
during a nearshore ocean field experiment (called SUPERDUCK) in Duck, North
Carolina, during the fall of 1986. Theoretical models suggest the importance of
these motions in sand bar generation, as well as the potential tuning of
infragravity waves by a pre-existing bar. The SUPERDUCK data set is unique in
its frequent and thorough sampling of the three-dimensional bathymetry and the
local incident (4-20 second) and infragravity wave fields. Three questions will
be addressed: 1. Are there systematic differences between infragravity waves and
barred beaches and those measured over simpler topographies? 2. If there are
differences, what are the dynamical reasons for them?, and, 3. Are infragravity
waves responsible for sand bar generation and evolution?
