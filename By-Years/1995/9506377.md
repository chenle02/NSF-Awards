Ahrens 9506377 The studies of the Properties of earth materials at high
pressures and high temperatures are focused on determining the chemical and
phase composition of the Earth and its internal temperature profile, as well as
understanding both the planet's evolution and its present internal dynamic
processes. These objectives require the application of data such as generated by
this program, theory, and a wide range of observational data for the Earth.
