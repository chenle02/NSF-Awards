This research will focus on two problems in algebraic geometry. The first is to
produce a factorization of a certain invariant associated to a particular
algebraic curve called the classical modular curve of level N where N is a
positive integer. The second problem is the computation of the heights special
points, called Heegner points, on Drinfeld modular curves. This investigation
will entail the study of the endomorphism rings of rank 2 Drinfeld modules
having supersingular reduction and orders in definite quaternion algebras. This
project is in the general area of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry
concerns the study of the curves and surfaces that arise naturally as the sets
of solutions of one or more algebraic equations.
