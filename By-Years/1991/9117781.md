This research is a continuation of highly successful seismic body wave
investigations of the earth's mantle. Efforts now will be directed towards the
upper 300 km and lower 300 km (D" layer) of the earth's mantle, regions that
appear to have the most lateral variation in seismic velocities. This
information is critical to resolution of models of convection in the mantle, the
major driving force for plate tectonics and earthquakes. D" will be investigated
by means of precursory arrivals to the PKP phase along with constraints from
other core phases such as ScS, Sdiff, SKS, etc. The upper 300 km of the mantle
around the Hawaiian Hotspot will be investigated with multiple bounce S-wave
techniques. The lithosphere beneath portions of the U.S. and Canada will be
investigated by means of Pn and Sn phases.
