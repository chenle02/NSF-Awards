The aim of the research is to develop mathematical models for the design and
control of production systems. Most research in this area has been for
production networks where the services at nodes are independent of the other
nodes. This research concentrates on networks with intricate dependencies
between nodes, and on the intelligent, node- interdependent routing of parts.
The object is to characterize the stationary probability distribution that
describes throughput rates, bottlenecks, costs, and parts travel time for such
networks. Such performance measures will form the core of a new generation of
intelligent computer-monitored production flows in both large and small
businesses.
