As the fertilized egg develops into an embryo, its shape changes dramatically as
it gradually transforms into a recognizable animal, a process known as
morphogenesis. Two of the major cellular movements that shape animal embryos are
rearrangement of cells in a preferred direction, and spreading of cell sheets.
Both processes require parts of moving cells to extend in very specific
directions. The Hardin laboratory will investigate directed movements of cell
sheets, using the embryonic epidermis of the nematode, C. elegans, as a model
system. They seek to answer the following questions: (1) What events during
epidermal morphogenesis are regulated by the dishevelled family member DSH-2?
DSH-2 is required for cell rearrangement in the dorsal hypodermis, and for the
subsequent epiboly event known as ventral enclosure. They will analyze the
defects in dsh-2 embryos dynamically, using computer-assisted microscopy,
analysis of fluorescent proteins in living embryos using the green fluorescent
protein, and markers for the cytoskeleton and differentiation. (2) What cells
require DSH-2 function for epidermal morphogenesis? They will determine the
localization of DSH-2 during morphogenesis, and drive DSH-2 expression in
specific tissues. (3) What molecular pathways require DSH-2 during epithelial
morphogenesis? They will use deletion constructs to identify which parts of
DSH-2 are required for epidermal morphogenesis. They will also investigate the
relationship between the maternally acting Frizzled MOM-5, other candidate
Wnt/Frizzled molecules, and DSH-2. (4) What other genes act maternally to
regulate epidermal morphogenesis in C. elegans? The Hardin laboratory has
conducted an extensive pilot screen for additional genes that act in early steps
of epidermal morphogenesis. They will analyze candidate mutants, using standard
techniques. As a result of these studies, the Hardin laboratory will gain
fundamental insights into regulation of polarized movement of epithelial sheets,
a process that is fundamental to many processes in embryonic development.
