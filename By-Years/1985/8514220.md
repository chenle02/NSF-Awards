This is an experimental project on the general topic of dynamic friction.
Friction processes under dynamic conditions are poorly understood and
quantitative relations describing frictional behavior are lacking. This project
performs well controlled measurements of dynamic frictional relations under
unsteady loading and sliding conditions. The data are analyzed to develop new
and improved models of dynamic friction. The results will contribute to the
general tribological knowledge and will also impact machine dynamic analysis,
motion control system designs, and machinery diagnostics.
