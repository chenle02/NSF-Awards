Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenges in Ecological Science and the National
Ecological Observatory Network &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ecological Society of
America proposes two activities that explore the connections between current
ecological science and the opportunities afforded by NEON. One component of the
proposed work is the development of a technical paper that describes current
ecological challenges and how they might be met by a program such as NEON. The
paper will also highlight elements that will be useful in planning the new
network. The second element is the development of a CD that visually and
concisely encapsulates the objectives of the NEON program. These objectives will
be attained through a series of workshops sponsored by the ESA.&lt;br/&gt;
