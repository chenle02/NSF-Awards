There exists a severe shortage of experimental data pertinent to basic
deformation processes such as forging, extrusion, and rolling. The lack of
appropriate data has been a major obstacle to progress in understanding the
fundamental mechanics and materials science associated with forming. Funds will
be used to purchase a custom-built, special performance load frame to equip the
deformation processes laboratory. The hydraulic system on the frame can deliver
large loads and high displacement rates simultaneously. Such capabilities do not
exist on the large majority of load frames but are needed to access the regimes
of stress and strain rate typical of industrial forming processes. The load
frame will be used for a variety of forming experiments in support of the goals
to better understand deformation processes and to develop accurate simulation
methods for such processes. The research emphasizes tightly coupled
experimentation and model development using unique experiments that are designed
especially to isolate particular physical phenomena. Such data motivate the
structure of forming models and provide the bases to assess modeling
assumptions. The deformation process laboratory will be a general purpose
facility suitable for studying a wide range of deformation processes, evaluating
constitutive model parameters of workpiece materials, and performing tooling
design case studies.
