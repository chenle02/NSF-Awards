Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to modern NMR spectroscopy is essential to
chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the Chemistry
Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department at the
University of Florida to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer. The areas of
chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Kinetic
and stereochemical effects of substituents in pericyclic reactions 2)
Intramolecular ene reaction and lanthanide mediated cyclizations 3) Studies of
metalloprotein derivatives and gas-phase inorganic chemistry 4) The effect of
strain on the chemistry of ligands sigma and pi-bonded to transition metals 5)
Structure elucidation and total synthesis of insect and plant related natural
products and new synthetic methodology 6) Tridentate, polyfunctional ligands and
catalysts for the polymerization of acyclic dienes.
