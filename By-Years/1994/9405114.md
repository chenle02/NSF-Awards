9405114 Landing PIs and collaborators will develop new biostratigraphic and
geochronologic bases for correlation of the Lower-Middle Cambrian of Avalon and
Morocco. Detailed work on the small shelly fossils of the Avalon sequence,
combined with high-precision geochronology, will provide a significantly refined
time scale for this important time in evolution of life on Earth. Study of
Moroccan sequence will permit correlation, and allow extension of the study in
the time scale. Work will also contribute to understanding the tectonic history
of these Cambrian platforms.
