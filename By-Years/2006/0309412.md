A grant has been awarded to Dr. Joseph Spatafora and Mr. Kentaro
&lt;br/&gt;Hosaka at Oregon State University to conduct the study "Systematics
&lt;br/&gt;and biogeography of the genus Hysterangium". Hysterangium is a
&lt;br/&gt;genus of mushroom-forming fungi that produces fruiting bodies below
&lt;br/&gt;ground. Unlike many of the above ground mushrooms, which can disperse
&lt;br/&gt;their spores by wind, Hysterangium's spores are only dispersed when
&lt;br/&gt;consumed by animals and deposited with their feces. This fact implies
&lt;br/&gt;that long distance (e.g., intercontinental) dispersal of Hysterangium
&lt;br/&gt;is improbable. The distribution of Hysterangium, however, is
&lt;br/&gt;worldwide. This can be explained by the hypothesis that Hysterangium
&lt;br/&gt;is a rather ancient organism and its present distribution was caused
&lt;br/&gt;by the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. Importantly,
&lt;br/&gt;Hysterangium forms mycorrhizae (beneficial relationships with the
&lt;br/&gt;roots) with many different tree species. Because these relationships
&lt;br/&gt;are specific, Hysterangium and host trees may have cospeciated. The
&lt;br/&gt;overall goal of this study is to develop robust hypotheses for
&lt;br/&gt;biogeography and cospeciation of Hysterangium by collecting and
&lt;br/&gt;analyzing DNA sequences. To achieve this goal, field expeditions to
&lt;br/&gt;previously underrepresented areas, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia,
&lt;br/&gt;and New Zealand, will be conducted with a special emphasis on the
&lt;br/&gt;Nothofagus (southern beech)
forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hysterangium is an important component of forest
ecosystems. It &lt;br/&gt;produces abundant fruiting bodies, and many animals
are heavily &lt;br/&gt;dependent on such below ground mushrooms in their diet.
Also, &lt;br/&gt;mycorrhizal relationships of Hysterangium and host trees are
&lt;br/&gt;mutualistic. Surveying the Hysterangium flora of Nothofagus forests
&lt;br/&gt;provides a more clear understanding of these ecosystems, which in
&lt;br/&gt;turn facilitates more proper forest management. Despite the fact that
&lt;br/&gt;fungi are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth,
&lt;br/&gt;biogeography of fungi is poorly understood. This study will provide
&lt;br/&gt;more accurate understanding of biogeographic and cospeciation
&lt;br/&gt;patterns of mycorrhizal fungi with Hysterangium as a model
organism.&lt;br/&gt;
