The plant hormone ethylene plays an important role in plant development and is a
major component of a plants response to physical and biological stress. This
simple hydrocarbon molecule provides an effective stress signal; its gaseous
nature allows for rapid diffusion of the hormone signal to both local and
distant target sites where upon activation of stress and defense response genes
may aid in plant protection. The ethylene-related mutants of Arabidopsis
thaliana are powerful tools for the genetic dissection of the ethylene signal
transduction pathway. Mutations which affect hormone production, perception and
signal transduction will be examined. The role of etheylene in plant stress and
differential cell growth processes will be addressed using genetic, molecular
and biochemical approaches. Our understanding of the mechanisms of hormone
signal transduction will be greatly aided by analysis of the Arabidopsis
ethylene-related genes. The molecular cloning and characterization of genes
which are required for regulation of ethylene production, perception and signal
transduction is a major focus of this proposal. The effects of ethylene-related
mutations on hormone- and stress-regulated gene expression will be examined
using chimeric gene fusions and in situ RNA hybridization. The ability to resist
bacterial pathogen attack will also be investigated in these mutants. Finally,
to further aid in the genetic dissection of the ethylene action pathway,
pseudorevertant analysis will be initiated for genes which act at different
steps in the signal transduction process. The characterization of interactions
among ethylene receptors, effector molecules and modulatory components at the
genetic, molecular and biochemical level should provide insight into the complex
pathways of hormone signal transduction.
