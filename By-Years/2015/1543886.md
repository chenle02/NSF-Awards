NON TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of
$8,000 are recommended in partial support of the travel expenses and
registration of ten underrepresented group scientists and junior faculty to
attend the Pacific Polymer Conference (PPC)14, sponsored by the American
Chemical Society?s Polymer Chemistry Division, to be held on 9-13 December 2015
in Kauai, Hawaii. The conference is the product of the Pacific Polymer
Federation (PPF) which is a regional organization of individual polymer
societies from around the Pacific Rim and Pacific islands currently numbering
seventeen member societies from fourteen countries. The objective of the PPCs,
which are held every two years and rotate among member societies, is to bring
together polymer scientists from the Pacific region to discuss and exchange
recent advances in polymer science, polymer technology, and the application of
polymers. The last conference in the series organized by a US society was held
in 2005. The planned conference which is scientifically and technologically
comprehensive, is organized into six main sessions, each encompassing two or
more subsessions. The main sessions are: (1) POLYMER SYNTHETIC CHEMISTRY. (2)
BIO-RELATED POLYMERS. (3) POLYMER PHYSICS and PROCESSING. (4) ENERGY. (5)
ENVIRONMENT. (6) SPECIAL TOPICS. The proposal includes a running list of expert
invited speakers for each session. The conference offers the opportunity for the
development of closer ties among Pacific Rim polymer groups and individual
scientists, to mutual benefit.
