Over the past two decades, technological developments have made huge leaps in
the speed, scale, and diversity of human communications. However, changes in
human behavior occur at a much slower pace. In some cases, this has created a
disconnection between how someone might think about communications media and the
potential implications of utilizing those media. There is perhaps no better
example of communication technologies that have created an array of
misconceptions about usage than online social networking sites (SNS) such as
Facebook and Twitter. The confusion surrounding potential or real risks to
privacy, the intended audience receiving communication through these sites, and
the extent to which ?online? relationships are bleeding into relationships
?offline? have created a perfect storm where individuals are confused about how
to portray themselves on these sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this
study is to evaluate how conceptions of privacy and social media audiences
affect portrayals of identity on social media platforms. In this study I will
test a series of hypotheses related to conceptions of privacy, intended
audience, and the potential overlap of offline/online contexts using survey data
collected directly from two of the largest social networking sites, Facebook and
Twitter. Paid advertisements will be used to disseminate links to the survey,
giving all active users an opportunity to respond to the survey. This method
avoids the shortcomings of existing studies of this topic, which tend to use
convenience-sampling methods. The broader impact of this study lies in providing
a better understanding of how individuals are navigating relationships between
offline and online contexts. Further, this study can provide new insight to
organizations such as Facebook and Twitter to motivate changes that would be
beneficial to social media users.
