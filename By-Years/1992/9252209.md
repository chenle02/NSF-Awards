The aim of this project is to provide laboratory instruments needed for
undergraduate electrical engineering students to work with state-of-the-art
circuits and electronic devices; applications of these high-speed circuits and
devices include communications, computers, consumer products, instrumentation,
and digital signal processing systems. Existing instruments are limited to
frequency ranges inadequate to permit laboratory teaching to cover currently
available components and circuits. Major items being acquired include high-
performance data and signal generators, high-sample rate digital scopes, RF
impedance measurement system, data analyzer, and high-frequency vector volt
meters.Communications, signal processing, microprocessor applications,
instrumentation, and consumer electronics equipment now operate at frequencies
formerly encountered only in radio transmission. This project will provide
students with laboratory experience in these growing areas appropriate to
prepare them for professional work in industry or for further study in graduate
school.
