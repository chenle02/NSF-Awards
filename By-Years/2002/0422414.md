This project at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the State
University of New York, College at Fredonia establishes the Mathematics and
Computer Science (MACS) Scholarship Program to increase the number of students
who enter, pursue, and complete rigorous programs in pure mathematics, applied
mathematics, and computer science. Specifically, the project supports a total of
30 scholarships annually, at $3000 per scholarship. The MACS Scholarship Program
objectives in terms of Intellectual Merit are:&lt;br/&gt;o To increase the
number of students majoring in mathematics and computer science.&lt;br/&gt;o To
increase retention of mathematics and computer science majors through
mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;o To increase internship and other experiential learning
opportunities for our majors.&lt;br/&gt;o To better prepare our majors for
technical careers, and to place our graduates in companies that will allow the
use of their skills and education.&lt;br/&gt;o To increase the number of our
graduates earning graduate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;In terms of Broader Impacts this
project selects students, encourages them to achieve their best academic
performance, and enables them to enter the workforce in their fields involves
not only the department, but the entire campus, including student support
