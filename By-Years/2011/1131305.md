Proposal: OISE- 1131011&lt;br/&gt;PI/Institution: Hsieh, M. Ani, Drexel
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. M. Ani Hsieh from Drexel University and Dr.
Rafael Fierro from the University of New Mexico propose to organize an
International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program with Brazilian
collaborators Dr. Luiz Chaimowicz and Dr. Mario Campos both from the Federal
University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to develop a multi-faceted
approach to study multi-robot system for reliable execution of large scale
cooperative tasks. The PIs will focus on four main topics related to multi-robot
systems and cooperative control: (a) execution of complex task using robot
swarms; (b) distributed autonomous assembly; (c) ensemble synthesis of
distributed coordination strategies; and (d) intentional sensing via prioritized
detection and active learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year IRES
program also provides undergraduate and graduate students with a unique
opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary and international research on the
design of multi-robot systems integrating theory and hardware. The students will
also gain new perspectives on the use of autonomous robots to accomplish
coordinated tasks within a complex environment and with limited resources.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the Division of
Information and Intelligent Systems of the NSF Directorate for Computer and
Information Science and Engineering and the Office of International Science and
Engineering.
