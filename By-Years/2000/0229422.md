With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Peter Sells will coordinate a
meeting to plan a variety of activities associated with the eventual development
of a new initiative within NSF. The long-range goal of these activities is to
dedicate funding to projects that are developing new approaches to linguistic
theory and its applications based on data-rich foundations. This project is
significant for two main reasons: (1) It will improve the Linguistics Program's
alignment with movements in the scientific communities it serves. (2) It will be
another way that NSF supports and perhaps enhance a field's development of new
approaches.&lt;br/&gt;
