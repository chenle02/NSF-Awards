1630471-Akay&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of travel
expenses of 15 senior undergraduate and graduate students who will be attending
the International Biocomplexity, Biodesign and Bioinnovation Summer School being
held at Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, June 26-July 2, 2016. The Summer
School hosts 6 invited faculty members and an anticipated 30 attendees.
Attendance is limited to engineering, computer science, mathematics and
biological science students who have the necessary math courses to understand
the lectures and participate in discussions and panels. The NSF travel
fellowships will be awarded on a competitive basis based on the scientific
credentials of the candidates including their academic standing and relevance of
their research, career goals and financial necessity. The main objective of the
education program is to expose undergraduate and graduate biological science and
bioengineering students to the relatively new approaches of Bionano Sensors,
Bioelectronics Medicine, Biopharma Engineering and Technology and Healthcare
Entrepreneurship. These topics will be helpful to undergraduate and graduate
students in computer science and mathematics who are interested in pursuing
research in biology, biomolecular engineering and bioengineering. The summer
school uses lectures (30 by expert faculty) and panel discussions (led by
faculty and participants) to stimulate further interdisciplinary research and
collaborations among engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists, and medical
researchers. Activities will help in identify new, challenging directions in
complex biological science and bioengineering research. The goals of the
conference, including the emphasis on student participation, are well matched to
programs supported by the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport
Systems (CBET) Division.
