This is a proposal to host a workshop at Brandeis University on the role for
learning of the neuromodulator dopamine--a key player in the brain's reward
system. The format is to be a "discussion meeting" for an invited group of about
25 researchers, most of whom are working to understand how the neuromodulator
dopamine affects synaptic plasticity in the brain, and thus plays a role in
learning. Much of this work is new and unpublished. Only recently have
investigators begun to realize that the role of dopamine in learning may be
fundamental, so this is the best moment to bring those researchers together to
discuss the effects of dopamine and the conditions under which it is released.
This small gathering of active researchers should lead to more collaboration,
and thus ensure that this new field will advance as rapidly and efficiently as
possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
