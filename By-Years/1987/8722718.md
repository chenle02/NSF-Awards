This award supports research on gases and isotopes in polar ice cores and other
samples of Antarctic ice. During the past year work has been completed on the
carbon isotopic composition and the concentration of methane in Greenland ice
cores, in ice samples back to 350 years before the present. This investigation
will focus on (1) the study of the 80 samples (1400 kg of ice) collected in
Antarctica, (2) continuation of methane analyses on ice cores with the new low-
blank system, and (3) sampling and extraction of ice for continued development
of the Krypton 81 method for age measurements of old ice (back to 1,000,000
years).
