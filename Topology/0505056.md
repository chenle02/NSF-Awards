The goal of this project is to study phenomena relating strictly commutative
ring spectra to the theory of formal groups. One part of the project is to
elucidation of the structure of the algebra of power operations for Morava
E-theory; and in particular a proof of the conjecture that this power-operation
algebra is Koszul. Another part of the project is the study of E-infinity
orientations of commutative ring spectra, extending the work of Ando, Hopkins,
and the PI on the string orientation of topological modular forms.

Homotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the study of certain
invariant properties of spaces, namely those left unchanged by continuous
deformations. The most powerful tools for studying such properties are what are
called "cohomology theories". It is a surprising fact that cohomology theories
are illuminated by the theory of formal groups, which in turn are closely
related to problems in algebraic number theory. The goal of this project is to
understand this relationship.
