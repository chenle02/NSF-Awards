9318502 Griffiths Simulation models are now being used to predict how global
climate change might affect vegetation and to determine how different landscape
management approaches may influence that change. An important component of these
models is the rate of carbon dioxide released from decomposing substrates. Thus
an important parameter is the estimated litter decomposition rates. The
assumptions upon which these rates are currently calculated may not be valid. It
is generally assumed that litter lignin concentration plays an important role in
regulating initial decomposition rates. In our view, it is more likely that
Reactive PolyPhenols (RPP) such as tannin may be important initial regulators of
decomposition rates because of their ability to bind with nitrogen and
phosphorus and because of their ability to affect the activity of decomposing
organisms. To obtain better understanding of how RPPs regulate litter
decomposition rates we are proposing to: (1) develop reliable lignin and litter
RPPs analyses, (2) assess the extent to which RPPs form complexes with nitrogen
in litter, and (3) determine the influence of RPP complexes on decomposition and
nutrient cycling.
