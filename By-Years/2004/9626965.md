9626965 Barnes How do we know the distance to a star? How do we know what a star
is made of? How do we know how fast an object is moving? These questions are
addressed in this 1,488 square foot permanent exhibit which emphasizes
astronomical spectroscopy - the detailed analysis of light from astronomical
objects. This interactive, bilingual (English/Spanish) exhibit will demonstrate
different applications of spectroscopy that provide insight into the universe,
and will provide opportunities for students, teachers, parents, and the general
public to learn about the universe. Bilingual ancillary materials will be
produced: pre- and post-visit materials for school visitors; a "Life at an
Observatory" ten-minute orientation/information video to be shown at the visitor
center. Target audiences are students in grades K-12, and general visitors.
