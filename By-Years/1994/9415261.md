9415261 Stringfellow This award supports the participation of 10 U.S. scientists
in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Atomic Scale Mechanisms of Epitaxial Growth, to be
held in Hawaii from May 8-15, 1995. The co-organizers are Dr. Gerald
Stringfellow of the University of Utah and Professor Tatau Nishinaga of the
University of Tokyo. The main purpose of this seminar is to discuss fundamental
chemical and physical aspects of vapor phase epitaxy. Leading researchers from
both academia and industry in the U.S. and Japan will interact and exchange
ideas that will lead to more rapid development of our fundamental understanding
of epitaxy. Specifically, the seminar will include topics on: surface physics,
surface chemistry, thermodynamics, and homogeneous reaction kinetics. The U.S.
participants provide a broad cross section of expertise and geographical
representation in the area of epitaxial growth techniques, and were selected on
the basis of being the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this
proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
