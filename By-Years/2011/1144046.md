?The project focuses on the evaluation of awards that were part of the 2011
cohort of research and demonstration projects funded by the Research in
Disabilities Education program. The evaluation has two objectives: (1) To
describe the challenges to and facilitators of research on disabilities
education experienced by the projects; (2) To assess the nature and extent of
dissemination and application of the results beyond the funded research context.
The evaluation utilizes a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods,
including systematic reviews of project documents and interviews with project
researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a composite program
logic model that incorporates the activities and intended outcomes of the
different research and demonstration projects, and links them to the goals of
the NSF program. By looking across projects, the evaluation is supporting more
general conclusions about the conduct of funded research in disabilities
education than can be drawn from a disparate set of individual project
evaluations. &lt;br/&gt;The evaluation will have a broader impact on the
participation of people with disabilities in STEM education and careers by
strengthening current research projects with formative feedback on
methodological issues. Researchers in disabilities education will be able to use
the findings to inform the research, dissemination, and evaluation plans they
propose in future projects. &lt;br/&gt;Findings are expected to provide vital
information to field of research in disabilities education investigators for
evaluating research in STEM education of students with disabilities.?
