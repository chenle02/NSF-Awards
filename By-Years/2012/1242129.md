This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE: Interdisciplinary Nano Tools Course at the University of Rhode
Island", at the University of Rhode Island (URI) under the direction of Dr.
Geoffrey D. Bothun, will focus on the instrumentation tools used to characterize
physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials. The rationale behind focusing
on Nano Tools is that instrumentation is broadly applicable to nanomaterials of
varying composition and geometry, and, by first learning the tools, students can
better grasp nanomaterial characterization that will feed into their
understanding of eventual applications. Nano Tools will provide basic principles
of operation and hands-on experience in dynamic light scattering (DLS),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
atomic force microscopy (AFM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nano Tools will develop
nanotechnology concept competences and professional skills in undergraduate
students within STEM majors at URI. The new course will be open to junior and
senior students and available as a professional elective course for all five URI
engineering majors: Chemical; Civil and Environmental; Electrical, Computer, and
Biomedical; Mechanical, Industrial, and Systems; and Ocean Engineering in
conformity with the norms of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
Technology (ABET). The pre-requisites are relaxed and clearly defined so that
more STEM students can enroll into the course. The course will also complement
two other nanocourses that are currently offered at URI, and will provide a
basis for the development of a future nanotechnology minor. This will be the
first course of its kind offered at URI, and will provide the basis for an
interdisciplinary nanotechnology minor and/or certificate program.
