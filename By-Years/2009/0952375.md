0952375 &lt;br/&gt;Boler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports acquisition of
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from a foreign space agencies and to
support their integration into the existing WinSAR imagery archive maintained at
the UNAVCO Facility. The U.S. does not have a civilian SAR sensor in orbit and
future plans for a mission are as of yet very uncertain. The WiNSAR archive is
available to the geosciences community without additional cost for use in SAR
interferometery investigations of spatially continuous crustal deformation
processes and dynamics as well as seismic and volcanic hazards mitigation
research. Support will allow for purchase of legacy and newly acquired SAR
imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA), both from the Envisat and ERS
satellite SAR sensors, support tasking costs of the Envisat satellite in order
to acquire SAR imagery over specified areas of geological interest which
otherwise would not be imaged, and modest investment in mass storage and related
data base administration needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***
