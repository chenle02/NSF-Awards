This project seeks to better understand the dynamics of interval exchange
transformations, straight line flow on flat surfaces and billiard flow in
rational polygons. These represent low complexity, zero entropy systems that
have a high complexity, positive entropy renormalization map on them.
Additionally, Eskin-Mirzakhani-Mohammadi recently showed that if one looks at
the systems arising from the whole flat surface simultaneously then the geometry
shows greater structure than one might naively expect. This project seeks to
connect these related and different phenomena to prove results about the
straight line flow on these surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ergodic theory is
interested in describing the long term behavior of orbits of dynamical systems.
The questions this project is interested come from statistical mechanics, number
theory and ergodic theory. Here are some sample questions: if there are two
point masses on a flat surface and one is sent out in a random direction, how
quickly does it get close to the other? If one fires the point masses in
different directions will the trajectories be related? When is it possible for
them to be related? This project hopes to attack these problems through tools
coming from geometry, homogeneous dynamics and ergodic theory. The hope is to
better understand what typical behavior is and what untypical behavior can
occur.
