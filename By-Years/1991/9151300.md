Future teachers are being prepared for the 21st century in a computer laboratory
for special sections of calculus. The prospective teachers are Teaching Fellows
supported by the state of North Carolina in return for their agreement to teach
in the state for at least four years. Students are making extensive use of IBM
PS/2 model 55SX computers running Derive, CAL and PHASER to experiment an to
better understand concepts. One of the goals is to entice more of these students
to enroll in higher level mathematics courses.
