The Natural Science Department is modernizing and strengthening the experimental
biology curricula. Recent developments include the establishment of a new
Comparative Physiology course as a component of several experimental and
medically oriented undergraduate programs. Fulfillment of the teaching and
research goals of the university through these programs depend on significant
expansion of existing facilities. This project provides instruments including
osmometers, a benchtop pH meter and microelectrode, a portable pH meter and
dissolved oxygen/BOD Probe, a 10- g digital microbalance, a digital
humidity/temperature meter, and a Ward's Physiogrip Muscle Physiology System and
square-wave stimulator. New analytical techniques and experimental approaches
are being incorporated into several interacting courses within the biology
programs and developed through planned collaborations with faculty at other
institutions.
