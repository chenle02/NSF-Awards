The level of glycogen phosphorylase, the controlling enzyme in the mobilization
of glucose from glycogen, is extremely high in the olfactory bulb. This suggests
that glycogen metabolism may play an important role in the functioning of this
brain area. Dr. Coopersmith will develop new techniques necessary for an
integrative study of the relationship between neural activity and glycogen
metabolism in the olfactory bulb. An in vitro olfactory bulb slice preparation
will be used to follow incorporation or radioactively labelled glucose into
glycogen and subsequent loss of label following various manipulations, such as
application of neurotransmitters. By combining this in vitro method with
autoradiography, localization of the action of specific glycogenolytic agents
will also be studied. An in vivo preparation for measuring glycogen metabolism
will be further developed. This model will include both isotope incorporation
into glycogen and direct measurement of olfactory bulb glycogen after various
experimental conditions. A new quantitative histochemical technique will be
further developed, which will allow more precise measurements of glycogen
phosphorylase activity within individual olfactory bulb cells. These studies
will provide valuable new information into the cellular metabolic activity of
nervous tissue and will offer new experimental techniques to evaluate this
metabolic activity.
