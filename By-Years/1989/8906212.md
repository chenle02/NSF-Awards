Evolutionary relationships within the advanced groups of fungi (mushrooms,
puffballs, and relatives) are poorly understood. The basidiomycetes, one of two
major divisions of higher fungi, are characterized by the basidium, the spore-
forming cell, which can be of two types: those which form cross walls or septa
after meiosis and those without septa. The auriculariaceous fungi, whose basidia
typically become divided by septa after meiosis, are a group of organisms with
characteristics intermediate between the ascomycetes, the presumed ancestors of
the basidiomycetes, and the presumably advanced basidiomycetes, with undivided
basidia. Dr. McLaughlin of the University of Minnesota will use powerful
electron- microscopic techniques to study ultrastructural features in several
groups of auriculariaceous fungi. Cellular features that are likely to yield
evidence of taxonomic relationships among fungi include aspects of meiotic and
mitotic cell-division, the spindle pole body, primary and secondary septa within
basidia, and the differentiation of cell- wall layers. The correlation of
evidence from these several aspects of cellular structure and function should
help determine a more natural grouping of the fungi intermediate between the
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.
