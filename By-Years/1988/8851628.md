A gas chromatograph and high-pressure liquid chromatograph are improving
laboratory instruction in Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Organic Chemistry,
Physical Chemistry, Chemistry for Non- Science Majors, General Chemistry and
Advanced Laboratory Courses as well as Undergraduate Research. The acquisition
of GC and HPLC instruments is enhancing student understanding of a) the
fundamentals of chromatographic science; b) the utilization of GC and HPLC for
qualitative and quantitative analysis of chemical systems; c) the utilization of
GC and HPLC for investigating reaction mechanisms; and d) the utilization of GC
and HPLC for separation and purification of chemical compounds. As GC and HPLC
instruments are found in most governmental, industrial and academic
laboratories, the introduction of GC and HPLC into the undergraduate chemistry
program is better preparing the students for future employment in the chemical
profession. Also the use of GC and HPLC instruments in introductory courses for
non-science majors is acquainting these students with the use of one of the
major principles and methods in chemistry. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
