9423541 Rodgers A workshop will be held in early 1995 to discuss the new- term
Future of Scientific Scholarly Publishing and Information Dissemination. The
purpose of this workshop is to aggregate the outcomes of a number of recent
planned meetings and workshops, to develop a big-picture view, to share
information on the status of initiatives planned or underway, and to produce a
document that describes the capabilities needed by a WWW/Mosaic system that can
serve as a general-purpose delivery system for scientific information.
Participants will be invited from the scientific scholarly publishing, library,
and vendors communities. In addition, there will be provision for a small number
of other observers.
