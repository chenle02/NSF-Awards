An interactive digital signal processing (DSP) laboratory to augment classroom
courses in discrete systems and digital signal processing (DSP) is developed.
All students pursuing experimental scientific fields have a need to understand
the principles of time series data, sampling, representation, filtering, and
spectral analysis. With the equipment to be acquired a set of closed and open-
ended interactive laboratory exercises to demonstrate these fundamental
principles, to challenge the student's creativity, and to develop his intuition
and expertise in DSP is developed. The lab will be based on a network of
computers which contain a commercial DSP circuit, interactive graphical display
and sufficient computational power to perform simulation and analysis in real
time.
