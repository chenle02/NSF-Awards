&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kispert Institution: U of Alabama
Tuscaloosa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports a
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Alabama
Tuscaloosa for the summers of 2003-2005. Lowell D. Kispert is the site director;
John Vincent is the co-PI. Twelve students (eleven supported by NSF) will carry
out research with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department each
summer over a ten-week period. The site will encourage applications from
minority and handicapped students. Four high school teachers will also
participate in research at this site under the program, Research Experience for
Teachers (RET). All participants will carry out research under the supervision
of faculty in the chemistry department. They will select a well-defined
interdisciplinary program in environmental, materials, or biological chemistry.
Training acquired during development of these projects will be enhanced by
weekly noontime seminars and problem sessions. The REU students will present a
seminar in the last week. Each will submit a final report on his/her
accomplishments and construct a poster to be displayed at a regional ACS meeting
and at their school.&lt;br/&gt;
