The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists
universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the
development of highly competitive students from groups historically
underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives,
American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific
Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to
increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from
underrepresented populations, with emphasis on PhD matriculation and completion.
BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education
contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2018-2022 Strategic
Plan, namely to "foster the growth of a more capable and diverse research
workforce and advance the scientific and innovation skills of the Nation." The
vision of this grant is to provide a national model to produce underrepresented
scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
performance site for this LSAMP BD Activity is California State University, Los
Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses included in the
California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.
The project provides a Master's level "bridge" to doctoral-level study for a
cohort of 12 graduates of LSAMP undergraduate programs. The Master's-level
experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in
STEM and their advancement to PhD programs following completion of the Master's
degree. In addition to providing substantial financial support to enable
students to focus full time on a two-year program of Master's-level course work
and research, the project provides an integrated set of activities designed to
advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies. Activities
include: (1) regular meetings with the BD project directors to monitor student
progress and provide comprehensive advising; (2) workshops focused on
information/tools needed for adjustment to and success in graduate school; (3)
writing support; (4) weekly professional seminars; (5) community building
activities; (6) connecting Fellows to doctoral programs through collaborations
with faculty and programs at PhD institutions; (7) journal reading club; and (8)
assistance with applications to PhD programs, as well as fellowship
opportunities and financial aid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
