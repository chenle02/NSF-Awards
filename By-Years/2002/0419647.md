This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I research project will
develop a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer for high-throughput, low-light
biomedical imaging. This instrument will collect optical spectra for hundreds of
picture elements (pixels) simultaneously from a small working distance, enable
multiplexing with fluorescent dyes that have overlapping spectra, avoid light
losses from bandpass filters, and allow accurate removal of fluorescent
background. Although spectral imaging instruments are available for microscopic
applications and for remote sensing from the air, instruments with sufficient
spatial and spectral resolution for fluorescent gel scanning or multi-well plate
reading of signals from cells is very limited. The proposed instrument will fill
this gap with an innovative optical design that utilizes the asymmetry of "push
broom" imaging spectrometers to efficiently gather light and greatly reduce
optical aberrations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this
project will be in the area of biomedical imaging. The proposed instrument will
be valuable in biomedical research, disease diagnosis, and drug
development.&lt;br/&gt;
