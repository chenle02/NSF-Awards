This research considers the development of resistant procedures for visualizing
regression data and the development of rigorous statistical theory for practical
robust estimators. Regression is the study of the conditional distribution of
the response variable given a vector of the predictor variables. Many of the
most used statistical procedures, including multiple linear regression and
generalized linear models, are special cases of regression. Existing methods for
regression often make rather strong assumptions on the predictor distribution.
If this distribution is skewed or if outliers are present, then regression
graphics methodology such as ordinary least squares, sliced inverse regression,
and principal Hessian directions may fail to give useful results. Of primary
interest in this research is the question of how to visualize regression when
the predictor distribution assumptions are violated. Previous research has shown
that robust estimators can be useful for visualizing regression. Since robust
estimators for which there is rigorous theory are generally impractical to
compute, another focus of this research is to develop practical consistent
robust estimators.

This research will lead to a better understanding of the increasingly complex
high dimensional data sets collected for scientific, social and strategic
purposes. Many methods using regression have been developed, and applications
include biomedical research, predicting future observations based on previous
data, and the analysis of economic and social data. Robust statistics combined
with regression graphics has the potential to make simpler but more accurate
models and diagnostics. New robust estimators are needed since robust methods
that perform well on text book sized problems frequently fail if applied to
larger high dimensional data sets that actually occur in practice.
