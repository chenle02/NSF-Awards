This equipment grant is in support of research on optical guided-wave
interactions with magnetostatic waves (MSW) in thin ferrite films. Possible MSW
optical signal processing devices based on these geometries include high speed
optical modulators, narrowband tunable optical filters, thin-film optical
isolator, and integrated-optic rf spectrum analyzers. The new equipment will
allow new research directed toward the development of these devices when
combined with existing microwave instrumentation. Specific research projects
include an MSW-optical amplitude modulator that should be capable of modulation
rates in excess of 20 GHz.
