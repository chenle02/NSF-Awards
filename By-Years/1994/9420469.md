9420469 Kadonaga The third FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Chromatin and
Transcription" will be held on June 24-29, 1995 at the Conference Center in
Snowmass Village, Colorado. A primary objective of this meeting is to bring
together researchers who study transcription factors, chromatin structure, and
higher-order nuclear organization. The prevalent theme of this meeting is the
role of eukaryotic chromosome structure in the function of basic cellular
processes. While the analysis of chromatin and transcription is the central
topic of this meeting, the function of chromatin/nuclear structure extends
beyond this domain. For instance, chromatin assembly is a key step in the cell
cycle, and for this reason, we have included a session on DNA replication and
chromatin assembly. There also appears to be a relation between nuclear
structure/localization and gene expression, and these topics are represented by
sessions on locus control regions and boundary elements, heterochromatin and
position-effect variegation, and nuclear organixation. The timing of the 1995
conference is ideal for the presentation and discussion of data in these rapidly
evolving areas. %%% The third FASEB Summer Research Conference on "Chromatin and
