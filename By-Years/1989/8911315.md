The purpose of this research is to recover and describe primate (including
human) and other vertebrate fossils from Madagascar that will reflect new
knowledge about a major wave of extinction that occurred there between about 800
and 2000 years ago. Fossils will be recovered from caves in the Ankarana Range
of Northwestern Madagascar where prior short expeditions have indicated that
giant lemurs and other fossils are abundant. The fossils will be prepared and
analyzed anatomically in order to understand some of the extremes of adaptation
within the Order Primates. The disappearance of certain fossil birds and mammals
from the fossil record in Madagascar has traditionally been thought to have been
caused by human intervention rather than by environmental change. This study
will provide evidence about the cause of extinction and help to distinguish
between these two competing theories of extinction on Madagascar.
