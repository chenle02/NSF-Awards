Theoretical research in elementary particle physics and astrophysics will focus
on studies which can help elucidate the nature of the dark matter which is known
to be present in our universe, on the substructure of nucleons, and on small
low-energy effects which can probe physics at energy scales beyond those
accessible to present - day accelerators. The nature of the dark matter is one
of the outstanding puzzles of astrophysics. The substructure of nucleons can
teach us much about the strong nuclear force.
