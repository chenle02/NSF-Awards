This project addresses the lack of support for rendering and manipulation of
mathematics on the web by continuing the development of "techexplorer", a cross-
platform, cross-browser plug-in originally developed by IBM Research that
renders mathematics written in either MathML or TEX markup. Dynamic mathematical
expressions are supported using techexplorer's application programming
interfaces (APIs). This further development provides consistent cross-platform
browser support for WYSIWYG equation editing and document annotation, making
techexplorer a robust development and delivery environment for interactive
mathematical content and web services. This project is informed by an advisory
group representing the Mathematical Sciences Digital Library (MathDL). The
techexplorer plug-in is freely available to end users via MathDL, ensuring
widespread access to interactive web-based mathematics.

This project enables rendering, editing, computing (via Java applets or
computational web services), and animating of mathematical expressions; support
for Dublin Core and IEEE standards for learning object metadata; implementation
of the World Wide Web Consortium's Document Object Model (for manipulation of
XML data) and MathML specifications; and delivery of a plug-in that is stable,
easy to install, and works with multiple browsers and operating systems. This
project is a step toward developing and disseminating new methods that could
dramatically impact mathematics education and communication.
