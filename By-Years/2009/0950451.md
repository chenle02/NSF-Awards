Computing has many potential 'green' applications including improving energy
conservation, enhancing energy management, reducing carbon emissions, and
improving environmental protection. The Computer Science and Telecommunications
Board of the National Research Council will appoint an ad hoc study committee to
plan and conduct a workshop involving approximately 40 experts that will explore
research themes and specific research opportunities that could advance these
energy and environmental objectives and also result in advances in computer
science and consider research modalities, with a focus on applicable
computational techniques and long-term research opportunities. In phase 2, a
consensus report will be prepared that identifies promising research
opportunities, catalogs applicable computational techniques, lays out an overall
framework for 'green' computing research, and recommends long-term research
objectives and directions.
