9424015 George This project will provide an environment for minority
undergraduate students to experience research in Applied Computer Science. Ten
minority students will be recruited to the REU program. Minority institutions
without graduate programs in Computer Science will be the main focus of the
recruitment effort. The major components of the REU program are a summer
research project and a one day mini-seminar during the academic year. The
participants will be given well defined research projects and will participate
in ongoing research projects. They will also have the opportunity to interact
with faculty and graduate students. The research projects will be designed such
that the participants can be co-authors of papers. Such experience is expected
to encourage the participants to continue their education into graduate school
and move on the research careers. The participants will be matched with faculty
members based on their interests. Examples of projects (not an exhaustive list)
are simulation of architectures and protocols, and developing efficient
implementations for abstract data types in shared memory and distributed memory
machines. The participants will work in small groups under experienced
professors. They will be expected to write a paper describing their research and
present the results in a mini-seminar to be organized during the academic year.
Contact with the students will be maintained throughout the academic year. ***
