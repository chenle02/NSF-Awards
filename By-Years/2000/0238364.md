Important advances in understanding nervous-system function have been made by
exploring animal species with particularly well-developed senses. This project
on the neurobiology and behavior of some highly specialized small-mammal species
aims to reveal general principles of nervous-system organization, function, and
plasticity. Star-nosed moles have an exceptional sense of touch in their ornate
noses, including mechanosensory organs that are used to make rapid
discriminations based on nearly microscopic textures. Analyses of foraging
behavior, prey selection and brain specializations for high-resolution and high-
speed tactile sensations are done in combination with computer simulations of
mechanoreceptor function and investigation of parallel processing of touch
information in the neocortex. Similar comparative approaches to neuroethology
will utilize naked mole-rats, unique among mammals in having a caste system like
some social insects, including smaller workers and larger queens, to study
naturally occurring adult brain plasticity that may accompany the physical
transformation of workers to queens. Finally, elephant shrews have a specialized
olfactory system that may provide novel insights about olfactory localization in
mammals. These comparative studies are particularly valuable for teaching
because the questions take the investigators and students through a journey of
discovery that ranges from the animal in its natural environment at one extreme
to the anatomy and physiology of single cells at the other. &lt;br/&gt; Results
will have an impact throughout many levels of neurobiology, as well as in animal
behavior and natural history. As a CAREER project, this work incorporates a
variety of disciplinary approaches and opportunities for graduate and
undergraduate students, including laboratory and field work, and also involves
undergraduate course development and public outreach.
