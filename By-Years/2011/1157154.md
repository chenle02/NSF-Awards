The symposium on Comparative Proteomics of Environmental and Pollution Stress is
the first of its kind to address global changes at the protein level in
organisms, in response to environmental stressors. Investigating global patterns
of protein abundance, also called proteomics, provides insights into the
functional responses of cells to environmentally stressful conditions. The
symposium will feature the few proteomic analyses currently being done on non-
model or marine model organisms, and will bring together a range of
participants, from students and post-docs to senior researchers, to present the
latest research results, discuss implications, and exchange methodological and
experimental approaches. Symposium participants will submit their presentations
as manuscripts to Integrative and Comparative Biology for publication, which
will help to distribute the research results to a wide audience and thus
facilitate the growth of a research community interested in pursuing proteomic
analyses to address problems in environmental and pollution stress biology.
