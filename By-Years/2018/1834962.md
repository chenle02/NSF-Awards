The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a
new modality for delivering effective substance abuse interventions. This
project involves a novel virtual-reality based intervention to be applied in
substance abuse treatment. The team plans to investigate customer potential for
a turnkey software intervention that can be integrated into the treatment of
substance use disorders. This intervention may save lives and money by
significantly reducing relapse rates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project
explores how virtual reality may be an immediately available intervention to
prevent relapse during periods of craving. Preliminary interviews suggest that
virtual reality can regulate emotion for a period of hours or days after a brief
30-minute session. Substance abuse develops as a maladaptive response to strong
negative emotions - if virtual reality can regulate emotion, it may serve as an
alternative behavior that can be sought during potential moments of relapse.
Prevention of relapse could combat the opioid epidemic and also help the
millions of people who are addicted to other
substances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
