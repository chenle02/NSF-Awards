Under the auspices of the University of Alabama (UA) Center for Advanced Vehicle
Technologies, undergraduate and graduate fellows in engineering and mathematics
will work in science and mathematics classrooms in middle and high schools in
Tuscaloosa city and county. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this
project lies in its responsiveness to three current, critical challenges for
improving math and science education. It is simultaneously increasing students'
interest in STEM fields; demonstrating the wonder of discovery while improving
students' mastery of math and science skills; and acknowledging the
professionalism of teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
program will be quite high in that through the participating schools, it will
reach a significant number of underrepresented middle and high school minority
students (approximately 75%). In addition, a large number of the key project
leaders are women, including the PI, and will thereby serve as role models to
the participating fellows, students, and teachers. This project will also build
sustainable alliances between UA, middle and high schools, and the Alabama
automotive industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is receiving partial
support from the Directorate for Engineering. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Title:
