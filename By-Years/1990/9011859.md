Plasmolipin is a protein located in the membrane of nerve cells in the central
nervous system. In brain, plasmolipin is developmentally regulated and
concentrated in myelin. In vitro, the isolated protein forms voltage-dependent
channels which allows potassium to cross the membrane. The concentration of
potassium, inside and outside the cell, is critical for proper cell function.
The goal of this research is to investigate the cellular and molecular events
that control the expression and function of plasmolipin. Several cDNA clones
encoding plasmolipin have been isolated and partially sequenced. Experiments
will be performed to complete the sequence in order to determine the topology of
plasmolipin in relation to membrane domains and the genetic structure. Dr.
Fischer will study the molecular mechanisms that regulate plasmolipin and
examine the role of this protein during oligodendrocyte differentiation and
during the early events of myelination. Results from this study will provide
information on the function of plasmolipin in encoding messages in the nervous
system.
