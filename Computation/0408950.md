Project Abstract: Hierarchical Matrices in Computational Fluid Dynamics

The numerical simulation of complex physical, biological, or chemical systems
typically requires the efficient solution of huge linear systems of equations
which consumes the majority (70% - 90%) of the overall simulation time. In this
project, we will develop, analyse and implement a novel iterative solver based
on so-called hierarchical matrix techniques. We will 1) adapt hierarchical
matrices to provide an efficient and robust solver for convection-dominant
problems, 2) analyse theoretical properties, 3) implement the proposed
algorithms and perform numerical tests in comparison with other state-of-art
techniques, and 4) study possible further applications for hierarchical
matrices.

This novel approach of hierarchical matrices is of significant importance within
its own field of numerical analysis and also with respect to practical large-
scale computing challenges that scientists are currently facing. Examples for
applications include models for magnetic fusion, electrochemical processes, the
growth of ceramic nanostructures, or groundwater modeling. Hierarchical matrices
have first been introduced in 1998, and the encouraging results that have been
obtained for well-conditioned problems motivate the application of hierarchical
matrix techniques in efficient solvers for these notoriously hard to solve
systems of equations that occur in Computational Fluid Dynamics.
