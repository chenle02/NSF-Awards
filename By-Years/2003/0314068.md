This research seeks to advance knowledge in two important areas of climate
modeling. The first involves downscaling of future projected climate information
and the second involves meso and cloud scale modeling to improve the cloud and
radiation parameterizations in the CCSM CAM (Community Climate System Model
(CCSM) Atmospheric Model).

1) Currently, climate projections are accomplished using coupled atmospheric and
oceanic general circulation models (GCMs), which produce future climate
information on horizontal spatial scales of about 200 km. However, in order to
assess the potential impacts of future climates on the environment and on social
systems, information is required on much smaller regional scales, i.e., roughly
1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller that those of the GCMs. The study examines
statistical-dynamical methods to downscale general (global) circulation model
(GCM) results to regional scales. The NCAR CCSM and PCM (Parallel Climate Model)
will provide the global, course scale, simulations. The research will focus on
the North American region and downscaled information will be compared to
available observations for this region.

2) Collaborative research with the University of Wisconsin will be conducted to
examine the details of the mechanisms that control the simulations of clouds in
the Wisconsin Cloud Resolving Model (CRM) and the parameterizations in the CCSM
CAM. The work will include an examination of the CRM results, including the
detailed energy, mass and cloud microphysics budgets. Simplified versions of
CCSM will be used; the single column model that replicates the CAM-2 physics,
and/or the CAM-2 coupled to a slab ocean model.

This research is important because, if successful, it will enable more credible
projections of climate variability and change, which is a requirement for
assessing the impacts of climate variability and change on regional spatial
scales. Moreover, the CCSM is a model used by over 100 scientists and its
improvement will benefit the climate research community at-large.
