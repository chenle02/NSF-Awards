Mobile RNAs mediate long-distance signaling responses&lt;br/&gt;Co-PIs: David
Hannapel and W. Allen Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Plants use
signaling pathways to regulate growth. Light plays an important role in
providing outside signals perceived by the plant. Photoperiod is an example of
one such external signal that controls processes like flowering and potato tuber
formation. During tuber formation, a signal is initiated in the leaves and moves
through the plant to activate tuber formation. The nature of this signal is
unknown but mobile ribonucleic acids (RNAs) may be involved. The goal of this
application is to investigate the developmental role of the long-distance
movement of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in relation to day-length.
Preliminary evidence implicates two mRNAs that encode transcription factors
(proteins that bind to genes to regulate their activity) in this process. These
proteins control vegetative growth by affecting plant hormone levels. The
objectives of this proposal are to identify signaling molecules that control
tuberization in potato and to understand the mechanism of their transport. It is
proposed that the long-distance movement of specific RNAs acts as a signal that
controls growth in potato. This hypothesis will be tested with transport
experiments and by studying the mechanism of RNA movement. This proposed project
will provide valuable new information on a novel mobile signaling mechanism for
coordinating growth in whole plants. This project will integrate research and
education through the training of students participating in programs in the life
sciences at Iowa State University. Specific programs will be targeted to include
both women and members of under-represented groups in the proposed
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
