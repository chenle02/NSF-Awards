The central question that will be investigated in this project is whether a
small RNA produced by one cell can influence gene expression in a different
cell. Recently, small RNAs have been described that have the potential to
specifically turn off their own genes. To date, this gene-silencing activity has
only been observed within the cell that produces the RNA. The Principal
Investigator proposes the very novel idea that small RNAs produced in odor-
adapted neurons may act as hormones to elicit responses in the gonads. The
expectation is that odor sensory neurons will adapt to odors by producing small
RNAs that shut down neuron genes that respond to odors and, subsequently, these
small RNAs will be released from neuronal cells and traffic to the gonad where
they will induce changes that preempt expression of specific genes. The
transparent nematode C. elegans with its powerful cell biology and genetics will
serve as the model for these studies. Genetic disruption of small RNA secretion
and signaling will be carried out to determine the effect of these small RNAs on
tissues distant from the site of their production. The finding of such high
content messengers would impact all aspects of biology as it would reveal for
the first time that RNA can act as a hormone, and with such a capacity, could
provide unprecedented specificity to the process of wide-spread down regulation
of genes. The broader impacts of this work will involve training high school and
Masters students, including students from underpriveleged families, in state of
the art research. Specifically, students will be trained in a one-on one setting
to design, execute, document and ultimately publish their work. This highly
innovative and original research has great potential to add another dimension to
our understanding of cell-cell communication networks that influence gene
regulation in multicellular organisms.
