This project involves research on integrating the intentional and informational
perspectives in architectures for interpretation and generation of interactive
discourse. Particular problems investigated include the recognition by the
listener of the speaker's plan, a formalization of the notion of "conversational
record," discourse structure from a computational point of view, and analysis of
implicatures involving quantity and similar phenomena involving interactions
between the processes of generation and interpretation. Bases for the research
are the use of abductive inference in finite-state approximation methods and in
knowledge-based systems, accommodation processes in interactive discourse,
generation of coherent text, use of defeasible reasoning in plan recognition,
and utterance planning to achieve communicative goals.
