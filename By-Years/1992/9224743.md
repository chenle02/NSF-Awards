This SGER award will support the parallel implementation of the immersed
boundary method in the application of a three- dimensional heart model. The
immersed boundary method is a computational technique for the simulation of
systems in which a viscous incompressible fluid interacts with an immersed
elastic boundary Such systems are ubiquitous in biological fluid dynamics, and
the immersed boundary method has already been applied to problems of blood flow
in the cardiac chambers, platelet aggregation during blood clotting, aquatic
animal locomotion, and wave propagation in the inner ear. Current implementation
of the immersed boundary method are fully vectorized on Cray computers, but only
a single processor is used although several are available. The aim of the
proposed research is to create a parallel implementation which maintains full
vectorization while making effective use of all available processors. This work
will be done on the Cray C-90 Computer, a 16-processor machine which is
scheduled to arrive at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center this fall. The
scientific utility of the immerse boundary method will be enormously enhanced by
the anticipated speedup resulting from parallelization.
