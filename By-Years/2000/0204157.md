ABSTRACT 0204157 Funderlic, Robert E. North Carolina State U

This section summarizes the progress the co-PI has made under the support of NSF
grants DMS-9804759 (07/01/98 06/30/00)for the project Adaptive Control Algorithm
for Adaptive Optics Applications and DMS-0073056 (08/01/00 7/31/03)for the
project Algorithms for the Inverse Problem of Matrix Con- struction of the
former,the objectives are to design,analyze,and evaluate adaptive control
algorithms for adaptive optics applications.The co-PI has established a
mathematical framework for the linear econstructor problem in adaptive
optics,and has made progress in the understanding of a latency-delay control
algorithm. Fo the latter,the proposed objectives were to investigate both the
theory and the practice of constructing a physical model,described
mathematically in the form of a matrix,from prescribed spectral data.The co-PI
has collected,classi .ed,and de .ned the egimen of inverse eigenvalue problems
as a whole,and has developed new numerical methods for tackling some inverse
eigenvalue problems.Thus far,a signi .cant portion of these objectives has been
accomplished under the NSF support as is evidenced below.
