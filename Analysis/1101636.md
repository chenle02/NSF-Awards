The goal of the proposed research is to develop methods of Harmonic Analysis to
solve problems from Convex Geometry including problems from Geometric Tomography
and questions concerning duality and volume. Many conjectures stipulate that
there must exist direct duality connections between projections and sections of
convex bodies. In order to gain an understanding of these connections, it is
important to try to obtain a description of the duality phenomena involved. This
is where the Fourier Analysis comes into play. A major component of this
proposal is to study problems, which arise naturally from the recent work of the
investigators. They will use Fourier Transform and other Harmonic Analysis tools
as a link between volumes of a convex body and its polar. They will also address
and study other duality problems about projections and sections of convex and
star bodies.

Convex Geometry has a lot of real life applications. It has goals similar to
those of many related and often practical areas. One of the best-known examples
is Classical Computer Aided Tomography, which aims to reconstruct the density of
objects by means of their line integrals. Other examples are crystallography,
robotics, stereology, and electron microscopy. One of the ideas of this proposal
is to connect theoretical results from Convex Geometry to those practical areas
via Geometric Tomography and Harmonic Analysis. In addition, the advantage of
the problems addressed in this proposal is that most of them are "intuitively
clear" not only to undergraduate students, but also to children in high school
or even middle school. Even the geometric notion of duality can be explained to
a child in the high school. On the other hand, the answers are (very often)
counter-intuitive, different in the plane and in the space, and this stimulates
an interest of students to the subject. The investigators believe that those
problems will help to attract more students to Harmonic Analysis and Convexity
as well as to Mathematics and Science in General.
