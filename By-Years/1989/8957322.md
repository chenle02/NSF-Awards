The focus of this Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award is on the
application of parallel processing to solution of coupled field problems and to
the modelling of composite structures. A realistic simulation of the dynamics of
many engineering problems remain beyond the reach of existing vector computing.
Concurrent or massively parallel systems offer a viable alternative. However,
engineering applications suffer from a lack of parallel algorithms. Fluid-
structure, soil-structure, control-structure and thermal- structure are typical
coupled field problems. The structures portion includes a sub-problem; to model
the composites which are the load carrying members. The dynamic response of the
total system includes nonlineraity, complicated material description and complex
geometry. Parallel computational simulation offers an efficient approach to
design.
