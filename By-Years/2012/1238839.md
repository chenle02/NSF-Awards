The overarching goals of this project are to establish a culture of research in
materials science at the University of the Virgin Islands, and to contribute to
enhancing the infrastructure for integration of research and education at this
undergraduate institution. The research objectives of the project are to
understand doping mechanisms in graphene, to perform annealing studies to
investigate if the microstructure of graphene can be modified to determine
conditions that lead to more permanent doping effects in the material for device
applications, and to develop a quantitative understanding through computational
modeling and simulations. The research on understanding electrochemical and
electronic doping mechanisms in graphene will advance the knowledge of
properties of graphene for electronic and sensor device applications.

This project will demonstrate p-type doping of graphene by surface modification
with tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ). F4-TCNQ has been widely used
in organic light-emitting diodes to reduce the hole injection barrier by forming
a narrow space-charge region near the metal contact, thereby improving device
performance. Modifying the graphene surface with F4-TCNQ is therefore expected
to favor electron transfer from graphene to F4-TCNQ molecules, leading to an
electron accumulation layer in F4-TCNQ and a depletion layer in the graphene,
thereby achieving p-type doping of the graphene.

The second task of this project is to investigate the effects of transition
metals (TM) as potential electronic dopants in graphene using a chemical vapor
deposition system. The doping studies will be complimented with carrier
transport measurements. The project intends to find a correlation between the
desired amount of doping, the concentration of atoms and their arrangement on
the surface. A series of annealing experiments will be performed in order to
determine whether or not the doping effect is still present. Lastly, it will be
determined which mechanism is best suited for n-type and p-type doping and which
set of conditions are most favorable for graphene to maintain its doped state.
