This project is focused on understanding how plant organs grow and attain their
final shape. In particular, this work is focused on the growth of petals in the
plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Petals are excellent organs for studies such as
these because they are accessible and are not essential for plant reproduction.
In particular, this project will examine the role of two genes that function to
control petal growth. The first gene is a micro-RNA gene (miR319a) that
functions by regulating a set of DNA binding transcription factor genes of the
TCP family. The second gene, named DORNRÃ–SCHEN-LIKE (DRNL), is a DNA binding
transcription factor. When either the miR319a or DRNL gene is inactivated, the
petals develop, but do not attain the normal shape. However, when both miR319a
and DRNL are inactivated together, the petals are reduced to very small
filamentous structures. The work in this project is focused on understanding how
the genetic and molecular pathways controlled by miR319a and DRNL function
together to control the growth of petals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has
several broader impacts. First, this work is important because it will
contribute to our knowledge about how plant organs attain their shape. A more
detailed understanding of plant growth in petals will increase our knowledge of
the growth of more agriculturally important plant organs such as leaves, fruits,
and seeds, three key components of the human diet. Second, this project will
provide training for several graduate students and undergraduate students.
Third, the primary outreach activity of this project involves participation in a
summer professional development workshop for high school teachers from Vermont
and New Hampshire, many of whom are from under-resourced public schools.
