The idea that ecological processes such as competition and predication
influence assemblages of species has been a common theme ever since the
scientific method was applied to ecological systems. Such factors have been
posited as explanations for many of the patterns seen in nature. The P.I. will
investigate competitive hierarchies (species A always beats species B and C, and
B always beats C) can be altered to such that an extent that an intransitive
relationship (i.e.,) species A beats species B, which beats species C, which
beats species A) using several invasion sequences which resulted in a change in
ordering of the intransitivity. The P.I. propose a series of experiments
designed to explore competition for resources based on physiological,
population, and community level factors. The experimentation and theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon promises to uncover ecological mechanics which may
very well recast some of the current views of interspecific competition.
