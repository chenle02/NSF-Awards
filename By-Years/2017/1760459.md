1760459 (Allen). Southeast Texas, including Houston, is a global center for fuel
refining and chemical manufacturing. Disruption of the highly concentrated and
highly networked fuel and chemical manufacturing infrastructures located along
the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast can have far reaching implications for
national and global fuel and commodity chemical markets. The scope and magnitude
of these potential disruptions are largely unmapped and the need for data
collection on the disruptions is urgent. This work will develop a quantitative
understanding of the potential disruptions to fuel and commodity chemical
infrastructures that result from Gulf Coast hurricanes such as Harvey. Also
examined will be recovery and mitigation measures that could reduce potential
impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will create and deploy decision
support tools that will improve decision-makers' understanding of the
interdependent nature of fuel, pipeline and commodity chemical manufacturing
infrastructures. Multiple audiences will be targeted including researchers,
policy-makers, and the general public. Decision support tools will be applied to
examine recovery and mitigation decisions concerning critical interdependent
infrastructures.
