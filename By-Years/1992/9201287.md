Ecological theories that explain why groups of animals are a given size provide
the hottest debates in ecology today. The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Colobinae:
Rhinopithecus bieti) is unusual in that it lives in coniferous forests, has
uncommon food resources (moss and lichen), and shows a striking pattern of
social and spacing behavior, including group sizes of up to 250 individuals.
Given the large group sizes and uncommon food resources, the Yunnan snub-nosed
monkey presents an excellent opportunity to test theories of grouping behavior
that suggest a relationship between the distribution of food resources and the
size of social groups. The study will take place in northwestern Yunnan, the
People's Republic of China. The Yunnan snub-nosed monkey lives only in China, is
extremely rare (only 2,000 individuals remain), and receives top-level
protection under Chinese law. The study will provide vital information for
conservation managers currently working to protect this species. This project,
furthermore, will train Chinese scientists and nature reserve staff in advanced
techniques for research and conservation.
