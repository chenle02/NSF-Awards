Lambert, David AST 96-18414 Dr. Lambert and collaborators will carry out a
diverse array of investigations into the chemical abundances of stars that will
provide insieht into the processes of stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic
chemical evolution. The wide variety of projects includes investigations of
nearby F and G dwarfs to define the age and spatial dependence of chemical
compositions at intermediate metallicities where sharp transitions in abundance
patterns are seen, determination of Mg isotopic abundances that have the
potential to constrain models of supernovae, observations directed at
illuminating the nature of the s-process operating in late-type AGB stars, and
the exploration of several groups of stars that present chemical 'puzzles.' Many
of the projects build on previous results of the PI and collaborators, and a
number of observations intend to make use of the new IR spectroscopic
instrumentation available at national facilities and new instrumentation at the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope. ***
