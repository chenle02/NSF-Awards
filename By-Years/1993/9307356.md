In phagocytosis, binding of a particle signals a rapid recruitment and
polymerization of actin that drives pseudopod extension. Although cell-surface
receptors for phagocytosis have been identified in platelet, macrophages, and
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the molecular details of how receptors signal the
dynamic changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton are unclear. The long-term goal
of this project is to understand how specific localized cytoskeletal responses
occur in the phagocytic process. The specific objective of this proposal is to
identify cell surface molecules responsible for the recognition and binding step
of phagocytosis. A primarily biochemical approach will be used, with the
expectation that the knowledge gained will guide a molecular genetic analysis of
phagocytosis in Dictyostelium discoideum. The purpose of these studies is to
generate a based of knowledge that will support and guide future biochemical and
genetic analyses of the interactions between cell surface molecules and the
cytoskeleton. %%% Phagocytosis, or "cell eating," is a process whereby cells
bind to and subsequently internalize particulate materials. The process is
critical to free-living amoebae, who depend on phagocytosis of food particles
(e.g., bacteria) for their survival. The process is also critical to mechanisms
of animal defense against microbial pathogens, both in invertebrate systems,
where phagocytic cells may be the primary mechanism of immunity against such
pathogens, and in higher animals, including man where phagocytosis serves a far
more complex series of immune functions. Phagocytic processes are also involved
in a broad variety of non-immune related cellular "clean- up" functions, such as
the clearing of smoke particles in the lungs by macrophages. This project has
the potential to increase our understanding of this fundamental life process.
