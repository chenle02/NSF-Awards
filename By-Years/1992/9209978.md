Theoretical research in elementary particle theory will focus on string theory,
solvable quantum field theories, and quantum groups. String theory is the only
known consistent framework for the unified description of all elementary
particles and forces, so further progress in this theory is quite important. The
work on solvable field theories and quantum groups can improve our understanding
of the mathematical structures that describe the elementary particles.
