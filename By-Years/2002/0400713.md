This award will help expand the temporal and spatial coverage of climate-
sensitive tree-ring chronologies in the Gulf of Mexico region. These proxy
climate records will be used with existing data to define decadal drought and
wetness regimes over North America and examine its connections with climatic
events and systems such as the El Nino Northern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal
Oscillation, and the North American Monsoon
System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paleoclimate data from Mexico will be examined for
decadal climate variability. Tree-ring chronologies will be examined to
reconstruct climate and climate related variables such as streamflow and crop
yields. These records will be examined to assess the impact of climate extremes
on past and current human cultures in the research
area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will greatly expand the coverage of
climate-sensitive tree-ring chronologies in the Gulf of Mexico region that will
help document the existence and extent of many ancient forest remnants. The
research will provide science experience and training for undergraduate and
graduate students in the United States and Latin America and encourage research
partnerships across national borders.
