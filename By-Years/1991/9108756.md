This grant supports improvements to and computerization of the Cornell
University ornithology collection. Much of the importance of the collection lies
in its age and sources and, therefore, its record of change in habitats, species
distributions, particular morphologies and so on since the middle 1800s as well
as its voucher record of celebrated ornithological research (270 graduate
degrees since 1915). The collection of 45,600 specimens (36,800 skins, 4,000
skeletons, 1500 alcoholics, 2000 egg sets, 1000 mounts, 300 nests) is
particularly strong in New York and North American species, with one of the best
samples of hybrid zones in the Great Plains and Mexico. Part of the collection
will be rehoused in new cabinets to alleviate crowding and aid conservation; the
entire collection will be computerized using MUSE, a collection database package
developed at Cornell with NSF support. These improvements will save the
collection from a nearly orphaned status, and will make it much more accessible
for research and education in the history of ornithology and the biology of
birds.
