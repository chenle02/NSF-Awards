9406259 Ruiz We propose to assess the effects of deuteric and hydrothermal
fluids in PGE mineralization by using Os isotopes as a monitor of crustal
interactions in the system. Bulk analyses by negative ionization mass
spectrometry (NTIMS) will be performed on country rocks and crustal xenoliths,
as possible representatives of the crustal component in the Bushveld. Re-Os
analysis of PGE-enriched layers and adjacent silicates will also be obtained;
preliminary results by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
show heterogeneities in these horizons, particularly where deuteric and
hydrothermal effects are evident. But in situ Os isotope and PGE analysis of PGE
phases by laser ablation ICP-MS are required to document the various inputs of
these processes. The data obtained in this study will allow us to place some
constraints on the magmatic, deuteric and hydrothermal contributions to PGE
mineralization in the Bushveld Complex.
