This project integrates process control equipment in order to revise the
curriculum of the Electromechanical Technology (EMT) associate degree in
response to technology changes in the manufacturing industry. The requested
equipment enables the development of process control training to prepare
technicians better for the maintenance and operation of sophisticated processing
systems that are prevalent in modern facilities. The process control curriculum
is integrated with the current motion control training by replacing outmoded
segments of the curriculum, redesigning the course structure, and developing two
new courses. The final segment of the curriculum modification requires new
process control equipment to offer real-world experimentation opportunities to
student technicians. A unique feature of the Electromechanical Technology
associate degree program design is that all of the course material is formatted
for individualized instruction providing greater accessibility to the technical
education needed by the nontraditional students and special populations who are
primarily enrolled in this degree. This model of instruction for
electromechanical training has created widespread national interest in
replication for other colleges as a method to address enrollment problems in
traditionally designed programs and minimize equipment investments within
limited budgets. *
