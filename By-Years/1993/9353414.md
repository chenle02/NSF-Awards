9353414 Henry This conference grant of $74,340 to the Florida Council of
Mathematics is designed to prepare 40 members of the Florida Mathematics
Presidential Awardee Association (FMPAA) to serve as mathematics education
reform leaders, and to conduct outreach conferences, particularly for small
school districts in Florida. Over twenty months of the project, there will be a
leadership conference for FMPAA members followed by five regional conferences
with many of the Awardees as conference presenters. The leadership conference
for the Awardees will be planned in spring and conducted in summer, 1994. During
the 1994-95 school year, the grant will provide support for the Awardees to
serve as presenters in five outreach conferences for teachers from small
districts in Florida. Each conference will be planned for an attendance of 75
teachers from small districts with minimal mathematics education support for a
total of 375 teachers impacted by the pool of 40 teacher leaders prepared. The
evaluation of the conference grant will be done by evaluating the five outreach
conferences conducted, the dissemination of examples of best practice through
the outreach conferences, and the monitoring of small district networking
activities resulting from each conference.
