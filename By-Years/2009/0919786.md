This one-year project aims to complete construction of a daytime potassium
Doppler lidar and to test its operation at Arecibo Observatory. The Arecibo
lidar, based on a narrowband injection-seeded alexandrite ring laser, has been
able to make nighttime temperature and potassium density measurements in the
mesosphere and lower thermosphere region since February 2001. Through seven
years of operation, the nighttime technology has matured and sufficient data
were collected to characterize the nocturnal thermal structure and nocturnal
potassium seasonal variations. To enhance its measurement capability and to
better serve the aeronomy community, in 2005 a project was proposed and received
funding for three years to upgrade the Arecibo lidar to a daytime observing
capability and to conduct extensive observations to study the tropical
mesosphere and lower thermosphere region over the full-diurnal cycle at the
Arecibo Observatory. The lidar modifications have been underway for the past
three years but the Faraday filter originally intended to be used did not
perform as expected. Many of the other technical goals of the previous project
were achieved, such as narrowing of the field-of-view, construction of the
Faraday filter test station, implementation of the new receiver optical chopper,
initial observational tests, and implementation of new data processing
techniques. In addition, the optical elements and hardware necessary to
construct a new Faraday filter were acquired. The project will therefore
complete the remaining steps to yield a daylight-optimized lidar capable of
making full diurnal observations at Arecibo, where its collocation with the
incoherent scatter radar will enable a wide variety of scientific studies, such
as measurements of tides, gravity waves, absolute atmospheric density, metal
layer chemistry, and the evolution of sporadic atom and ion layers.
