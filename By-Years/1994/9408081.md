9408081 Smethie The proposed work is the collection and analysis of chloro-
fluorocarbon samples on an oceanographic cruise of the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer
to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas in early 1994. This region has been
sparsely sampled in the past, and little is known about the regional
oceanographic processes. The specific objectives of this cruise are to
investigate the large-scale oceanographic features, study the evolution of the
surface mixed layer and pycnocline in relation to the sea ice cover and the
underlying intermediate and deep water masses, determine the location of the
Antarctic Slope Front, and to investigate the impact of warm circumpolar water
flowing onto the continental shelf. The proposed work complements these
objectives of the cruise, since the physical and chemical characteristics of
CFCs are well known and well suited for the investigation of subsurface water
mass formation and water circulation. Knowledge of the distribution of CFCs in
the ocean broadens the time and space scales of the direct observations, and
allows inferences about oceanic processes that go beyond the immediate limits of
the cruise. ***
