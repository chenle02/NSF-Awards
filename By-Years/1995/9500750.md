This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in the purchase of a R-Axis Area detection diffractometer, an upgrade generator
and the upgrade of a computer. This new instrumentation will enhance greatly
research in a number of areas including the following: (a) Multiple Metal-Carbon
Bonds, Metallacycles, and Catalytic Reactions, (b) High Oxidation State
Dinitrogen Complexes, (c) Ring Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP), (d)
Fundamental Technetium Chemistry; (e) Modification of Receptor Biomolecules; (f)
Zirconocene Complexes of Unsaturated Molecules and Highly Strained Organic
Ligands; (g) Low Dimensional Oxides; and (h) Insertion Chemistry of Three-
Coordinate Complexes. The X-ray diffractometer is used to make accurate and
precise measurements of the full three- dimensional structure of a molecule. The
information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond distances and bond
angles of a given molecule and it gives accurate information about the spatial
arrangement of that molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.
