9760474 Carlberg This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
will develop and utilize advanced transgenic genetic engineering methods to
produce striped bass fingerlings with traits favorable production in culture
systems common in the U.S. Desired traits include accelerated growth and
increased resistance to bacterial disease. Phase I will first introduce a marker
gene (foreign genetic information that can be readily identified) and then
introduce foreign genetic material that will confer upon fish the desired
traits. If this succeeds, Phase I will develop the required supporting culture
and fish breeding technology to take advantage of fingerlings possessing the new
traits. Every major review of U.S. aquaculture describes the critical need for
improved seed stock methodologies if this new industry is to expand. The
introduction of genes for expressing growth hormones and antimicrobial molecules
in striped bass is a complex task, but the rewards could be significant. Striped
bass farming has exploded around the world, and although the primary markets are
in the U.S., foreign products are easily delivered fresh anywhere in the country
overnight. Research on these methods is expected to buttress the industry
against the rising global competition.
