Summary: This project will obtain isotopic and trace metal analyses on planktic
and benthic foraminifers to test initial results from subpolar North Atlantic
cores suggesting that global ice volume during MIS 11 was similar to modern ice
volume and that sea level during MIS 11 was not substantially higher than today.
The project will measure oxygen isotope ratios on planktic and benthic
foraminifers at three sites in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to
compare these values against new and existing data from subpolar North Atlantic
cores. In addition Mg/Ca ratios of benthic and planktic foraminifers in selected
intervals will be measured as independent estimate of temperature effects. The
new analyses will provide a means for separating temperature and salinity
effects from ice volume effects on the isotope values. Cd/Ca and carbon isotope
measurements of benthic foraminifers will be used to detect deep circulation
changes associated with the glacial - interglacial transitions. &lt;br/&gt;
