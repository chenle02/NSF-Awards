Cell-penetrating peptides possess the remarkable ability to bypass the
endocytosis uptake mechanism of the cell and are transported directly to the
cytoplasm utilizing an energy-independent pathway. Such cell-penetrating
peptides can also carry large cargo molecules (proteins, DNA, nanoparticles)
across a cell membrane. However, the mechanisms by which cell penetrating
peptides are transported across membranes have proven difficult to resolve. This
project employs an advanced membrane replica technique to systematically
identify and quantify the key interactions and forces that underlie the
properties of cell-penetrating peptides. By comparing and contrasting the uptake
of cell penetrating peptides in replica membranes and in live cells this project
aims to elucidate the mechanism of non-endocytotic peptide-mediated
transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. An educational toolkit (the
MOST kit) will be developed for use in teaching three fundamental concepts:
Membranes, Osmosis and Selective Transport. The MOST kit will form the basis for
course modules taught at the University of Massachusetts, and for peer-mentored
exchange research programs engaging undergraduate students at the University of
Massachusetts and the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez.
