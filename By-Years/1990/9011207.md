The separation of gas mixtures is a problem of great industrial significance.
Recent advances in polymeric technology have led to an increasingly greater use
of membranes for these separations. Different polymeric materials are commonly
evaluated for a given separation by measuring gas sorption isotherms and
diffusion coefficients. Frequently, the sorption data obtained is interpreted
using the dual mode model. While this model has proved useful in practice, it is
largely empirical in nature and does not directly relate sorption properties to
other material properties. This project is an investigation of the sorption of
gases in glassy polymers from a thermodynamic point of view. A theoretical
framework for the thermodynamics of gas sorption in glassy polymers will be
established. Heats of sorption will be measured experimentally and used to
validate the theoretical results. Preliminary results suggest a relationship
between sorption, mechanical properties, and the heat of mixing which might aid
in the screening of materials for gas separation. A comparison of the results to
the dual mode model allows an interpretation of certain dual mode parameters in
terms of mechanical and thermodynamic properties.
