0110225&lt;br/&gt;Storm / Cava&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest in solid state
chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly
based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges
involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of
scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing
exciting research in this area. The 2001 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research
Conference will be held at Queens College, Oxford, England September 16 -
September 21, 2001. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international
collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers
with interests in solid state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support
the attendance of young American Scientists as well as senior U.S. session
chairs and invited speakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
Solid State Chemistry chemistry community continues to have direct impact on
technological advances of high significance to society by designing new
materials such as porous solids and molecular sieves, catalysts, and magnetic
and electronic materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
