This proposal suggests a very novel approach to producing radioisotopes for use
in non-invasive diagnosis and assessment of heart disease. The short life
isotope will be continuously separated from the long live isotope by the
chromatography technique. Thus, the patient will receive primarily the short
life isotope. The radiation dose and the time over which the patient is exposed
to radiation will be greatly shortened. The background radiation will not
increase significantly due the short half-life of the radioisotope. Therefore,
the various medical techniques using radioisotopes can be used repeatedly
without the background radiation creating noise that will degrade further
testing using radioisotopes.
