There has been considerable progress in our understanding of the segmentation
patterns on mid-ocean ridge system, but little has been learned about the nature
and temporal stability of upper mantle processes associated withthe
segmentation. A field survey will be carried out over a 250 km wide area of Mid-
Atlantic Ridge using Hydrosweep to obtain bathymetric coverage, along with
acquisition of gravity and magnetic data. These data will allow testing of
hypotheses concerning temporal evolution of the ridge related tosegmentation
processes of the spreading center. This is a US-France collaborative research
project.
