This basically theoretical research project involves a systematic investigation
of various large scale linear and nonlinear atmospheric dynamical processes. A
number of idealized high-resolution spherical models with/without topography and
with/without self-induced condensational heating will be formulated and
analyzed. The principal investigator will look at the instability
characteristics of certain types of flow and the response of the model
atmosphere to several types of forcing due to orography and heating. The results
of the investigations are expected to improve our understanding of a number of
atmospheric phenomena including regional cyclogenesis, storm-tracks, and low
frequency variability.
