The rolls used in the rolling of steel, even if undamaged by catastrophic
fracture or other major failure, must be changed frequently because of wear and
spalling. Proper cooling appears to have a significant effect on roll life, but
there is very little definitive information about the why and how. The proposed
study is aimed at providing a basic understanding of the influence of roll
cooling on the thermal and mechanical responses of rolls. Alternative cooling
practices will be sought for reducing roll wear and spalling caused by thermal
failure stress. A laboratory apparatus has been developed at Drexel University
which models the cooled rolls used in steel mills. The apparatus will be heavily
instrumented to determine the heat transfer coefficient between the roll surface
and the water spray which serves as a coolant. The thermal information will be
used as input to a numerical model for determining the stress field in the roll.
