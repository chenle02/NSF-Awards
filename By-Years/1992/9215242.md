This project supports the dissertation research of an anthropology student from
the University of Michigan in Nicaragua. The student's project is to understand
how government-sponsored local cultural centers attempted to impose a national
set of values in the Sandinista era, and how this failed or succeeded in
different local situations. Using a combination of ethnographic methods
including participant observation and community surveys, the student will try to
assess reasons for the varying success and failure of these centers. This
research is particularly timely at the present time, when the break-up of the
Yugoslavian state shows that local resistance to national ideologies is powerful
and long-lived. This sort of in-depth case study can provide valuable
information to explain the success or failure of programs of national
integration.
