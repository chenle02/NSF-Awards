The sphere of research includes the development of accurate continuum methods
for vibration and stability of prestressed skewed and twisted bodies. Three
areas of structural mechanics are examined, which include: (1) the effect of
corner stress singularities on the vibration and buckling of sectorial and
skewed quadrilateral planforms of general shapes, (2) the vibration and buckling
of skewed and twisted 3.D bodies having mixed combinations of clamped and free
edge conditions, and (3) the vibration of skewed by path.dependent centrifugal
body forces. //
