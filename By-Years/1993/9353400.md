This planning grant will provide the time and resources for the staff to
explore the needs and specifications of a project which would give inteternet
access to K-12 educators throughout West Virginia. Building on work that has
already been done, this planning grant includes an assessment of the teachers'
needs, an evaluation of the network capacity, and the development of a strategy
for full implementation in the form of a proposal. Through the network, the
teachers will be able to access vast databases in science and mathematics as
well as mentors and other resources. The cost sharing for the planning grant is
estimated at 23%
