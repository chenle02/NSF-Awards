This project will develop and carry out preliminary research in manufacturing
fixture design concepts and in manufacturability analysis. In the area of
fixture design, the work will be directed both toward development of devices as
well as on the incorporation of fixturing considerations into part design. The
work will be largely exploratory and conceptual. In the are of manufacturability
analysis, the emphasis will be on concepts and algorithms for tolerance
analysis, part coding, and feature recognition from computer-aided design data
bases for prismatic parts. The goal of the research in this area is to develop
analogous concepts for more complicated prismatic parts in solid modeling
environments.
