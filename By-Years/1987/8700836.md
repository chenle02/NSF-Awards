Infinite Horizon Optimization involves the study of infinite stage stochastic
and deterministic programming, and subsumes a rich class of applications
including most production and inventory control problems, as well as optimal
search, capacity expansion and equipment replacement problems. The PI's view the
space of feasible solutions as an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and
propose to establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of finite to
infinite horizon optimal solutions, and to explore the applicability of well-
known direct methods of solutions. Professors Smith and Bean are well-known for
their work on infinite horizon optimization problems. The University of Michigan
provides a fine research environment for this project. An award is highly
recommended.
