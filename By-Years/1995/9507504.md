9507504 Fendler The objective of U.S.-Hungary research project, between Dr.
Janos Fendler of Syracuse University and Imre Dekany of Attila Jozsef
University, is to pursue fundamental work required to develop a simple and
versatile technique for constructing stable and robust organic/inorganic
composite self-assembled nanostructured films. The researchers have demonstrated
layer-by-layer self-assembly of ordered nanostructured films composed of
alternating layers of cationic polyelectrolyte and anionic solid nanoparticles.
They believe that this suggests a viable membrane-mimetic approach to
engineering advanced materials. As a result of this project, the researchers
hope to achieve a high degree of stability and relative ease of systematic
chemical and physical manipulation that will enable them to derive
nanostructured films with desired mechanical, optical, electro-optical,
electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic properties. This chemistry project in
organic dynamics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to
combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong
mutual interest and competence. ***
