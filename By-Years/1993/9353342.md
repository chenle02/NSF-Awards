To catalyze improvements in teaching and learning in the life science at the
undergraduate level a conference, sponsored by the Coalition for Education in
the Life Sciences (CELS), is being held at the Marine Biological Laboratory in
Woods Hole, MA from February 14-17, 1993. About 150 participants will consider
effective teaching models and relate these models to changes in student
assessment. Plenary topics include: 1) how biology can contribute to literacy
and liberal education, 2) coping with the diverse field of biology, 3)
developing an effective institutional plan for change at small and large
institutions, 4) linkage to the life sciences education clearinghouse, and 5) a
training workshop that will provide information about how to get educational
sessions incorporated as part of the regular meetings of professional societies.
A Proceedings is planned that will contain the abstracts of contributions and
summaries of the plenary sessions. This award is to support the production and
dissemination of the Proceedings.
