The objective of this research is the investigation of mesoscale, vortex,
boundary layer and turbulence dynamics, using theoretical, experimental, and
computational techniques. The experimental portion is devoted to the
investigation of helical flows using the Ward generator. Additional topics will
be pursued using numerical simulations, and exiting observations from previous
field experiments.
