The Aspartate transcarbamoylases (ATCases) of divergent organisms, and in
particular of enterobacteria, are sufficiently similar to organize in comparable
tertiary domains and to assemble in similar quaternary aggregates. Nevertheless,
they differ from each other by their catalytic properties and allosteric
responses. Various intergenic fusions have been carried out from bacterial
cistrons and hamster cDNA clones and their characterization is underway. The
sequences of catalytic and regulatory chains have been determined. These will be
compared in the hope that a sufficient number of sequence: function comparisons
will permit deduction of critical structure/function relationships. Site
specific mutagenesis will be performed aimed at elucidating the function of each
segment of these catalytic and regulatory polypeptides. Monoclonal antibodies
will be used to compare surface structures of the enzyme from different species.
Collaboration with x-ray crystallographers should provide definitive structural
information of interesting mutationally altered proteins. This is an excellent
model system for such studies and Dr. Wild's past work makes him uniquely
qualified for what is proposed.
