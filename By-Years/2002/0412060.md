&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for
the use of catalytic metal aryl oxides. The first goal is to design a Lewis acid
assisted catalysis of a number of transformations including ketone aldol
syntheses, Michael-Michael annulations, Nazarov cyclizations and Sakuri ene
reactions. Second, the research will focus on the selective and efficient
transesterification reactions using tetracyclic bridged phenols, salen ligands
and new 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands in concert with Ti, Zr, Hf, Sm, Sc and In
metals. Third, metal aryl oxide cavities based on pyridine base
functionalization will be used to promote asymmetric isomerization,
racemization, aldol synthesis and Morita-Baylis-Hillman
reactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Hisashi Yamamoto of the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago. Professor Yamamoto will
focus his research efforts on developing efficient catalysis based on the
chemistry of metal aryl oxides. The work relies on designing reactions inside
the cavity of a metal aryl oxide system, which creates the opportunity for new
chemistry to occur. The project has broader impacts for polymer and medicinal
science and will afford an excellent arena for the training of graduate students
and postdoctoral associates. &lt;br/&gt;
