This projects investigates the external and internal factors (e.g., demographic,
personal, and psychological aspects) that impact senior citizens' online privacy
behavior. The multi-perspective approach to address this question consists of
surveys (standardized), intensive in-person interviews, focus groups, key stroke
logging and log analysis and scenario based questionnaires to understand online
privacy behavior and attitude. A computational framework for online privacy
protection using Bayesian Networks will be developed that includes a privacy
architecture incorporating security policies, enforceable measures and a set of
recommendations for proper design of privacy-enhancing technologies. This
research will also explore senior citizens' perceived value of their personal
information and the impact of cyber security education on online privacy
behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there is limited empirical data and
research about senior citizens and online privacy, this project has the
potential to significantly contribute to the design of more usable and unbiased
online privacy protection technology for elderly users of the Internet.
Ultimately, the wider societal importance of the proposed research is that a
deeper understanding of the interaction between personal, social and
institutional factors in determining senior citizens' experience with online
privacy is needed to facilitate the continuing effort in enhancing online
privacy assurance on the Internet.
