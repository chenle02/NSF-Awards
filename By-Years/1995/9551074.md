This project, the Multimedia Technology Laboratory (MTL), gives students hands-
on experience building Multimedia tools such as authorware, animation and sound
editors, and videoconferencing programs. The MTL is equipped with workstations
designed to display, transmit, and store high-resolution graphics, video
sequences, and sound clips. In conjunction with the laboratory, a new course--
CSC 485 Multimedia--is being introduced into the graphics curriculum. The MTL is
also being used for demonstrations in other computer graphics courses and
required senior projects.
