This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
develop an x-ray microscope capable of providing real-time, in-vivo images of
specimens ranging from from mice to bacteria. The proposed technology combines
visible and x-ray optics concepts to develop a completely new radiological
imaging system capable of record x-ray-imaging resolutions. This microscope will
be built using commercially available characteristic line x-ray tubes and high-
resolution imaging detectors along with the company's previously developed x-ray
lenses and optical system, making it an inexpensive, table-top tool. The Phase I
work will provide a design for a commercial prototype to be built in the follow
on Phase II project, and will answer critical technical questions including what
narrowband x-ray flux can be delivered to the specimen and what image quality
can be expected for a variety of biological samples. In addition, experimental
work will demonstrate imaging using an x-ray tube source, both as a proof-of-
principle and to confirm the accuracy of design calculations.

The commercial application of this project is in biological and medical
research. The proposed x-ray microscope will be a valuable research tool for
scientists, biotechnology and medical research companies and institutions. By
allowing high resolution, in-vivo imaging of organisms and structures as small
as 10 nm, the microscope is expected to be a valuable tool for molecular and
cellular research. At larger resolutions, the microscope would allow imaging in
small animals, particularly mice, allowing the tracking of biological processes,
such as angiogenesis, without harming the mouse.
