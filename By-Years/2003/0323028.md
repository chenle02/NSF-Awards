The project is aimed at developing (1) a productive collaboration framework that
will enable integration, collaboration, and real-time control of spatially
distributed small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), (2) decision making models
and tools driven by shop floor level operations, and (3) a distributed
simulation virtual environment that mimics interaction among SMEs and acts as a
testbed for experimentation and validation of the proposed system architecture
and mathematical models. The project will extend auction paradigms into a
distributed (versus local) manufacturing resource environment. A primary outcome
will be an architecture of cooperative agents, a set of which would represent an
SME with a desire to collaborate with other SMEs for mutual gain within a
manufacturing context. New research components include the development of an
information flow model of a shop floor and new decision-making models and
tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will
provide insights for building productive collaboration environments for SMEs.
The distributed information flow model that will be developed in this project
will provide scalability and reconfigurability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
