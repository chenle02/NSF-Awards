WHOI proposes to acquire the needed high-resolution imaging systems (3 new,
high-resolution digital deep-sea still color cameras and high-intensity deep-sea
strobes) so that numerous UNOLS operators would have ready access to robust
real-time, deep-sea digital still imaging capabilities for their multicorer
systems. Seagoing technical personnel at four (4) UNOLS institutions
(SIO,&lt;br/&gt;U. Hawaii, U. Washington, &amp; WHOI) will be trained in
operating the systems and in developing&lt;br/&gt;?best-practices? documentation
for operating multicorers with imaging systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit
Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides
infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use
instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects
(which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of
NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation
allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working,
calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research,
and expanding the base of potential researchers.
