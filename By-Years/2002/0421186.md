AST-0421186 -- Salgado/Norfolk State&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rapid Response
Robotic Telescope is for the photometric and polarimetric study of gamma-ray
bursts optical afterglows. The UBVR and near-IR magnitudes and polarization will
be measured during the first few minutes after the gamma-ray burst is detected
by satellite missions. This project will increase diversity in the astronomical
community and provide astronomy outreach for the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area.
The Rapid Response Robotic Telescope will be an important component in Norfolk
State University's astronomy program, and will enhance the university's general
public outreach through collaborations with local public school systems and
amateur groups. The instrument will be located at the Fan Mountain Observatory
near Charlottesville, Virginia, and will be a 0.6 m telescope on an equatorial
fork mount. It will be fully automatic and controllable from the Norfolk State
University campus.
