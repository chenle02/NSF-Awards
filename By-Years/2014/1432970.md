Plate tectonic arguments, primarily based on motion derived from Earth's
magnetic anomalies, require that Greenland has moved about 250 kilometers
northeast with respect to North America during the Paleocene (65 to 54 million
years ago) on a continental transform that links the opening of the Arctic Ocean
with the opening of Baffin Bay. Some scientists view the proposed transform as a
myth, and indeed geophysical data show that the so-called Wegener Fault is not
located in Nares Strait itself. The PI joins a helicopter-supported expedition
led by the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR)
to look for evidence of faulting onshore remote SE Ellesmere Island, Canada
adjacent to the strait. The study area is on strike with known left-lateral
strike-slip faults of Paleocene age to the north, which could link up to form
the Wegener fault. Identifying the Wegener fault settles a long-standing
tectonic problem and solidifies our understanding of the critical period of
spreading in the Labrador Sea and opening of the Arctic Ocean. The results also
provide an important case study of the complexity of geologic relationships
along continental transform boundaries, which can be compared to processes at
similar boundaries such as the San Andreas Fault. Research results will be
shared with the Geological Survey of Canada, and will be disseminated through
the geologic literature. In addition to the geologic goals of the project, the
project is providing support for research infrastructure at the University of
Iowa, as well as public outreach efforts, including those aimed at First Nations
people who live near the field area.
