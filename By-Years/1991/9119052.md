The goal of this proposal is to understand how totipotency, the ability to
undergo embryogenesis, is restricted to a single cell lineage in the eukaryote
Volvox carteri. Volvox is ideal for dissecting the mechanisms underlying the
regulation of totipotency since it is composed of only two types of cells:
reproductive and somatic. In asexual (clonal) growth, reproductive cells cleave
successively yielding a new embryo while somatic cells never divide. A number of
mutants that alter cell fate have defined critical genes in the determination
pathway. In regA - mutants, somatic cells redifferentiate into reproductive
cells and become totipotent. The locus is unusual in that it becomes
hypermutable (105 times the spontaneous rate) at a specific stage in
development. The primary aim is to determine how the regA gene normally keeps
the somatic cell lineage from undergoing embryogenesis and why it is transiently
hypermutable. The PI has devised two powerful new methods to isolate the regA
gene: genomic subtraction and DAF (differentially amplified fragment)
subtraction. To begin to understand how regA regulates totipotency, cloned gene
will be used in studies to determine the nature of the regA gene product and the
molecular basis for the unusual hypermutability of the gene.
