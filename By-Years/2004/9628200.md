Oglesby, Elizabeth U. of California, Berkeley This study will focus upon the
dynamic expansion of sugar plantations on Guatemala's south coast. The reason
for this expansion, in contrast to developments elsewhere in the Third World,
lie in the contextual responses to local social conflicts and the exercise of
social and political power waged at multiple levels. The work will study the
imposition of new forms of labor stabilization on these plantations including
scientific management and the automated construction of migrant labor markets.
The research will examine how methods of industrial labor control are transposed
onto agrarian social and labor relations. Using ethnographic research at the
level of the household the process of negotiation and contestation between
migrant workers and management over a stable yet flexible labor force will be
revealed. An aim is to identify the negotiations at the household level which
reveal how migrants create their own flexible labor strategies. The product will
shed new light on aspects of agrarian change with global implications.
