Seogjoo Jang of the City University of New York Queens College is supported by
an award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to carry out
research on the development of computational methods for energy flow dynamics in
soft optoelectronic molecular systems. The research focuses on three factors:
(1) electronic quantum coherence involving multiple excited states or sites; (2)
coupling of electronic excitation to nuclear vibrational dynamics; and (3)
disorder and stochastic fluctuations in the structure or energetics of
molecules. For certain conjugated oligomer systems, coarse-grained models are
being constructed in order to study energy flow dynamics and to model
spectroscopic signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is having a broader impact
through the development of methods that may lead to new optical, electronic and
sensor devices. It is having a further impact on students at the graduate,
undergraduate and high school level in the New York metropolitan area through
workshops and seminar series that Jang is developing in conjunction with his
research.
