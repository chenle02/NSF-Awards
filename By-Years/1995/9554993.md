The project is continuing to develop a series of laboratory modules for the
introductory astronomy laboratory. The modules address a pressing need for
modernization: though astronomy is a very popular course for undergraduates, and
for many their first and only college experience in science, laboratories in
astronomy have difficulty providing needed hands-on experience because of the
faintness of astronomical objects, the inconvenient time scale of many
phenomena, and the fickleness of weather. In the past, most exercises available
to astronomy instructors relied on analysis of photographs or canned data, and
exemplified techniques that were increasingly out-of-date. The current project,
Contemporary Laboratory Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA), has already developed 7
Windows and Mac exercises, and will complete at least 3 more by 1996. Each
module consists of software, student guides, teachers' manuals, and technical
documentation. The material has been introduced into classes at Gettysburg
College and distributed widely. CLEA software is currently at use throughout all
the United States and 40 foreign countries, reaching at least 10,000 students
per year. Four CLEA exercises won the 1994 COMPUTERS IN PHYSICS educational
software prize. The current project is continuing to develop modules and
evaluating the effectiveness of modules on student learning.
