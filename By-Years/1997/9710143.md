9710143 Lauffenburger This project will combine approaches of biochemical
engineering, cell biology, and molecular biology to increase the quantitative
understanding and manipulation of growth factor/receptor dynamics at both the
cell and tissue level. Work will focus on the dynamics of autocrine growth
factor signaling, particularly with respect to the spatial regulation of ligand
release and receptor occupancy. A major goal in this direction will be to
determine whether autocrine ligands provided information to cells regarding
their tissue "community" as opposed to their local microenvironment, and how
physico-chemical parameters influence this information. Work will also continue
to build on current models of receptor trafficking to include new experimental
information about the sorting compartment, and to extend these models to
incorporate key components of related signal transduction pathways. This will
allow a quantitative evaluation of the effects of altered receptor trafficking
on signaling pathways underlying previous studies of cell proliferation
responses. Understanding these sorts of integrated dynamical influences on
growth factor signaling will continue to generate a rational basis for the
design of improved pharmacological growth factor mimics or antagonists. By using
the human epidermal growth factor/receptor system transfected into defined cell
lines, tools for molecular biology such as monoclonal antibodies, site-directed
receptor mutants, and recombinant site- directed ligand variants can be used for
biochemical engineering purposes. The work for the new grant period has been
organized into three specific aims which are designed to facilitate the
understanding of receptor and ligand dynamics in growth factor regulation of
cell function. ***
