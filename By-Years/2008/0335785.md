The Noyce Scholarship program at MSU will fund both 1-and 2-year scholarships
for 39 talented college students who commit to becoming K-12 mathematics or
science teachers in high-need districts. The scholarships may be used during a
student's 4th or 5th year of an undergraduate teacher preparation program or
toward one year of a post-BA program. The funds are being administered through
the Division of Science and Mathematics Education. This effort builds on MSU's
all-university initiative called Teachers for a New Era (TNE) that involves
creating standards for teacher preparation, course development and revision, and
implementing new ways of teaching and assessing students. A committee of faculty
from the Colleges of Natural Science and Education is overseeing the
recruitment, selection, and mentoring of the Noyce Scholars. An experienced
evaluator is conducting the evaluation. Graduate students are assisting with
mentoring and evaluation. The Noyce Scholarship program is enabling students who
graduate from MSU and benefiting from the TNE work to share their knowledge and
skills with elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas throughout
Michigan and beyond. The scholarships and associated activities are expected to
increase the number of teachers graduating with either a major or minor in
mathematics or science from about 135 per year in 2000 - 2003 to about 155 per
year in the years 2006 - 2008. The number of MSU graduates with mathematics or
science majors taking positions in high need schools is also expected to
increase proportionately during this period. The Noyce Scholarship program and
other recruitment efforts initiated recently at MSU are expected to increase the
participation of underrepresented groups in teaching. Further, the Noyce
Scholarships are expected to add impetus to a fundraising program begun at MSU
to establish a scholarship endowment for students choosing careers in teaching
mathematics or science in Grades K -12.&lt;br/&gt;
