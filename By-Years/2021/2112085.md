This NSF Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institute in Dynamic Systems will
transform research and education in fundamental artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) theory, algorithms, and applications. The instituteâ€™s
specific aim is to empower safe, guaranteed real-time learning and control of
complex dynamic systems, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, power grids,
fluid flow control, digital twins, and/or advanced manufacturing. AI/ML methods
are a suite of data science algorithms that leverage diverse sensor data streams
across all disciplines of science and engineering. This enables the integration
of traditional modeling and computation of dynamic systems, which evolve in time
and are governed by physics, with emerging AI/ML algorithmic approaches. As a
result, this allows for safe, reliable, efficient, and ethical data-enabled
solutions to real-time sensing, learning, prediction, and decision-making
challenges. In addition, the institute will disseminate open-source software and
educational materials for the professional development of undergraduate
students, graduate students, and engineering professionals alike. The institute
will further develop a community-wide common task framework for evaluating a
taxonomy of ML/AI algorithms on challenge data sets in physics and engineering,
thus providing a broad service to the engineering AI/ML community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AI Institute in Dynamic Systems will transform the
foundations of physics-informed AI/ML algorithms by developing the mathematical
foundations in four key disciplines: (i) control theory, (ii) probability and
statistics, (iii) optimization, and (iv) dynamical systems (modeling). The
integration of all four of these disciplines is critical for the development of
AI/ML algorithms that can be leveraged by engineered systems. Establishing
rigorous mathematical connections between these disciplines is a driving
inspiration for our efforts in re-framing the foundations of AI/ML for the
dynamic systems in engineering. Such foundational efforts will engender the
following program thrusts: (i) the mathematical foundations of AI, (ii) grand
challenge applications for AI, and (iii) a transformational educational and
workforce development infrastructure for AI Engineering. Physics-informed ML is
emerging as a leading paradigm for bringing together a diverse suite of AI/ML
algorithms and dynamic systems engineering, providing new capabilities in real-
time sensing, learning, decision making, and predictions that are safe,
reliable, efficient, ethical, and imbued with uncertainty quantification (UQ).
Our team will focus on developing a general and flexible AI/ML framework to
rapidly learn new physics, enforce known physical constraints, and discover them
directly. We will continuously evaluate our methods through demonstrations on
real-world grand challenge applications so that the methods are physically
motivated, and advances are catalyzed across multiple domains. Such an
evaluation on a common task framework will engender a broad and principled
taxonomy of AI/ML algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
