9416499 Olshansky This project is being funded as part of the National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's investigation into the causes and effects
of the January 17, 1994 earthquake. The primary research question is: In what
ways can planning reduce earthquake risks? Using the Los Angeles area as an
example, this project will document and evaluate the ways in which planning has
been used as an earthquake hazard reduction earthquake strategy. Using a case
study approach, the project will examine the historical development of policy
and its effect on local planning decisions. How did national and state policy
changes catalyzed by the 1971 earthquake come back to affect the scale of damage
that occurred in adjacent areas in 1994? ***
