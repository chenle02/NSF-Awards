In creating a design, the designer attempts to arrive at the best solution given
an objective and given a set of constraints that must be met. This process is
very similar to playing a game since a game involves developing a winning
strategy subject to the rules of the game. This analogy is apt since most
designers find the process of design challenging and enjoyable and also feel the
satisfaction of winning when they have created a good design. The principal
investigator will create design problems that are structured as games. The
design problems will be computer-based so that the designer's interactions with
the rules can be monitored and studied. The use of a limited design space and
the ability to change the rules (the design constraints) will create an
environment in which the principal investigator can perform experiments in
design theory and methodology.
