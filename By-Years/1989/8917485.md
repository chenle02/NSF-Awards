The basic premise for this research is two-fold: first, to exploit the full
capabilities of laser-initiated polymerization as a critical and novel method
for probing the kinetics and mechanisms of photopolymerization processes under a
variety of conditions for a number of different types of monomer systems; and,
second, to establish a rationale for defining the operating parameter for laser-
initiated polymerization applications for such applications as imaging, curing
of coatings for optical fibers, microcircuit processing, etc. The importance of
the rapidly developing laser-initiated polymerization field and its potential
for use in American industry cannot be minimized. We will continue to
investigate the basics of polymerization kinetics of simple monofunctional
monomers in bulk and solution, while placing special emphasis on laser-initiated
of multifunctional/crosslinking monomers and polymerization of liquid-
crystalline systems. In addition, we propose to investigate the laser-initiated
of other polymerization types including templated systems, cationic-initiated
polymerizations, and microemulsions in an effort to provide a fundamental
kinetic analysis for these systems.
