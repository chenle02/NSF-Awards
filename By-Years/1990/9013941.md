Classical, semi-classical and quantum theories for strongly perturbed,
nonlinear oscillators using a variety of novel theoretical approaches will be
employed to understand the quantum processes that mimic classical chaos.
Localization of wave functions and the striking phenomenon of "scars" associated
with unstable, classical periodic orbits will be investigated as mechanisms
which suppress classical chaos quantum mechanically. Systems to be studied
include Rydberg atoms in microwave and strong magnetic fields, and inelastic and
reactive scattering in chemistry.
