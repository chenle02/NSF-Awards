Training in the theory and practice of remote sensing and geographic information
systems is becoming increasingly important in the training of environmental
scientists for natural-resource and urban-growth management. The Remote Sensing
and Geographic Information System for Undergraduate Training project is adding
12 computer workstations; 1 server platform for a local network and Internet
connection; 1 hub platform to serve as the main database provider; 1 complete
geographic positioning system capable of downloading data to the hub platform; 1
256-grey-level class-D scanner; and additional required software to support
continued expansion of the environmental science curricula developed since 1985.
The use of these resources supports undergraduate training in ARC/INFO, ERDAS
IMAGINE, and related systems in order to develop a professionally trained
workforce to staff Federal, state, local, and private resource management
agencies. This project enables the Biological and Environmental Sciences
Department to improve its curriculum and, at the same time, give students hands-
on experience with systems used in the real world. The ultimate outcome of the
project may be Environmental Science graduates who are better prepared to enter
a rapidly expanding job market or to continue in graduate education.
