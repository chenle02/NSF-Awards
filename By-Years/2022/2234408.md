Messaging applications that provide strong privacy for their users can have the
unintended side effect of making it harder for users to report abuse. When the
platform cannot see the contents of users' messages, or does not know which
users are talking to each other, it can never know if a report of abusive
content is real or not. This project's novelties are in new cryptographic
approaches to design private messaging applications that allow users to
verifiably report abusive content to the platform without compromising the
privacy of unreported messages or conversations. The project's broader
significance and importance is to enable new possibilities for moderation on
private communication platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project achieves
multiple order of magnitude performance improvements over prior work by taking a
co-design approach to the design of abuse reporting features for end-to-end
encrypted or metadata-hiding messaging applications. It takes advantage of the
existing structure of these systems to improve on both the functionality and
performance possible via the more generic approaches of prior work. For example,
instead of only assuming that an existing platform hides message metadata, the
project designs solutions for metadata-hiding platforms that specifically rely
on broad classes of techniques like secret sharing or mixnets. The project also
develops new educational materials to allow both college undergraduates and
middle/high school students to gain early exposure to security and privacy
topics. The project's impact will be to advance the research and industry
communities' ability to design and deploy new messaging systems that keep users
safe and protect their privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's
statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
