Equipment is being purchased to integrate concepts of environmental sciences
throughout the curriculum and develop students' analytical skills. Beginning and
advanced students conduct experiments that integrate field and laboratory
experiences. They measure responses of plants and animals to their environment
and manipulate variables to test hypotheses. Students use a light sensor, leaf
area/image analyzer, balances, portable water quality lab, and portable
hygrometer/thermometer to measure important environmental parameters.
Environmental chambers and a refrigerated incubator allow students to control
temperature, light, and humidity to learn how environmental conditions affect
essential physiological and ecological processes. Approximately 200 students per
year benefit during lab experiences in the first two biology courses. Another
50-60 majors use the equipment in upper level courses, and will have the
opportunity to use the modern equipment for independent research in
environmental science. The university will contribute an amount equal to the
award.
