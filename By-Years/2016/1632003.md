1632003 (Taira, Kunihiko)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed
research is to employ theoretical techniques developed for network theory in the
analysis of complex, unsteady fluid flows. The work proposed herein is
exploratory in nature but is aimed to lay the foundation for examining a range
of fundamental fluid flow networks and to incorporate uncertainty
quantification, stability analysis, and active control techniques in future
studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed computational and theoretical work
will examine the underlying vortical-interaction networks present in unsteady
separated flows and their resilience to perturbations using network analysis. To
achieve the goals of this work, we will establish network-based analysis
techniques suitable for a continuous dense network representations of fluid
flows. Complex nonlinear interactions in fluid flows pose challenges with
traditional analysis techniques and have not been systematically analyzed in the
past. Network analysis has a great potential for uncovering such important
interconnections amongst vortical structures (eddies) in unsteady flows. With
knowledge of which interactions are important on the vortical network, graph
theory and network analysis can provide guidelines on how to describe the
collective dynamics of unsteady fluid flows. The use of network analysis will
provide a transformative change to how we examine vortical interactions and
energy transfers in fluid flows. By developing the network formulation of fluid
flows, we can analyze the resilience of fluid networks against perturbations and
external forcing inputs. Understanding the resilience of vortex-interaction
networks allows us to identify the sensitive vortical structures and types of
disturbances that can globally affect the dynamics of unsteady fluid flows, in a
manner complementary to the hydrodynamic stability analysis.
