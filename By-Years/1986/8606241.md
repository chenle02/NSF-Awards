This equipment request is for acquisition of a double crystal x-ray spectrometer
system that will be used in the evaluation of films and quantum well structures,
such that optimum molecular beam epitaxial growth techniques can be developed.
At present there is a significant increase of interest in II-VI semiconductors
due to recent success in growth of films and multiple quantum well structures of
those materials by molecular beam epitaxy. Applications now envisioned include
infrared detection, nonlinear optics, blue LED and laser devices, and flat panel
electroluminescent displays. The research effort described in this proposal
represents a leading program in the study of several aspects of II-VI epitaxy.
The proposed research deals with fundamental concepts of heteroepitaxy, the
optical and electrical properties of quantum wells, and the general problems of
charged-particle transport in these potentially important materials.
