A one-week workshop is being offered to a group of fifteen faculty participants
from institutions that are predominately involved in teaching undergraduates.
The workshop is being led by faculty who are knowledgeable in the use of
microcomputers to carry out studies in computational chemistry. The unique
features of this workshop are that it is providing the faculty participants with
a syllabus and with hands-on experience, so as to facilitate the implementation
of computational chemistry at their home institutions. The emphasis of the
workshop will be on the use of microcomputers in quantum chemistry and in
molecular modeling. The software and hardware that are being used is
sufficiently inexpensive so that almost any institution now has the resources to
incorporate computational chemistry into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.
Computational chemistry is a relatively new area of chemistry, but one that is
fast becoming important to both academic and industrial scientists. It is
therefore imperative that the undergraduate chemistry student be given some
exposure to this area. At present very few institutions provide an adequate
introduction to computational chemistry. The workshop is helping to correct this
deficiency in the training of undergraduate chemists.
