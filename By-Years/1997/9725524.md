9725524 Horwitz Over the past several years, with support form the Applications
of Advanced Technology Program of NSF, we have developed and evaluated a series
of computer applications that offer a new paradigm for educational software, the
computer-based manipulative (CBM). The CBM is an open-ended environment
consisting of linked representations and affordances that reify an underlying
model and enable students to investigate scientific and mathematical concepts
via direct manipulation and experimentation. One of our most successful CBMs has
been GenScope, which helps students reason about genetics at multiple levels. We
propose to broaden the scope of this technology by creating three additional
CBMs dealing with tissues, cells, and molecules. These new applications will
interact with each other and with GenScope, to form a seamless exploratory
environment within which students can investigate phenomena spanning
subdisciplines that are taught separately in the traditional biology curriculum.
To achieve such interoperability will involve advanced research in component
software technology. We will design and publish protocols and standards for
inter-component communication that will make it possible for future developers
to create CBMs of their own and link them to ours. Working in urban and suburban
schools, we will conduct formative research to determine the optimum use and
educational effectiveness of this new technology.
