Abstract: Collaborative Research: Accounting for the Rise in College Tuition
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persistent rising college tuition and student debt in the
U.S. are growing public policy concerns, yet factors driving their growth remain
unresolved. With its combination of extensive public subsidies, complicated
financial aid rules, segmented market structure, and widespread use of
differential tuition pricing, the higher education market functions quite
differently from many other markets. In addition, most traditional colleges are
non-profit institutions that pursue objectives that differ from those of profit-
maximizing firms. In addition, the incentives colleges face are less well
understood. This research project develops a new approach to quantify the
determinants of U.S. college tuition and how they contribute to tuition
inflation, as well as assess the impact of programs aimed at expanding college
access and easing the burden of student debt. Focusing on explaining the
aggregate trends in college tuition increases, it will shed light on differences
across college types and investigates ways to promote educational opportunity
across the socioeconomic spectrum. The methods used in this research can also
serve as a template for future students and researchers interested in studying
the complex higher education market. The results of this research can help
policy makers develop better policies to increase higher education attainment
for the American workforce, hence improving U.S. competitiveness.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research develops an equilibrium structural
model that includes life-cycle decision-making by households, imperfect
competition and price discrimination in the higher education sector, student
loan borrowing, and uninsurable post-graduation earnings risk. Relative to the
existing literature, the presence of forward-looking behavior and higher
expected post-graduation earnings endogenously motivates college attendance and
facilitates taking the model to the data. The model is then used to test and
quantify various hypotheses for the rise in college tuition---an approach which
permits counterfactual analysis and decomposition of tuition drivers. Lastly,
the project will use the model to study the efficacy of recent and proposed
reforms whose goals are to restrain the growth of tuition and student debt. The
results of this research project will help guide policies aimed at improving
college education, thereby increasing the U.S.?s human capital and
competitiveness.
