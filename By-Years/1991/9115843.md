Study of trace element abundance and isotopic ratios in a suite of gabbros and
basalts from Cayman Rise spreading center which have been the subject of several
previous geochemical and petrological studies. The objectives of this study are
to determine the processes of formation of gabbros and the extent of
heterogeneities at deep levels in the mid Cayman Rise crust.
