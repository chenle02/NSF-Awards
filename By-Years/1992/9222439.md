This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will assist the
Department of Chemistry at Indiana University Purdue University in the purchase
of computer hardware and software for a Macromolecular Modeling System. Two
graphics workstations with ancillary data storage and output equipment and
commercially available molecular graphics/scientific software will be networked
together to create a computational chemistry facility for studies in
macromolecular science. The projects to be undertaken include: 1) Examination of
the intermolecular forces responsible for chiral recognition of optical isomers
binding to polymers such as cellulose, polymethacrylates and DNA. 2) Computer-
assisted molecular design and testing of bis-intercalating agents for sequence-
specific binding sites on DNA. 3) An assessment of the unique micro environments
made by polysiloxanes with pendant 4-aminopyridyl groups that fold into highly
efficient catalysts. 4) An investigation of the number, size, spatial
distribution and electrostatic features of charge patches on proteins and why
and how proteins interact with polyelectrolytes to form complex coacervates. 5)
Designed catalysts as mimics of biological hydrolases and acyl-transferases. %%%
The computer hardware and software in the macromolecular modeling system allows
one to simulate interactions that take place in molecules in a real laboratory
environment. The insights and information one obtains from such calculations
make it possible to design more efficient and more effective laboratory
experiments.
