Peterson 9302614 The PIs will use faunal, geochemical and stable-isotopic data
to reconstruct climatic changes in the Indian Ocean between 12 and 3.5 Ma
utilizing ODP core material. The study will lead to delineation of surface
temperature gradients, productivity, and the signature of biogenic
sedimentation. It will also provide a time series of monsoonal upwellinmg in the
northwestern Indian Ocean that may be associated with the uplift of the
Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.
