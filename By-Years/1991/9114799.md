The primary aim of this research is to investigate the mechanism of solid state
chemical reactions at the atomic level. High- resolution electron microscopy
(HREM), analytical electron microscopy (AEM), and associated techniques are used
because of their adequate lateral and temporal resolutions. The chemical and
structural evolution of the amorphous gel to the crystalline ceramic will be
examined along with structural and dynamic studies of intercalated low-
dimensional materials, and the complex oxide systems of the rare earths and
doped zirconia. These studies are important in developing new materials such as
structural ceramics, fast ion conductors, and sensors.
