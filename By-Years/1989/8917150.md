This award will provide one-half the funding for acquiring a rare gas mass
spectrometer system to be housed and operated in the Department of Earth,
Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
MIT and Harvard faculty will utilize this equipment ,and MIT and Harvard are
both institutionally committed to providing the remaining half of the funding
required. The instrument will be used for argon 40/39 isotopic analysis leading
to geochronological applications. The interested faculty at MIT and Harvard are
actively involved in research to understand the pressure-temperature-time
history of large rock masses as they become involved in large-scale tectonic
movements (subduction, uplift, etc.). The age-dating capabilities of the argon
40/39 method is a vital input for such studies.
