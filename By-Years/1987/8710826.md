The objective of this project is to develop hardware generation functions that
synthesize hardware correctly. The existence of such functions would result in a
significant savings in design time because the validation effort occurs only
once. Only the generating function needs to be proven correct. The candidate
techniques which will be extended to produce practical designs are: (1) the use
of proven correct recursive functions to generate Boolean logic; (2) compiling,
specifying, and verifying timing and control hardware from specifications
written using temporal logic or the notation of Hoare's Communicating Sequential
Processes (CSP); and (3) the application of equivalence transformations to
rewrite high-level specifications into hardware generation functions which
produce practical and correct arithmetic hardware. Candidate arithmetic
functions include transcendental functions that are calculated based on the
algorithm used by the coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC). Hardware
meta-functions are one class of tool to manage the complexity of VLSI design.
The large gate counts associated with VLSI circuit technology makes unrealistic
the hope that correct detailed interconnection lists and block diagrams can be
synthesized manually. Correct and automated synthesis methods like hardware
meta-functions offer the attractive possibility of creating correct designs from
the start. Thus, the growing impracticality of validating large designs using
simulation is avoided.
