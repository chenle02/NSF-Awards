This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This project will examine the growth and propagation of Electromagnetic Ion-
Cyclotron waves in Earth's magnetosphere. It will look at the polarization
characteristics of the waves and how they are affected by resonant interactions
with energetic particles in the magnetosphere. The non-linear behavior of the
waves will also be investigated. The research will use a newly developed two-
dimension hybrid simulation that uses a coordinate system based on Earth's
dipole magnetic field.

The research will be carried out by a graduate student and will form the basis
of the student's PhD thesis.
