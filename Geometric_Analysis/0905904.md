One of the central themes in differential geometry is to understand curvature
and its implications in terms of geometric and topological properties. This
project is to study two classes of problems involving scalar curvature and Ricci
curvature. The first class of problems concerns compact Riemannian manifolds
with boundary whose scalar or Ricci curvature is positive. It is an important
problem to understand the boundary effect of these curvature conditions. These
problems are related to understanding quasi-local mass in general relativity. A
key specific case is whether a compact 3-manifold with scalar curvature bigger
or equal to six whose boundary is totally geodesic and isometric to the standard
two dimensional sphere is isometric to the three dimensional hemisphere. These
problems will also serve as great source of inspiration and lead to many other
fascinating problems. Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature have
been studied a lot and we have a good knowledge about them. Riemannian manifolds
with a negative lower bound for Ricci curvature are more complicated and less
understood. The author intends to study them by working on some rigidity and
comparison problems involving asymptotic invariants such as entropy and the
spectrum of the Laplace operator. This project aims to study some fundamental
problems involving scalar and Ricci curvature. Progress will deepen our
understanding of curvature and geometry. These problems have interactions with
other areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, probability and
potential theory. Some of these problems are closely related to theoretical
physics, particularly general relativity and their solutions will enhance our
understanding of spacetime. This project will also contribute to the training of
graduate students and post-docs in the area of geometric analysis.
