This proposal will identify the main degrees of freedom of sulfur dioxide (SO2)
injections in creating radiative forcing that has the potential to limit the
impacts of climate change. The capability to inject SO2 in the stratosphere will
be added to the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version of the
Community Earth System Model (CESM-WACCM), a fully coupled land, ocean, ice, and
atmospheric model extending through the stratosphere, which includes full
interactive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry. The study will derive the
most reasonable injection location(s) that can be used as degrees of freedom in
a wel-designed geoengineering scenario.
