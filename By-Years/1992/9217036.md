This project is an investigation of the Lagrangian displacement of water masses
in the deep equatorial Atlantic Ocean using both analytical and numerical
approaches. Two numerical models are used: a reduced gravity shallow water
model, and the GDFL ocean general circulation model. The main scientific goals
are (1) identification of dominant mechanisms for generating wave transients and
how can these transients affect Lagrangian displacement of water masses and, (2)
analysis of effects of bottom topography and shoreline geometry on the
Lagrangian equatorial transport.
