As the observational evidence supporting Einstein's theory of general relativity
as the pre-eminent model for the gravitational field in astrophysics and
cosmology grows stronger, it becomes increasingly important to use the latest
mathematical tools to carefully explore the implications of the theory. This
award supports a focus on new procedures for constructing spacetimes
representing the the interaction of many bodies, and also on new techniques
which allow us to probe the nature of the cosmological singularities predicted
by Einstein's theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports work which
studies various aspects of Ricci flow, the analytical tool which has proven to
be spectacularly successful in proving the Poincare Conjecture and the
Geometrization Conjecture in three dimensions. There is much work to do in
understanding the details of the dynamics of Ricci flow, and how it might be
used to further analyze the relationship between geometry and topology, and this
proposal supports such work, including a number of studies of Ricci flow
stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will participate in the
supported research as part of a PhD dissertation.
