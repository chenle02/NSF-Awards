9354634 Escoe This project focuses on an appropriate design for large-enrollment
introductory micro- and macro-economic courses. The project also applies
concepts and theories that are relevant to undergraduate student roles in the
economy and society. Thematic introductory curricula are being developed to be
more relevant to a diverse student body. Modules for each thematic curriculum
contain approaches and materials designed to encourage "active learning". The
impact of the curricula and learning techniques on student enrollment,
performance, and retention will be analyzed, and it is expected that the
thematic curricula and teaching techniques will better meet the needs of the
target audience at the institution. In addition, general and specific materials
resulting from the project will be disseminated through a series of handbooks,
articles, conferences, and seminars to other faculty and scholars. ***y
