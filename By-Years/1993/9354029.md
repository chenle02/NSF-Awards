9354029 Kimmel Redesigning Introductory Physical Science Courses to Focus on the
Learner as a Prospective Teacher Abstract New Jersey Institute of Technology
(NJIT), Fairleigh Dickinson University (FDU), Jersey City State College (JCSC),
and Montclair State College (MSC) are collaborating in the planning and testing
of undergraduate science courses that combine teaching methodology and content
in courses for all students. The courses involved at each of the four campuses
are chemistry, physics, and earth/spaces sciences. The project explores an
integrated exposure to teaching strategies and content by folding pedagogy into
selected topics in each of the disciplines. NJIT and FDU are working with topics
in chemistry courses, MSC is focusing on physics topics, and JCSC is working
with earth/space science. Evaluation methodologies concentrate on assessing
students' understanding of the topics affected. The science courses will become
part of the reform curriculum for teacher preparation, yet recognize that every
student is a prospective educator in any of a variety of settings. The concept
that college courses combine pedagogy and content should be the basis for all
science and mathematics courses that serve all students as part of the core
curricular/general requirements of the collaborating institutions. ***
