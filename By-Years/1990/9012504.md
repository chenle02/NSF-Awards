The proposed research will test a model that predicts higher rates of encounter
between zooplankton and their prey in turbulent than still water. If this model
is correct, feeding and egg production rates od copepods should increase as
turbulence increases, provided food in limiting. Experiments will be run in
100-1 microcosms using three species of copepod and three levels of turbulence
established using a pair of vibrating grids, with mesh separating the copepods
from the grids. Preliminary measurements will be made to establish the range and
spatial distribution of turbulence. Food concentration will be limiting, except
in high- food containers that will control for direct, physical effects of the
turbulence on the copepods. The model will be supported by significant increases
of egg production or feeding with increasing turbulence in treatments with
limiting food concentrations. This result would have implications for the effect
of the physical environment on copepods and how they obtain their food in the
sea. In addition, it may call into question the applicability of many
experiments on the feeding and growth of copepods in bottles.
