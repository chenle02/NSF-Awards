This Targeted Research project is investigating a model for integrating content
from NSDL into online and web-enhanced courses in higher education. The
project's first user community and testbed are the students and faculty at the
Texas A&amp;M Electronic Teachers College (ETC). CollegisEduprise is supplying
its iLumina digital library infrastructure and its experience with metadata
tagging of learning resources to facilitate the integration of Texas A&amp;M
University System learning objects into the NSDL. Services under development
include mapping of modular learning object content to teacher certification
competencies in high area needs such as mathematics; defining competency-based
metadata vocabularies for these learning objects that reflects the teacher
certification requirements; and creating a Content-Packaging Tool Suite to
enable faculty to select learning objects from a repository, build them into
learning modules, and connect them into course-management systems or other
delivery platforms. These services are being designed and implemented in a
generalizable way to enable effective integration into the NSDL and sharing with
others who want competency-tagged learning materials and tools to construct
learning modules from them.
