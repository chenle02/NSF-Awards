Catherine J. Murphy and Michael Wyatt, University of South Carolina, are
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
for exploratory research into the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles. Gold
nanoparticles with sizes ranging from four to 200 nm will be functionalized with
amino acids, small peptides and other bioactive groups. The functionalized
nanoparticles will be characterized by electronic absorption spectroscopy,
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy and
then tested for cytotoxicity. Further pharmacological characterization will
include determining the mechanism of cell death and subcellular localization
studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
supports high risk/high impact research in nanobiotechnology. Chemists and
pharmacologists will conduct preliminary studies on the interactions of
nanoparticles with cells. Because nanoparticles are being considered as cellular
imaging and drug-delivery agents, it is important to understand the inherent
bio-activity of these nanoparticles. The nanoparticle may mimic the size, shape
and surface functionality of protein aggregates that have also shown cytotoxic
responses.
