0331276&lt;br/&gt;Fred Roberts, DIMACS&lt;br/&gt;Workshop on Information
Processing in the Biological
Organism&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop on Information
Processing in the Biological Organism will bring together internationally known
experts in systems biology. The workshop will investigate information processing
in biological organisms from the general point of view of systems biology. The
workshop will discuss model systems concerning information processing in the
biological organism, the mathematical foundations and algorithms of broad and
central utility for this topic, the next generation of reference resources
needed for it, and how the topic might inform other disciplines, including
computer science. Issues to be emphasized include gene-to-product information
flows, signal fusion within the cell, cell-to-cell communication, and
information flow at the system level, including environmental interaction. A
report summarizing the workshop recommendations will be presented to the Fall
BISTIC Symposium. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
