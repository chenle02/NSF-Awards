Dr. Howse and co-investigator Dr. Frankenberg, representing the Southern
Association of Marine Laboratories (SAML), will organize a multi-phase program
to increase the minority presence in marine science; the Gulf Coast Research
Laboratory will handle administrative matters. The first phase will be a two-day
planning meeting of ten SAML representatives with an equal representation from
minority institutions with whom they have interacted in the past. This meeting
is scheduled for September, 1988, in North Carolina, and will (1) review
previous SAML activities to attract minority students into marine science, (2)
review minority institution experience with recruitment activities in science,
and (3) plan a program of activities built on past successes in recruitment of
minorities to science, especially marine science.
