This award is for the purchase of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer, to
carry out materials research in quantitative surface depth profiling of
polymers, reflectance spectroscopy of monolayers, physical properties and
structure of polyamides and fabrication of integrated circuits. The unusually
high sensitivity of infrared spectroscopy to molecular structure and environment
as expressed through peak frequency, area, intensity and half-width establishes
the technique as essential for new insight in these materials research areas.
The chemical and physical information available from vibrational spectroscopy is
vital to an increased understanding of materials. The proposed instrument will
provide a high degree of flexibility in terms of data acquisition, software
modification and hardware control imperative to the design and execution of
state-of-the-art materials science research.
