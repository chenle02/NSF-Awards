Dr. Larrabee is developing and using three different structural probe techniques
to study the coupled binuclear copper sites in hemocyanin, tyrosinase and
laccase. These probes are: 1) substitution of other metals for copper followed
by uv/vis, CD and MCD spectral studies; 2) binding of exogenous ligands to the
native and metal substituted proteins, followed by spectral studies, and 3)
infrared spectroscopy of the internal vibrational modes of bound exogenous
ligands. Coupled binuclear copper is found at the active site of a variety of
proteins of living systems from fungi to humans. These proteins are involved in
oxygen transport (hemocyanins) or in activation of dioxygen (tyrosine, laccase).
Because of the large size and complexity of these proteins the exact structures
of their active sites are unknown. Most of our knowledge of these structures has
developed through the study of their spectroscopic properties.
