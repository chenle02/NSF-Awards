The Virginia Tech Site of the I/UCRC for High-Performance Reconfigurable
Computing (CHREC) seeks to further build its momentum from its initial phase of
operation through a Phase II award. Reconfigurable computing, promises to
realize performance potential of underlying hardware system resources in a
highly adaptive manner, maximizing performance while minimizing implementation
challenges such as system size, weight, cost, and power. Areas of research
thrust for the next phase of the Virginia Tech CHREC site include accelerator
research, open-source tools, HPC-GPU and cross-compilation
technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leadership in reconfigurable hardware and
system platforms represents a critical area for national competitiveness of
every growing cyber-enabled economy. Working with its Industrial Advisory Board,
the Virginia Tech site of the CHREC center along with the center as a whole
intends to serve as a catalyst that brings leading organizations together to
define common goals, methods, and standards. Research results are planned to be
integrated into the university educational process with expanded programs at
multiple levels in engineering. Activities are planned to be structured to
attract a diverse set of students and faculty, including underrepresented
students via several minority recruitment programs.&lt;br/&gt;
