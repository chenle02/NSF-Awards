This award supports cooperative research in enzyme biochemistry between William
Stahl of the University of Washington in Seattle and Marta Antonelli of the
Institute of Cellular Biology in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The study will examine
the role of specific sequences of isoforms of the catalytic subunit of the
Na,K-ATPase in ouabain binding. One important goal is to establish whether the
C-terminus of the catalytic subunit is intracelular or extracellular. In
addition, a long term goal is to establish localization of isoforms with
different ouabain binding characteristics by light microscope
immunocytochemistry. Dr. Antonelli has support for this work at the Institute
through collaboration with its Director, Jorge Saavedra's immunocytochemistry
group. The have extensive experience in light and electron microscope
immunocytochemistry. Their methodologies have been utilized by Dr. Stahl in his
laboratory. The collaboration will provide an opportunity to make use of the
excellent facilities in Argentina for localization of the Na,K-ATPase isoforms
to provide insight into the structure of the cardiac glycoside binding site in
different isoforms of the catalytic subunit. This is complementary to studies in
Seattle on expression of mRNAs coding for isoforms with high and low affinities
for cardiac glycosides. Brought together in this collaboration, these efforts
will provide a broader, more comprehensive approach to understanding functional
aspects of Na,K-ATPases.
