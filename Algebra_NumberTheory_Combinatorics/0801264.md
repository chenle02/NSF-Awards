L-functions are the basic functions of number theory and are fundamental in the
study of prime numbers, solutions to equations in whole numbers, and the
uniformity of the distribution of arithmetic sequences. The first L-function is
the Riemann zeta-function. The location of its zeros is the subject of the
Riemann Hypothesis which is widely regarded as the most important unsolved
problem in all of mathmatics. In this project the PI will study various
approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis. In addition, he will investigate some very
specific statistical properties of the Riemann zeta-function and of families of
L-functions in order to more fully understand thes mysterious functions.

The PI and his collaborators intend to prove that most of the zeros of
Dirichlet L-functions are on the critical line. They also will to develop a
general tool, the asymptotic large sieve, to address problems involving averages
over all primitive Dirichlet characters of modulus less than a given parameter.
They will use this to investigate the spacings between zeros of Dirichlet
L-functions. Another project is to determine (conjecturally) the arithemetic
part of the distribution of spacings between consecutive zeros of the Riemann
zeta-function. Finally, the PI would like to prove the reciprocity formula that
he conjectured for Vasyunn sums, and to investigate its relevance in the Nyman-
Beurling approach to the Riemann Hypothesis.
