Vacuolar function is essential to the regulation of cytosolic calcium levels.
Calcium-binding proteins unique to the vacuolar membrane have been identified.
The immediate goal of this project is to purify and characterize these proteins
in terms of affinity, capacity, and cation selectivity. Polyclonal antibodies
will be used to study the tissue-specific expression patterns of these proteins,
particularly with regard to the process of vacuolation and biogenesis of the
vacuole membrane system. Antibody will further serve to identify cDNA clones in
expression libraries encoding these proteins. %%% Plant cells contain large
membrane-enclosed compartments, which serve a number of biochemical and
structural functions for the plant cell. Some of these are relatively
"universal" functions associated generally with lysosome-type compartments;
others are unique for plants. Accordingly, the vacuole has an essential role in
growth and development. It is remarkable that few vacuolar membrane activities
have been examined and fewer still have been identified and examined at the
molecular level. There is not yet a clear understanding of either the origins of
this organelle or the means by which vacuolar membrane proteins are continuously
replenished. This study will contribute to an understanding of the molecular
basis for the role of the vacuole in conferring to higher plants the ability to
respond to its environment and carry out the normal processes of growth and
development.
