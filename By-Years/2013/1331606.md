An AGS Post-Doctoral Fellow will undertake analysis of long-term, continuous,
high-resolution data set (2009-2011) of methane and non-methane hydrocarbons
(NMHC) at Summit, Greenland as tracers for identifying and studying transport of
individual pollution events to the Arctic, along with their primary source
regions.

Investigations will be conducted to determine the seasonal and yearly frequency
and variability of pollutant transport events and their impacts on the Arctic
climate system. Similar NMHC measurements from other high-altitude sites (i.e.
Pico Mountain, Jungfraujoch, Hohenpeissenberg) will be compared to the Summit
data to establish background conditions and determine whether Summit, in
comparison to other sites, is subjected to more or less transport at different
times of year. Positive matrix factorization will be used as a tool to decipher
emissions sources and their contributions to Arctic pollution events. FLEXPART-
based transport modeling studies will be incorporated to perform source region
allocations of pollution events.

This research is supported under the AGS Postdoctoral Research Fellowship
program.
