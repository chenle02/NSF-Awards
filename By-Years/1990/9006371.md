In this project ("Structure and Rearrangement of Carbocations. The Isotopic
Perturbation Method") in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Martin Saunders
of the Chemistry Department at Yale University will continue studies on the
development and applications of the isotopic perturbation method. The focus of
this project will be the investigation of the fundamental properties of reactive
carbocations. This project will be focussed on the extension of the isotopic
perturbation method to study the cooperative effects of multiple deuteration
which produces equilibrium isotope effects that are nonlinear functions of the
number of deuterium atoms. Experimental evidence will be obtained from
investigations of the angular dependence of the isotope effects in rapid
processes which include rotation around single bonds that varies dihedral angles
between carbocation orbitals and carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds. Ab
initio quantum mechanical calculations will be performed to predict the energies
and structures of carbocations and to predict equilibrium isotope effects which
will be compared with the experimental results.
