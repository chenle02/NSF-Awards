This award in the NSF/DARPA Joint Initiative on Image Understanding and Speech
Recognition will support development of a directional microphone chip for
tracking sound sources. This acoustic array, together with a new nonlinear
optimization algorithm, should permit nulling of noise sources and tracking or
nulling of individual speakers. The ultimate goal is improved speech recognition
in noisy or acoustically confusing environments.
