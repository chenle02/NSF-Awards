Maryland Instructional Television, in conjunction with the National Science
Teachers Association, will use the expertise of scientists and educators and the
medium of television to create an exciting science video series for children
ages four through seven. The activities of the project include the
identification of content, design of instructional video and ancillary print
materials, and formative evaluation. Fifteen video programs will be developed,
each containing two or three separate sub-programs. These will be supplemented
by teacher and parent guides which will suggest activities designed to expand
upon the material covered in the program. The series content and materials will
explore everyday events in the lives of young children and will integrate
science and mathematics concepts, skills and application into a variety of
curricular areas. The companion activities will make use of objects already in
the child's world or easily accessible in the home. This project is funded
jointly with the Instructional Materials Development Program.
