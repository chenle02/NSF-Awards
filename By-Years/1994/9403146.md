9403146 Leon Dr. Jeffrey W. Leon has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Leon received his doctoral degree from the
University of Rochester under the supervision of Professor David Whitten. Dr.
Leon will continue research at Cornell University under the sponsorship of
Professor Jean Frechet. His postdoctoral research will target the synthesis and
catalytic properties of a water-soluble starburst dendrimer having a
metalloporphyrin at the focal point. This macromolecule will serve as a
catalytic reaction chamber for the epoxidation of olefins. Longer term, he will
study metalloporphyrin cored dendrimers as analogs of electron transfer
proteins. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed
as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and
experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in
contemporary chemical research and teaching.
