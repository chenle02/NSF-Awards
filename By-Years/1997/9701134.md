9701134 Wills Microsatellite sequences are arrays of short repeated DNA
sequences. Their variation in repeat number makes them useful for studying many
questions in population biology. Such arrays are highly unstable, and a current
topic of debate is over what factors influence the stability of these sequences.
This project aims to develop yeast as a model system to study microsatellites,
in which hypotheses can be tested by experiments. Development of a yeast model
will entail rigorous computer analysis of the complete yeast genome and the
determination of mutation rates at a range of loci, using molecular genetic
techniques. Over 20 unstable repeats have been identified in yeast. The relative
roles of repeat length, repeat sequence, genetic context, and cellular growth
conditions on the stability of these repeats will be examined. This project will
develop molecular markers for the study of laboratory and natural strains of
yeast. The identification of unstable loci in yeast should lead to a powerful
model system to test evolutionary hypotheses about mutations at such loci. This
work will allow comparative studies of microsatellite sequences as they relate
to genome organization, stability, and evolution.
