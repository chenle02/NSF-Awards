Prediction of tropical cyclone intensity change remains a very difficult
problem. One reason is that the dynamic and thermodynamic processes associated
with tropical cyclones are not well understood. The PI plans to use flight-level
and Global Position Satellite (GPS) dropsonde data collected from reconnaissance
flight missions, as well as satellite and radar retrieved data, to 1) study the
inner-core structure and dynamics with emphasis on forces driving hurricane
inner-core convection and its feedback to the hurricane vortex; 2) investigate
the variability of the tropical cyclone boundary layer kinematic and
thermodynamic structure; and 3) improve methods of predicting short-term
tropical cyclone intensity based on the tangential wind profile using
observational data.

The planned research has the potential of providing new knowledge on tropical
cyclone structure and intensity change, as well as generating a new conceptual
model for intensity prediction.
