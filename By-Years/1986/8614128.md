The project will study cores in the Sulu Sea and South China Sea in order to
contrast a silled, anoxic basin with an open oxygenated basin, respectively,
during a glacial to interglacial cycle. The advantage of a study of this type in
this area is that an open ocean study area of anoxic (or at least oxygen
deficient) conditions does not have the problems of terrigenous input during
periods of low sea level as would be found in the more common continental margin
sites. The study involves foraminiferal studies, oxygen and carbon isotopic
studies, and bathymetric distribution of benthic foraminifera. These studies
would determine the paleoenvironmental conditions during the glacial and
interglacial periods, examine the controls on benthic populations in a shallow
silled basin, and provide a baseline study in an area where future ODP drilling
may occur. The paleoenvironmental information may be used to study the glacial
to interglacial contrasts in monsoonal characteristics in the western Pacific.
