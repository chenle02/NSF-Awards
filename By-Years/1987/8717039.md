This project is in the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative in the Office of
Special Projects in Chemistry. It is under the co-direction on Jacqueline Barton
(Chemistry) and Lawrence Chasin (Biological Sciences) and involves the search
for understanding of distinct DNA conformations and the mapping of binding sites
in extra cellular and intra cellular media. This research is important to the
understanding of altered DNA structure and local conformation along DNA strands.
The overall objective of this research is to relate conforma- tional
polymorphism of DNA which has been observed in vitro to that in the biological
environment. Chiral metal complexes which recognize and distinguish the A, B,
and Z conformations of DNA will be used, upon photoactivation, to cleave the DNA
strands. The points of cleavage will be identified by electro- phoresis. This
will provide the basis for comparison of in vivo conformations of DNA with those
previously observed in vitro. Results from this research will answer questions
concerning whether selected regions of DNA are protected or accessible and
whether variations in local conformation relate to gene expression.
