Colorado at Boulder will purchase an Optical Spectrum Analyzer with an optical
fiber connector input. The equipment will be used for sever al research projects
and in the undergraduate and graduate optics laboratory courses. This instrument
displays in real time, on an oscilloscope like screen, the spectral
characteristics of the input optical signal from the visible to the infrared
region of the spectrum. It also has a standard communications port to transfer
data to a printer or computer for printing or analysis. Three research projects
will immediately use this instrument: i) a multi wavelength, optical
communications network; ii) semiconductor laser analysis, and iii) rare earth
doped semiconductor luminescence. Experiments using the OSA would improve the
quality of the laboratory courses by exposing the students to state of the art
techniques in optical fiber communications. ********
