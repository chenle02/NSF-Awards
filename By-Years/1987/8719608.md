The focus of Dr. Beetem's work is incremental CAD tools, that is, design tools
that support and take advantage of an incremental design methodology. An example
is an incremental router which reroutes changed wires, but leaves the majority
of the unchanged wires alone. A non-incremental router reroutes all wires even
when only one is changed. This research explores both incremental tools and
interaction between these tools in a design system. Of particular importance in
Dr. Beetem's research is incremental simulation, which has the potential for an
order of magnitude increase in performance over non-incremental simulation.
Several new, incremental simulation concepts are being explored as part of this
research. Prototype tools are used to design digital hardware, thereby assessing
productivity of the new tools.
