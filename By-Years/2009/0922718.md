The LI-COR Infrared Imaging System acquired with this Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) award will enhance protein based research by several
Colleges, Research Centers, and regional collaborators located near Erie, PA.
Specific projects focus on the determination of toxin abundance and distribution
by phages and bacteria in nature, identification of genes involved in axon
pathfinding in zebrafish, and examination of gene expression patterns involved
in wound healing, ripening of tomatoes, and cold tolerance in insects. These
projects representing diverse fields of Biological and Biochemical study will
allow for state of the art training in protein analysis for undergraduate
students with plans to pursue graduate studies or science careers. Moreover,
class based laboratory projects in courses including Cell Biology, Biochemistry,
Molecular Biology, and Instrumental Analysis will allow for further training of
hundreds of undergraduate students with various backgrounds and interests in
research advancement not directly related to these specific faculty mentored
research projects. Results of the research projects enabled by the LI-COR system
will be presented by Mercyhurst students and faculty at regional or national
meetings, published in peer-reviewed journals, and made available on the
departmental WWW-site.
