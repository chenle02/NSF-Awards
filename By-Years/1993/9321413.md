This project of Thomas Meyer, University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), in the
Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, involves the study
of photoinduced electron and energy transfer in molecular assemblies that
include extended arrays of polypyridyl complexes of Ru(II), Os(II) and Re(I) as
chromophores and various redox carriers coupling these arrays to electron donors
and acceptors. The potentials of the latter moieties will be chosen to provide a
free energy gradient so that electrons and holes migrate away from the initial
excited state metal centers. The transient infrared and Raman resonance
spectroscopies will be used to determine the sites of oxidation and reduction in
the charge separated excited state. Systems will be synthesized for study of
conversion of single-photon, single-electron events into multiple redox
equivalents that are required for catalytic bond-forming reactions. These will
be constructed around a metal oxo center that is catalytically active for the
oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. The conversion of light energy to chemical
energy, as accomplished by plants during photosynthesis, has largely eluded
scientists. In photosynthesis, a single photon stimulates multiple redox
processes that lead to formation and cleavage of chemical bonds. This project
draws upon recent advances in inorganic photochemistry to suggest ways that
large molecular assemblies can be constructed that will generate a separated
electron-hole pair that can be utilized to stimulate multiple redox events.
Studies such as this lay valuable, and badly needed, ground work for ultimately
utilizing solar energy for chemical processing.
