With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program, the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (UALR) is working
with Henderson Middle School, UALR Children's International and the Museum of
Discovery to recruit 40 undergraduate students majoring in Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines and prepare them to become secondary
school teachers. Additionally, internships will support five first and second-
year students in informal science settings to provide them with early teaching
experiences. Upon completion of licensure, Noyce teachers will be supported by
biannual UALRTeach Professional Development Days during induction, and work
primarily in the high-needs Little Rock School District.

Arkansas is in particular need of STEM trained professionals due to the overall
shortfall in college degrees within the state which contribute to severe
shortages in STEM areas, and the UALRTeach program will respond to this need
through the preparation of highly-qualified STEM secondary teachers.
Underrepresented students will be targeted for recruitment into the UALRTeach
program to increase the diversity of secondary STEM teachers.
