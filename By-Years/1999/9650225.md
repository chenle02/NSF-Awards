The Department of Geography and Earth Science trains earth science
professionals and secondary teachers through instruction in the standard geology
curriculum and the application of field and laboratory problems. To enhance this
training program, the department is obtaining an x-ray diffractometer (XRD).
This acquisition significantly improves the Geography and Earth Science
curricula on two levels: (1) students, most of whom are destined for employment
in the environmental industry, can learn to use this device as an analytical
tool with which geologic problems can be investigated and (2) many basic
geologic concepts of mineralogy, petrology, and sedimentary geology can be
taught by laboratory exercises employing the XRD, through which students become
familiar with the theory and operation of the instrument. Execution of this
project entails the integration of the XRD into three existing courses
(Mineralogy, Petrology, and Stratigraphy and Sedimentation). In addition,
applications of the XRD to various geologic problems are being taught in a new
course (Laboratory Methods in Geology). Students are encouraged to utilize the
power of this instrument in designing their own projects for the course in
senior research.
