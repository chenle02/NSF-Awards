This project is concerned with problems in noncommutative ring theory, category
theory and other areas of algebra. The principal investigator will work on
representable functors from varieties of associative rings to varieties of other
algebraic objects. In addition, he will study the Gel'fand-Kirillov dimension of
factor rings and lattices realizable as lattices of all two-sided ideals of von
Neumann regular rings. The research supported concerns a wide spectum of
problems in ring theory. It has the potential of impacting many areas of
mathematics including ring theory, algebraic number theory, finite group theory
and universal algebra, as well as, computer science.
