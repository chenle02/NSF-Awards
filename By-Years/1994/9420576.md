9420576 Kim ABSTRACT The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is proposing
an interdisciplinary combined research-curriculum development project to develop
methodologies for achieving effective collaboration and integration of
industrial design and product engineering in the early phases of product
development, and to develop integrated engineering and industrial design
curriculum where industrial design and engineering students will learn the
integration methodologies and conduct interdisciplinary product design projects.
The project team led by three principal investigators representing industrial
design, engineering design and manufacturing engineering has been developing
design support tools appropriate to improve combined evaluations from industrial
designers concerns and engineering and manufacturing considerations.
Specifically, four major tool development efforts will be made for (1) design
history documenting system, (2) associative, shape design tools, (3) design for
manufacture comparative cost models and design-to cost tools and (4) designer-
friendly interface for rapid prototyping tools. Based on newly developed design
methodologies and tools for integrated engineering and industrial design, fully
collaborated, innovative curriculum, composed of two core courses, will be
developed in a tightly integrated design studio and prototyping laboratory.
Emphasis will be on the integrated design methods and tools in the first
semester course, and on interdisciplinary team-based design projects sponsored
by industry in the second semester course. ***
