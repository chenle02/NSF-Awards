This project investigates the static and dynamic partitioning of optical
networks into domains or clusters and addresses the problem of providing
survivable end-to-end service provisioning for unicast and multicast traffic
over such multi-domain networks. A large optical network, even if administered
by a single operator, needs to maintain its state information in a distributed
and multi-domain hierarchy for purposes of scalability and fault-tolerance.
Moreover, dynamic reconfiguration is often necessary to respond and adapt to
sudden unexpected events or changes in network conditions. Other significant
challenges in such a heterogeneous multi-domain environment are to implement
end-to-end routing and survivability mechanisms, which are complicated by the
limited amount of state information shared across domains due to factors related
to business, policy, security, and other issues. This project enables a self-
organizing framework for survivable optical networks. The project is addressing
new methods for defining and reconfiguring domains based on service and
performance requirements, introduces several new mechanisms for providing
survivability in multi-domain networks, and is introducing new algorithms and
protocols for provisioning survivable end-to-end unicast and multicast services
in a scalable and cost-efficient manner. The broader impact of this work is that
it can lead to a more robust and dynamic optical control layer that will enable
the deployment of a greater range of end-to-end optical services to support
emerging applications. It envisions greater intelligence in the control plane of
optical transport networks, potentially leading to a network that is more
autonomous than networks in existing ASON and GMPLS frameworks.
