The project aims at increasing the ability to respond to large-scale disasters
and manage emergencies by including robots and agents as teammates of humans in
search and rescue teams. The project focuses on large teams of humans and robots
that have only incomplete knowledge of the disaster situation while they
accomplish the mission to rescue people and prevent
fires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology to achieve cooperation within the
teams will be based on the development of mental models shared by team members.
The shared mental models will facilitate the interactions among robots and
humans by providing a suitable level of abstraction enabling them to share
beliefs, desires, and intentions as they work to accomplish their
tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The performance of teamwork models will be measured
by comparing various task performance metrics (such as time to save people),
system level metrics (such as computation time or message traffic), and amount
of sharedness of the mental models. The experimental work will be conducted
using the open source RoboCup Search and Rescue
Simulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include integration of research
results in undergraduate courses, availability of the software produced as open
source, outreach activities to expose K-12 students to research issues and to
excite them about using computing methods for real-world problems. The long term
objective is to improve preparadeness for emergency situations, which will help
saving lives and minimizing loss of properties.
