This project extends a theory of decision making in or- ganizations. It will
compare several decision strategies in terms of effectiveness as functions of
the communication and influence structure. The theoretical extensions include
accoun- ting for individual differences, unstable or 'chaotic' network
structures, and increasingly complex payoff interdependencies. After theoretical
development, research will test and apply the theory in three settings: computer
simulations, controlled laboratory experiments, and natural settings. Results
should link social exchange theories to theories of network selection and
organizational behavior.
