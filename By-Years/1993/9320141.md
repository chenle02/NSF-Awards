9320141 Dickinson Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a growing national problem
without a good solution. This project targets MSW as a low grade/hazardous fuel
and represents a distinct improvement over current combustion/incineration
methods By combining a wet RR and Wet Thermal Oxidation, EnerTech seeks to
commercialize an alternative waste disposal method which is less costly, more
energy efficient, and has excellent control over gaseous and solid emissions.
