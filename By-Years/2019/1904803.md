The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division funds
Professor Miriam Freedman for studies of ice nucleation. At temperatures above
approximately -38 degrees Celsius (or -36 degrees Fahrenheit), ice particles in
the atmosphere are only formed through nucleation on aerosol particles. Here,
nucleation is the first step in the formation of solid (ice) via self-assembly
or self-organization of liquid. Particles differ widely in their ice nucleation
activity. The aim is to measure the ice nucleation activity of many materials to
develop a model that predicts which surface properties of the particles are most
important for promoting ice nucleation. Because the types of particles found in
the atmosphere are limited in number, man-made nanomaterials, sand, and other
materials with specific surfaces are being studied. The properties of these
synthesized materials can be tuned to explore the effect of different surface
characteristics on ice nucleation. These studies enhance the understanding of
the molecular basis of ice nucleation, which is important for industrial
applications and atmospheric chemistry, specifically the research could reduce
uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interactions, which are the largest uncertainty
in our understanding of weather and climate. This work is of interest to the
physical chemistry community because it deals with phase transitions,
heterogeneous catalysis, and surface chemistry all of which are critical to
industrial applications. This project provides training for undergraduate and
graduate students, as well as outreach to the public through outreach events
focusing on science and science policy.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ice nucleation
activity of several materials is being investigated. Specifically proposed
materials are amorphous silica nanoparticles, mesoporous silica, the phase
change material GeTe, silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles, salt (NaCl/KCl)
mixtures, zeolites, and metal organic frameworks. The materials are selected for
their ability to tune surface characteristics such as functional groups,
crystallinity, crystal structure, porosity, and dopants. Both immersion and
deposition mode freezing are measured in laboratory ice nucleation chambers. In
addition to laboratory studies, kinematic models are used to explore the impact
of heterogeneous nucleation on the properties of mixed phase and cirrus
clouds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
