This project launches the creation of a new class of playground apparatus based
on an emerging understanding of how students learn mathematics and science
concepts. The equipment will be highly interactive and instrumented, providing
opportunities for thoughtful, planned actions that children can evaluate with
the aid of instrumentation. The design principles used are applicable to many
mathematics and science topics, but this initial demonstration is restricted to
creating units which embody some important concepts from classical mechanics. We
will create, test, evaluate, and begin the dissemination of units incorporating
timing, motion, and force sensor electronics designed to give children real-
time, symbolic feedback to reflect their experiences. The first nine months will
be devoted to the apparatus design, building, testing, safety evaluation, and
formative research. We will install apparatus in three highly varied sites to
evaluate the design. In a second phase, improved units will be built for one
site and detailed research on student learning undertaken. If we observe the
hypothesized learning, the approach we use in mechanics will have broad
generalizability. This work could lead to interesting and highly educational
apparatus addressing other science fields and useful in a broad range of
informal learning environments.
