A major objective of the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference is to
bring together every two years leading members of the scientific community,
graduate students, and post docs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects
in marine chemistry within an informal setting. In 2013, the Chemical
Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held August 4-9, 2013 at the
University of New England, Maine. The theme for this year's conference will be
"Chemical Geography of the Sea" and aims to synthesize the advances made in
Chemical Oceanography due to high resolution measurements from global scale
survey programs such as CLIVAR and GEOTRACES as well as smaller regional
studies. The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings
together scientists that are leading contributors in the field of marine
chemistry and graduate students/postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative
research. . Presentations and discussions at the 2013 Gordon Conference will
center around the following session topics: (1) Overview of the US GEOTRACES
North Atlantic Section; (2) Results from US GEOTRACES North Atlantic Section;
(3) Processes at Ocean Boundaries; (4) Carbon, Oxygen, and the Biological Pump;
(5) Towards a Definition of Ocean Biogeochemical Provinces; (6) Biogeography of
Organic Compounds in Seawater; (7) Time-Series in Redox-Active Regimes; (8)
Regional Seas and Margin Processes; and (9) Geography of Benthic and Nearshore
Processes. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become
recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary
field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances. For this
reason, the National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research
Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 15 graduate
student/post docs and 28 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs in the 2013
Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference.
