9319354 Pezzementi Whenever one moves a muscle, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase
insures that the muscle will relax by breaking down the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine, which is released by the nervous system initiating the processes
of muscle contraction. Thus, acetylcholinesterase is required for all motor
activity, including writing and speech. In addition to acetylcholinesterase,
humans possess another evolutionarily related enzyme, butyrylcholinesterase,
with similar, but distinct, characteristics. In contrast to
acetylcholinesterase, the function of this enzyme is unknown. In fact, there
appear to be individuals who lack this enzyme entirely, yet appear normal. It
has been suggested that butyrylcholinesterase acts as a scavenger of ingested
neurotoxins and that it plays a role in the embryological development of the
nervous system. Although humans and other higher vertebrates possess both
cholinesterases, lower vertebrates appear to possess only one,
acetylcholinesterase. Invertebrates also possess only one cholinesterase;
however, it is neither acetylcholinesterase, nor butyrylcholinesterase, but an
enzyme with intermediate characteristics. It has been stated that "nothing in
biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution." Thus, in an attempt to
clarify the roles of the two cholinesterases in humans, in particular
butyrylcholinesterase, Dr. Pezzementi is tracing the evolution of the two
enzymes, using the techniques of biochemistry, pharmacology, and recombinant DNA
technology to study the structure and function of cholinesterases in selected
organisms, where the transition from a single intermediate cholinesterase to two
distinct cholinesterases occurs. Integration of this information with the
biology of the organisms in question could provide further clues about the
physiological functions of these enzymes. ***
