This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental, Population and
Organismic Biology at the University of Colarado at Bolder to establish a
Research Experience for Undergraduates SITE in ecology and behavior. The program
will provide undergraduates contemplating a career in the biological sciences
with 1) an introduction to current research in the areas of soil ecology, plant
and insect ecology, plant physiology, and behavioral ecology; 2) the opportunity
to conduct original research in a supportive, interactive environment; and 3)
instruction in the planning, execution, and interpretation of research in the
areas of ecology and behavior. All participating students will attend weekly
meetings that will introduce them to the fields of ecology and behavior, aid in
planning and executing an original research project, and provide advice on
applying to graduate school. They will also present the results of their
research in a short seminar at the end of the summer. Students will work with
faculty members on their projects, and will also be able to interact with other
students and post-docs in their laboratories.
