The investigators will undertake a unified program of atmospheric science
research that merges state-of-the-art experimental capabilities in optical
aeronomy, use of advanced numerical models, in-depth graduate student training,
robust collaborations with colleagues in the US and abroad, and significant
general education and public outreach activities. The effort includes fixed-site
atmospheric observations in five locations, campaign-mode experiments, and
utilization of multi-diagnostic facilities, model development, and satellite-
ground based data analyses efforts. The group will conduct observations in four
global regions where geophysical activity displays transient effects of
intrinsic scientific interest and recognized societal impact: auroral, sub-
auroral, mid-latitude and equatorial phenomena. These include the study of so-
called tall auroral rays, proton aurora, sub-auroral red (SAR) arcs, equatorial
plasma instabilities, anomalous winds from the midnight temperature maximum, and
the use of ionosondes to validate modeling of ionospheric variability. The group
will continue its existing program in general education and public outreach
through discussion group activities at the weekly "Open Nights" at the Boston
University Observatory. Research expertise with instrumentation and remote-site
observations will bring solar-terrestrial science to lay audiences using
advanced video methods.
