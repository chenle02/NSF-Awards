The project funds the travel expenses of US-based researchers to the Eleventh
International Conference on Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods in
Scientific Computing, to be held in Leuven, Belgium, April 6--11 2014. The
meeting will consider advanced methods for psuedo-random number generation,
construction of low discrepancy point sets, complexity of algorithms, particle
methods, rare event simulation, Markov chain Monte Carlo and applications of
Monte Carlo methods. There will be tutorial sessions on multilevel Monte Carlo
and on global sensitivity indices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Monte Carlo (MC)
method is a computer based simulation using random number generators. The name
was given by atomic researchers in&lt;br/&gt;the 1940s who likened their
simulation methods to keeping score in a casino in order to learn some odds.
Monte Carlo methods are used in every branch of science and engineering because
they allow brute force computer power to be used on problems that are too
complicated to solve mathematically. Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods replace
simulated random numbers by strategically chosen ones. By leaving&lt;br/&gt;less
to chance, large improvements in accuracy are possible. MC and QMC methods are
widely applied in computer graphics to make animated movies and other images, in
computational finance to control risks, in statistical inference to separate
real findings from chance fluctuations, and in many other areas. Much of the top
QMC work is done in Europe, Asia, Canada and Australia. This conference will
bring together leading researchers from around the world to share results. The
project will support travel expenses of US based researchers to participate in
this exchange of knowledge. One of the researchers is a US-based expert giving a
major talk. The majority of the funds are for young US-based researchers in the
mathematical sciences, including PhD students, postdocs, and junior
professors.&lt;br/&gt;Further updates will be made available via the conference
