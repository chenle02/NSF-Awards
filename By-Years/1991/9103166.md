Under the direction of Dr. Elmer Miller, Judy Lustig, a graduate student at
Temple University will conduct doctoral dissertation research. She will focus on
the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdom periods of ancient Egypt and examine
the relationships among gender ideology and roles, kinship structure and beliefs
and practices about ancestors. Because the database is so rich, it will enable
her to ask specific kinds of questions which cannot be addressed in most
archaeological situations. Primary sources include scenes, texts and statuary
found in elite tombs as well as a variety of literary and religious texts
concerning divine and human relationships and the values Egyptians attached to
these. Cemetery, village and house plans will be utilized as additional sources
of social information. This research is of anthropological significance for
several reasons. It will shed light from a new perspective on the social
processes which led to the growth of Egyptian civilization. Secondly, it is
methodologically innovative. While an anthropological/archaeological approach
stresses the search for the general rules which underlay human behavior and
which are best revealed by their development over long periods of time,
Egyptiologists tend to review their subject matter from a tighter more
historical perspective. Therefore, anthropological archaeology and Egyptology
constitute, unfortunately, two distinct disciplines with very little overlap and
anthropologists rarely examine Egyptian data. Ms Lustig's research cuts across
this divide since it will examine this Egyptian material with an
anthropologist's eye and use this database to ask anthropological questions.
Hopefully, it will mark a path which others will follow. This project will also
assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.
