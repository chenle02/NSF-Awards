Pair programming transforms a traditionally solitary activity into a
collaborative one. In pair programming, software is developed by two programmers
working at a single computer workstation. However, some students have difficulty
pairing due to the collocation requirement. The PI has developed a tool that
allows pair programmers to work from separate locations. This tool will enhance
the educational infrastructure, and permit more students to enjoy the benefits
of pair programming. Removing the collocation limitation of pair programming
will encourage more educators to allow their students to pair. This project will
evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in an introductory programming course.
It is expected that students who are allowed to use this tool will spend less
time working alone, and will have better working relationships with their
partners than those who must physically meet to pair.
