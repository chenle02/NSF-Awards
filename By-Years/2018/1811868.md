High-dimensional, high-order data commonly arise from a wide range of
applications, such as neuroimaging, microbiology, bioinformatics, longitudinal
studies, and material sciences. These data possess distinct characteristics
compared with traditional low-dimensional or low-order data and pose
unprecedented challenges to the statistical community. Dimension reduction often
becomes the crucial first step in order to better summarize, visualize, and
analyze high-dimensional high-order data. One natural approach is to unfold
high-order data into matrices, followed by the use of well-established matrix
dimension reduction methods. However, such operations often lead to loss of
information on the intrinsic data structures and sub-optimal statistical results
of subsequent analyses. In addition, the naive generalization of traditional
statistical methods to high-dimensional, high-order data is often statistically
or computationally infeasible. Therefore, there is a critical need for new high-
dimensional high-order data dimension reduction methods.

In this project, the PI plans to develop new theories, methodologies, and
computational algorithms to address a series of fundamental problems in high-
dimensional, high-order data dimension reduction. The project will be focused on
four major areas: (i) a general framework for regularized tensor SVD; (ii)
provable regularized tensor decomposition via alternating annealing; (iii) high-
order PCA with theoretical guarantees by a new high-order spiked covariance
model; (iv) dynamic network community detection via tensor methods.
