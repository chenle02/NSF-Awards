This project, from an institution in an EPSCoR state, acquiring instrumentation
to set up a grid, aims at enabling/assisting research in areas such as
economics, simulation, modeling, high performance computing, graphics and
computational science projects (e.g., splicing). Ten different projects,
involving the use of grid networks and possibly cluster of computers, are
addressed in the fields of Computer Science and Computational Science. The
infrastructure enables the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;Cluster/Grid Economics
and Performance&lt;br/&gt;Better Explicit Parallel Programming
Model&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Environment for Multidisciplinary
Research&lt;br/&gt;Research Modeling and Graphics&lt;br/&gt;Scalability of I/O
and System Fabrics in a Grid&lt;br/&gt;High Performance Linear Algebra Research
and Benchmark&lt;br/&gt;Exemplar for Campus Grid&lt;br/&gt;Grid-Based Modeling
of Cardiac Electrical Activities&lt;br/&gt;Multi-Dimensional Scalable Dynamic
Sequence Alignment Algorithm&lt;br/&gt;Accelerating Phylogenetic Tree Inference
Using Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Enabling
collaborations between CS and other disciplines, the infrastructure will
additionally aid in the quality of the summer visualization camp for high school
students (targeting some underrepresented groups). Moreover, the equipment will
service at least 8 PhD students, as well as other graduate and undergraduate
students.&lt;br/&gt;
