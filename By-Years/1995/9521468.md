9521468 Kunze A statistical approach to analyzing finescale double-diffusive
interleaving will be used on multiple large datasets to quantify the effect of
interleaving on isopycnical and diapycnal mixing and quantify finescale water
mass variability. The main goals of the study are to determine a universal
spectrum of double-diffusive fluxes and test recent theoretical work which has
elucidated the posible fluxes and dynamics of double-diffusive processes.
