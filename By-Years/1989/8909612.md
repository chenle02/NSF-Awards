This project will support the Midwest /Great Plains Workshops in Commutative
Algebra. These workshops will encourage collaboration among researchers in
commutative algebra in the Midwest/Great Plains region. Two workshops, each
lasting two or three days, will be held for the next two years, and the site of
these workshops will rotate among the participating institutions in the region.
Each workshop will be devoted to specific topics in commutative algebra; intense
research collaboration in small groups will be encouraged.
