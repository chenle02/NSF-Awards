9354001 Traficante NMR Concepts will hold three workshops that will improve the
ability of faculty to conduct research and to teach NMR courses to
undergraduates. Each workshop will be 10 days in length, and will consist of NMR
lectures, laboratory and problem solving sessions, keynote speakers, and round
table discussions to aid the faculty in incorporating the new knowledge into
their research efforts and into their courses. The first workshop will focus on
the physics of NMR experiments, and how raw data is received and processed. The
second workshop deals with the interpretation of one dimensional information
received from the instrument, with emphasis on chemical applications. The last
workshop covers the most advanced two-dimensional experiments that are presently
being used to solve current chemical problems in industry and in academia. An
annual reunion will be held for participants in these workshops to exchange
successes, failures, and ideas for improving the implementation of these NMR
methods into the undergraduate curriculum. ***
