This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase a
cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrometer system that will be housed and operated in
the Department of Geology at St. Lawrence University. The University is
committed to providing the remaining funds. The cathodoluminescent properties of
minerals (the ability to emit visible light when bombarded with electrons)
depends on a variety of factors such a crystalline defects and chemical
impurities. For the mineral quartz, it is found that its CL spectra can be used
to fingerprint quartz grains from different source rocks. Hence, the CL spectra
of quartz grains in sedimentary rocks holds promise as a tool for reconstructing
the provenance of sediments in ancient sedimentary basins. The equipment
purchased with this award will be used by the PI to further investigate the
applicability of CL in such studies.
