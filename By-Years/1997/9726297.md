In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Weltner will use electron spin resonance (ESR), electron-
nuclear double-resonance (ENDOR), Raman and infrared spectroscopies to study the
spectra of transient molecules, ions, and clusters trapped in low-temperature
matrices consisting of rare-gas and hydrogen hosts. Transition metal, rare-earth
metal, Group III, supercritical carbon dioxide, and other open-shell carbon-
based molecules and their derivatives will be characterized for information
about their bonding. In this study Professor Weltner will trap highly reactive
species in solids at very low temperatures in order to determine their
structures and measure their electrical and magnetic properties. The broad range
of experimental techniques used in these investigations provides a unique and
significant source of data on a broad range of molecules, ions, and clusters
which is difficult to gather by other methods. Such data are important for
refining theoretical calculational methods as well as for understanding such
processes as heterogeneous catalysis and semiconductor manufacture.
