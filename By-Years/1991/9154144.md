The workshop concentrates on the integration of several scientific computation
software systems into the teaching of mathematics courses offered in the first
two years of college. The workshop will be followed by a weekend mini conference
in February, 1993. This project aims to upgrade the mathematical and computing
expertise of faculty in California Community Colleges. Three high level
computational packages (Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB) will be used in the
project.
