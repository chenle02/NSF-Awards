Numerically controlled (NC) machine tools are among the most important
components of automated factories. Much research remains to be done with them,
however, before they reach their full potential. Four tasks in this connection
will be completed. First, a simulator for 3-axis NC/CNC machining will be
completed and tested. It will serve as a programming and debugging aid, for
automatic program verification, and for guiding the further design of geometric
modeling systems. Second, a system for automated planning of machining processes
will be developed. The problem to be tackled is making prismatic parts by a
group of machining processes, using several setups. Third, computer numerically
controlled machine systems will be studied, to determine how the computing
capabilities can best be distributed. Fourth, a task on sensors is aimed at
putting software for gaging probes within the machine controller, with machine-
driving software in a separate computer.
