The Chemistry Department at the University of Minnesota will be running an NSF-
REU program for ten undergraduate students from around the country in
environmental, materials, or biological chemistry during the summers of 2009-
2011. Participants will gain a cutting edge research experience at a major
research University at the forefront of chemistry in highly interdisciplinary
areas. This broad research exposure will be supplemented with short classes,
hands on training with high tech instruments, and visits to local government and
industrial laboratories. Students will also be able to participate in the
Chemists-in-the-library program, where hands-on experiments are carried out by
40-70 children at a time in local community libraries. Participants will be
selected by advertising nationally and sophomores, under-represented minority
groups, and 1 or 2 late bloomers who ordinarily would not get such an
opportunity will be targeted. This will maximize the impact of our program and
lead to the development of new scientists who pursue careers in the chemical
sciences that otherwise would have picked different career pathways.
