This project develops a laboratory facility designed to train students in the
maintenance of microprocessors. The scope of the facility ranges from
introductory microprocessor cencepts through advanced, industrial-standard
microprocessor systems. Trouble-shooting equipment and techniques, along with
familiarity with state-of-the-art system architecture is heavily emphasized.
This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
