To obtain an accurate estimate of conductive heat flux from the Cascadia
accretionary prism, the PIs plan redundant methods to obtain both thermal and
fluid flux measurements along a 2.5 D profile of the margin at a single
latitude. In this profile they will use thermal blankets suitable for
impenetrable sub-stratum, continuous fluid flow meters, multi-core deployments
for sediment pore-water chemistry and thermal gradient measurements, and Jason-
II heat flow probes. The heat flow and fluid flux data will be obtained at 10
specific equally-spaced depth intervals, along the margin from 2900 m to 500 m
depths. The heat flow profile would also coincide spatially with other large-
scale NSF programs planned for the Washington corridor at 47°N, including the
OBSIP (Ocean Bottom Seismometer) focused deployment site, Endurance Array
moorings for OOI, high resolution EM302 bathymetry surveys, and an Open Access
3-D MCS volume using the LANGSETH. The goal would be to obtain data of
sufficient quality that downward projection of the surficial thermal gradients
to the CSZ décollement and igneous basement can be made with reasonable
confidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Open Data Access strategy developed by the
MCS community is the new paradigm for geophysical data that has wide community
interest, and we plan to follow that model. The planned heat flow, fluid flux
and companion geophysical data will be made publically available (via GeoPRISM
and UW web sites) in preliminary form, within 3 months of the end of the cruise.
The project will also incorporate UW graduate and undergraduate students, as
well as students from other institutions in the cruises and equipment
development. The Grays Canyon area is within the treaty fishing zone of the
Quinault Indian Nation, and the PIs plan to include students and teachers from
the Tahola High School and Cascadia Community College in the field program.
