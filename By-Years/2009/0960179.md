This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research
Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Vartkess A. Apkarian and colleagues
Rachel Martin, Reginald M. Penner and Eric Potma from the Department of
Chemistry at the University of California-Irvine (UCI) will acquire a confocal
Raman microscope to facilitate research at the NSF Center for Chemical
Innovation on Chemistry at the Space-Time Limit and the UCI Center for Solar
Energy. The instrument will be broadly utilized for the molecular
characterization of fabricated novel materials, nano-structured devices for
solar cells, single molecule devices based on nano-tube and nano-wire platforms,
nano-catalysts, polycrystalline hydrates and protein aggregates. These are all
examples of heterogeneous specimens in which molecular composition and function
greatly vary with space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A confocal Raman microscope is a
highly flexible instrument, principally used for the non-destructive chemical
characterization of heterogeneous specimens. Raman spectra allow the
identification of molecular structure and environment. The confocal Raman
microscope produces images of specimens, consisting of spectra obtained with a
spatial resolution of 1 micrometer. The instrument will be an integral part
teaching and research activities of two research centers and will in addition
serve the broader research communities at UCI.&lt;br/&gt;
