DMS-0310645&lt;br/&gt;Fuhua (Frank) Cheng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CARGO
incubation award made under solicitation
&lt;br/&gt;http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2002/nsf02155/nsf02155.htm.&lt;br/&gt;This
grant provides funding for the development of necessary&lt;br/&gt;mathematical
theories and geometric algorithms to support&lt;br/&gt;subdivision surface based
one-piece representation, i.e.,&lt;br/&gt;representing the final object in a
design process with only&lt;br/&gt;one subdivision surface, no matter how
complicated the object's&lt;br/&gt;topology or shape. Hence, the number of parts
in the final&lt;br/&gt;representation is always the minimum: one. The research
requires&lt;br/&gt;studies in three areas: representation refinement,
representation&lt;br/&gt;conversion and representation joining. The aim for
representation&lt;br/&gt;refinement is to develop new vertex generation schemes
and&lt;br/&gt;topological structures that allow local refinement of a
subdivision&lt;br/&gt;surface's control mesh while preserving the crack-free
property of&lt;br/&gt;the refining process. The aim for representation
conversion is to&lt;br/&gt;develop conversion algorithms for subdivision
surfaces of different&lt;br/&gt;type or subdivision surfaces of the same type
but whose control&lt;br/&gt;meshes are of different topology. The aim for
representation&lt;br/&gt;joining is to develop direct and indirect joining
techniques that&lt;br/&gt;can be iteratively applied to join different component
surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;an object into a single surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If
successful, the results of this research will significantly&lt;br/&gt;shorten
the construction process of a free-from surface because&lt;br/&gt;one-piece
representation makes Boolean operations more efficient&lt;br/&gt;and,
consequently, increase the productivity of a design
engineer.&lt;br/&gt;Actually, in addition to their roles in one-piece
representation,&lt;br/&gt;the results in the first area will also significantly
improve the&lt;br/&gt;current art of subdivision surface theory. They would not
only&lt;br/&gt;include current refinement techniques as special cases, but
also&lt;br/&gt;provide more powerful mesh refining rules which allow both
local&lt;br/&gt;and adaptive refinement of subdivision surfaces. The results
in&lt;br/&gt;the second area will also make it possible for a CAD/CAM system
to&lt;br/&gt;include subdivision surfaces as a new and yet more general free-
form&lt;br/&gt;surface modeling tool because B-splines and NURBS are special
cases&lt;br/&gt;of subdivision surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;
