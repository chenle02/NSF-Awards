The principal investigators will study the effect of deformation on fluid
inclusions. They will first generate inclusions under hydrostatic conditions,
then subject the inclusions to plastic deformation. These data will be critical
to those geologists who use fluid inclusions to interpret the history of rocks
which have undergone deformation.
