This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
Chemistry Division, seeks to design and build novel instrumentation for Electron
Spin Resonance (ESR) imaging. Programmed phasing of radio frequency signal
inputs rather than magnetic field gradients will be employed. Lower frequencies
than are commonly employed for ESR spectrometry will also be employed, reducing
the problems of sample heating. If successful, this Grant for Exploratory
Research should lead to radically different ESR imaging instrumentation than
would otherwise be available. %%% Magnetic Resonance Imaging has profoundly
improved diagnostic medicine. Electron Spin Resonance imaging has not had the
impact of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, due to instrumental as well as fundamental
difficulties in generating signals. In this research, supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, a novel
means of generating electron spin images which may overcome several of the
previously identified problems will be built and studied. This Grant for
Exploratory Research is considered to be high risk, but the reward (the ability
to routinely image free radicals in situ without roasting the object studied)
makes the risk worthwhile.
