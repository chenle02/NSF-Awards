In order to attain further insight into the nature of the human language
faculty, this linguistic and psycholinguistic research involves integration of
results from basic cross-linguistic research in the area of first language
acquisition with results from parallel research in the area of second language
acquisition. The is being led by hypotheses and methods deriving from current
linguistic theory, and typological cross-linguistic studies as well as by
insights from current studies of language pedagogy. Interactive activities
involve: mentoring graduate students and undergraduates; teaching a graduate
seminar; and developing a workshop at the Linguistic Society of America (LSA)
Summer Institute 1997, a symposium for the American Association for the
Advancement of Science annual meeting, and a workshop on female mentorship in
linguistics at the LSA Institute.
