A new epitaxial growth technique (Atomic Layer Epitaxy) will be used to grow a
rapidly developing transistor structure ( -doped FET). Atomic Layer Epitaxy
(ALE) has several advantages over other growth techniques for such application
since it allows low temperature deposition, with less diffusion of the doping
spikes, better control of the incorporation dopant with higher carrier
concentration and mobility uniform thickness over large area wafer, abrupt
interfaces and reduction of native defects. The potential of ALE on improving
the performance of -doped FET structures will be the subject of the proposed
investigations. -doped structures will be fabricated in GaAs and InGaAs material
systems, while MODFETs with doping spikes will use AlGaAs, InGaP and strained
GaAsP high bandgap ternary alloys. Monte Carlo transport calculation will be
applied to these newly developed structures.
