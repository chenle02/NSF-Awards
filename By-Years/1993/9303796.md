This research is to define by gravity and active seismic refraction methods the
subsurface structure of the Salt Lake Valley, Utah, model the resulting
structure in a 3-D finite element code for response to earthquake waves, and
compare the result with recorded data from earthquakes. The research is expected
to provide a new understanding of the competing interactions among the effects
of attenuation, topographic scattering, basin resonance, body-to-surface wave
conversion at basin boundaries, and coda enhancement. The topographic scattering
results will be applied to dam sites in the Wasatch Range, Utah, to determine if
conventional earthquake response design criteria are adequate. This research is
a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
