ABSTRACT Nowicki &amp; Weiss IBN 96-23869 Functional Analysis of Female
Reproductive Coloration Female choice, male-male mate competition, and resulting
sexually dimorphic traits have been a primary focus in studies of animal
behavior. Relatively new to the field of animal behavior is the concept that
species with conventional sex-roles may exhibit female-female mate competition
and male choosiness. Such reproductive patterns may be an important selective
force in the evolution of communication signals. This proposal proposes a study
of the communicative function of female reproductive coloration in the sexually
dimorphic lizard, Sceloporus virgatus (Sauria: Iguanidae). It will be determined
whether this coloration is used in female-female mate competition, functioning
to attract choosy males into a female s home range during her receptive period.
To test this and other hypotheses concerning the function of female reproductive
coloration, this research will (1) determine how changes in coloration and
display behavior are temporally associated with seasonal changes in reproductive
state, (2) determine whether aspects of female quality are correlated with color
patch characteristics, and (3) experimentally examine the effect of female
coloration and display behavior on the behavior of conspecific males using a
choice test paradigm.
