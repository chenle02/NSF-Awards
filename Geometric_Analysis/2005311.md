Many physical theories have been modeled successfully by mathematical equations
known as partial differential equations (PDEs). The classical examples are the
heat equation, the wave equation and the Laplace equation, which describe in
ideal conditions the behavior of heat, waves and electrostatic potentials
respectively. These are linear PDEs. More complicated theories are often modeled
by nonlinear PDEs. A classic nonlinear PDE is the Monge-Ampere equation which
has connections to the physical theory of optics but is also a powerful tool in
the study of geometry. This research will investigate several nonlinear PDE, all
related to the Monge-Ampere equation, which arise in geometry or which exhibit
geometric behavior. The research goals are two-fold: to use nonlinear PDEs to
advance our understanding of geometric spaces and the structures that live on
them; and to understand the phenomena and behavior of solutions of nonlinear PDE
using the tools and language of geometry. In addition the PI will also train
graduate students in the methods of nonlinear PDEs and geometry, and guide their
research.

The PI will carry out research on nonlinear PDEs and geometry. There are five
projects, linked by the common theme of the complex Monge-Ampere equation and
focusing on developing new analytic tools and strategies to derive a priori
estimates. For the first project, the PI will investigate a conjecture of
Donaldson extending Yau?s theorem on the complex Monge-Ampere equation to the
setting of symplectic 4-manifolds, using an ansatz which reduces the nonlinear
PDE to an equation of a single real-valued function. A second project will study
Perelman?s estimates for the Kahler-Ricci flow with the goal of understanding
the behavior of the flow when there is a finite time singularity. A further
project is to investigate a non-Kahler version of this flow, known as the Chern-
Ricci flow, with a focus on finite time singularities on complex surfaces.
Another project will extend the work of Chen-Cheng and Shen on the question of
existence of metrics with constant Chern scalar curvature, in the setting of
non-Kahler complex surfaces. A final project is to study the uniform convexity
of convex solutions to PDEs satisfying certain structure conditions, building on
constant rank theorems.
