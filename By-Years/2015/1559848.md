This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates
(REU) and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of
Notre Dame. The goal of the site is to provide realistic research experiences to
undergraduate students and high school physics teachers. The primary impact is
in training of the next generation of scientists who will be essential for the
continued well being of our society and economy, and for maintaining a robust
national defense. Taking it a step further, the RET component aims at creating
enthusiastic high school teachers who, in turn, will convey the excitement of
physics to their students, the future physicists.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The
participants will work with a faculty mentor on a specific research project and
will be exposed to physics research in other areas via weekly seminars,
workshops, interactions with other participants, and field trips to nearby
national laboratories. They will participate in a "Physics Olympics" with REUs
from Purdue and Michigan State Universities, prepare a research report at the
end of the program, and make oral presentations at the REU-RET Symposium. They
will also maintain a research logbook and will have the opportunity to attend
courses in computer programming and radiation safety, as well as a GRE-
preparation class and an "Applying to Graduate School" workshop . A series of
workshops will also be held as part of the Ethics component. Projects will be
available in the areas of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Biophysics, Cosmology,
Condensed Matter Physics, High-Energy Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics, and
Physics Education Research.
