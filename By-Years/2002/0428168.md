Integrating and sharing data from multiple sources has been a long-standing
challenge in the database community. This problem is crucial in numerous
contexts, including data integration for enterprises and organizations, data
sharing on the Internet, collaboration among government agencies, and the
exchange of scientific data. Many applications of national importance, such as
emergency preparedness and response; as well as research in many scientific
domains, require integrating and sharing data among participants.

Data integration is seriously hampered by an inability to ensure privacy.
Without a privacy framework, sources are reluctant to share their data. Problems
include fear of disclosing confidential information as well as regulations
protecting individual privacy. While there has been progress in computing
aggregations of distributed data without disclosing that data; e.g., privacy-
preserving distributed data mining, it assumes data integration problems (schema
matching, record linkage) are solved. As a consequence, the lack of a privacy-
preserving data integration framework has become a key bottleneck to deploying
data integration.

This project will develop the technology needed to create and manage federated
databases while controlling the disclosure of private data. While the emphasis
will be on general techniques for data integration that preserve privacy, the
project will work in the context of diverse but particularly relevant problem
domains, including scientific research and emergency preparedness. Involvement
of domain experts from these fields in developing and testing the techniques
will ensure impact on areas of national importance.
