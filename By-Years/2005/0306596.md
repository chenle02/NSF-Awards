The University of Alabama at Birmingham has been awarded a Small Grant for
Exploratory Research (SGER) to develop a "Power Atlas" for microarray data sets.
The project will develop a collection of publicly available DNA microarray data
sets and perform a common power analysis on all datasets and then place all
results into a common format for easy determination of sample size requirements
that meet criteria set by a researcher. It will make the Atlas of power analyses
available via a website with a searchable index so investigators can easily find
sample size estimates from experiments similar to an experiment being planned.
The database will enable scientists to download and compare sophisticated
statistical computations and graphical representations of them. It will also be
a resource to educate investigators on basic statistical principles in
biological research. This is in addition to its primary function as an easily
accessible source of information for use in planning microarray experiments.
