The new technique of laser heated pedestal growth will be used to grow a range
of optical materials. This technique enables single crystal fibers of diverse
optical materials to be grown and doped in a rapid and cost effective manner.
The optical properties of these materials will be comprehensively determined
using a dedicated optical characterization system. The rapid turn-over time in
both growth and characterization will enable materials parameters to be
optimized for a particular aplication in an interactive fashion.
