The general purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot study of the impact
of regular education teachers on the performance of mildly handicapped children
in science, mathematics and computer program development. A ten day staff
development program will provide twelve regular education elementary teachers
with the skills necessary to conduct the implementation of instruction in
science, mathematics and computer program usage at two schools. After training,
the regular classroom teachers, both the project participants and a control
group of teachers, will work with children in both small and large groups under
observation. Comprehensive evaluation of pupil performance and teacher
performance and activity will be evaluated for both curriculum and instruction.
The Project Director seeks to improve on the existing curriculum, rather than
create a new one. The successful outcomes of this project will be disseminated
to help meet the needs of the nearly 3,000,000 mildly handicapped children in
regular grades and the school personnel who serve them.
