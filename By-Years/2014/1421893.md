Getting access control policies right is challenging, especially in large
organizations. This project is developing techniques and tools to support
efficient and trustworthy administration of Attribute-Based Access Control
(ABAC) policies. ABAC is a flexible, high-level, and increasingly popular
security policy framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABAC promises long-term cost
savings through reduced administrative effort, but manual development of an
initial ABAC policy can be expensive. This project is developing policy mining
algorithms that promise to drastically reduce the cost of migrating from legacy
access control frameworks to ABAC. These algorithms generate candidate ABAC
policies from existing lower-level policies, if available, or operation logs,
together with data about attributes of users and
resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An administrative policy specifies how each user
may change the access control policy. Fully understanding the implications of
administrative policies in enterprise systems can be difficult, because of the
size and complexity of the policies, and because sequences of changes by
different users may interact in unexpected ways. This project is developing
policy analysis algorithms that support validation of administrative policies,
by answering questions such as whether, how, and under what conditions specified
administrators can together change the policy in order to grant specified
permissions to specified users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Powerful development
environments for creating and validating access control policies, incorporating
algorithms like the ones being developed in this project, have the potential to
significantly increase the trustworthiness of IT systems, by helping security
administrators efficiently and reliably develop correct policies.
