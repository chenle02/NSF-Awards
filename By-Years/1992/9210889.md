This grant will fund undergraduate design projects in the area of Research to
Aid Persons with Disabilities. It is expected that seven projects will be
completed each year. The projects will range from modifications of commercially
available devices to make the instruments suitable for use by a person who has a
disability, to the design and construction of devices, such as a car door
opener, that do not have any commercial counterpart. The design and development
experience that is integral to these projects will provide the students with the
opportunity to work in groups, to write reports, and to present the results at a
scientific meeting. It should also help encourage them to pursue future careers
in this area.
