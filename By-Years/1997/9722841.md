This project involves an archaeologist from the University of Washington,
studying the domestication of plants and animals and the development of complex
societies in southwest Asia and northeast Africa. Using standard archaeological
techniques, the investigator will study the geomorphology, sedimentary, and
botanical records of sites in the southeastern Sinai, as well as conduct area
surveys. The period to be studied is from about 10,000 to 6000 years ago the
`Pre Pottery Neolithic B`, an early stage in the transition from hunting and
gathering to a domesticate-based subsistence economy and and the development of
early complex societies in this region. It has always been assumed that contact
between southwest Asia and Egypt was through northern Sinai and the Nile Delta.
However, there are hints in the archaeological record that contact may have been
more important across southern Sinai and the Gulf of Suez. The archaeology of
southern Sinai remains largely unknown. This research is designed to examine the
role of southern Sinai in the introduction of some domestic animals,
particularly sheep and goats, from southwest Asia into Egypt, and, during the
later part of the period, what role southern Sinai may have played in the
relationships between the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and Upper
Egypt. The research should expand our understanding of this important period of
time in this central geographic location.
