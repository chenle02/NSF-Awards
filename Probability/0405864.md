0405864 Soshnikov The principal investigator works on several problems in random
matrix theory and random point processes. The main emphasis of the research is
on the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of large random matrices and
fundamental questions about an important class of random point processes (namely
determinantal and pfaffian random point processes) appearing in random matrix
ensembles and applications of random matrix technique in random growth models,
representation theory and combinatorics. The problems of a special interest to
the principal investigator in random matrix theory include local statistical
properties of the spectrum of large sample covariance matrices, spectral
properties of the adjacency matrices of random graphs and Poisson statistics at
the edge of the spectrum for random matrices with heavy tails of marginal
distributions. The principal investigator expects to collaborate in this
research with a theoretical physicist Yan Fyodorov and a combinatorialist Benny
Sudakov. The problems in random point processes include, among others, the study
of the ergodic properties of the translation-invariant pfaffian random point
processes and the analysis of the Janossy densities in determinantal and
pfaffian ensembles. The random matrix models and random point processes that are
proposed to study come from, or have applications in multivariate statistical
analysis (principal component analysis), nuclear physics (statistics of energy
levels of heavy nuclei), solid state physics (modeling transport properties of
small metallic particles and quantum dots), quantum chaos (spectral properties
of the quantum analogues of strongly chaotic classical systems) and theoretical
computer science (computational complexity, statistical analysis of errors and
linear numerical algorithms). The importance of the field increases as many
different areas of mathematics and physics including combinatorics,
representation theory, number theory, integrable systems, random growth models,
quantum gravity appear to have deep and fruitful connections to random matrices.
