Abstract Shultz

This is a proposal for partial participant support for the East Coast Operator
Algebras Symposium (ECOAS) to be held at Wellesley College, Wellesley,
Massachusetts, on September 29 and 30, 2007. It is expected that 50 to 80
participants will attend the meeting, including some 40 to 50 graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows.

This will be the fifth annual meeting of this conference series on operator
algebras and non-commutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of
areas from geometry to quantum physics. The first meeting in the series was held
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, in the fall of 2003. Succeeding meetings
have been held in the fall each year at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and the Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta.

In addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the
symposium will provide a forum for young researchers, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in the eastern part of the United States to hear of current
work from those at the forefront of the field and to present their work and
discuss it with senior mathematicians.
