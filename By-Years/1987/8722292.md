This award is for a program planning conference on technology and cooperative
work. The object of the conference is to promote awareness of the relevance of
behavioral science research and theory to the design of computer and
communications systems for collaborative work, and to stimulate both design
efforts based on that knowledge and interdisciplinary research regarding user
satisfaction and competence with advanced information systems, as well as the
behavioral impact of these systems. Participants include social scientists who
have made empirical and theoretical contributions to the study of relevant
social and cognitive processes, studied particular forms of collaborative work
or carried out investigations of the impact of new technologies, as well as
information systems designers. The conference includes technology demonstrations
at the Planning and Decision Laboratory at the University of Arizona, a state-
of-the- art facility designed to support computer-mediated brainstorming and
decision-making.
