The principal objective of this project is the study of the behavior of
solutions to certain nonlinear differential equations arising in mathematical
physics in various geometrical settings. There is a rich interplay between the
analytic and algebraic aspects of this problem which researchers have found
useful for both theoretical and computational purposes. The current project will
further the understanding of the long time evolution of geometric flows of this
type, and it will provide a precise determination of the singular structure of
solutions to these equations. A second important aspect of this research is the
global nature of the entire space of solutions (called the moduli space).
Understanding the structure of moduli spaces reveals underlying phenomena that
unify and explain particular aspects of individual examples. The Yang-Mills
equations and moduli spaces of Higgs bundles are the major examples of interest
to the PI. They also form an important point of intersection between mathematics
and theoretical physics. Progress on the research in this project will have an
impact outside of pure mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
outlines research in three principal areas of complex geometry related to
holomorphic bundles and moduli problems. The first continues work of the PI on
the Yang-Mills flow on Kaehler manifolds, compactifications of spaces of
Hermitian-Einstein metrics, and the structure of singular sets. The second
studies the asymptotic and global geometry of moduli spaces of Higgs bundles.
This is currently an area of intense activity motivated by constructions from
mathematical physics and invariants in low dimensional topology. The third
project seeks to extend and apply the PI's work on determinants of Dolbeault
laplacians. This will provide a unified framework for Quillen metrics over
moduli spaces of bundles with additional parabolic structures. The PI has
experience working in this field and has published research articles on topics
directly related to the subject matter of the current proposal.
