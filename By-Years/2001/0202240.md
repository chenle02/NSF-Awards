The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) is transitioning to
serve as the NSF's leading dissemination center for skill standards, ideas,
materials, contacts, and mentoring in the field of semiconductor industry
education. Since 1996 MATEC has collaborated with industry and educators to
increase the number of semiconductor manufacturing technology (SMT) programs
from 32 to 80; create the industry's first national skill standards; and develop
and distribute 44 modules of learning materials through a unique electronic
delivery system. As a dissemination center, MATEC's goals are 1) to motivate at
least 50 percent of the nation's SMT faculty to adopt the MATEC learning system
by 2005, in part by developing an industry-accepted ChipReady job-screening
assessment; and 2) to broadcast best practices and new ideas among SMT faculty
nationwide. MATEC continues to use the dissemination vehicles developed in the
last six years (adopter and topic workshops, Web site, quarterly print
newsletter and e-mail bulletins, conference attendance, faculty development, and
sponsorship of the industry's most influential annual workforce development
conference). MATEC is also developing five new dissemination vehicles (Learning
Invention Lab, lesson plan recognition, exemplary instructor video,
collaboration with Arizona State University East, collaboration with industry
workforce developers).
