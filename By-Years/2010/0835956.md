In recent years, mountain pine beetle outbreaks in western North America have
been startling in both their speed and extent; in Colorado alone, more than
600,000 hectares have been infected since the late 1990s. Yet, our understanding
of how both ecosystems and humans react to such outbreaks, and how such
responses alter critical ecosystem services, remains poor. This research
involves both natural and social scientists and will take advantage of a unique
opportunity to collect pre-infection data at the Niwot Ridge Long-Term
Ecological Research site just prior to a pine beetle invasion that is virtually
certain to occur. Data to be collected include not only those on ecosystem
responses, but also on public and policy reactions to the outbreak in the
Colorado Front Range region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of an
integrated study on human and ecosystem responses to pine beetle outbreaks are
considerable. The work will directly address a phenomenon that has the attention
of the highest levels of government in the western U.S. and Canada, where states
and provinces are scrambling to enact new management policies in the wake of
large-scale beetle kills. This work will also contribute key scientific
understanding to the debates on pine beetle management plans.
