Disorder Effects on Quantum Spectra and Dynamics

Abstract of Proposed Research Michael Aizenman

The research will address the effects of disorder on spectra and dynamics of
operators which play a role in the dynamics of quantum systems. The
incorporation of even weak but extensive disorder is known to result in
delocalization of at least some of the normal modes, and in the creation of
pure-point spectral regimes, characterized by a dense collection of eigenvalues
corresponding to well separated eigenfunctions. The focus of the proposed
research is on the less understood question of the existence of extended states
in the presence of disorder, and the corresponding Lebesgue absolutely
continuous spectra. Also to be investigated is a possible relation of the
spectral gap statistics of local operators incorporating disorder with the known
eigenvalue statistics of random matrix ensembles. As the effects of randomness
are dimension dependent, the initial goal is to clarify some of the issues in
high dimensions, where loop effects are in general more controllable. In the
converse direction, a new -fluctuation based- method is envisioned for the
derivation and analysis of localization in low dimensions, where the effect is
most drastic.

Disorder effects play a key role in the conduction properties of quantum systems
modeled by random operators, and are of direct relevance for quantum networks.
The work will capitalize on recent progress made by the PI with collaborators,
and on his past work on the Anderson localization and on other effects of
fluctuations, such as the rounding of fist-order phase transitions in low
dimensions, in what is known as the Imry-Ma effect. The subject provides the
meeting grounds for techniques involving mathematical analysis with ideas drawn
from statistical mechanics, where science is made of disorder. The challenge of
shedding light on issues of physics enriches also fields of mathematics.
