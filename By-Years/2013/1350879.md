Quadrupedalism, pervasive in nature, is a promising locomotion mode for numerous
future robotic applications. Utilizing its versatility can play a crucial role
in managing unexpected and varying terrains in an efficient and stable manner.
Understanding of why, how, and when to use a certain gait is central to
successfully building stable, adaptable robots. Gait transition criteria in
animals involve an intricate interplay among such biological characteristics as
metabolic cost, bone stress, muscle physiology, and social stimuli. Obtaining
general principles that are useful in design of robots by studying animals is
very challenging. This project investigates the intrinsic nature of dynamic
characteristics of quadrupedal gaits and the transitions among them by utilizing
appropriate computational models. These models are selected to represent only
important dynamic characteristics of quadrupedal gaits and filter out biological
aspects that are not essential to the realization of robots. These models help
to develop gait selection criteria from the energetics and stability analyses of
each gait. The gait selection criteria constitute the basis of the development
process of stable gait-transitioning controllers. This project aims to enhance
our understanding of quadrupedal locomotion, contributing to future applications
such as disaster response robots and new transportation systems. In addition,
the project plans to integrate research results with educational activities. The
new class on bio-inspired robot provides the opportunities for students to learn
how to investigate scientific questions using computational methods and physical
robots. The student training includes several outreach activities such as
participation in science festivals and developing science exhibitions for K-12
education.
