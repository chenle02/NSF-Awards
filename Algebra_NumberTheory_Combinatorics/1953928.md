There is a rich history of symbiosis between computer science and mathematics.
This award is aimed at further strengthening this connection, and in particular
between the fields of theoretical computer science and combinatorics. This
project centers around a fundamental open problem in combinatorics, called the
sunflower conjecture. This problem originated in 1960 and is still unanswered,
despite having numerous applications in mathematics and in computer science.
Recent work by the PI has made significant progress towards resolving the
conjecture, and this project is focused on continuing this work. The project
provides research training opportunities for graduate students.

Concretely, the project explores a correspondence between set systems (also
known as hypergraphs) and DNFs (Disjunctive Normal Forms). Building upon recent
work by the PI, the project demonstrates how tools used to study DNFs can be
instrumental in studying set systems, and proposes a unified and versatile
framework to make progress on several well-studied conjectures in mathematics
and theoretical computer science about the structure of set systems and DNFs.
These also include, beyond the sunflower conjecture and related problems in
combinatorics, problems related to DNF compression and the Fourier structure of
DNFs.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
