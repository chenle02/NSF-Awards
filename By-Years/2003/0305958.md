ABSTRACT

Complexity of the objects of complex analysis

(DMS-0305958)

Steven R. Bell

Prof. Bell has shown that the most widely used kernel functions and metrics of
complex analysis associated to certain finite Riemann surface are elementary
combinations of only three, and sometimes even two, analytic functions of one
complex variable related to special conformal mappings of the domain. Bell will
study deeper questions about complexity in complex analysis and potential theory
posed by his recent findings and he will extend his results in the plane to
quadrature domains and general finite Riemann surfaces. Bell has formulated a
unique continuation principle for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations
that he has shown yields information about the behavior of holomorphic mappings
between domains in complex space. He will apply this principle to some of the
questions mentioned above and he will also use the property to try to gain a
more geometric understanding of the Bergman projection in several complex
variables.

The mathematical objects of potential theory and conformal mapping are
ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering. They carry encoded within
them a vast amount of information about geometric properties of regions in the
plane. Although these objects are familiar and well studied, they continue to be
a source of interesting and applicable new mathematics. Professor Bell will
express the classical objects of potential theory associated to a two
dimensional surface with holes in terms of much simpler analytic objects. These
results will give rise to new and practical methods for understanding and
zipping the solutions to many problems in differential equations, conformal
mapping, and potential theory that should be of interest, not only to
mathematicians, but to scientists and engineers as well. Because humans best
perceive higher dimensional objects by taking a series of two dimensional
slices, the tools developed could find many applications.
