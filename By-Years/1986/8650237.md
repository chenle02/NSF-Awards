This project will increase the breadth of the junior/senior laboratory
experience for physics and engineering students at the University of Wisconsin,
Platteville, by enabling the Physics Department to add topics in nuclear
physics, lasers, fiber optics, and vacuum science. Specifi- cally, the
Department will purchase optics equipment, including an optical table, helium-
neon and nitrogen-dye lasers, and energy meters which, together with optics
apparatus already on hand, will enable students to work in an excellent quality
optics laboratory. A neutron source will be purchased in order to begin using a
newly constructed neutron laboratory, and vacuum equipment will allow students
to do work in vacuum science. Much of the equipment will also provide
independent project and research opportunities for undergraduate students.
