"Project La Costa" is a three-year, youth-based ITEST project proposed by the
Southwest Texas State University. The project seeks to create a computer science
academy to provide IT experiences for 250 Hispanic youth, including girls, from
five Central and South Texas school districts. Students will start on the
project beginning with 8th grade and continue until they are in 10th grade. In
8th grade students will focus on computer hardware, operating systems and
desktop management. In 9th grade students will focus on computer programming,
robotics and web page and web site development. In 10th grade students will
focus on computer systems and network management. The project will provide each
student with 120 contact hours per year. The project is named "La Costa," which
implies "a vocational vista for students". "Project La Costa" has five inter-
related goals: educational, programmatic, curriculum, institutional and
workforce. The project, which will be conducted in a bilingual and bicultural
community, will have after-school, weekend and summer activities integrating
computer skills, family involvement, role modeling, tutoring, mentoring, career
development and externships.
