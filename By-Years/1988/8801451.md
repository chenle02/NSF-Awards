The longterm goal of this research is to discover how gene expression in
chloroplasts affects and is itself affected by chloroplast development and
biogenesis. This goal will be approached by first studying the processing of
multigenic messenger RNAs transcribed within the chloroplast. There are two main
objectives to this project. First is to identify precursor and product RNAs from
the ATP synthase gene cluster in spinach chloroplasts. In the course of
achieving that goal, the primary transcripts from that gene cluster will be
identified. The second objective is to observe the levels of these multigenic
transcripts and their processing products as the chloroplast develops from its
immature beginnings in the seedling stage to the fully developed state that it
reaches in the mature leaf. Both of these objectives will be studied with a
number of molecular biological techniques, the chief among them being Northern
analysis.%%% Chloroplasts are the cell organelles where photosynthesis takes
place. Chloroplasts, like the cell nucleus, have genes which direct the
synthesis of proteins needed for photosynthesis. mRNA's are the intermediates
between genes and proteins. There has been very little research performed on
mRNA processing in chloroplasts. Results from this research will serve as the
first steps in the elucidation of this complex process.*** //
