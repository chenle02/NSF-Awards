The history of science has taught us always to remember that the development of
a field does not nor cannot occur within an intellectual vacuum. Science by its
very nature is a social pursuit practiced by men and women who interact not only
with their fellow specialists but with the events of society at large. Dr.
Schabas is exploring the ways that economists were influenced by other
scientists in the development of their economic theories. It is important to
note, though this is not the subject of this research, that the influence was
not only one way. Economists affected the development of other sciences--the
most famous example is the influence of the economist Malthus on the thought of
Charles Darwin. The issues that Dr. Schabas is exploring under this grant are
the many different uses of concepts of nature in the major economic texts from
the Physiocrats of the mid-eighteenth century to John Stuart Mill in the mid-
nineteenth century. More specifically, she is tracing the gradual retreat from
appeals to nature as economists came to recognize the importance of social
institutions in structuring the economy and as they came to set human nature
apart from physical nature. This ongoing "denaturalization" of the conceptual
foundations was part and parcel of the gradual secularization of science and the
general transformation of economics into a science of the mind that came with
the Marginal Revolution of the 1870s. To develop these themes, Dr. Schabas is
examining these specific topics: 1) John Stuart Mill on the natural/artificial
distinction; 2) Concepts of nature in the economic writings of David Hume and
Adam Smith; and 3) The privileging of physical nature in the Physiocratic
corpus.
