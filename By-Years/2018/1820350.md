The IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) is a
premier international conference, held annually, covering a wide spectrum of
theoretical and applied research in the networking field. The conference
provides an unique platform for world-leading researchers and practitioners to
present their latest research results. Attending such a high-caliber technical
event, with multiple technical sessions and workshops, is important for graduate
students' professional development. The students will have the opportunity to
present their work and be exposed to the state-of-the-art developments in the
field. They will also have the opportunity to interact with peers from
institutions worldwide, meet with leading researchers, and participate in
discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field.

This award will support approximately 20 students in the United States to attend
the 2018 IEEE INFOCOM conference which will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from
April 15 to April 19, 2018. The travel grants will target graduate students who
will substantially benefit from attending this conference but have limited
travel funds. Priority will be given to first time attendees,especially those
without papers, and students from under-represented groups (female, minorities
and students with disabilities).
