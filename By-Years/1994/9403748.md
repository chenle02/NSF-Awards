ABSTRACT Proposal: CHE-9403748 PI: Myers, A. G. Institution: Cal Tech This
award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program will help the
Department of Chemistry at California Institute of Technology acquire upgrades
for existing 400 and 500 MHz NMR spectrometers which will be used in research
investigations in the following areas of chemistry: (1) Synthetic, Structural
and Mechanistic Studies in Organotransition Metal Chemistry; (2) Studies on the
origin of the hyperthermostability of rubredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus; (3)
Specificity in Co- and Post-translational Modification Reactions; (4)
Organometallic and Catalyst Synthesis; (5) Synthetic and Mechanistic Studies in
Organic Chemistry; and (6) Sequence Specific Recognition and Cleavage of DNA.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies are useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
