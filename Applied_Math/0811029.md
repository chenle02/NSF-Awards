The focus of this project is the development and analysis of numerical
algorithms to simulate materials which exhibit intricate rheological behavior or
mechanical response due to their microstructural makeup. For example, elastic
properties of particulates, molecules, or cells of a material frequently
influence the macroscopic properties. These materials are modeled by formidable
systems of partial differential equations, and it is important to develop
numerical schemes to faithfully represent the mathematical structure of these
models. Tools from partial differential equations, continuum mechanics, and
numerical analysis, will be used to analyze numerical schemes to simulate these
systems. Past experience has shown that new mathematical tools can lead to
numerical schemes which inherit important structural properties of these models,
and that a deeper understanding of the current schemes frequently leads to
improved and simpler algorithms.

Essentially all biological and manufactured materials exhibit complex
macroscopic behavior due to their fine scale makeup. Examples include micro
electromechanical systems (MEMS); biological fluids; ink for ink jet devices;
semiconductors; liquid crystals; and metals undergoing plastic deformation.
Predicting material response is an essential technology needed to determine
biological or physiological function; or to design and manufacture these
materials; or for the design of the multitudes of devices which use their
special properties. This research will improve our understanding of the
mathematical models and the computational tools used to accomplish these tasks.
The equations used to model such phenomena are complex and poorly understood,
and much of the research is directed to revealing the theoretical (mathematical)
properties of these models. This work complements the more practical approaches
undertaken in the engineering community and at the national laboratories.
