The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) is requesting $50,000 to
investigate and report on education activities linking science centers with
schools. The research will examine the nature and levels of service currently
provided by science centers, and produce a report that describes the current
status with an emphasis on understandings that provide insight for program
planning. The study will gather information from both museums and schools and
museums where collaborative efforts are not occurring to investigate the
barriers that have discouraged linkages. ***
