9710139 Thompson This is an experimental and theoretical research effort on the
evolution of structure and the mechanical state of polycrystalline films during
thin metal film deposition and during subsequent thermal processing. The goal of
the research is to develop models and simulations which can be used to predict
the course of grain size, grain orientation and stress evolution as a function
of substrate, film and capping layer material properties, while also considering
the deposition conditions and subsequent thermal history. The stresses in films
deposited on substrates are monitored using wafer curvature measurements made
while heating at controlled and variable rates and while annealing at different
temperatures for different times. Film material, capping layers, film thickness,
and film deposition temperature are among the varied parameters in these
experiments. In situ TEM observations explore grain structure evolution in
heated films on thin substrates which impose a strain in the films due to
differential thermal expansion. Texture of the films is monitored by X-ray
analyses. %%% As modeling and simulation capabilities evolve through comparison
with experiments, new quantitative capabilities are developed for predicting
grain structure, grain orientation, and stress evolution. This provides
techniques for processing of films with properties that are optimized for
specific engineering applications. Polycrystalline films are used in electronic,
micromechanical, and magnetic devices. In these applications, the performance
and reliability of polycrystalline films are strongly affected by their
structure, specifically the distribution of grain sizes and crystallographic
orientations. ***
