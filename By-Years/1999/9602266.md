This award supports a new, multidisciplinary research training program focused
on understanding the biological implications of small population size. A group
of 18 faculty from the Departments of Zoology, Plant Biology and Entomology at
the University of Maryland have joined with 5 colleagues from research units of
the Smithsonian Institution to develop a novel training program for
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students that integrates studies of
population and community ecology, genetics, evolution, and social behavior in
the context of small populations. Because small, reproductively isolated
populations are an increasingly common feature of the natural distribution of
many wild plants and animals, such studies will both provide important
understanding of basic processes in biology and, at the same time, lead to
knowledge useful in conservation biology and in the preservation of wild and
captive endangered species. Undergraduate trainees will pursue a year- long
research project and participate in seminars, journal clubs and technical
workshops aimed at all trainee levels. Graduate students will follow a core
curriculum of existing and new courses developed for the RTG, as well as a
required year- long focused seminar leading to an intensive 3-day annual
meeting. During the meeting, leading experts will meet in lecture and discussion
with the trainees. The technical workshops and optional summer research
internships will benefit from Smithsonian Institution laboratories and field
research sites. A novel feature of required training will be a course on race,
gender and scientific knowledge taught by one of the RTG faculty. Graduate and
postdoctoral research projects will emphasize integration of multiple
disciplines and are expected to benefit from the participation of two faculty
mentors. ***
