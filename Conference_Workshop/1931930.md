This award provides partial funding for a two-week program "Biology, Analysis,
Geometry, Energies, Links" that will take place during June 17 - 28, 2019 at the
Institute of Mathematics and its Applications in Minneapolis, MN. The goals of
this program are twofold. On the one hand, it is focused on interdisciplinarity,
bringing different scientific groups together whose research areas are adjacent
but would benefit from closer collaborations. On the other hand, this program
aims at bridging gaps between different stages of scientific development: namely
undergraduate study, graduate work, and postdoctoral research. The first week is
a summer school targeted at graduate students and early career researchers. This
is followed by a workshop that builds on the topics covered in the prior week
and features speakers from a broad set of disciplines such as mathematical
physics, topology, approximation theory, analysis, and microbiology.

Low-dimensional topology, geometry and knot theory are excellent platforms for
collaboration and training: they are highly interdisciplinary, and have features
that are accessible to a beginner, while at the same time connecting to the
deepest and most advanced realms of mathematics, biology, and physics. The
summer school presents a state-of-the-art introduction to several mathematical
fields concerned with curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional analogs. The
workshop will present the latest developments in the fields discussed at the
summer school and beyond. Topics to be explored include nonlinear mechanics,
topological fluid dynamics, low-dimensional topology, quantum invariants,
homology theory, categorification, contact geometry, geometric curvature
energies, discretization of geometric flows, and discrete differential geometry.
