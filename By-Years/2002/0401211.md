Richard Stanley is one of the major figures in combinatorics. His work has
&lt;br/&gt;been of fundamental importance in many areas of combinatorics
(especially &lt;br/&gt;in the areas of enumeration, lattices and partially
ordered sets, &lt;br/&gt;matroids, and hyperplane arrangements) and in
connections between &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and other fields such as
commutative algebra, algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry, representation theory of
symmetric and classical groups and Lie &lt;br/&gt;algebras, and topology. In
addition, his two-volume textbook "Enumerative &lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics," and
his advising of numerous students, have been &lt;br/&gt;enormously influential
in the development of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will put
into perspective some of the important advances &lt;br/&gt;that have come from
Stanley's work, and bring together researchers in the &lt;br/&gt;different areas
of combinatorics in which he has worked. The conference &lt;br/&gt;will enable
researchers in these fields to learn from each other, and will
&lt;br/&gt;promote further development of the connections between different
areas of &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics and between combinatorics and other areas of
mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;Support from the NSF will be used to fund travel
expenses of &lt;br/&gt;participants, especially those who would not otherwise be
able to attend. &lt;br/&gt;Funding of travel expenses for researchers in early
stages of the their &lt;br/&gt;careers will be a priority.&lt;br/&gt;
