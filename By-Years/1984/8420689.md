Research is conducted on the prediction, simulation, and optimization of
nutrient content of processed foods. The estimation of nutritional value and
other quality attributes of foods is difficult because the conditions of
processing and storage are subject to a great deal of variation. This project
will develop methods of quantitative analysis, prediction, computer simulation,
and ultimately optimization of specific quality factors of processed and/or
stored foods. This research is helping to develop the kinetic approach to
analysis of quality changes in food processing and storage into a branch of food
engineering.
