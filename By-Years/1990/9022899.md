Numerical methods for solving optimization problems will be developed and
analyzed. The research will focus on: a). The Dual Active Set Algorithm, a new
algorithm developed by the principal investigator for solving mathematical
programming problems, will be studied in the context of linear programming
quadratic programming and minimax. b). An augmented Lagrangian type algorithm
for mathematical programming problems will be reformulated in a way that is
appropriate for large scale optimization. c). Approximation techniques for
optimal problems, will be extended to handle state constraints. The main
emphasis will be placed on applying these optimization techniques in the study
of electric fields generated in thunderstorms.
