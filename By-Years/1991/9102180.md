The research is directed at developing immunoassay diagnostics for potential
field-kit use that would more easily determine the ripening of pome fruit (e.g.
fruit with internal seeds). The focus will be on developing enzyme-linked immuno
system assays (ELISA's) which are specific and highly sensitive in detecting
proteins associated with ripening. During Phase I polyclonal antibodies were
produced against malic enzyme and post-initiation protein pAp5 and crude ELISA's
were developed. In Phase II monoclonal antibodies will be produced to improve
their specificity and sensitivity. Prototypes will be developed and validated.
These ELISAs will be used to quantitate changes in specific proteins that occur
in synchrony with or just prior to the onset of the ripening process. Efficacy
tests will be performed with fruits from experimental controlled atmosphere (CA)
storage which maintains fruits in the preclimacteric condition. Gene expression
of these proteins also will be investigated by Michigan State University
scientists. the diagnostics developed could have major economic benefits for
fruit growers by minimizing losses incurred too early or too late picking of
fruit.
