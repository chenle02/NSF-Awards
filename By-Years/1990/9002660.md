This research seeks to better comprehend Just-In-Time in order to broaden its
usage to a wider variety of manufacturing environments. The topics to be
examined include: (1) analyzing multi-model production in a stochastic
environment, (2) extending Just-In-Time to environments with greater
variability, and (3) investigating the impact of set up reduction on inventory,
quality and capacity.
