Follow-Through Project builds on the existing VINE Program in which youngster
investigate ecological interactions occurring on their school grounds. VINE
Follow-Through: (1) Works with Leadership Teams in three cities to design and
test a set of strategies for developing collaborative teams and leading
professional development initiatives. The strategies are designed to enable
teachers to follow up on VINE investigations in a manner that will enable
students to do more science and construct meaning from their experience. (2)
Documents those strategies and produces professional development materials which
can be used to apply this model in additional settings. (3) Evaluates this model
for building on informal science education experiences and promoting science
education reform, and assesses its potential for use in conjunction with
informal science education experiences offered through science museums and other
community-based institutions. Each city's team includes five experienced
teachers, a district curriculum coordinator, a university science educator, an
action research expert, and a VINE project coordinator. ***
