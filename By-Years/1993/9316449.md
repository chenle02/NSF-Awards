9316449 Martinson This project is the analysis of the data set obtained as part
of an integrated research program into the oceanographic structure of the
western Weddell Sea. The field work was carried out from an ice camp jointly
occupied by U.S. and Russian scientists from February to June 1992. The data set
obtained by the principal investigator had as its objective the definition of
the vertical and horizontal thermohaline fluxes within the western part of the
Weddell Gyre. Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the
Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly were suspended from the ice
at the camp and maintained throughout the duration of the drift. Also, a remote
buoy to measure upper ocean temperature, salinity, and current structure was
emplaced to make observations on the larger scale variability within which the
turbulence data is embedded, and which is expected to have some effect on the
turbulence intensity. The analysis program will be carried out in conjunction
with those of other concurrent experiments to quantify the energy brought to the
underside of the ice, working toward the general goal of tracing the flux of
energy from the ocean through the sea ice cover to the atmosphere. ***
