Under the direction of Dr. Marc Bermann, MS Sonia Alconini will collect data for
her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct six months of archaeological survey
and excavation in the Chaco region of eastern Bolivia. This area marks the
western edge of the Amazonian lowland rain forest and the start of higher ground
which leads to the Andes. It also marks the boundary of the Inka empire. The
Inka were a highland people who extended their influence through most of the
Andean Mountain chain and westward to the desertic Pacific coastal margin.
However they were not able to conquer lowland Amazonian peoples and the Chaco
marks the border between these groups. Through archaeological evidence and early
Spanish chronicles anthropologists have learned much about how the Inka empire
was governed. Much power was exercised indirectly and previous local rulers were
allowed to retain immediate control. However less is understood about what
happened at the boundaries of the empire and several models have been proposed.
One envisions a military situation with forts and other fortified strong points
and interaction of a hostile nature across the frontier. Others see various
kinds of exchange and acculturation and movement of goods and people across
cultural groups. Through a program of survey and excavation MS Alconini will
examine this question. Inkan sites are known to exist in the Chaco and two have
been selected for study. Surface collection and limited excavation will be
conducted. In particular the presence and nature of fortifications will be noted
and the presence/absence of trade goods indicative of exchange will be
determined. Survey in the areas surrounding each site should yield additional
information on the nature of settlement and the types of groups present. This
research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on the nature
of inter-cultural interactions and boundaries between ethnic groups. It will
provide basic data of widespread interest from a poorly known archaeological
region and will assist in training a promising young archaeologist.
