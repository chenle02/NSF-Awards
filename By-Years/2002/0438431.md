This project provides funding for the 17th workshop on Electromagnetic
Induction in the Earth in India in October 2004. This workshop is sponsored
every two years by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy
(IAGA) and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and is the
primary forum for earth scientists in the world to share their EM research and
plan international cooperative experiments. Besides the week-long core EM
workshop in Hyderabad, there will also be a pre-workshop in Mumbai, India on
Magnetotelluric Data Interpretation and a post-workshop in Hyderabad focusing on
multi-disciplinary studies of the Himalaya.
