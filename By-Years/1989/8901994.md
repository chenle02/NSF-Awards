This research examines grain boundary structure and its relationship to grain
boundary behavior. Grain boundary structure is observed in random
polycrystalline non-cubic materials by transmission electron microscopy with
temperature as a principal variable. Energies of grain boundaries are estimated
from these observations and related to the annealing temperature. Diffusion-
induced grain boundary motion is studied in bicrystals to relate this behavior
to grain boundary structure and the underlying mechanism of the phenomenon.
