This project adapts successful models from CSU Hayward and James Madison
University to facilitate the incorporation of DNA sequencing technology into
both the undergraduate curriculum and independent student research at CSU Chico.
We are creating a modern automated DNA sequencing facility and integrating
sequencing into a wide variety of undergraduate courses (microbiology, plant and
animal molecular biology, systematics and ecology) helping to unify our diverse
disciplines. Undergraduate students are introduced to modern gene-based biology
by incorporating hands-on sequencing and database exploration. The project has
two objectives: (1) to improve undergraduate laboratory course experiences, and
(2) to stimulate independent student research. We are quantifying class outcomes
as students' individual and class projects, and independent research by student
presentations and publications. We are also evaluating how well this project
helps students prepare for further education or biology-related careers.
