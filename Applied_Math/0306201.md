The proposal will establish boundedness and integrability results for wave
patterns arising from strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The
methods apply to patterns of non-interacting shock and rarefaction waves
generated as solutions of the one-dimensional Riemann and Cauchy problems
without any restrictions on their amplitude.

As to the project's broader impacts, the PI is hoping to link the analytical
results obtained to recent experimental data where the bounded variation
instabilities of certain heavy gases have been discovered. These findings will
have impact in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics.
