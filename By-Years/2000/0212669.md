Cell adhesion is responsible for the formation of tissues and organs. Cadherins
are proteins that confer specificity to cells such that they adhere only to
specific cell types. They are membrane-bound calcium-binding proteins with
independently folded extracellular domains that participate in the cell-cell
interactions. Calcium binds at the interface between the extracellular domains
and changes their relative disposition. Calcium is required for cell adhesion.
Studies of cadherins fall into two main categories, cellular level studies and
high-resolution structural studies. Results from these approaches have not
yielded a paradigm for the structural basis of the intermolecular interactions.
At this point there is little understanding of the energetics of the molecular
interactions involving cadherins. This project includes the study of the
stability and calcium-binding properties of the extracellular domains of
epithelial cadherin. In addition, the project will address how the calcium-
binding properties depend on dimerization. These studies will elucidate the
energetic origins of the calcium-linked interactions of cadherin that are
critical for cell adhesion. The specific aims of this research are:
characterization of the stability of the extracellular domains of epithelial-
cadherin (ECAD12), determination of affinity and cooperative interactions for
calcium binding to the sites between ECAD12, and establishing conditions under
which cis-dimerization occurs for ECAD12. This project will have a broad
positive impact on undergraduate and graduate education in physical
biochemistry.
