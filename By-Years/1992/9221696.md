It has long been postulated that our hominid ancestors underwent critical
adaptations to the savanna grasslands of Africa after leaving the forests, yet
the presence of this savanna habitat type throughout hominid evolution has never
been clearly established. This dissertation research project will infer the
vegetational structure of early hominid habitats by determining the feeding
adaptations of contemporaneous herbivores. The initial stage of analysis will
involve the determination of correspondences between cranial and axial
morphological variation on the one hand and specific feeding behaviors among
living African antelopes on the other. This information will then allow for the
determination of various fossil bovid dietary preferences, and in turn, the
evaluation of hypotheses concerning the origin and spread of savanna grasslands.
The study provides for excellent graduate training for a young professional.
