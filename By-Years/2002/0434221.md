The primary goals of this project are to understand how stationary wave patterns
may change in response to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, to assess
the impact on atmospheric teleconnection dynamics, and to explore the linkages
between changes in the zonal mean flow in response to greenhouse warming. Off-
line linear and non-linear stationary wave models are to be used to identify the
forcing agents responsible for the stationary wave responses. Climate changes
are expected to alter these responses by, for example, impacting on the location
and intensity of atmospheric jet streams. The research is motivated by the fact
that stationary waves determine regional climate and, to some extent, the
teleconnection dynamics of the atmosphere. The research is important because it
has the potential to improve models and their ability to predict weather and
climate.

The project involves undergraduate students who will actively participate in the
research tasks.
