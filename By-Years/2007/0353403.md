A request for $48,950 of support over a twelve-month period is proposed for
North Carolina A&amp;T University to allow the project staff to plan and further
design a TPC project that will develop and test a professional development model
to investigate the relationship between mentoring and knowledge in content,
pedagogy, diversity, human growth and development principles, instructional
technology and behavioral attributes empirically documented to enhance
instruction and student achievement. It is based on the premise that teachers
who are well prepared in content knowledge, pedagogical skills and understanding
of growth and development of middle grade students from diverse backgrounds can
make significant changes in student achievement. An expected outcome of great
local, state and national significance is the development of a model that will
increase the number of well-prepared and licensed middle school teachers of
science, technology and mathematics.
