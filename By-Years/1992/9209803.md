This award provides support for the development of a research plan on
algorithmic issues of combinatorial problems in the solution of large sparse
symmetric positive definite systems of linear equations. The primary goal is to
develop a theoretical research program that addresses issues of interest to the
sparse matrix community. Fundamental to the planning activities will be open
discussions and seminars between senior researchers in the algorithms community
and practitioners in the sparse matrix community. Through these discussions the
investigator will determine problems of interest to the sparse matrix community
and cast them in theoretical terms. This collaboration will afford the
investigator a rare opportunity to create a unique and useful research program.
