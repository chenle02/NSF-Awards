This project is in the area of data development and utilization and involves a
collaborative effort with Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) on further
improvements in accuracy and speed in computer programs for identification of
unknown compounds from their mass and infrared spectra. These programs are the
retrieval algorithm "Probability Based Matching (PBM)" and the interpretive
algorithm "Self-Training Interpretive and Retrieval System (STIRS)". Of
particular importance will be comprehensive and efficient utilization of a new
data base of around 130,000 different mass spectra. The highest performance PBM
and STIRS programs will be developed with CAS, taking advantage of their
extensive experience in computer structure manipulation and their complete files
of connection-table structure descriptions, for ultimate use on their
international on-line service, STN. PBM for on-line GC/MS will be made far more
efficient with data base compression, pre-filter techniques, vector formulation,
and use of array processor chips. PBM and STIRS accuracy will be improved by
exact mass data available from high resolution GC/MS instruments and structural
information from infrared spectrometers. STIRS will also be improved through
computer identification of maximal structure descriptions of the best matching
compounds.
