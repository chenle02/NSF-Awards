9353197 Cabrera The proposal requests funds to establish a materials
characterization facility with the acquisition of surface analytical
instrumentation. The instrumentation consists of an Auger electron spectrometer
and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and will aid current research in
environmental chemistry, thin films, catalysis, materials science and
electrochemistry. The surface analytical instrumentation will specifically
enhance the research on the processing of transition metal dichalcogenides and
ferroelectric films, by determining the composition of majority elements, as
well as impurities. The dichalcogenides and ferroelectric films are used for
solar energy batteries and optical-electrical devices, respectively. The
impurity composition can significantly affect the semiconductive and magnetic
properties of the materials, which are usually prepared by chemical vapor
deposition, sol-gel techniques or electrodeposition. The material
characterization facility will dramatically improve the interpretative
capabilities of the researchers investigating fundamentally the processing of
the foregoing materials. ***
