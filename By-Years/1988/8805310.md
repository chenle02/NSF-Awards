The International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) Inter-Associate
Committee on Mathematical Geophysics (Chairman - Albert Tarantola; Secretary -
John Orcutt) will hold its 16th International Symposium on Mathematical
Geophysics in Blanes, Spain on the Costa Brava, June 20-25, 1988. The covenor is
Dr. Antoni Correig, Physics Department, University of Barcelona. The National
Science Foundation is requested to provide partial support for the Symposium in
the amount of $18,500. Other sources of support are: IUGG (about $10,000) and
the Spanish government. Support has been requested from Air Force Geophysics
Laboratory, Department of Energy, Office of Naval Research and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. The NSF funds would be used to support
travel and per diem costs of approximately 10 U.S. scientists (at 1750 each) who
would chair sessions, present papers, lead discussions, etc. I have also
requested funds to advertise the meeting and the availability of funding in EOS,
Geotimes and Science. The first circular announcing the Symposium has been
widely distributed.
