Through this work the investigators will further develop and apply their global
3-D chemical transport model (IMPACT) to study tropospheric photochemistry and
long-range transport. Model enhancements will include the chemistry of organic
aromatic compounds, and organic peroxides produced from isoprene. The inclusion
of selected reactive nitrogen tracers will enable investigation of long-range
transport of reactive nitrogen, ozone and its precursors and the determination
of ozone production efficiencies. Data from a variety of recent field campaigns
will be compared with model simulation outputs. Results will likely bring about
significant advancements in our present understanding of the photochemistry of
some key oxidants, peroxides and organic nitrates on the global scale. The
broader impacts of this project include providing new and potentially important
information on global ozone production, and the effects of human activities on
air quality and climate. This project will also contribute to the education and
research experience of a graduate student at the University of Michigan.
