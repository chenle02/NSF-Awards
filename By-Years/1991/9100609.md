This grant supports work to measure the fluorescence cross sections for
producing the NI 120nm emission from photodissociative excitation of N2 from
their respective thresholds to 200A. Such cross sections are required for
accurate quantitative analysis and for assessments of models of the Earth's
nitrogen dayglow. The proposed work on the NI 120nm measurements will be carried
out with existing instrumentation which has been developed by the present group
for use with light sources at USC and the synchrotron radiation source at the
University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Facilities. A small Seya-Namioka
type monochromator with a spectral bandwidth of 10A is required for the NII
measurements. It is hoped that it will also be possible to measure the cross
section functions for producing (1) the NI 113.4, 142.1, 149.3, and 174.3nm
emissions from N2 and (2) the OI 130.4 and OI 135.6nm, and OII 102.5nm from O2.
