9513105 Stern This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a
U.S.-Japan workshop and field trip, to be held near Tokyo from July 27 to August
1. 1996. The co-organizers are Dr. Robert Stern of the University of Texas at
Dallas and Professor Makoto Arima of the Yokohama National University. The main
purpose of this meeting is to discuss the state of present understanding of the
3000 km long Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin (IBM arc system), and to
develop plans for future cooperative research programs in this arc system. A
total of 12 Japanese, 12 U.S., and 3 foreign scientists will participate. Five
aspects of the IBM arc will be the focus of the workshop and field trip: 1)
Generation of arc and back-arc basin magmas; 2) Early arc history and forearc
evolution; 3) Back-arc basin evolution; and 4) Hydrothermal processes and ore
deposits; and 5) Crustal and lithospheric structure. The U.S. participants
provide a broad cross section of expertise and geographical representation in
the area of Western Pacific convergent margin processes, and were selected on
the basis of being the most active researchers in the U.S. Therefore, this
proposal fulfills the objectives of the Program in its exchange and transfer of
scientific knowledge through an international collaboration. ***
