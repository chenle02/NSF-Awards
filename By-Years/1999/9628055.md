Although there is ample evidence that primates consume and disperse viable seeds
of many plant species, there are few data top illustrate the importance of their
role as seed dispersers in determining the dynamics of tropical forests. This
study will provide an assessment of the role primate seed dispersal plays in
determining the structure of the forest found in Kibale National Park, Uganda. A
sixteen month study will be conducted at three sites in Kibale that differ
markedly in the density of primate seed dispersers Two primate-fruit
interactions have been selected: (1) Uvariopsis congensis appears to rely on
dispersal by the entire frugivorous primate community, while (2) Monodora
myristica is dispersed by only the largest primates in Kibale. The densities of
the primate seed dispersers will be contrasted with the abundance of adults,
saplings, and seedlings of these two species among the sites. The possibility
that the pattern of primate seed dispersal is masked by other fruit-fugivore
interactions will be assessed.
