A2PE*H2 is a secondary irreversible photochemical product generated during
periods of high alltrans- etinal generation (i.e., receptor photopigment
bleaching) in the retinal photoreceptor outer segments. It has an absorption
maximum at 505nm and emits fluorescence peaked at 620nm. Dr. Bonner has
hypothesized that the increasing A2E levels with age are cytotoxic to the RPE
cells when internal stores within the secondary lysosomes reach too high a level
and the rate at which A2E leaches from these granules exceeds the rate at which
endoplasmic reticulum reprocessing segregates A2E back into the granules. The
induced RPE dysfunction is the earliest and potentially reversible stage of age-
related macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in affluent
societies. In this SGER a cross-disciplinary approach is taken to develop
spectral image analysis techniques suitable for extracting the retinal
distribution maps of the different fluorescent molecules in the A2E pathway from
a series of noninvasive spectral images of macular autofluorescence. If this
grant is successful, then clinical studies can be applied by these techniques to
test the theory that the role of spectral imbalance in AMD progression and to
evaluate disease prevention strategies based on spectrally modifying A2E
production and photo-oxidation rates.
