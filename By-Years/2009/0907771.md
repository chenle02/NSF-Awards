Dr Zaritsky will use deep optical imaging and spectroscopy with the Large
Binocular Telescope to study the stellar content, history, and motions in the
outer parts of galaxy disks. These regions were long known to contain gas, but
until recently were thought to be making no new stars. Clumps of new stars will
be mapped out using deep images in blue light, to investigate the history of
starbirth in the outer galaxy, and find the true edge of the stellar disk. The
motions of the stellar clumps will be measured from the Doppler shift of their
spectral lines. The averaged motion will show how fast the outer parts of the
galaxy rotate about its center, and the mass density of the outer disk can be
inferred from the way that the motion of individual clumps of stars deviates
from that mean. Dr Zaritsky will use his results to test key concepts in models
for galactic evolution, such as whether the thin disks can survive the repeated
mergers through which large galaxies are expected to grow; what the tightness of
scaling relations implies for the development of galaxy disks; and how disk
sizes could be related to the angular momentum distribution of the
protogalaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will fund the training of a
graduate student. Dr Zaritsky will use his deep galaxy images to develop
laboratory exercises for his undergraduate observational astronomy class, a
Vatican summer school that he has proposed for 2010, and a Study Abroad course
in Ghana scheduled for winter 2009. The labs will also be made available over
the internet. &lt;br/&gt;
