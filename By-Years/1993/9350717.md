Indiana University Purdue University in Indianapolis (IUPUI) is modernizing and
further developing their undergraduate teaching laboratories, which comprise the
research methods component of the psychology major. The introductory laboratory
course, which provides the first psychology laboratory experience for
undergraduate majors at IUPUI, is the primary target for development. With the
addition of this new laboratory they are computerizing experimental protocols
and data analyses, introducing students to research as it is conducted in the
modern psychology laboratory. Numerous improvements and developments are
afforded by the equipment, including increased precision of controlling stimuli
and recording responses, and standardization across different lab sections. In
addition, students in upper division laboratories and those enrolled in
independent research courses are benefiting from the new equipment. Having
learned the fundamentals of the experiment generating software in Introductory
Laboratory, advanced students are designing and carrying out independent
research projects.
