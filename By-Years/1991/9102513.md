This is the first year of two year continuing award. Properties of the well-
founded semantics for (possibly) unstratified knowledge bases are investigated
for the purpose of implementing this semantics on a wide class of practical
logic programs and expert systems. This project continues development of
algorithms for automatically recognizing sets of rules that can be guaranteed to
terminate with the appropriate execution strategy. The project also studies
methods by which the compiler can optimize execution by discovery of determinacy
in the rules. In the presence of determinacy, the correct choice among
alternatives can always be made immediately, making backtracking unnecessary.
The study focuses on the use of mode information and inductive type definitions.
This project continues implementation of prototype analyzers, compilers, and
interpreters, building upon and extending algorithms and software developed
during prior research. A major difficulty today in building large-scale rule-
based systems is choosing effective control strategies for the various subsets
of rules, and current systems place virtually all of this burden on the
programmer. An inferior choice can easily produce a nonterminating or extremely
inefficient system. Progress in this research will facilitate the development of
tools that automatically choose effective control strategies in most cases, and
advise the programmer of unclear cases.
