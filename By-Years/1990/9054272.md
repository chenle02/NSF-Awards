Workshops on microfabrication are being provided for 150 undergraduate faculty
over a two year period. These workshops teach the technology used for the
manufacture of integrated circuits, disk read-write heads, sensors, and other
miniature devices. Hands-on laboratory experience, under the direction of
experts in the field, are emphasized. The subject matter is highly
interdisciplinary, appropriate for faculty from most science and engineering
departments. The workshops are particularly appropriate for teachers of
introductory courses in materials science and engineering, electrical
engineering, chemistry and chemical engineering, and physics. Teachers of
general science courses for non-science majors are encouraged to attend. The
focus is on experienced teachers without significant prior microfabrication
skills. Participants leave the workshops with the skills required to provide
microfabrication demonstrations and experiments to their own students.
Participants are encouraged to join in the development of a laboratory manual
and are invited to follow-up workshops for improvement of experiments.
