This award supports the research on p-adic Galois repre- sentations of
Professor Shankar Sen of Cornell University. Dr. Sen's project consists of two
parts: the first is to relate the generalized Hodge-Tate structure of the
representation to the various p-adic liftings of global Galois representations
over the prime field in characteristic p. The other part is to extend previous
work of Dr. Sen that described p-adic field extensions by means of certain semi-
linear integral representations of p- power cyclic groups. Except for counting,
number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the
oldest branch of mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have
furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the fields of pure
algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most recent and most astonishing
applications of number theory have appeared in theoretical computer science and
coding theory.
