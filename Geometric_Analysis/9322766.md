9322766 Forstneric The research involves the geometry and dynamics of
holomorphic vector fields in complex Euclidean space. Connected with this are
problems of convexity type which entail analysis on the polynomial hull. The
scope of projects has potential applications to complex dynamical systems and
the geometry of partial differential equations. The overall area of several
complex variables in which the research falls, has long-standing applications to
elasticity theory and other areas of enginnering science. ***
