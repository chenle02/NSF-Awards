9803526 Schwartz Richard Schwartz will carry out research in geometry and
dynamics, along four lines. First, Schwartz will continue the work that began
with his proof, in 1993, that nonuniform rank one lattices are quasi-isometric
if and only if they are commensurable. In particular, Schwartz will further
develop the theme of action rigidity, introduced in his 1996 Acta paper, "Quasi-
isometric rigidity and diophantine approximation." Second, Schwartz will explore
the ramifications of his 1997 proof of the Goldman-Parker Conjecture, which
gives exact discreteness criteria for complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups.
This result is the first of its kind, in that it gives the complete analysis of
a nontrivial deformation problem in complex hyperbolic space. Third, Schwartz
will continue his work on dynamical systems defined by iterative constructions
in projective geometry. The work here is related to birational dynamics, abelian
varieties, the KdV equation, and determinants. Fourth, Schwartz will develop
software that aids in the understanding, communication, and solution of
geometric and dynamical problems. The common theme to this research is that it
deals with the geometric structure of infinite, symmetric, patterns. One should
think, for example, of tiles on the kitchen floor, or trees arrayed in an orange
grove. Informally speaking, the first area of Schwartz' research deals with the
question: Could a fairly blind person mistake one infinite symmetric pattern for
another? The idea is to find very "rough" features of an infinite pattern that
could distinguish it from another infinite pattern. The second area of research
deals with the following kinds of questions: Imagine that an apple is suspended
in space, surrounded by mirrors. How can you position the mirrors so that the
pattern of reflections of the apple will be nice and orderly? The third area of
research deals with the generation of infinite patterns through the repetition
of simpl e constructions, made from pencil and paper drawings. Often a very
innocent construction, such as the Pappus' theorem construction, yields a
surprising and beautiful geometric pattern upon infinite repetition. The purpose
of Schwartz fourth area of research is to make all these infinite patterns come
alive through interactive computer graphics. ***
