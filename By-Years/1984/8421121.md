This award will provide for the production of a 27-minute film on engineering
projects funded by the NSF. Subject matter would include both fundamental
research and basic, and the film will be used to stimulate interest in the
general field of engineering by emphasizing the connections engineering has with
our everyday lives, as well as implications the research will have on our
future; to show the diversity of subject matter that engineering covers; and to
depict how the engineering sciences are implemented through the National Science
Foundation.
