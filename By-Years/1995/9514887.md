The Effect of Expecting to Evaluate and of Forming Performance Expectations on
the Evaluation Process and Outcome People are increasingly asked to evaluate
their experiences Ãµ their satisfaction with the quality of products they
purchase, services rendered to them, and so forth. However, there is little
research examining how these evaluations are formed and what factors influence
their content. For example, does it make a difference if evaluations are
elicited from individuals spontaneously (the individual asked for the evaluation
does not anticipate being asked) versus deliberately (from individuals informed
that an evaluation will be requested after the good or service is provided)? The
proposed research will examine differences between spontaneous and deliberate
evaluations resulting from a variety of factors including recall, primacy
effect, the effect of a `peak event`, the correlation between judgment and
recall, susceptibility to context effects, susceptibility to order effects and
the influence of irrelevant reasons.
