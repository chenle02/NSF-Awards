Human Abilities to Perceive, Organize and Remember Auditory Sequences This
award recommendation is made under the U.S.-Industrialized Countries Program for
the Exchange of Scientists and Engineers, 1987/1988 Competition. The program is
designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct long-term research
at research institutions in the industrialized countries of Western Europe as
well as Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Exchange awards provide opportunities
for the conduct of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries. Awards
are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant to his/her field of
science, the prospective potential of the applicants for professional growth, as
well as criteria relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in
science and engineering. The program is particularly directed to scientists and
engineers who are embarking on their research careers. This research project
will investigate human abilities to perceive, organize and remember auditory
sequences varying in pitch, duration, and timbre. The perceptual capacities for
processing these dimensions of auditory stimulation, and the interaction between
them, will be assessed in three sets of experiments using a variety of stimuli
and music-like patterns. The project is under the direction of Dr. Carol L.
Krumhansl, Associate Professor, Department of Psychology, Cornell University,
Ithaca NY 14853, U.S.A., and Dr. Stephen McAdams, Director of Pedagogy, IRCAM,
Centre Georges Pompidou, 31 rue Saint-Merri, F 75004, Paris, France. This award
recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate, international travel,
local travel abroad, stipend, dependents allowance, if applicable, language
training, if required, and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S.
home institution.
