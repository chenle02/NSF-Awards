The purpose of this proposal is to apply a general equilibrium model designed to
assess the effects of US tax policies aimed at encouraging investment. This
model will be applied in an open economy context which will account for the
interactions between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world. An important
innovation in this research is that particular attention will be paid to the
international flows of financial capital and the international cross-ownership
of capital stocks. Two main types of policies will be examined. One type
involves policies aimed at the promotion of domestic savings. These policies
include proposals to base the individual income tax more exclusively on
consumption. The second type emphasizes the promotion of domestic investment.
These policies include tax credits for investments in domestic plant and
equipment, and reductions in statutory U.S. corporate income tax rates. The
various policy options will be analyzed along a number of dimensions including
effects on domestic and foreign welfare; on saving and investment by domestic
and foreign households; on the size, ownership, and industrial allocation of the
U.S. capital stock; and on the trade balance and other components of the balance
of payments.
