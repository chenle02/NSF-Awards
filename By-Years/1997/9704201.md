9704201 Speck This collaborative project between researchers at the University
of California, Santa Barbara and the Argonne National Laboratory, addresses
fundamental research issues in the growth of GaN by metallo-organic chemical
vapor deposition(MOCVD), in-situ atomic-scale characterization of the MOCVD
growth process, with the scientific goal to understand the basic chemical and
physical processes and the fundamental mechanism of crystal growth by MOCVD. The
approach utilizes real-time synchrotron x-ray techniques to measure structure,
chemistry, and surface morphology evolution within a state-of-the-art MOCVD
reactor. The project emphasizes strong interlinking between growth, structural
characterization, physical property measurements, and related device research
efforts. %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area
of materials science having high technological relevance, compact and efficient
light sources in the blue-green spectral region. The research will contribute
basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general. Additionally,
the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected
to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials, and materials combinations. An important feature of the
program is the integration of research and education through the training of
students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***
