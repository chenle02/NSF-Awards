This research, with work completed earlier, will provide a detailed analysis of
the paleoecology of Cenozoic Central America using a series of fossil beds that
are extremely rich in pollen. Cores will be sampled from each of two sites---one
in southern Mexico and one on Puerto Rico. This study will complement data
collected from other sites in the Caribbean and Isthmus regions. The data and
the derived inferences will have great implications for understanding the effect
of large-scale global change on the dynamics of vegetation, and the effects of
those changes on animal populations and climate itself. Specifically, the
results will be instrumental in understanding the origin and migration of floras
during the closure of the Pan-American land mass. This event is crucial to
comprehending the modern floras and faunas of the New World, and it has
significance for biogeography, systematics, ecology, etc.
