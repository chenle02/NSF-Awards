The objective of this research is to use the pore-pressure, temperature and
displacement fields that are induced as a result of dike intrusion to provide
important information regarding the intrusive process. The monitoring of induced
fluid pressures have already illustrated the potential of determining dike
location, volume and propagation rate. The monitoring of thermal and
displacement signatures will provide complementary information to define the
form of the intrusion, and may be used in isolation, or ensemble. The additional
constraint that the ensemble data gives maybe useful in further defining the
coupled processes that accompany intrusion, and maybe of use in predicting
eruption. The program of analysis is a prelude to initiating a field monitoring
experiment.
