New workstations at the Institute for Advanced Study will facilitate more
effective studies of solar neutrino production, galaxy formation, quantum
chromodynamics (the theory of the nuclear force), mathematical models of various
physical and biological systems, and other topics. The research program at the
Institute is a broad and influential one which often requires significant
amounts of numerical computation or graphical analysis. The new equipment will
make this computation and analysis more efficient and effective.
