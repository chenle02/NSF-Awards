The broader impact/commercial potential of this project encompasses key
application areas of photovoltaic sustainable energy systems in residential and
commercial power systems, with a projected multi-billion dollar global industry.
From a business owner standpoint, the proposed microinverter will provide a
significant advantage to photovoltaic power-conditioning companies both in terms
of (a) enhanced profitability due to reduced microinvert cost and (b) superior
performance parameters encompassing improved energy efficiency, higher
durability, enhanced reliability, high power density, and simultaneous grid
connectivity and source energy optimization. Further, the proposed technology is
also extendable to (single- and three-phase) energy systems sourced by fuel
cell, batteries, and wind as well. As such, the proposed system is expected to
be of prime interest to key businesses. On a broader note, the proposed project
brings together the expertise of a small business and an advanced research
institution providing a pathway that is based on strong foundation of industry-
university collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology
Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project This STTR Phase I project will design
and analyze a GaN-on-Si based novel photovoltaic (PV) microinverter and its
power-stage subsystems, synthesize a unified model predictive control algorithm
for simultaneous source energy optimization and grid connectivity, and perform
comprehensive performance predictions of the microinverter. The GaN-on-Si
technology provides an optimal balance between low-cost, high performance, and
high power density for the microinverter. A direct power conversion mechanism
for the microinverter alleviates the high-voltage dc-link electrolytic capacitor
thereby yielding higher long-term reliability, reduced cost, and reduced space.
The compact architecture microinverter architecture and the reduced device count
of the power stage provide a seamless and modular pathway for power scalability
for future multi-phase and/or high power needs.
