This research will examine how people with physical disabilities, scientists and
technologists who develop assistive devices for their use, and rehabilitation
professionals who prescribe such devices, view rehabilitation success. The goal
is to identify and examine disparities or misunderstandings in these views so as
to develop a better understanding of factors leading to rehabilitation success
or failure and improve rehabilitation assistance. The research will collect and
analyze data from observations, interviews, questionnaires, and personality
tests with representatives from these three groups.
