This award is for the purchase of a Datacube MaxVideo 20 Image Processing
System and two Sun SPARCstations each with an image database server. This
equipment will support research in image understanding and image compression for
dynamic scences. Research in image understanding and image compression requires
high computational power and large memory space. The University of Central
Florida will purchase equipment to build a real-time vision system to support
several research projects in image understanding and image compression for
dynamic scenes.
