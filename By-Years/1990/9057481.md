This project focuses on sequential as well as parallel algorithms for
constrained optimization and computational geometry. One of the goals in the
area of constrained optimization is the application of recent developments in
convex optimization to non-linear membrane and plate problems in mechanics.
Interior point methods in optimization are studied further in order to obtain
better solutions/heuristics for (hard) integer programming problems. Research in
computational geometry with a special emphasis on problems defined on a set of
points in high dimension is conducted. Such high dimensional problems arise
routinely in classification, pattern recognition, vision, and speech
recognition. A typical problem in this class would be developing a practically
workable data structure for near neighbor search. In particular, all known data
structures that achieve a sub-linear worst-case query time, require an
astronomical amount of storage and preprocessing. This project investigates how
techniques in computational geometry may be used to obtain better algorithms for
solving large scale linear systems arising in the context of partial
differential equations.
