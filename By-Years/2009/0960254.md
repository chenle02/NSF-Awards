This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at Occidental College in
Los Angeles, California received an MRI-R2 award to provide support for the
purchase of an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system, a NanoDrop 2200c
spectrophotometer, a Beckman Allegra-25R benchtop refrigerated centrifuge, and a
Beckman DTX 880 multimode detector and workstation. The instrumentation greatly
improves research and training capabilities and enables the current biology
faculty to undertake new research projects. Research areas include microbial
ecology, animal physiology, and plant biology. Acquisition of state-of-the art
instrumentation is key to maintaining and enhancing the high quality of science
research and education. In addition to the use of the proposed instrumentation
by students conducting independent research projects, this equipment will also
be made available to students in advanced Biology courses taught by the PIs,
including Microbial Diversity, Symbiosis, Plant Form and Function, Plant
Physiological Ecology, and Vertebrate Physiology. These include students
majoring in Biology, Biochemistry, Kinesiology, Cognitive Science and
Psychobiology. Occidental College is a research- intensive learning environment,
with goals that complement the goals of the MRI program - to increase access to,
and improve the quality of, shared scientific instruments for faculty research
and research training of future scientists. Data and findings from research
enabled by these instruments will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and
presented by students and faculty at regional and national meetings.
