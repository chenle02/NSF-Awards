This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium," a conference series in which the 2018
event will take place during May 29-June 2, 2018, on the campus of Miami
University in Oxford, Ohio. Additional information about the conference can be
found on the website https://users.miamioh.edu/mckennp2/gpots/index.html

The Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS) is an annual regional
conference that has taken place since 1981. It brings together a diverse group
of mathematicians whose primary research interest is in operator algebras,
operator theory and related areas. A sampling of the topics presented in the
2018 event is given by the following: the corona problem, Hilbert modules,
noncommutative function theory, deformation rigidity, free probability,
subfactors and fusion categories, classification of C*-algebras, C*-algebras and
dynamical systems, the Baum-Connes conjecture, noncommutative differential
geometry, index theory, operator spaces and applications, and logic and operator
algebras. The expected attendance is between 100 and 150 participants. The
conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs,
and other young scientists to present their work.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
