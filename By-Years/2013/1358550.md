Li-ion batteries have enabled tremendous breakthrough in applications but the
need for advanced battery electrodes that can deliver high capacity and power
continues to drive battery producer R&amp;D efforts. The PI and his team have
developed a low-cost, high-throughput self-assembly process to create diverse
well-organized nanoparticle structures in the electrodes with electric field. In
the fabrication of electrodes, the PI's research has demonstrated advanced
battery electrodes with enhanced rate capability, high energy density, long
cycling life, and reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technique proposed in
this project will produce high performance batteries needed by electric vehicle
and other applications, which will benefit the society by addressing global
energy and environmental challenges. Translating the technique to commercial
applications will not only create new jobs and contribute to the economy, but
will also increase the US competence in the important area of Li-battery
manufacturing.
