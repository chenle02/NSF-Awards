This research is aimed at the development of a versatile environmental
controller that will allow persons with varying disabilities to control multiple
external devices in their environment (e.g., home appliances, computers, etc.).
This controller is different from existing devices in that clinical
professionals will be more able to adapt it to meet the needs of end users with
various disabilities. Existing devices are often limiting and impose constraints
on the types of input/output information they can process. As such, clinician
often have difficulty adapting the controllers to the end users and,
consequently, the users are provided with less-than-optimal systems. Present
systems are generally expensive to set up and many have questionable utility and
reliability. By using recently introduced powerful and standard technology for
interconnecting input and output devices and the company's expertise in
developing programmable and portable hardware/software systems, a versatile
environment controller will be developed that will allow clinicians to quickly
and cost- effectively configure systems for individuals.
