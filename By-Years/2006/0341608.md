Abstract

Proposal Title: Issues in Non-equilibrium Reactive Distillation Proposal
Number: CTS-0341608 Principal Investigator: Lakshmi Sridhar Institution:
University of Puerto Rico



The objective of this project is to perform a fundamental investigation of the
analysis, design, optimization and control of non-equilibrium reactive
distillation processes. The causes of multiple steady states that occur in non-
equilibrium reactive distillation and the location of the singularities that
cause these multiple steady-states will be determined. Non-equilibrium reactive
distillation line maps that can be used for design/synthesis in the limit of
reaction equilibrium will be developed. The effects of kinetics on feasible
splits will be determined by distinguishing between a rectifying and a stripping
cascade and identifying the fixed points of the corresponding equations. Several
optimization strategies will be pursued. The number of trays, feed tray
locations, holdup per tray, reflux and boilup, and the condenser and reboiler
duties for both non-equilibrium non-reactive and non-equilibrium reactive
separation processes will be optimized. Two optimization strategies used will
be: solution of mixed integer nonlinear optimization formulations using genetic
algorithms and solution through standard local branch and bound algorithms such
as Generalized Benders Decomposition. Generation of Pareto optimal solutions
through multi-objective optimization formulations will also be considered. All
the analysis and algorithmic/numerical procedures developed will be tested on
real industrial problems. The control aspect involves the development of
nonlinear multi-variable control strategies for non-equilibrium reactive
separation processes. Controllers based on reduced order and Volterra series
representations will be developed and their performance will be tested through
rigorous dynamic studies. In terms of the broader impacts, both graduate and
undergraduate students will be involved in the project. New courses in
distillation design will be introduced. If successful, this work may lead to
general methodologies for dealing with a class of problems encountered in
industrial separations.
