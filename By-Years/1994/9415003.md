9415003 Frenzen This research will evaluate changes in the equation for
turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the surface layer as a function of roughness
Reynolds number as well as stability by conducting and add-on experiment over an
extensive forest in north central Saskatchewan. A 26-m tower temporarily
installed in this location for the BOREAS experiment offers a timely opportunity
to determine weather findings of earlier TKE studies conducted over selected
"ideal" field sites also apply over more realistic terrain. Questions raised by
recent experiments over two relatively smooth sites (zo < 5 cm) will be
investigated over the much rougher forest canopy (zo> 50 cm) using proven
procedures and equipment development for the earlier work. These questions
include: a) How much does the difference between rates of turbulent energy
production and dissipation (the dissipation deficit) changes with increasing
roughness Reynolds number? b) How do the higher-order, turbulence and pressure
transport terms adjust to these changes in the energy balance over rough
surfaces? and c) Does the von Karman constant continue to decrease with
roughness Reynolds number to the theoretical limit of 0.37? Results obtained
will be used to develop generalized terms for applying the TKE equation to
surface layer flows over real terrain, and will be used to determine the
accuracy of various scaling hypotheses proposed for flow over forests.
