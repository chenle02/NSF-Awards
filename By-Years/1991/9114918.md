In the last twenty years the construction of large aperture radio
interferometers has provided an essential tool in understanding the physical
characteristics of the "coronas" of several groups of stars. Two such groups are
the magnetically active lower main sequence stars (like the Sun) and very young
("naked T Tauri") stars whose outer envelopes have evaporated away enough to
permit their direct observation. In this proposal a former NSF Presidential
Young Investigator plans a one year observational survey of emissions from the
coronas of these two groups of stars. These radio data will be combined with
x-ray and ultraviolet data to provide a physical understanding of the plasma
responsible for flaring activity that in the coronas of these stars. This
project will help bring order to a currently confused picture of the emission of
radio- active stars and should ultimately help provide a broad context within
which to understand the differences and similarities of physical processes
leading to the radio emissions in several groups of stars, including the Sun.
