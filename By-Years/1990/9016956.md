This research is concerned with the investigation of the atomic structure of and
crystal symmetry of (probe atom) surface bonding sites produced during the
epitaxial growth process. The specific surface sites will be on III-V epitaxial
structures such as gallium arsenide, indium-gallium arsenide, indium arsenide
and indium phosphide grown on single crystal gallium arsenide substrates.
Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) spectroscopy employing the indium/cadmium
(isotope 111) probe will be used to measure electric field gradients at the
bonding sites via the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction. The PAC technique
can provide important information about growth kinetics, thickness of layers,
stoichiometry, and the crystal symmetry of the interface phases.
