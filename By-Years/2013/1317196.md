This four-year mixed methods research project investigates the processes by
which students select into and out of fields of study and of how projects funded
by STEP impact these processes. Grounded in Eccles' expectancy value-model, the
research study examines student pathways to STEM baccalaureate degrees and the
impact of different types of interventions on those pathways across diverse
students and STEM majors. The research focuses on the relationships among
student academic preparation, subjective expectations with respect to future
academic performance, objective academic performance, the tasks values students
ascribe to STEM courses and majors, and interpersonal relationships from which
students may draw personal and academic support. The comparison group design
based on stratified probability samples of first-time first-year students from
the participating institutions results in representative samples of the
population of entering first-time students. The design includes two control
groups and one treatment group to increase external validity: One cohort
includes only STEM students who enter the university in the year prior to the
start of the intervention designed by STEP Type I projects (control condition
1). The second cohort of students includes STEM students who participate in STEP
Type 1 activities (treatment condition) and those who do not (control condition
2). Data include institutional student records and student responses to surveys
designed for the study. In addition, the project is constructing a data
infrastructure for further research by researchers and use by STEP projects.
