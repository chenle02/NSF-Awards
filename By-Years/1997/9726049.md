ABSTRACT EEC-9726049 MOMOH This award funds a researcher at Howard University
(HBCU) for a two year project reporting to the Industry/University Cooperative
Research Center for Power Systems Engineering. The project is entitled, "Real
Time Pricing of Reactive Power Support Service and Control." The study will
develop an optimal reactive-resources-planning tool, similar to the optimal
generation planning tools that minimize the sum of capital and operating costs
over some future period, subject to constraints.
