This award will produce an updated supplement to the fourth edition of the
Ethnographic Bibliography of North America. The PIs will collect between 15,000
and 20,000 new bibliographic entries from the years 1973- 86 on the native
peoples of North America. The Ethnographic Bibliography of North America is a
standard reference source for North American Indians (including Eskimos) for
scholars in several fields. Citations will be entered on a microcomputer and,
with the aid of specialized bibliographic software, the grantee will produce a
supplement, probably in two printed volumes. Citations in these volumes will be
numbered and listed, accessible by at least three indexes, that is, by ethnic
group, author and subject. The supplement will also be made available on a
collection of disks. This project is important because an updated, comprehensive
bibliography is an essential research tool.
