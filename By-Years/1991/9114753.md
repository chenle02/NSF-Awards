The project will follow the rapidly changing conditions produced by the fifth
year of drought in California and will collect data which otherwise would be
lost. The study will focus on the following four areas: a) the acquisition and
analysis of drought- related meteorological and hydrological data in order to
assess the uniqueness of this drought episode; b) the assessment of the drought
monitoring procedures in order to determine how efficiently the drought's
beginning was detected and the drought's progression was evaluated; c) the
assessment of the effect of the drought on the performance of major water
resource engineering projects; and d) the assessment of the performance of
unusual response measures, e.g., water transfers and water banking. The results
of this work will benefit climatologists, hydrologists, planners and managers,
and researchers from government, the private sector and academia.
