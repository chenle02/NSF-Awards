In a continuing research program it is proposed to develop an improved
fundamental understanding of the equilibrium and dynamic behavior of oil-water-
surfactant systems and to assess the implications of the results to current
challenges in detergency. Phase behavior experiments and observations of dynamic
behavior using videomicroscopy will be carried out with model systems consisting
of pure components. However, emphasis shall ultimately be on systems containing
mixtures of pure surfactant and/or soils since mixtures are the rule in
practice. Strong interaction with industrial research groups investigates
detergency will continue to be a significant part of this work. One major
emphasis of the research will be to determine the limiting conditions in mixed
soil or mixed surfactant systems when surfactant-rich intermediate phases just
start to form upon contact of surfactant solution and soil. Early results
suggest that detergency improves significantly when such phases occur, whatever
the details of the phase behavior. Thus, this approach offers the promise of
being of general use to identify conditions where good detergency can be
expected for a wide variety of systems of general widespread interest.
