This study will provide a three-year, in depth, longitudinal analysis of
students' development as mathematical learners in reform-oriented mathematics
classrooms during the middle school years. For the purposes of this study,
reform is defined as a teacher's use of instructional practices and curricular
materials that aligned with the NCTM's Curriculum and Teaching Standards and the
Principles and Standards for School Mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
overall purpose of this research is to examine the ways in which mathematics
reform affects students' development as mathematics knowers and learners. The
study will document changes in students' learning and self-conceptions, as well
as the processes by which this change occurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary
research questions guiding the work are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the
direct and indirect effects of teacher practice, classroom and student level
processes on students' conceptual understanding, achievement and identify
development in mathematics?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. How are the effects of
teacher practice, and classroom and student level processes on students'
conceptual understanding and identify development moderated by gender, ethnicity
and socioeconomic status?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
