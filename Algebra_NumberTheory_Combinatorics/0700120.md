The PI has recently obtained new results on qualitative features of packings :
proof of an abrupt change (phase transition) between low and high density
packings of a certain deformed disk in the plane, and the experimental discovery
of a phase transition in packings of sand (that is, with anisotropy produced by
gravity) as density is varied.

These results give a uniform approach to understanding certain qualitative
features of the geometry of packings, linking research areas in unexpected and
fruitful ways, and using a variety of mathematical techniques unusual in the
traditional approaches to such studies.
