Copepod feeding on the suspended phytoplankton in marine systems are very
important links in the food web. 'recent research on copepod feeding has shown
that the process is a very active one, achieved via the production of feeding
currents, the detection of particles of food in the water column and active
capturing of particles. The actual mechanisms employed in these feeding
processes are not understood. The focus of this research will be on the relative
importance of chemoreception and mechanoreception in feeding and the role of
learning. A unique micro-cinematography/3-D video system has been developed to
allow fine-scale observation and experimentation with the behavior of these
animals in near natural conditions. This system will be further developed during
the award period. Dr. Strickler has been unique in his approach to the study of
zooplankton behavior. He is widely regarded for the development of sophisticated
observations systems that other researchers have easy access to. His fundamental
research contributions are equally regarded. Support is strongly recommended.
