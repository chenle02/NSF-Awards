DMS-9523292 Bruno The mathematical investigations associated with this proposal
relate to the classical theory of Partial Differential Equations and its
applications to the study of the physical properties of materials and media;
they constitute a natural continuation of my research of the last five years. By
using methods of homogenization, integral equations, spectral analysis and
regularity together with computational techniques I intend mathematical
techniques will be developed to study and predict the physical properties of
composite materials, shape memory materials and plasmas, as well as the
scattering of electromagnetic radiation by general obstacles. In the area of
electromagnetism some computational methods are introduced recently to new
areas, including remote sensing of obstacles as well as the mathematically
related problem of detection of damaged biological tissue (perhaps cancer) by
means of electromagnetic scattering. In its previous applications these methods
were highly successful; These methods will be used to deal with shape memory
alloys. These materials can be used in a variety of applications (including
generation of electricity from low temperature sources, medical devices, etc.)
by exploiting their ability to recover their shape, after they have been
deformed, by means of appropriate changes in their temperature.
