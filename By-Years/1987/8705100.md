C. Chakravarthy will work on speech digitization problems, particularly the use
of Packet Voice techniques and the use of efficient methods like Vector
Quantizers for achieving the enhanced channel capacity. This award will provide
for the purchase of computational equipment and spectrum analyzer to permit this
research. The research planned is substantial and of significant interest to the
engineering community.
