Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science faculty at the College of St. Benedict
have launched a pilot cohort-based program called MapCores (Math, Physics, and
Computer Science Research Scholars) which blends scholarships, curricular
refinements, mentoring and support activities designed to attract, retain and
graduate more women in these disciplines. This project supports students with
financial need in the cohorts for fall 2010 and fall 2011. CSB provides merit-
based scholarships to MapCores students who do not demonstrate financial
need.&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of MapCores are:&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase women's
participation and persistence in the fields of mathematics, physics, and
computer science&lt;br/&gt;2. Include women as junior members of the scientific
community and&lt;br/&gt;3. Strengthen women's academic confidence and interest
in the targeted disciplines&lt;br/&gt;Each cohort starts by taking a specially-
designed First Year Seminar emphasizing critical thinking, discussion, oral
presentation, information literacy, and research skills. Students in their
second and third year take a problem-solving seminar each semester of their
second year and a research seminar each semester of the third year. As seniors
they complete a senior thesis or project in collaboration with a faculty member.
Students are encouraged to take part in summer research experiences after their
second or third years.
