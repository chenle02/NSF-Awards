This research takes an information theoretic approach to understanding
principles that govern a coordinated rate-efficient sampling of multiple signals
and centralized compression of the sampled subset. The goal is to reconstruct
the entirety of the signals within acceptable distortion levels. The research
has three main components: an integrated analysis of sampling and rate
distortion behavior, and their tradeoffs; sampling rate distortion theory for
Markov random fields; and sampling rate distortion performance for signals with
memory. Expected outcomes are a characterization of fundamental performance
limits of optimum sampling rate and lossy compression rate and their interplay,
together with the best choice of sampling mechanisms and attendant processing
for reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators' technical approach
involves the development of a principle of "sampling rate distortion" which lies
at the intersection of specialities in information theory and signal processing,
and has the larger objective of elucidating material connections between
sampling and rate distortion performance. The performance of specific sampling
and rate distortion processing schemes will be investigated. Specific groups of
open problems chosen for investigation address a general class of multisignal
models for sampling and lossy data compression. These are motivated by potential
applications including dynamic thermal management for on-chip temperature
control during runtime; network function computation; and image restoration,
surface reconstruction and visual integration in computer vision.
