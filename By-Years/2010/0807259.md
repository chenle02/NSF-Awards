The GENIUS Scholarship Program provides scholarship support for incoming
academically talented freshman engineering students with unmet financial need
for a duration of 2 years. The scholarship awards range from $4,000 to $10,000
based on individual unmet student financial need. In totality, the GENIUS
Scholarship program supports 3 cohorts of 12 students for a total of 36 students
over a five year period. The scholarship program supports students majoring in
any of the discipline departments that comprise the College of Engineering,
Architecture, and Computer Science. This program offers a suite of "best
practices" to effectively address significant issues facing students from
underrepresented groups such as: 1) Effective academic integration into the
campus; 2) Effective social integration into the campus; 3) Appropriate
financial support; and 4) Disillusionment with engineering.
