9315136 Peterson In various globular clusters, stars are distributed along the
horizontal branch in quite different ways. Although mass loss on the red giant
branch is widely thought to be responsible for this distribution, the underlying
parameter which controls the mass loss has not been established. The PI will
measure rotation velocities, oxygen abundances and helium abundances for
horizontal branch stars in clusters with a range of properties. This will help
to establish whether any of these parameters play an important role in
horizontal branch evolution. ***
