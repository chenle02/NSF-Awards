Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project for "Improving
National acceptance of Computing Intensive Statistical Techniques (INCIST)" is
developing, field testing, and disseminating materials for teaching
computationally intensive techniques for almost all of the topics in
introductory statistics. This project is designed to study the ways in which
these materials enable students to develop a deeper understanding of statistical
concepts. These comprehensive modules are web-based, utilize the low-cost yet
computationally powerful statistical software StatCrunch, contain interactive
multimedia presentations for students, and include extensive instructor
materials. While the materials can serve as a stand-alone course, they are also
modular so that parts can also be integrated into a course which is taught using
a typical introductory statistics textbook. The INCIST resources are useful for
statistics instructors at a large number of institutions including those
teaching at community colleges and smaller liberal arts colleges. This project
also holds workshops to train instructors on using the modules in their courses.
