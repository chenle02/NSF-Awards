The Hispanic Engineering, Science and Technology (HESTEC) program at The
University of Texas-Pan American, serves as a catalyst to promote awareness and
increase the full participation of Hispanics in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM) fields by encouraging and motivating students to pursue
higher education and STEM careers. HESTEC will convene a weeklong series of
events on September 27- October 2, 2009 to engage high school and undergraduate
students, and the community at large in STEM educational activities, and provide
a forum where higher education, federal, and corporate sector stakeholders can
discuss and address key issues on preparing Hispanics for the science and
engineering workforce. The program supports the Foundation?s strategic outcome
goals of learning and stewardship, and expands efforts to increase participation
from all under-represented groups. The HESTEC activity will foster communication
among stakeholders to help prepare a diverse cadre of future scientists and
engineers ready to meet the challenges of advancing the frontiers of knowledge,
and equipped to solve the imminent concerns confronting the nation domestically
and globally.
