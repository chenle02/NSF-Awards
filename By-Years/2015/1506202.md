This project proposes to support two conferences in the subject known as
topology. The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) Symposium
on the Geometry and Topology of Manifolds is to be held June 29-July 7, 2015, at
University of British Columbia and the Applied Topology and High-Dimensional
Data Analysis conference is to be held August 17-28, 2015, at the University of
Victoria. Topology studies the shape of objects and how they can be deformed. It
plays a key role in a variety of disciplines in science and engineering. Top
level international experts will come together to discuss recent developments
and applications. This grant will enable young researchers and students from the
United States to attend these meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIMS Symposium
on Geometry and Topology of Manifolds has as its objective to bring together
mathematicians working on a broad range of topics in this area, and provide an
opportunity for researchers and graduate students to learn about new
connections. The program will include a combination of expository and research
talks, as well as time for informal contacts and exchanges of ideas. Some
particular themes that we hope will be represented during this activity include
geometric structures and analysis on manifolds (e.g., Ricci flow, Einstein
metrics, special holonomy); geometric group theory and 3-manifolds; geometric
topology (e.g., surgery theory, cobordism and stability of diffeomorphisms);
smooth 4-manifolds and gauge theory; symplectic geometry and topology. The
conference "Applied Topology and High-Dimensional Data Analysis" aims to bring
together applied topologists and spatial statisticians to explain their research
and develop interactions between them, as well as to expose students to this
emerging interdisciplinary field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshops'
