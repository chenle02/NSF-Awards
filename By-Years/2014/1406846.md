One surprising effect of biological diversity can be to reduce the spread of
disease: infection of one host species may be lower in the presence of other
host species. This ?dilution effect? is typically seen when the species are
similar enough that they compete for resources such as food. The net effect of
species diversity then depends on whether diversity reduces infection more than
it decreases the availability of resources. This project will investigate the
dilution effect using artificial communities of two zooplankton, algae they both
eat, and a fungus that infects one of the zooplankton more readily than the
other. Previous work with these communities showed that the net effect of the
less susceptible zooplankton on the more susceptible one depended on genetic
diversity: the higher the genetic diversity of the more susceptible zooplankton,
the more beneficial the presence of the less susceptible one. This suggests that
rapid evolution of the susceptible zooplankton was required for the dilution
effect to operate. Research will now measure how the genetic makeup of the
susceptible zooplankton changes as competition and infection proceed, and how
the genetic changes result in changes in the traits of the zooplankton to create
a dilution effect. Results should increase understanding both of how ecology and
evolution can affect each other and how biodiversity can counter disease.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research include applications
to control of disease in wildlife and in humans. Dilution effects may be
important in serious diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile virus, Hantavirus,
and schistosomiasis. The project will also provide research experience for
undergraduate researchers including members of underrepresented groups.
