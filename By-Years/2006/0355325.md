This project supports an open community workshop addressing organic speciation
within ambient atmospheric aerosols. Although it is understood organics in the
aerosol phase probably play important roles with respect to human health and/or
climate, there remains considerable uncertainty as to the nature and specific
contributions of such effects. This workshop will evaluate the state of the
science, identify gaps in present understanding and reach community consensus on
current research needs and future direction. The workshop will have a broader
impact on the scientific community with respect to producing a summary document
dealing substantively with an important interdisciplinary area of atmospheric
science. Under support from this award a number of graduate students and junior
postdoctoral fellows from U.S. institutions will significantly enhance their
professional development by participation in the meeting.
