This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the renovation of
laboratory spaces used by five active researchers in the Chemistry Department at
Trinity College so they can handle modern, chemical research. Designed for
research in 1937, the laboratories used by these five faculty are not well-
equipped to handle the demands of modern chemical research. In particular, these
laboratories lack control of temperature, humidity and sunlight. Current
research projects which will be enhanced by the renovation include work on the
use of organometallic moieties to constrain peptides to particular secondary
structures, the biological properties of the bone protein osteocalcin and the
binding of proteins to DNA, rational syntheses for Buckminsterfullerene and
related compounds, the reactivity of transition metal hydrides, and the role of
reactive oxygen species in the molecular events associated with neuronal cell
death. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When completed, the renovations will remove
obstacles that slow the pace of accomplishment in the laboratories of the five
affected faculty and allow these faculty to continue working with large numbers
of undergraduate student researchers.
