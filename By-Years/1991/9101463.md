This project will developa chronology for the Paleogene by integrating
magnetostratigraphy, stable isotope stratigraphy, Sr- isotope, and
biostratigraphy. The stratigraphic goal is to develop a Paleogene time scale,
and to test biostratigraphic correlations between low and high latitudes. In
addition, the work has the paleoceanographic goal of reconstructing deep-and
surface-water fluctuations by makeing synoptic faunal and isotope comparisons
across two climate transitions, the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and the late
middle Eocene to early Oligocene.
