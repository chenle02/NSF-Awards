Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel at much lower weight. The greatest
barrier to the widespread use of titanium, however, has been its high cost, much
of which comes from high processing costs. A new powder metallurgy process
called hydrogen sintering has been introduced that can produce titanium
components with the capacity to compete with the mechanical properties of
standard titanium parts produced by forging, but at a fraction of the cost. This
new process is very promising for dramatically reducing the cost of titanium
parts and components. Titanium parts can be used in many applications
(biomedical, chemical processing, aerospace, etc.), but have particular benefit
to the transportation sector. By reducing the weight of vehicles, significant
savings in fuel consumption will be realized, as well as associated reductions
in emissions. This award supports a comprehensive study of the fundamental
underlying metallurgical processes associated with the titanium powder process,
and the mechanical properties that can be achieved by varying process
parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research program, the PIs will
systematically study the range of mechanical properties that can be attained by
several heat treating options that have already shown the capacity to produce
wrought-like microstructures from this novel powder metallurgy approach.
Processing parameters will be studied for their effects on phase equilibria in
the relevant titanium alloy-hydrogen systems, as well as phase transformations
and microstructural evolution as functions of thermal cycles and hydrogen
partial pressures, the mechanisms and kinetics of the transformations, and the
dependence of mechanical properties, especially the fatigue performance, on the
microstructure. By studying these relationships and applying the knowledge
gained toward maximizing the strength, ductility and fatigue properties of
titanium alloys at substantially lower cost, a major step will be taken toward
realizing the full benefit of titanium for industry and society.
