9707489 Galloway This RPG proposal requests funds for assisting the PI to
diversify her interests towards thin film synthesis and analysis of
scientifically challenging and technologically important microelectronic
materials. She will investigate TiN films with respect to potential applications
in microelectronics. TiN film growth by Dual Ion Beam Sputtering(DIBS) will be
used to integrate TiN as a diffusion barrier and conductive layer with other
materials. The project will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at
Lucent Technologies. %%% The project addresses materials science and engineering
research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological
relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a
fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and
integrated circuits. Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding
gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance
of advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for
designing and producing improved materials. ***
