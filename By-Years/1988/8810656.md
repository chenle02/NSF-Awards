The work is in the fields of both elementary particle physics, (EPP) and
astrophysics (AP), and the intersection of both fields as well. The EPP work
measures the elastic scattering and total cross sections for proton-antiproton
interactions at 2 TeV at the Fermilab Collider (the highest energy accelerator
in the world). There are two cosmic ray projects, one at Los Alamos which
searches for point sources of cosmic rays with energies greater than 30 TeV and
one project to study neutrino astronomy. The EPP field studies the basic
building blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, and weak bosons)
at very high energies. The experiments use accelerators (colliders) which
provide the highest energy particles made in the laboratory. The data is
collected and analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and
techniques. The AP field studies the origins and structure of the universe by
measuring radiation impinging on the earth from outer space. The measurement of
this radiation gives information about AP and EPP.
