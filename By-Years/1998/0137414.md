Staff at the University of Wisconsin are developing the next version of the
middle school instructional program, "Mathematics in Context." Materials are
also developed for teachers, administrators and parents. The work is done is in
collaboration with the Freudenthal Institute at the University of Utrecht, the
Netherlands and the Encyclopedia Britannica. Some units will receive only minor
changes and corrections and others will be completely revised. Among the more
significant changes are: streamlining the fifth-grade units to facilitate the
transition from elementary school reform materials; reducing the number of units
at each grade level to facilitate more complete coverage; and the development of
technology-based project units that could be used by groups of students outside
regular class time. The revisions are based on reviews by experts and the
experience of use in classrooms.
