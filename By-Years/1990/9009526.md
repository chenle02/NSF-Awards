Plants are used as the source of many useful compounds and mixtures including
pharmaceuticals, flavors and fragrances, essential oils, enzymes, and pigments.
Large markets exist for these secondary plant metabolites which are normally
obtained by extraction from intact plants. Plant tissue culture (PTC) may
provide an alternative to whole plants as biological sources of these useful
compounds. PTC is a technique which allows plant cells to be grown in solid or
liquid medium in the laboratory under carefully controlled environmental
conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a model system for studying
the potential of strawberry cells grown in culture to produce flavors and
pigments of interest to the food processing industry as natural food
ingredients. The investigations will include the production of the
anticarcinogenic compound, ellagic acid, by strawberry cell suspension cultures.
Factors that influence the kinetics of growth and secondary metabolite
production of strawberry cells will be systematically studied using suspension
cultures propagated in roller bottle and low- shear cell culture bioreactors.
Information obtained in this study will be applicable to other plant cell
culture systems.
