The purpose in gathering the Workshop/Seminar on "Wind Engineering: The past to
the Future" is to review the state of the fluid modeling concepts applied to
wind engineering, and to identify and prioritize the research problems specific
to this area that is of more importance to industry and government. During the
lectures and discussions the current status of practice and methodologies will
be critically assessed. The participants will pay particular attention to the
future directions open to wind engineering and its potential for solving
problems in building design transport of hazardous materials, and energy
production. The meeting will be hosted by the Fluid Dynamics and Wind
Engineering Program Department of Civil Engineering, Colorado State University.
Graduates from this program now operating in universities, industry and
government in the U.S. and abroad, as well as world renowned specialists will
participate. The P.I. is highly qualified to carry out this task. In
consequence, an award is recommended.
