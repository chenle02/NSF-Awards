This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. David Wing,
presently a post-doc at the Max-Planck Institut fur Zuchtungsforschung, to
conduct collaborative research for nine months with Dr. Akira Kato of the
National Institute of Agrobiological Resources in Tsukuba, Japan. They will
investigate the response to heat shock at the cellular level in rice plants,
with the ultimate goal of using genetic engineering to increase the resistance
of such plants to the stress of such shock. Heat shock response, which exists to
protect all living organisms, is characterized by the generation of special heat
shock proteins upon stimulus from special heat shock genes. In this work, an
attempt will be made to determine which cells in the rice plant are protected by
these genes, and which are sensitive to heat stress. A special "reporter" gene
which can be induced by heat stress will be introduced into the rice plants to
localize the heat stress genes. Dr. Kato is an expert on the generation to
transformed rice plants, and will help to produce the specially marked rice
plants. Dr. Wing has also previously performed extensive related work on the
genetic expression of chalcone synthase in tabacco, in collaboration with Dr.
Kato.
