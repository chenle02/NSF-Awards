This proposal provides for the establishment of a partnership program between
Rice University and the Houston Independent School District (HISD) together with
businesses and industry to enhance the scientific skills of teachers at the
middle school level. The program calls for the establishment of Resident
Teachers positions to be filled by qualified HISD candidates. These teachers
will be involved in enrichment programs that will provide them with exposure to
modern scientific and technical materials and knowledge, businesses and industry
applications, and up-to-date educational theory. Three hundred middle school
teachers will participate in this teacher enhancement program. Cost sharing is
equivalent to 120% of the NSF award.
