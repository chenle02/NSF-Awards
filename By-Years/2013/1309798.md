Superparticles are nanoparticle assemblies in the form of colloidal particles.
They exhibit physical and chemical properties inherited from their nanoparticle
constituents as well as the collective properties of these constituents induced
from coupling effects. Under the support of the Solid State and Materials
Chemistry Program at NSF, Prof. Cao and his research group aim to: (1) develop
size-controlled synthesis of colloidal superparticles, (2) explore the
principles that govern the constituent-packing and surface morphology of
colloidal superparticles, and (3) investigate the formation of colloidal
superparticles from binary nanoparticle constituents.

The goal of this project is to develop synthetic methodology for making
monodispersed colloidal superparticles potentially useful for new manufacturing
technology for next generation industries. The research effort is integrated
with educational activities for training graduate and undergraduate students in
multidisciplinary nanoscience and nanotechnology research areas. This project
also includes outreach activities to promote the interests of high school
students in science.
