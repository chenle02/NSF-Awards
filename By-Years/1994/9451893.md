9451893 Beatty This project is designed for teaching introductory biology to
both majors and non-majors in a large course setting. The new course with
laboratory is also expected to become the institution's largest-enrollment
introductory biology course. Central topics are genetics, evolutionary biology,
ecology, and the process of scientific inquiry. Laboratories for the course are
designed to use the educational strategies of "conceptual change" teaching and
"collaborative group" learning. We also combine computer simulation exercises
with experiments involving plants and animals with rapid life-cycles in one
laboratory period. Computer stations are established in four laboratories, and
the stations are designed for students to work in pairs. In addition, one TA
computing station is used to introduce and train students in software. Concepts
and processes with graphics and animations can also be illustrated.
