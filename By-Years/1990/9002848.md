This project will develop analytical and numerical studies directed at hybrid
computational schemes that use Lagrangian augmentation technology to treat
problems with intricate constraints implicitly, and gradient projection methods
to handle simpler constraints explicitly. These studies are motivated by
questions in optimal control where there is the need to solve large systems of
equations subject to contraints with special mathematical structures. Optimal
control problems arise naturally in engineering and natural sciences.
