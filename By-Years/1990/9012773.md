Agarwal The goal of the Alewife experiment is to demonstrate that a parallel
computer system can be made both scalable and easily programmable. To achieve
this end, a scalable parallel computer system called Alewife is being designed,
built and evaluated as the experimental vehicle for this project. The system is
a mesh- connected set of processor nodes, each consisting of a slightly modified
SPARC processor, called SPARCLE, some main memory and cache, a Caltech route
chip, and a custom memory management circuit, all on a custom PC board.
