This project supports research on two topics that relate to the effects of
processing flows on the properties of complex fluids. The first concerns the
mechanisms and conditions for breakup of viscous or viscoelastic drops in shear
flows, and thus addresses one of the basic mechanisms by which one fluid is
dispersed in another during mixing or blending processes. The second examines
the velocity and concentration distributions that occur due to shear-induces
particle migration effects in concentrated suspensions. In both cases, the
proposed research will be primarily experimental. The technological significance
of the investigation is related primarily to the development of a basis for
predicting the changes that occur in suspension-like complex fluids during
processing, and thus how processing flows may be used to modify or control bulk
properties of materials that are produced from such fluids.//
