This grant is for the partial support of an international (IUTAM) symposium on
nonlinear waves in solids to be held during August 15-20, 1993 at University of
Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The proposed symposium will allow
the presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the area of nonlinear
waves in solids to the leading workers in this field from academe, government
laboratories and industry. In particular, the symposium will feature
presentation concerning the theory of nonlinear wave propagation in porous media
and in solids with microstructure; interaction of elastic waves with thermal and
electromagnetic fields; and numerical methods.
