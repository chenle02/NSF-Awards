A vision machine must support a wide range of complex operations on massive
amounts of time-varying image data, and execute all of the operations at high
speeds. The goal of this research is to design, implement, and evaluate dynamic,
cooperative, parallel vision algorithms which execute simultaneously on two
tightly-coupled multiprocessors: a linearly-connected, 8-processor Aspex PIPE,
and a 10-processor, shared-memory Sequent Balance. This two-level organization
corresponds to the two kinds of processing required in computer vision. In the
first, low-level vision algorithms will be developed for the PIPE, detecting
primitive "tokens" in a video-rate sequence of images. The second, high-level
vision, requires more symbolic and geometric processing (e.g., in model-based
object recognition), and will be developed for the Sequent. Research activities
will include the development of methods for coordinating multiple levels of
image analysis on the two machines, dynamic load- balancing techniques for high-
level vision on the shared-memory multiprocessor, and parallel algorithms for
multiresolution image analysis and model-based recognition. //
