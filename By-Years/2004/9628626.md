LEIMKUHLER DMS-9628626 The Department of Mathematics at the University of Kansas
will purchase a multiprocessor and several workstations dedicated to the support
of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for several
research projects in dynamical systems and numerical analysis, in particular:
(1) Adaptive Geometric Integrators for Molecular Simulations and Rigid Body
Dynamics; (2) Methods for Large Matrix Eigenvalue Computations; (3) Moving Mesh
Methods for Time-Dependent Partial Differential Equations in Two and Three
Dimensions; (4) Studies in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: and (5) Geometric
Visualization and Biological Time Series Analysis.
