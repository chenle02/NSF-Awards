9321899 Rabalais This research project, which is focussed on the development of
a new method for the structural analysis of solid surfaces, is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. Scattering and Recoiling Imaging
Spectrometry (SARIS) will be developed as a method for providing structural
information about solid surfaces on a time scale consistent with some important
dynamic processes. This method is based on the shadow cone techniques previously
developed in the Rabalais laboratory, and the primary goal of the research
project is the design and construction of an instrument which can be used for
SARIS studies. The technique will then be applied to a number of important thin
film growth and surface reaction processes, with impact on the understanding of
electronic materials chemistry. %%% The ability to obtain surface structural
information on a time scale compatible with electronic device growth and
processing is a crucial ability for the semiconductor industry. The results of
this research project will enable the development of analytical instrumenation
and methodology which will address this need. ***
