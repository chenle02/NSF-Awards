How birds navigate during long-distance migrations remains mysterious, but
there is behavioral evidence to suggest that some birds detect the earth's
magnetic field. There is controversy about whether such magnetic detection
requires a magnetic material such as the mineral magnetite. This mechanism would
be an exciting new discovery if true, but because of conflicting results, a
rigorous set of tests still is needed to establish its validity. One property of
magnetite is that it can be re-magnetized, and this project use the novel
approach of applying a remagnetizing pulse to migratory birds, and then
measuring their nightly behavior of preferred headings in a planetarium. The
presence or lack of short-term or long- term effects from different conditions
of remagnetization will be examined. This approach creates a set of critical
tests to reject or accept whether behavioral magnetic field detection depends on
magnetic particles. Results from this novel approach will have an impact on this
controversial and interesting field, and this project also has a significant
impact on undergraduate scientific experience.
