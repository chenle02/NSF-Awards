This grant permits Drs. Sanders and Whittington to continue archaeological
research at the site of Copan. Located in Honduras, this large site documents
the rise of Mayan culture. It was also occupied during the "classic period" when
monumental construction reached its peak and during the following interval which
saw the "collapse" of Mayan society. Building on work by other teams, Dr.
Sanders led a multidisciplinary field project there from December 1980 until the
present. Copan developed with an urban "core" which housed high status
individuals, surrounded by a rural area with smaller homesteads. Within this
outlying region, however, a few larger elite residences are also located. These
tend to occur in paired sites which differ in configuration. Although some work
has been done in these rural elite compounds their functions are not well
understood. Drs. Sanders and Whittington will excavate two such centers.
Artifacts such as pottery should provide insight into site function. Recovered
burials will yield data on health, nutrition, and demography of residents and
obsidian, which can be dated by a hydration technique, will allow for more
precise dating. Archaeologists still do not understand how the Mayan empire
arose, was maintained, and then collapsed in such a relatively short period of
time, and this research will help to answer this question. It will also increase
our knowledge about this very important site. Archaeological data, because they
cover such long spans of time and because of the direct environmental
information they provide, are well suited to answering such questions of culture
process.
