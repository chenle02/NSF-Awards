The project involves investigations of two components of the plant nuclear
envelope. One is the fucose containing glycoconjugates and the other is the
fibrous lamina underlying the nuclear membrane. These components will be
characterized using ultrastructural and biochemical techniques. The project
should yield important basic information in plant cell biology and prove useful
in designing more effective methods for plant generic transformation.
