The Division of Chemistry supports Albert DePrince of the Georgia Institute of
Technology as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. DePrince will
work on developing new ab initio computational chemistry methods and software to
work on newer computer architecture, taking advantage of the computing power of
graphical processing units (GPU). The resulting software will be incorporated in
open access software. The PI will collaborate with scientists at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory to implement his work on the next-generation super computers
(the Keeneland and Titan systems) that will be housed there. The ultimate goal
of this research is to develop improved methods for computational chemistry. For
his plan for broadening participation, Dr. DePrince will develop
IntercalationDiscovery@home to allow the public to engage in computational
chemistry experiments to help screen potential anti-cancer drugs. In addition,
DePrince will develop computational chemistry lab experiments for use by high-
school chemistry students to illustrate chemistry concepts (e.g. VSEPR theory).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. DePrince is aimed at developing
new methods for the computation of chemical and physical properties of matter.
Work like this enables scientists to do experiments "in silico" to help guide
scientific research. The project that Dr. DePrince is working on will be
disseminated through a widely-used open-access software package, as well as
being incorporated into the software of next-generation supercomputers that will
be housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory - a Department of Energy laboratory.
The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. DePrince are aimed
at giving a broad population of students and the public exposure to an emerging
area of the chemical sciences.
