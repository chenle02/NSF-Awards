9301107 Hanson High performance computing is essential for managing massive
computational and memory demands in optimal control of large scale applications,
such as aerospace, structures, resources, economics and robotics. Implementation
of advanced computational techniques, such as parellelization, matrization
(including vectorization), graphical visualization and problem mapping make
possible the solution of larger dimensional problems. Our research objective is
to develop fast algorithms for the optimal feedback control of general
continuous time nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. These systems include
perturbations by both Gaussian and distributed Poisson white noise. Advanced
computational treatment of these systems, especially with Poisson noise, is a
particularly unique feature of this proposal. The algorithms are being testing
on multi-state resource models, but are applicable to a wide variety of
applications. The numerical approach directly treats the partial differential
equation of stochastic programming. New algorithms, such as finite element, will
be developed to alleviate both memory and computationally intensive demands from
the "curse of dimensionality". Purely parallel methods are being developed for
scalable, massively parallel and massive memory supercomputers, including new
generation "ultracomputers". The development of graphical visualization tools is
also essential for analyzing massive amounts of output in many dimensions. There
are also several related problems as well. ***
