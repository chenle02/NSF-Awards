The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to
commercialize smart compression garments for enhancing performance gains during
fitness, athletic training, and rehabilitation. The products to be
commercialized are intended to address important needs in health and training
that may be of interest to many fitness enthusiasts, amateur or professional
athletes, and individuals recovering from physical challenges. This could
include millions of individuals in the United States. The potential benefits for
society and the economy are commensurately high. In the long term, this project
may hold benefits for a large number of individuals that personally or
professionally engage in physically demanding activities in the workplace, or
that require physical assistance for activities of daily living. The underlying
technology holds the potential to enable applications in healthcare and
assistive and rehabilitative devices that could improve quality of
life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of a
fabric technology that consists of a soft, muscle-like robotic fabric, that uses
an actuated composite polymer textile. These actuated textiles consist of
composite fabric structures that integrate an elastic-hydraulic transmission.
Previous research revealed that the textiles are capable of supplying large,
dynamic forces or displacements via soft fabrics that may be fashioned into
wearable garments, which may be fabricated using facile textile manufacturing
methods. This technology holds the potential to enable a wide variety of
wearable garments with applications in fitness, healthcare, and many other
areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
