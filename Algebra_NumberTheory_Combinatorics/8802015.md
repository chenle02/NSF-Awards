In this research Speiser will study projective plane curves, their duals, and
some natural spaces which parametrize them. Enumerative problems, a conjecture
of Tyrell about degenerations of nonsingular cubics, and general questions about
transversality in arbitrary characteristic seem closely interconnected and this
will be examined. A related problem about the existence of plane curves with
given numerical characters will be considered, also. Recent progress on related
questions by the principal investigator and his collaborators and others suggest
attractive lines of attack for these problems.
