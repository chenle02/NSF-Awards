This award will provide support to a group from Johns Hopkins University, who
is participating in an experiment in high energy physics with the L3 detector at
LEP, CERN Switzerland, the new 27 kilometer electron positron collider. The aim
of the experiment is the study of the properties of the Zo particle, the neutral
carrier of the weak nuclear force, involving the decay of Zo into hadrons, and a
precise determination of the number of neutrino species. It will also search for
new particles. The primary focus of the L3 detector is its ability to achieve
mass measurements to better than 1% for the leptons. An important part of the
muon detection system is the Time Expansion Chamber (TEC) a device with strict
resolution requirements. The Johns Hopkins group is responsible of the readout
and software of the calibration system of TEC, which is to provide 0.1%
calibration for the drift velocity during normal data taking runs, an essential
feature for some of the physics to be achieved by the L3 detector.
