Intellectual merit. When proteins are tagged with reporter labels to trace the
locations and movements of the proteins on or within cells, the physical size of
the label can be quite significant. This is especially true for the popular
class of labels called quantum dots (qdots), which are inorganic crystals with
intense fluorescence. The core of a qdot is fairly small, 2-4 nm, but is
completely insoluble. To make them soluble in water-based buffers requires a
hydrophobic-hydrophilic ligand shell. Commercially-available qdots are typically
21 nm in diameter. The research will make a ligand-shield that is only about 2
nm thick. The shield will have a sulfur atom that binds the qdot-core very
tightly. This sulfur will either be a thiol, a thioether, or a thioketone. This
sulfur will also have a polyethylene glycol, making the entity water soluble. It
may have a negative or positive charge to reduce non-specific sticking. Finally,
it will have a bioreactive entity for coupling.

Broader Impacts. Quantum dots have tremendous potential as incredibly bright
fluorophores for labeling proteins. However, their large size has limited their
usefulness as biological tracers. The research presented here intends to
overcome this limitation by providing to the research community methods to make
a new class of water-soluble quantum dots that are significantly smaller than
those currently commercially available. The research provides excellent training
for synthetic chemists and graduate students who are interested in basic optics,
microscopy, and spectroscopy.
