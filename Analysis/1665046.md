This mathematical research project deals with probabilistic properties (or
stochasticity) in deterministic systems. Many deterministic systems exhibit
random behavior due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The goal of
the present project is to develop methods of predicting the behavior of such
systems using a statistical approach. Particular attention will be paid to
describing the dynamics on short spatial and long temporal scales. The methods
developed during this project will have applications to several fields,
including probability theory, number theory, and statistical physics. The
investigator also will continue his synergistic activities including organizing
conferences, giving lectures and minicourses on recent advances in dynamics,
writing survey papers, and mentoring graduate students.

The investigator will work on limit theorems for dynamical systems. The main
directions of research will concern (1) local limit theorems and related
asymptotic expansions and (2) limit theorems for toral translations and other
zero entropy systems. The methods will be drawn from dynamical systems and
probability theory. In particular the investigations will rely on a spectral
approach and renormalization techniques. The connection between the two parts of
the project is that the limit theorems for renormalization dynamics developed in
the first part of this project will play important role in the second part.
