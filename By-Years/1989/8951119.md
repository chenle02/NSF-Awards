Geography students should recognize that the accuracy of their maps depends on
the spatial characteristics of data. The computer mapping software and the
computer hardware being installed allows students to critique data manipulation
decisions. With specific software, students can efficiently tackle questions
they cannot ask or do not have time to ask under our current manual map-making
procedures. Students can evaluate a variety of data generalization decisions
(e.g., different categorization and scales for choropleth maps, different point
sampling numbers and arrangements for isoline maps, and different raster cell
resolutions in geographic information systems.) Geography courses at several
levels use the equipment: for individual projects in introductory and advanced
cartography courses, for small-group projects in introductory human geography
and teacher-training institutes, and for individual projects in advanced
seminars. Computerized mapping enables students to examine critically data
generalization decisions that result in maps. The institution is matching the
NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
