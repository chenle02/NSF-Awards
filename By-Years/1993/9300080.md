This grant provides funds to hold the third RIDGE Theoretical Institute in the
summer of 1993 to investigate "The physical, chemical, biological and geological
interactions within the seafloor hydrothermal systems." The institute will
consist of a four-day short cruise and a half-day field trip, followed by a
three-day workshop.
