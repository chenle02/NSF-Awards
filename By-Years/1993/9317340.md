&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9317340 Grimm &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This proposal is
submitted under a special pilot program, Undergraduate Mentorships in
Environmental Biology. The four year program will offer undergraduate students
first hand experience in carrying out ecological research under the mentorships
of six active research ecologists. We will aggressively seek to involve groups
traditionally under represented in environmental biology, includi ng trainees of
Latino, American Indian, and African American backgrounds as well as a number of
non minority students. This effort will be aided considerably by close
coordination with existing programs that target these minority groups at ASU.
The program is a specialized educational track consisting of an integrative
first year seminar, early exposure to advanced courses, research involvement at
the outset of students' college careers, and continued follow up and support of
individual students as they make plans for graduate school and future careers.
Careful documentation of the program's successes and failures, support from
other research experience programs targeting more advanced undergraduate
students, and placement of students in individual laboratories will facilitate
the entry of alumni and alumnae of this program into research careers in
environmental biology.&lt;br/&gt;
