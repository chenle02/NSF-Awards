This proposal seeks support for the invited speakers, graduate students, and
junior faculty members to attend the International Workshop on Information
Processing and Sensor Networks meeting. IPSN'03 provides a forum for presenting
the latest advances in information processing techniques and applications for
sensor networks and for discussing the practical challenges encountered and the
solutions adopted. A special mission of IPSN'03 is to foster discussion of
cross-layer issues in signal processing, networking, database and information
management, and circuits and systems communities.

Sensor networking and distributed signal processing is a very important area in
emerging technology space. It poses challenging problems in both networking
technology and applications domain. The meeting is also very timely as NSF is
launching a cross-directorate initiative in sensors and sensor networking.
