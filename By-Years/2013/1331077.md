Joel Kuipers of George Washington University proposes to explore the
relationship between the usage of Arabic as a sacred speech register and
emerging forms of religious identity. The project will test key hypotheses about
how gender, education, urbanization, and rapid mediatization affect
participation in Islam. The research will take place in Indonesia, the world's
largest Muslim country. The role of classical Arabic (fussha) in everyday life
has dramatically expanded in the last 30 years, evidenced in personal names,
greetings, Qur'anic verses and other pious expressions in everyday life. At the
same time, old patterns of piety are changing, reflected not only in new
political alignments, but new ways of expressing faith, ways that are seldom
examined by scholars. By focusing on the largest ethnic group in Indonesia - the
Javanese - the research examines specifically the role of the Arabic language in
the emerging realignment of pious identities in everyday life. Drawing on
advanced methods in linguistic anthropology, the proposed study will collect and
examine detailed transcriptions of recordings of everyday interactions,
classrooms, prayer houses, popular films, radio talk shows, and a variety of
other contexts in which pious subjectivities are displayed and evaluated. The
results will not only demonstrate rigorous new linguistic methodologies for
investigating religious subjectivity, but also provide substantive and
comparative insights into patterns of piety in the world's fourth largest
country. The project makes strong contributions to international collaboration
among scientists through its affiliation with an Indonesian research team at
Gadja Mada University. The project also supports the training of undergraduate
and graduate students in anthropology.
