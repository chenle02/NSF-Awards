This award will partially fund the acquisition of a new electron microprobe for
the Electron Microprobe Facility in the Department of Chemistry &amp;
Biochemistry at ASU, replacing our 24-year-old JEOL 8600. The new microprobe
will provide a significant increase in our ability to chemically characterize
microscopic samples, facilitating ongoing NSF and NASA-funded projects in fields
such as geology, meteoritics, archaeology, material science, and biology. The
new microprobe, with its increased capabilities, will also open up opportunities
for novel research directions that are currently inaccessible with the current
machine. The Electron Microprobe Facility has been a successful multi-
disciplinary analytical facility at ASU for over 40 years, and has a history of
strong commitment to undergraduate and graduate student training in micro-
analytical techniques. This acquisition will provide broad but critical support
for research programs institution-wide, as well as supporting important student
training on state-of-the-art analytical equipment used by many commercial
industries.
