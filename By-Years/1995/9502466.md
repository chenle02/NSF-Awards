ABSTRACT CTS-9502466 Colorado School of Mines John R. Dorgan Research activities
focus on the development of novel hybrid polymer systems for the manufacture of
advanced materials. Three research projects are pursued, the first pursues the
development of fundamental theory useful as an aide to processing liquid
crystalline polymers into molecular composites and high tenacity fibers. The
second research project studies new chemistries for the production of polymeric
monolayers on inorganic surfaces and involves the use of Monte Carlo simulation
techniques to understand such systems. The third research area involves the
design and characterization of polymeric binding systems useful in new
manufacturing process for advanced ceramics. Innovative teaching methods are
described which allow the PI to serve as an effective instructor in the
classroom. Plans include the integration of computers and laboratory exercises
into the curriculum. Additionally, the development of teaching methods which
allow different types of learners to be successful students are pursued. The
educational infrastructure of the Colorado School of Mines is greatly improved
by having the interdisciplinary field of Polymer Science and Engineering
represented on campus.
