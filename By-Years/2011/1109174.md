This project will support a theoretical investigation into thermonuclear
explosions on white dwarfs that are experiencing mass transfer from a nearby
companion. This transfer of combustible fuel gives rise to explosive phenomena
that is easily detectable in distant galaxies by the current and future optical
surveys. Using the latest computational tools and techniques, this group will
study outcomes from the transfer of helium onto white dwarfs and investigate the
effects of gravity and acoustic waves on the creation and propagation of
explosions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;White dwarfs are the dominant product of
stellar evolution, forming at the rate of about one per year in a typical
galaxy, but it requires special circumstances for two of them to end their lives
in a binary with a short orbital period and the details of the explosion are not
well understood. The project is expected to have many implications for the study
of stellar populations, stellar evolution, and cosmology, particularly in the
upcoming era of massive surveys to detect gravity waves, short-period binaries,
and peculiar supernovae. Computational techniques from this project will be made
freely available to the astrophysical community, and this group will continue
ongoing efforts in science education and research training.
