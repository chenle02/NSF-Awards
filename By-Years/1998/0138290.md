Recognizing the important role the African easterly waves (AEWs) play in
forecasts ranging from daily to seasonal, this project seeks to understand the
evolution of AEWs and their interactions with convection. The first part of the
research is to obtain the statistical relationships in these interactions at
various phases in the life cycle of AEWs and to investigate the physical
processes involved in them using the ECMWF analyses, satellite data, radiosonde
data and raingauge data. The study will then be enhanced through a case-study
approach following the evolution of individual AEWs and their interactions with
convection. The third part, albeit at a lower priority, is to investigate the
intra-seasonal to inter-annual variability of the relationships that exist
between the AEWs, the African easterly jets, and tropical convection. An
important goal is to understand and gain knowledge of the precursors of Atlantic
tropical cyclones through the interactions of the AEWs and tropical convection.
If a conceptual model can be developed for the preconditioning for tropical
cyclogenesis, it would be very valuable for the prediction community.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is actively involved in planning the international
Western African Monsoon (WAM) experiment to be held in 2004/2005. The research
from this grant will contribute to the planning of the WAM field experiment.
