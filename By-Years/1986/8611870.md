Measurement of the normal displacement of a three-dimensional body subjected to
arbitrary loading or boundary displacements has been a major problem for
experimentalists for the past century. Elaborate optical methods including
holography and speckle interferometry are only applicable to the two dimensional
problem where the specimen surface is plane. Recently, improvements in video
cameras and computers (storage capacity) have led to significant advances in
image analysis which can be effectively employed to record displacements. The
approach is to record and store in pixel form the surface features of the
specimen in its deformed and undeformed state. Intensity interpolation methods
are then employed to identify small subsets on the specimen and to determine the
displacement of these subsets. The method has been established for two-
dimensional bodies undergoing plane deformation. The proposed program will
extend these methods to three- dimensional specimens by utilizing two video
cameras and stereo imaging procedures to obtain the images required for
displacement determinations. Advanced methods of image correlation methods will
be employed to achieve sub-pixel accuracy in the displacement measurements.
