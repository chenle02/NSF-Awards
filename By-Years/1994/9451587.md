9451587 Strawil This project for chemistry laboratory curriculum improvement is
designed to bring more modern laboratory methods and advance chemical concepts
to freshman and sophomore science students at the College of the Sequoias. To
accomplish this objective, the college will purchase a Fourier Transform Infra-
Red Spectrophotometer (FTIR) for use with microscale laboratory techniques in
the sophomore organic laboratory. The FTIR will allow expansion of spectroscopic
analysis in the organic laboratory and to complete conversion to microscale
methods and allow increased information about the identity and purity of the
small quantities of materials generated by these techniques. It will also allow
the introduction of modern spectrographic techniques into the freshmen chemistry
courses.
