This proposal will address questions in the theory of interacting particle
systems and stochastic spatial processes. These stochastic processes are models
for large systems with many interacting ``components'' (cells, individuals,
particles, plants, etc.). Some examples of the phenomena these systems model
are: competition of species, epidemics, population growth, evolution of genetic
traits. A principal goal of research in this area is to understand how the
macroscopic behavior of large systems depends on the individual interactions
between components. Two competition models will be studied, a spatial stochastic
Lotka-Volterra model and a multitype contact process. For the Lotka-Volterra
model, the objectives are to determine the parameter regions which correspond to
survival of one species and coexistence of both species. The project is part of
the investigator's ongoing efforts to understand and exploit the scaling
relationship between interacting particle systems and measure-valued diffusions.
For the multitype contact process, the questions of interest concern survival
versus extinction on regular trees. The investigator expects to find new phase
dependent survival and extinction phenomena that do not exist in the lattice
case. A second general area of this proposal addresses problems motivated by
population genetics. The evolution of genetic traits in geographically
structured populations is often modeled with Kimura's stepping stone model,
where questions about measures of kinship are reformulated in terms of questions
about the behavior of coalescing random walk systems. The investigator's
previous research includes work on limit theorems for these systems on large,
two-dimensional lattice sets with torus or wrap-around boundary conditions. The
goal here is to show robustness of these theorems over a wide range of boundary
conditions, justifying their use in population genetics.

This proposal involves research in the theory of interacting particle systems
and stochastic spatial processes. These stochastic processes are models for
large systems with many interacting components (cells, individuals, particles,
plants, etc.). The goal of this research is to obtain a better qualitative
understanding of various complex phenomena that interacting particles systems
model well, such as models of: competition of species, epidemics, population
growth, evolution of genetic traits. A principal goal of research in this area
is to understand how the macroscopic behavior of large systems depends on the
individual interactions between components. Several specific models will be
studied, including a stochastic spatial version of a well known model for
competition between species. In addition to work on specific models, the
investigator will try to extend the validity of some approximation theorems
established for some specific models to handle more general ones, thus
justifying their use in applications.
