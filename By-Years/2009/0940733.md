The Institute for Advanced Study/Park City Mathematics Institute

(PCMI) is a 3-week-long summer mathematics institute, which began over 20 years
ago as an NSF-funded Regional Geometry Institute. Each PCMI summer program is
organized around a single topic of contemporary mathematical research, which
varies from year to year. PCMI's summer programs are of very high quality and
are unique in integrating undergraduate mathematics studies, graduate
mathematics studies and mathematics research activities through coordinated,
concurrent programs. PCMI also has parallel programs for undergraduate faculty
and secondary school teachers, whose participants benefit from their proximity
to students and researchers. The undergraduate faculty participants develop
educational materials related to the research topic for inclusion in
undergraduate courses.

PCMI has many positive and profound effects on the mathematics community. The
undergraduate and graduate summer programs, through the quality of their lecture
series and their close relation with a cutting-edge research topic, create
excitement among the students and are effective at recruiting students into the
mathematics discipline. The unique integration of students, educators and
researchers results in many positive interactions, which include collaborations
between students and researchers. To ensure that PCMI's lecture series have
enduring impact, the graduate student summer school lectures are published by
the American Mathematical Society.
