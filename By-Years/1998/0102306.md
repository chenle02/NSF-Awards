The funding is for the workshop "Pathways to the Future", to be held August
10-11, 2002, in New York, NY. The workshop provides a venue for approximately 20
young female researchers in probability and statistics to interact with each
other and with approximately 5 invited established researchers. The young
researchers must have received their Ph.D. within the five years prior to the
workshop, and will give a short presentation of their research. All participants
must also have the intention to attend the Joint Statistical Meetings that will
be held August 11-15, 2002, in New York, NY.
