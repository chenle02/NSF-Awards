The Department of Statistical Science at Southern Methodist University will
purchase a departmental file server, a graphics workstation and related UNIX
equipment which will be dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical
sciences. The equipment will be used for several research projects, including
construction and analysis of phylogenies based on DNA sequence data, statistical
analysis of data related to global temperature variation, geometrical approaches
to ranked data, and bandwidth selection in nonparametric function estimation.
