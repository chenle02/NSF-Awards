This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We increasingly rely on MAD Services,
systems that span Multiple Administrative Domains. Examples include cloud
computing, peer-to-peer streaming, Internet routing, and wireless mesh routing.
Unfortunately, when different parties control a system's nodes, the nodes may
undermine the desired service either by malfunctioning or by selfishly
maximizing their own benefits to the detriment of the broader system (e.g., a
tragedy of the commons.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central thesis of this
research is that any approach to building robust MAD services must account for
both selfish behaviors and Byzantine malfunctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research therefore brings together ideas from game theory and Byzantine fault
tolerance to (1) develop the new theoretical framework for MAD distributed
systems; (2) design techniques that rigorously address key practical issues in
building MAD systems, such as heterogeneity, locality, and node churn; and (3)
construct significant prototypes of dependable MAD systems that tolerate selfish
and Byzantine behaviors and whose costs and performance are comparable to less
robust systems deployed today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work seeks to have
broader societal impact in at least two dimensions. First, it will develop the
theory and practice of MAD systems at a time when crucial personal, business,
and societal needs are increasingly met by MAD services. Second, we expect a
significant educational impact from this work, as graduate and undergraduate
students will participate in a research plan that will enhance skills in both
practice and theory.
