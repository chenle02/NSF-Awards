This award funds a Research Fellowship in Plant Biology for two years. The
project is entitled "Biosynthesis of Phycobilisomes in Marine Red Algae and the
Isolation and Characterization of Nuclear Genes Encoding Phycobilisome
Polypeptides". The Research Fellowships in Plant Biology are granted to
applicants trained in traditional areas of plant biology who wish to extend
their training in new techniques and to those trainedin molecular or cellular
techniques who wish to gain experience working with plants. These fellowships
are designed to increase the number of outstanding young scientists in plant
biology.
