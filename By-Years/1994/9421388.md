9421388 Laurence Abbott The nervous system uses electrical spike trains to
transport information that is converted into actions at the synapses between
motor neurons and muscles. A wide variety of different patterns of the neuronal
spike trains arrive at the neuromuscular junction and are converted by the
muscle into an equally wide range of muscle contractions. These investigators
would like to understand this transduction process and determine what effect
changes in the output of the motor neuron have on the muscle response. To do
this they will construct a mathematical formalism that allows them to predict
the response of the muscle to any spike train. The prediction will be made by
linear integration kernels and mathematical neural networks using learning rules
that improve the performance of the system over time while a variety of spike
trains are delivered to the muscle. The resulting network will then be able to
predict the effect of novel spike trains. In addition, the form of the model
will provide important information about the biophysical processes underlying
the synaptic transduction. The techniques that will be developed can then be
applied to synapses between neurons within the nervous system as well as those
between neurons and muscles. This work will have an important impact on our
understanding of how the brain processes stimuli from the environment and
converts them into a resultant behavior.
