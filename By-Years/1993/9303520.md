9303520 Davies This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research collaboration
between Professor Frederick Davies of Texas A&amp;M University and Professor V.
Olalde Portugal of the Biotechnology Institute (CIVESTAV) at Irapuato, and
Professors H. Escamilla and H. Chirinos of the Monterrey Institute of Technology
(ITESM) in Mexico. The researchers intend to collect and screen Mexican
mycorrhizal isolates for enhanced drought resistance of pepper plants, and
determine how drought resistance mechanisms in the pepper-mycorrhizal fungi
symbiosis differ among selected mycorrhizal isolates. Scientists at the
Biotechnology Institute in Irapuato and at ITESM have been collecting beneficial
mycorrhizal fungi from arid sites in Mexico that have potential promise for
increasing plant drought resistance. The U.S. investigator has shown that
mycorrhizal fungi will enhance drought resistance of pepper plants. Their
collaboration should increase our understanding of the mechanisms of drought
resistance and allow the development of superior strains of fungi that enhance
water relations and yield of pepper plants under reduced irrigation regimes. ***
