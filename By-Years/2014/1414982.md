Bacterial contamination affects industrial processes, food processing equipment,
biomaterials, and other biomedical contamination. The ability to control
bacterial adhesion on surfaces and to kill harmful bacteria requires that new
methodologies are developed. Over the last decades, the resistance of pathogenic
bacteria to antimicrobial agents has become a major challenge. A novel approach
would be to use a new class of nano-antibiotics, which can kill bacteria without
promoting antimicrobial resistance. The goal of this project is to study how
silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be exploited as
antibacterial agents. Among different metals, silver is known for its
antibacterial and growth inhibitory effects. Gold does not show any bactericidal
effect in bulk amount. However at the nanoscale, gold NPs in a certain size
range have some unique properties that make them good candidates for killing
bacteria through pore formation in bacterial membranes. A great benefit of this
research is that since AgNPs and AuNPs kill bacteria through membrane-associated
processes, there is a low likelihood of bacteria being able to develop a
resistance to their actions. This project will be conducted under supervision of
Dr. Jonghoon Choi, a noted expert on nano-biotechnology, at Hanyang University
in Korea.

In this project the antimicrobial effect of gold and silver nanoparticles (NPs)
on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) will be
characterized. NP solutions of varying sizes and concentrations will be
prepared. Morphology and size of NPs will be characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and light scattering. Electrostatic charge of NPs will
be characterized via zeta potential measurements. Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) of NPs on E. coli and S. aureus will be determined by using
plate counting and growth rate experiments. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in
collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.
