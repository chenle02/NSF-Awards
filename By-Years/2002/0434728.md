This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
Informatics for FY 2005. The fellowship supports research and training at the
postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Exploring the
relationship between landscape variation and genetic diversity in eastern North
American woodland salamanders." This research investigates geographic patterns
of genetic variation and species diversity in woodland salamanders of the genus
Plethodon. It integrates natural-history collection, population-genetic, and
environmental data from hundreds of populations using geographic information
systems (GIS), and explores the extent to which landscape ecology has influenced
spatial patterns of genetic divergence and speciation in the group. The research
builds upon the Fellow's graduate training in molecular phylogenetics and also
permits him to gain new analytical skills in spatial ecological analyses and
museum-based informatics. Integration of these fields strengthens the link
between natural-history museum collections and emerging technologies in
evolutionary ecology and prepares him for an academic research program in
biodiversity informatics.
