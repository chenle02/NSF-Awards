This research is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of chromatography. Methods will be developed that permit the
separation of compounds called enantiomers that are presently very difficult to
purify by existing procedures. The objectives of this research are to establish
preparative methods for separating enantiomeric compounds by developing
cyclodextrin modified silicas for use in displacement chromatographic
procedures. This would solve important pharmaceutical problems in the
preparation of pure chiral compounds that hold promise for use as anti-
inflammatory, beta-blocker, platelet activating factor and anti-ulcer drugs.
