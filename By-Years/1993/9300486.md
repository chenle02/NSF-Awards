9300486 Keszenheimer Q-switching a laser is a practical means of producing
short, high intensity optical pulses. For some applications the physical size
and robustness of the laser is an important consideration, and in these cases
Q-switched, composite-cavity, microchip lasers are highly desirable.
Conventional laser technology uses discrete optical components which are subject
to misalignment due to thermal cycling or vibration. Composite-cavity microchip
laser technology eliminates the superfluous space present in conventional lasers
allowing the smallest possible package size for the laser. Q-switched lasers can
be designed independently to optimize peak power, pulse energy, power
efficiency, or pulse width. The primary goal of this research is to develop
composite-cavity microchip lasers from a variety of laser materials which
optimize these parameters. This is a SBIR Phase II project that provides data on
performance tradeoffs that will enable Q-switched microchip lasers to be
designed for many applications. Such applications of Q-switched composite-cavity
microchip lasers include: materials processing (welding, soldering, ablation,
etc.), laser range finding (topographic mapping, collision avoidance, optical
time domain reflectivity, laser radar), and generation of visible radiation via
frequency conversion ,e.g., for optical recording. ***
