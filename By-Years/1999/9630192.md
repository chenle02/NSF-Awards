Dr. Judith Eglin, Department of Chemistry, Mississippi State University, is
supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the
Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to study the synthesis and
reactivity of tungsten complexes. The reactivity of multiply-bonded ditungsten
and dimolybdenum complexes with chlorinated hydrocarbons will be explored, with
the ultimate goal of catalytic dehalogenation. Mononuclear tungsten complexes
will also be investigated for their potential as precursors to conducting
materials. These planning activities will advance Dr. Eglin's career by
providing a basis for preparing a competitive NSF research proposal subsequent
to the completion of this Research Planning Grant. The chemistry of tungsten and
molybdenum is unique in that these metals tend to form complexes in which two of
these metals are bound to one another through multiple bonds. The reactivity of
these compounds with chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests their potential use in
the dehalogenation of these environmentally harmful molecules. Futhermore, the
unique geometry of tungsten lends itself to the study of conducting materials,
which could have important industrial applications.
