The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) Higher
Education Research and Development Survey (HERD) data are collected through a
survey instrument sent to approximately 900 universities and colleges annually.
Each of these institutions collects data to respond to the survey in their own
way. Most rely on highly labor-intensive processes to gather and classify
information about expenditures and research projects in terms of the character
of the work, funding sources and fields of science. The ad-hoc expenditure
classification methods employed are dependent on the individuals carrying out
the task as they develop the necessary evaluation skills over time. There is
potential for a lack of consistency over time and across institutions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develop the tools necessary to leverage
university administrative data to automate the essential and time-consuming step
of classifying projects by science areas, purpose and sponsor type required to
respond to the NCSES HERD Survey. The results will provide a better
understanding of the similarities/differences in the data reported for HERD and
STAR METRICSÂ® and provide suggestions about how data collection for each source
might be improved.&lt;br/&gt;
