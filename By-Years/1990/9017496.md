The high field NMR Spectrometer is the single most important tool available to
organic and inorganic chemists for structure determination and it is becoming a
significantly useful technique for analytical chemists and biochemists. This
award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Utah acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. The
NMR will be used in the following research topics: 1. New Photo and Free-Radical
Reactions of Organophosporus Compounds 2. Conformation Features of Cyclic
Nucleotides and Related Molecules 3. The Study of Isoprenoid Compounds 4.
Unusual Transition Metal-Main Group Element Complexes 5. The Tool Synthesis of
Natural Products 6. Isoprene Biosynthesis 7. New Acetylene Chemistry
