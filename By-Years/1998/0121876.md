0121876&lt;br/&gt;Castillo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will disseminate current and advanced computational science and
engineering methodologies through a series of short courses of two weeks
duration. Organized by Dr. Jose E. Castillo of San Diego State University, the
PASI will take place in Cordoba, Argentina, July 2002. The lectures aim to
promote in-depth computational science and engineering knowledge, encourage
training, and foster cooperation among diverse researchers and lecturers of the
Americas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Course content will focus on research in areas of
computational fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, parallel computing, grid
generation, and geostatistical methods. Discussion, collaboration and
examination of new methods will form part of the overall strategy of the
lectures. Lectures and results of the scientific program will be disseminated
electronically via a web site to be developed for the
Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
