This SBIR Phase I project will develop a microalgae harvesting system for
separating biomass from a water-based growth medium. Specifically, it will
evaluate and model properties of several species of microalgae for removal and
separation from a growth medium utilizing electrostatic properties and
process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the proposed
project will be to advance the state-of-the-art of separating and removing
micro-algae from its growth medium and improving the efficiency of harvesting
high energy content microalgae for biofuel. Further, it could provide an
important step toward reducing the U.S. dependence on fossil fuels.&lt;br/&gt;
