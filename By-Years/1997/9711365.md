This award will support a postdoctoral program in cross-disciplinary research
at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS). Six Fellows will be
appointed, for periods of two or three years, to work on existing or prospective
NISS projects (located at NISS headquarters or elsewhere), with some teaching
responsibilities (at a Research Triangle university or elsewhere). The planned
program builds on the intensity, depth, scientiflc breadth and national scope of
NISS' current, NSF-funded Junior Fellows program, adding emphases on project
development and new forms of institutional support. Junior Fellows will
participate in projects that span current and prospective NISS interests,
including environment, education, transportation, software development, large
data sets, drug design and insurance. These projects involve virtually all
aspects of statistical science. Participating senior researchers and junior
scientists are drawn nationwide from the statistics and relevant scientific
communities, and will serve as collaborators and mentors for the Junior Fellows.
Reflecting NISS' close relationship with the Research Triangle universities
(Duke, North Carolina State and the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill), four distinguished statisticians will serve as Liaisons with Department
Programs: James 0. Berger (Arts and Sciences Professor, Statistics and Decision
Sciences, Duke), Peter Bloomfield (Professor, Statistics, NCSU), Richard L.
Smith (Professor, Statistics, UNC) and Francoise Seillier-Moiseiwitsch
(Associate Professor, Biostatistics, UNC).
