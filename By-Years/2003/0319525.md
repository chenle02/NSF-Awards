This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore an
antithrombotic coating on catheters through a newly developed surface treatment
technique, electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). Such catheters would display
improved device functionality by extending the period between catheter
replacements and decreasing morbidity and mortality. ECR plasma can be spatially
localized to treat the lumen and external surfaces separately and uniformly.
Albumin and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) can be coated onto polymeric
surfaces successfully. In the proposed project, a new approach, enhancing both
anticoagulation through albumin (Alb)-heparin (H) complex and fibrinolysis
through tPA concurrently, will be investigated.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of medical
products that contact blood, e.g., catheters. The project could lead to a low-
cost commercial surface modification method for end stage renal disease (ESRD)
catheters. Catheters that possess mechanisms to fight thrombosis complications
would greatly extend the period between catheter replacements and therefore
benefit patients.
