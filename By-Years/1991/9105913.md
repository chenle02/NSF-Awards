Sea urchin micromeres arise at the vegetal pole of the embryo by unequal
cleavage in the vegetal tier of four cells. Primary mesenchyme, the cleavage
products of the micromeres, migrate into the blastocoel of the embryo where they
interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and differentiate to produce the
embryonic skeleton or spicule. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies
suggests that the micromeres require a permissive environment or signal to
initiate differentiation. An intact embryonic ECM is a major component of the
permissive environment. The PI has recently shown that micromeres will
differentiate in vitro if cultured on a reconstituted basal lamina (matrigel).
Isolated micromeres cultured in sea water alone will not differentiate. What is
the molecule in the matrigel which initiates differentiation and how is it
related to the endogenous signalling molecule in the embryo. The PI proposes to:
(1) identify and purify the spicule inducing activity (SIA) from the matrigel,
(2) characterize the general mechanism of action of SIA, and (3) identify and
initiate characterization of the homologous SIA activity from the sea urchin
embryo.
