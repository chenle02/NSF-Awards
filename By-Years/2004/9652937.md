Any IBM clone PC having a printer port may be used to interfaced with all
manner of interesting real world devices which have meaning to students. There
are millions of such PC's in colleges and universities, in high schools and in
the hands of individuals throughout the country. This project will develop
material to show students at Morgan State University and across the nation how
to use this resource to give relevance to programming and to encourage
individual "tinkering" and experimenting by students. The project will develop
material related to the computer control of real world peripherals for use by
students throughout the nation. This will be distributed using the World Wide
Web and in the form of tutorial manuals. New material will be developed to teach
freshmen engineering majors programming skills in an environment of controlling
lamps, solenoids, motors and measuring such parameters as infrared and
temperature. Applications of these real world peripherals to such fields as
manufacturing, robotics and automation will also be woven into the project. The
possibility of moving this meaningful application of programming outside the
University and into high schools will be explored.
