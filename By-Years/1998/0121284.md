The conference is to cover the topic of "Nonhomogenous Harmonic Analysis". The
principal lecturer will be Sasha Volberg. He will show how the Bellman technique
from the area of Operations Research can be modified to solve many difficult
problems in the area noted. He will in particular address deep questions to
Calderon-Zygmund kernels, Tb theorems, two weight problems, capacity problems,
some questions in Quasi-conformal mappings as well as several other topics. The
material will cover the topics in the most&lt;br/&gt;general settings (i.e.
R^n), non-regular measures, etc..
