9309786 Weigend The progress in the last decade in predicting and understanding
time series has been remarkable. Where once time series analysis was shaped by
linear systems theory, it is now possible to recognize when an apparently
complicated time series has been produced by a low- dimensional nonlinear
system, characterize its essential properties, and build a model that can be
used for prediction. At the opposite extreme, there is now a much richer
framework for designing algorithms such as neural networks that can learn and
adapt to the structure in time series that do not have a simple origin. This
research addresses the following three questions: How to estimate the accuracy
in time series prediction, how to deal with data sets that are noisy and
chaotic, and how to characterize the system that temporal sequence by analyzing
the predictive model. The tools to be developed in response to these questions
combine recent advances from connectionism and dynamical systems theory. They
will be evaluated on real-world data, submitted by various groups for
consideration at the Time Series Prediction and Analysis Competition that was
held under the auspices of the Santa Fe Institute. ***
