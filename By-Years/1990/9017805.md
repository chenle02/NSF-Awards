It is the purpose of this project to continue to make balloon borne measurements
of ozone, polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles and condensation nuclei in
the stratosphere above McMurdo, Antarctica during the austral springtime. This
work is required to further understanding of the annual Antarctic ozone hole. It
is known that the principal cause of the ozone depletion is chlorine, and that
the PSCs play a major role in the chemistry, freeing the elemental chlorine from
the reservoir gases, hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate, so that it is
available for the photocatalytic destruction of the ozone at the time of
sunrise. Very little is presently known about the details of the formation and
physical state of the particles in the PSCs, and it is expected that this
project will continue to improve the state of knowledge of this important
subject.
