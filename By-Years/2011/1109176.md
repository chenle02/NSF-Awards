This award will fund a theoretical effort to model the outer layers of neutron
stars. The principal goals of the research are (1) to generate models of the
neutron star inner crust that will handle nuclear reactions with realistic
treatment of nuclear composition; (2) to determine how the crust evolves in an
accreting environment and to connect observed surface phenomena with the
properties of the deep interior; and (3) make predictions about the extent to
which the neutron star crust can be deformed in accretion and to compute the
expected gravitational wave signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars are the
densest objects in the universe and knowledge of neutron star physics is growing
rapidly, due to X-ray telescopes, laboratory nuclear experiments, and future
gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory. A recent National Academy report, "Connecting Quarks with the
Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century," identified the nature of
matter at exceedingly high density and temperature as one of the eleven critical
science questions for the 21st century.
