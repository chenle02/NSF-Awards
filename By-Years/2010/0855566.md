This project represents the final phase of a decade-long effort to
experimentally determine if electrons have a non-spherical distribution of their
electric charge. Such a charge asymmetry (known as an electric dipole moment)
can arise from the same fundamental mechanisms responsible for the universe
being composed of matter rather than antimatter. This project provides one of
the few means to test theories of particle physics that can explain this basic
fact of existence. The goal is to achieve sensitivity to the electron's electric
dipole moment a factor of 2-3 better than previous experiments, and hence
possibly observe this effect for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts of this project are primarily related to research training of
the participants. Over its lifetime, this experiment has supported training of
three postdoctoral researchers, four Ph.D. students, and ten undergraduate
researchers, most of whom have remained active in research. This phase will
support the final year of research for the last Ph.D. student on the project.
