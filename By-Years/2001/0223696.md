The NSF Workshop on Learning and Approximate Dynamic Programming is proposed to
take place on April 8-10, 2002, in Playacar, Mexico. The technical focus of the
workshop is to address one common cross-cutting problem: how do we do our best,
using learning-based approaches or the equivalent, to develop general-purpose
designs to try to maximize the sum of expected utility over future time, in a
nonlinear stochastic environment, without just simulating the entire
future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important goal of the workshop is to bring
people in diverse areas to unify their efforts to tackle some important
problems. The workshop is therefore highly interdisciplinary, and the invitees
are world leaders in machine learning, control systems theory, and neural
networks. The technical program is intended to create opportunities for
participants to carry on discussions and to form teams for their future
work.&lt;br/&gt;
