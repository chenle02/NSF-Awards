This S-STEM scholars program awards scholarships to academically talented, but
financially needy students seeking baccaulareate degrees in information
technology and engineering disciplines. This project builds on the success of
other student centered programs funded by the National Science Foundation. The
Success Programs for Retention in Information Technology and Engineering
(SPRITE) targets first generation students from underrepresented groups and
provides scholarships that enable students to reduce their extracurricular work
hours, thus liberating time for additional study. Students selected to be SPRITE
Scholars are eligible for comprehensive support services including faculty
mentoring, tutoring and financial and career planning. The SPRITE program
features an on-line Professional Development Milestones program that students
use throughout their academic career to assist with educational and career
decisions. This project awards approximately forty-five scholarships over the
life of the grant.
