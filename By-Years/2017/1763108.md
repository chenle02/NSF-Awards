This award will support national health and prosperity by developing large-scale
quantitative models for the strategic design of conservation plans to preserve
biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential to human survival on Earth. A key
strategy for preserving biodiversity involves making strategic land use
decisions over time to create a system of habitat reserves. Long-term planning
for these reserves faces challenges due to scarcity of data on species
prevalence and resilience, uncertainty about land development activities, and
changes over time in the ability of land tracts to sustain diverse species. This
project uses a data-driven, computationally efficient robust optimization
approach that can assist land use planners in making decisions that affect
wildlife and fishery management and that may impact the prosperity of
surrounding communities. The project will leverage ongoing collaborations with
the United States Geological Survey, as well as Panthera and the Wildlife
Conservation Society. The PIs will involve female graduate and undergraduate
students in the project through the Women in Science and Engineering program at
the University of Southern California. In addition, they will integrate the
outcomes of this research into graduate and undergraduate courses they
teach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project take a rigorous, quantitative approach
to conservation planning that utilizes land acquisition and development data to
inform novel multi-stage robust optimization models. The framework provides a
general modeling scheme for optimization problems under endogenous uncertainty.
These models involve binary adaptive decision variables with an exponential
number of contingencies whose chance of occurrence is also decision-dependent.
Spatio-temporal uncertainty sets are constructed using land use projections
obtained from governmental agencies and NGOs. The PIs will extend the
K-adaptability approach to the multi-stage setting, and will investigate
techniques to provide lower bounds on the optimality
gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
