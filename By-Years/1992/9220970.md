Professor Dehmelt proposes to continue his studies of single elementary
particles at rest in free space. The main thrusts of this Nobel Prize winning
work are (1) Investigate the possibility that electrons and positrons have
internal structure, (2) Test the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics to the limits
of the physically measurable, (3) Test electron-positron mirror symmetry and the
hypothesis that the combination of charge, parity, and time is a conserved
quantity in nature.
