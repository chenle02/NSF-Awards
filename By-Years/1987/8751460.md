The Associated Colleges of the Midwest, in conjunction with the Great Lakes
Colleges Association, will sponsor a regional conference for mathematicians
involved in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum from non-PhD granting
institutions in the upper Middle West, to be held on June 3 and 4, 1987. The
conference will have two primary goals: (1) to provide a series of presentations
analyzing the ways in which undergraduate mathematics courses can more fully
integrate instrumentation; and (2) to inform participants who will develop
laboratory-based mathematics courses about opportunities for assistance from the
National Science Foundation's College Science Instrumentation Program. A paper
on curricular changes integrating instrumentation into undergraduate mathematics
courses will come out of the conference and will be distributed to participants
and more widely around the country. The model of this regional meeting may be
used by NSF for other regional meetings with similar goals.
