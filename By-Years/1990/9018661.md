This award provides 50% of the funds required for the acquisition of a computer
file server system required for the research of the seismology group in the
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. The University
is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition. The
computer system will allow the researchers to address a broad range of problems
dealing with the interpretation of data from globally distributed digital
seismographic stations to arrive at the Earth's three-dimensional internal
structure from its crust to the core.
