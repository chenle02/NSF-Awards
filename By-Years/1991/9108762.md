The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) in the state
of Arkansas will enhance the research competitiveness of approximately 35
scientists in three research clusters: (1) Arkansas Neurobiology Research
Center; (2) Center for Cellular and Molecular Studies on Biological Aging; and
(3) Center for Protein Dynamics. Arkansas' effort is directed toward bringing
three groups of scientists to a nationally-competitive level by funding
equipment, graduate students, common facilities, and post- doctoral scientists,
and by recruiting new faculty members. Outreach components of each group will
draw undergraduate students and faculty from other institutions in the state to
conduct research under as the direction of the nationally- competitive group
leaders. In addition to the clusters' outreach programs, the statewide EPSCoR
Committee will administer the Visiting Scientists Program, providing funding for
continued research at primarily undergraduate institutions. A Public Awareness
Program is funding the production of six half-hour documentaries featuring
Arkansas scientists. These documentaries, produced by the Arkansas Educational
Television Network, will be shown on the public television stations and include
corresponding educational materials so that the programs may be used in the
public schools. During the three year period of the award, state and
institutions will contribute $3 million in support of EPSCoR'S objectives.
