estuary, an area of common interest. This project fulfills the program objective
of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United
States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in
areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the field of basic scientific
research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
