This award will support research aimed at deepening our understanding of
graphical representations of block codes. Such representations play a
fundamental role in modern coding theory, where codes on graphs are used in
order to employ iterative decoding algorithms. The powerful performance of these
algorithms has led to a vivid interest in optimal graphical representations of
codes. Tail-biting trellises form a particular type of such graphical models.
This project focuses on studying the relation between various tail-biting
trellis realizations of a given code, such as minimal realizations and
irreducible ones, as well as on analyzing the performance of iterative decoding
algorithms on these graphs.

Coding theory is at the interface of applied mathematics and engineering of
communication systems. It deals with ensuring the integrity of data transmission
via satellite, internet, cell phones etc. The basic idea is to preprocess the
to-be-sent messages in such a way that, after sending, the receiver has a good
chance to recover the original message from the received, and generally
erroneous, message. The preprocessing is called the encoding, and the recovering
process is the decoding. This award will support research geared toward optimal
graphical representations of codes, which in turn is closely related to
designing efficient decoding algorithms. The award will also support the
graduate program at the University of Kentucky because two Ph.D. students will
be involved in the project.
