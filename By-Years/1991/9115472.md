A four and half day conference devoted to pool and external flow boiling is
proposed from March 23 to 27, 1992 in Santa Barbara, California. Boiling is one
of the most efficient modes of heat transfer. Its applications encompass diverse
engineering fields such as mechanical, chemical, nuclear and aerospace. Boiling
is also a very complex process. Though considerable effort has been devoted to
its study in the last 50 years, the understanding is so incomplete that
predictions cannot be made without the use of empirical constants. The proposed
conference will bring together researchers from industry, government labs and
universities in Europe, Asia and the U.S. to assess the level of current
understanding and to establish directions of future endeavors. The conference is
being sponsored by the Engineering Foundation and only modest funding is
requested from the National Science Foundation. Other funding is being sought
from industry and other sources.
