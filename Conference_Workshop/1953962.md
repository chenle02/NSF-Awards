This award provides funding for two small regional conferences that will
continue to rotate among the three host institutions: Iowa State University, the
University of Minnesota, and the University of Wisconsin. These conferences
promote a broad view of commutative algebra, inspiring conversations, and
collaborations between different areas of algebra. This is a continuation of a
conference series, with two meetings each at Minnesota and Wisconsin between
2015 and 2017. After a brief hiatus, Iowa State University will join the
rotation, hosting the conference in 2020 before the event returns to Minnesota
in 2021. Commutative algebra is filled with connections to other areas,
including: algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, combinatorics, number theory,
applied algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, and more. The
conference series supported by this award promotes a broad view of commutative
algebra, helping connect it with the research environments in the mathematics
departments involved. Information about the conference will be found at

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
