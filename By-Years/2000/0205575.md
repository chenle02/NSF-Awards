ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;0205575&lt;br/&gt;U of Mass, Amherst&lt;br/&gt;Leon J.
Osterweil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The internet has changed forever the way science
is done. Collaborations such as NSF-sponsored&lt;br/&gt;Globus, and GriPhyN are
beginning to employ internet access to facilitate data sharing
and&lt;br/&gt;expedite collaboration among worldwide communities of
geographically distributed researchers.&lt;br/&gt;This creates opportunities to
do better science through the use of shared data and expertise, but
it&lt;br/&gt;also creates risks arising from uncertainty about how internet-
accessed data sets were produced&lt;br/&gt;and how they can be used. If
scientists cannot determine how particular results were
obtained,&lt;br/&gt;those results may be subsequently combined in ways that will
lead to incorrect or misleading&lt;br/&gt;conclusions, possibly with devastating
effects.&lt;br/&gt;Our project will develop, demonstrate, and evaluate
technologies to facilitate the building of&lt;br/&gt;community consensus by
supporting definition, validation, repeatability, and adaptability
of&lt;br/&gt;scientific processes that integrate and combine web-based data sets
and tools. Although there will&lt;br/&gt;always be debate about the most
appropriate models, methodologies and conclusions used in&lt;br/&gt;scientific
inquiry, our work should help scientists focus on areas of disagreement and
resolve these&lt;br/&gt;disagreements more quickly, perhaps through further
experimentation and inquiry. Thus, our work&lt;br/&gt;will also help policy
makers in areas where scientific results are critical ingredients, such
as&lt;br/&gt;economic policy, environmental management, and social initiatives..
