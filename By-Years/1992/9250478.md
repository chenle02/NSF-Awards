A computer laboratory is being developed in an existing mathematics curriculum
that will strengthen the discovery and exploratory components of various courses
by providing power, flexibility, vividness, and transparency to the general
user. Equipment n the laboratory will permit students in classes to manipulate
and experiment with mathematical concepts both theoretical and applied. The goal
of the program is to improve the education provided to mathematics students by
acquainting them with the mathematical ideas that are more accessible through
the symbolics, numerics, graphics, and programming capabilities of computer
algebra systems. Deeper understanding, retention, and excitement in mathematics
is the goal.
