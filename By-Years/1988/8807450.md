Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Chemistry Department of
the RUI institution, Hope College, to acquire, operate and maintain a high-field
NMR spectrometer. The acquisition of the instrument will enhance the ability of
the Department to prepare undergraduates for possible careers in chemistry and
will enhance research in the following areas: 1) Reactive bi-metallic early-
late-transition metal complexes 2) Preparation and polymerization of
1,2-dihydrocyclobutaÄ±b!- napthalene-4,7-dione and derivatives 3) Identification
of biologically important compounds exuded from sorghum and other grasses 4)
Biosynthesis of 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in sorghum: a model for anthocyanidin
biosynthesis 5) Characterization of divalent germanium, tin and lead compounds
by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy 6) Diastereoselective reactions of enolates
with epoxides 7) Competitive cyclyzations of epoxides to double bonds and
aromatic positions.
