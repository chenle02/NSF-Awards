Economic considerations permeate the ways in which different laws or rules
relate to various aspects of corporate control. Despite the fact that rules
influence corporate behavior and the structure of the market, systematic
theoretical and empirical work is far too scarce. Dr. Bebchuk seeks to
investigate the influence of economic factors in this area by means of the
development of several theoretical models to examine 1) how laws or rules with
respect to fee-shifting affect the incentive to sue; 2) the way in which scope
of the liability for losses due to breach of contract is affected by situations
in which the buyer places a high value on contract performance (a value that the
seller is unaware of) and where there are transaction costs in determining that
value; 3) a new method for corporate reorganization which overcomes what are now
thought to be problems inherent in the reorganization process; 4) how
alternative rules for allocating costs incurred in proxy contests may be
utilized to provide input to the evaluation of possible changes in the law
governing the financing of proxy contests; 5) the interpretation of charter
provisions of management powers and duties; and 6) a normative standard for
evaluating legal rules governing corporate acquisitions. A young, productive
scholar with a concern for making his results accessible to both legal scholars
and economist, Dr. Bebchuk is especially well situated to contribute to
illuminating the interface between law and economics in the area of corporate
control.
