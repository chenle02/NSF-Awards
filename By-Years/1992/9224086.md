Few events are as traumatic, in both personal and corporate terms, as layoffs.
This project explores how workers view the causes of their job loss and how they
decide whether they have suffered wrongful or discriminatory treatment. The
project expands the study of decisions about suing by looking at claiming
decisions with respect to past employers. The study will test a number of
theories of litigation behavior, focusing particularly on how feelings of fair
or unfair treatment by the former employer affects the decision to make a
wrongful termination claim. By helping us to understand the psychological and
social processes involved in claiming decisions, the study will contribute to
our understanding of how everyday notions of fair treatment affect the movement
of cases into the legal system. This collaborative study will include interviews
of 1075 recently fired or laid-off workers recruited at state unemployment
offices. The interviews will explore a variety of factors thought to contribute
to the decision to sue, including pre-termination treatment, financial burdens
of unemployment, awareness of claiming options, and feelings of discrimination.
Follow-up interviews with some of the workers will be used to determine who
actually initiated wrongful termination claims.
