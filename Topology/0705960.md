A fundamental technique in group theory is to study groups by examining their
actions on topological spaces. If one restricts attention to spaces with strong
geometric properties (such as metric trees or CAT(0) spaces), one can often make
the set of actions of G into a topological space itself, called a deformation
space, with good topological properties. The automorphism group of G acts on the
deformation space by twisting each action to get a new action. In this project
we study automorphism groups of various classes of groups by studying their
actions on deformation spaces. For free groups, the relevant deformation space,
originally defined by the PI and M. Culler, is known as Outer space. A fairly
recent development in this subject is that Morita used a connection found by
Kontsevich between Outer space and a certain infinite-dimensional symplectic Lie
algebra to detect cocycles for Out(F_n), the group of outer automorphisms of the
free group of rank n. The PI and J. Conant have reinterpreted these cocycles as
cycles on the quotient of Outer space by the action of Out(F_n), and plan to use
these to study the unstable cohomology of Out(F_n). A second goal of this
project, joint with R. Charney, is to develop an analog of Outer space for
right-angled Artin groups, a class which includes both free groups and free
abelian groups. A third component is motivated by previous work of the PI on
stability of the homology of Out(F_n) and Aut(F_n). Techniques developed for
proving these stability results apply to other sequences of groups related to
low-dimensional topology, and the PI will further investigate these
applications. Other ongoing projects include a study of the space of
phylogenetic trees and an investigation of rigidity properties of Out(F_n).



A phenomenon which occurs throughout mathematics and the sciences is that
complicated structures can often be understood more easily by codifying the
information they contain in terms of graphs and trees. On example of this is the
use of graphs and trees to describe the possible splittings of an algebraic
object called a group into simpler pieces. When there are many possible
splittings, one can construct deformation spaces which measure the ambiguity. In
this project we study groups by considering actions of the symmetries of the
group on such deformation spaces.
