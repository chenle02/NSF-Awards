Professor Blasius will continue his work on Shimura varieties and their
associated motives. He will study motives attached to Hilbert modular forms
using the stable trace formula and endoscopy. He will also study reductions mod
p of these varieties. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic
geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number
theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful -
having recently solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many
consequences are new error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both
modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
