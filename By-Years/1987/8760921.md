This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the general
area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the subfield of biosensors. The
thrust of this experimental activity is to evaluate a new, electrodeposition-
based method for the production of enzyme biosensor electrodes. The objective of
this research is to electrodeposit colloidal gold containing a test enzyme on
carbon rods, and other inexpensive conducting materials, in a manner that
maintains biological activity of the enzyme while providing for facile electron
transfer. The research tasks consist of (1) immobilization of the test enzyme on
colloidal gold particles by each of two methods (adsorption directly on the
surface and covalent attachment via a spacer arm); (2) production of electrodes
from the colloidal gold containing the attached test enzyme by an
electrodeposition method; (3) measuring the activity of the immobilized enzyme;
and (4) coupling the electron transfer characteristics of the immobilized test
enzyme to the electroactive gold surface. The results of this research should
demonstrate the feasibility of electrodeposition as a viable method for the
production of bioelectrodes. Electrochemical sensors based on enzyme specificity
have broad potential in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and
process control. Major problems in current commercial biosensor design arise
because of instability, slow response, and lack of direct, efficient electrical
coupling between the enzyme and the electrode surface. The successful completion
of this Phase I SBIR project could lead to new and efficient technologies for
the production of multi-analyte sensors with desirable characteristics.
