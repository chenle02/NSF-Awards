This award will support the organization of the annual Principal Investigators
(PI) meeting for the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and Foundational
Research in Robotics (FRR), which were launched in 2011 and 2020 respectively.
The PI meeting will bring together the community of active robotics researchers
to provide cross-project coordination of intellectual challenges and best
practices in education, technology transfer and general outreach. This activity
will also establish a repository illustrating the research ideas explored and
milestones achieved by the various robotics projects. The meeting is planned for
three days in March of 2021, to be held virtually. The format will include
presentations by the attending PIs of projects in their final year, a poster
session with all other projects, keynote speeches, and panel discussions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to organize the spring 2021 NRI and FRR PI
meeting. The meeting promotes dissemination and serendipitous collaboration
amongst robotics researchers. The organization includes participation for
graduate students as well as PIs. This award is for the meeting organization
only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
