Thin films adsorbed on solid substrates frequently exhibit properties which are
quite distinct from those exhibited by the bulk material. As such two-
dimensional films thicken, they must eventually exhibit three-dimensional
behavior. Current research is focused on various aspects of this evolution from
two- dimensional to three dimensional behavior as a film grows: Employing model
systems of rare-gas films on well characterized substrates, two fundamental
issues of film growth are addressed: (1) Given a known substrate and a known
adsorbate, can one, based on atomistic principles alone, predict the mode of
growth which will occur? (2) How can one alter a particular film substrate
combination so as to obtain a desired mode of film growth? The overall goal here
is to decrease our reliance on empirical approaches to the characterization and
prediction of film growth modes and to bridge the gap between "ideal" and "real"
surfaces. Other research interests include studies of the relationship between
film surface melting characteristics and wetting behavior, and the preparation
of metal substrates by ballistic aggregation allowing adsorption studies on
fractal and/or void networks.
