The goal of Science City: New York as a Science and Technology Exhibit, is to
increase public awareness and interest in science and technology in daily life
by creating "found exhibits" in public places throughout New York City. This
proposal is based on a 1986 pilot project which developed criteria and concepts
for successful Science City units and a prototype exhibit operating in a tourist
elevator at the World Trade Center. Science City will use the streets and
structures of New York to present the science and technology of everyday life.
It will reach the science inattentive public who do not go to science museums.
Eye-catching exhibits such as diffraction gratings mounted on bus shelters will
reveal the different spectra of the incandescent, flourescent, neon, and mercury
vapor lamps, already part of the street scene. The New York Hall of Science will
place Science City exhibits in public parks, subways, bus kiosks, and building
lobbies. Ten to fifteen different exhibits/signs, each replicated an average of
10 times, will be installed and evaluated throughout the boroughs of Queens and
Manhattan.
