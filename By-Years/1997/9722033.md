Detailed theoretical calculations at both zero and finite temperatures are
performed for Bose-Einstein condensation in gases having a negative scattering
length. The importance of addressing this issue concerns the prediction that
Bose-Einstein condensation cannot occur in homogeneous, infinite quantum systems
with a negative scattering length. The research focuses on the theoretical
treatment of 7Li, an alkali gas having a negative scattering length, which has
been shown experimentally to have a small, stable BEC.
