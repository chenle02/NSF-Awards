This research focuses on a comprehensive approach to achieving individual and
collaborative interactions for extremely complex simulation data. Such datasets
would overwhelm existing systems. They often share many common attributes in
their organization, data evolution and dependencies, and patterns of shared,
coherent access by human or automated agents. These commonalties can be captured
through a suitable set of abstractions, and exploited to achieve fundamental
improvements in methods for manipulating, sharing, and understanding such broad
collections of data. Specifically, the project is aimed at constructing a system
for interactive visualization of extremely complex datasets, by developing
techniques for: (1) query factoring, (2) predictive fetching, (3) detail
degradation, (4) conservative algorithms, (5) hybrid cost metrics, and (6) an
interactive tool infrastructure. The educational component addresses the
potential for collaborative interactive techniques to improve pedagogy at the
undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels, and performance evaluation at
the undergraduate level.
