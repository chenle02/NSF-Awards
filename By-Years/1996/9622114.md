Mukherjee 9622114 Electronic and optical thin film production currently relies
on techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition,
sputtering, liquid phase epitaxy, ion beam deposition, and thermal evaporation.
The research is to study the interaction of the CO2 laser with the target as
well as the effect of inter-pluse delay of the temporal shaping on the coupling
of the CO2 laser energy to the excimer laser-ablated plume. Both theorical and
experimental models will be studied to optimize the process parameters. To
assess the flexibility of the proposed dual-laser process as a manufacturing
method, three diferent materials, including Lithium Niobate, High Temperature
Superconductor, and Amorphous rare earth-transition metal alloys will be
investigated. The outcome of this research project would allow the development
of a database for the general applicability of this technique, thus the
realization of the use of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) for manufacturing could
be achieved. The outcomes of the study would yield useful tools and models to
develop a novel manufacturing technique which combine the merits of molecular
epitaxy technology and single source deposition
