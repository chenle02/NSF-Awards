Electromagnetic pulses from a distant clock traversing a gravitational wave
experience a variable delay depending on the gravitational wave phase at the
emitter and at the receiver. This effect allows the use of a spatial array of
the most precise pulsars, which are precision celestial clocks, as a sensitive
gravity-wave detector at very low, nHz, frequencies using a measurement interval
extending over several years. It is expected there should be a low frequency
random background of gravitational radiation as a relic from an early epoch of
the formation of the Universe, but that an astrophysically significant
'foreground' of gravity waves from the coalescence of massive black hole
binaries in the nuclei of galaxies will be the dominant source at nHz
frequencies. The global Pulsar Timing Array of selected pulsars is essential for
positive detection of gravitational radiation and involves a continuation and
improvement of the Arecibo experiments, the new Green Bank Telescope, and a
collaboration with pulsar groups in Amsterdam, France, and Australia to assemble
the "best" combined data sets for the multi-pulsar/multi-frequency/multi-
telescope analysis. The project will also learn about the intrinsic properties
of pulsars and the turbulence structure of the plasma in the line of sight to
the pulsar. ***
