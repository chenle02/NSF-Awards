Abstract



Award: DMS-9971574

Principal Investigator: F. Reese Harvey





This project has three components. First, push forward singular

connections will be analyzed and their associated characteristic

currents will be determined. Second, the calculus of kernels as

developed by Harvey and Polking will be used to attack new

problems in differential geometry. Third, calibration theory,

introduced by Harvey and Lawson, will be applied to geometric

problems.



In practical geometric problems it is important to distinguish

"local" from"global" information. Here "local" means in the

vicinity of a point while by contrast "global" includes

information such as the distance from, say Washington D.C., to

another place on the surface of the earth. Results of particular

importance for applications are frequently ones where global

information is computed from an assembly of local information.

For example local information alone, involving the amount of

local curvature of a surface can be used to distinguish the

global nature of a ball from the global nature of a inner

tube. This research will develope new instances of this important

procedure.
