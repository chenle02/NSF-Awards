Automatic Performance Skeletons for Grid Computing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
performance skeleton of an application is a short running program whose
execution time in any run-time scenario reflects the expected execution time of
the application it represents. Such a skeleton can be employed to quickly esti-
mate the performance of a long running application on a given set of execution
nodes even when the nodes and network links are shared. This project is per-
forming research to enable automatic construction of performance skeletons of
resource intensive applications. A performance skeleton must mimic application
execution behavior, such as computation, memory, and communication pat-terns, in
order to model the application's performance. The approach being taken to
construct the performance skeleton of an application consists of the following
steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Execute the target application and record the
execution trace that captures detailed CPU, memory and network activity. (2)
Capture repeated patterns in the application execution trace and summarize it as
a compact execution signa-ture. (3) Generate the performance skeleton executable
program from the summarized system activity captured by the execution
signature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Performance modeling is central to effective use
of high performance computa-tional resources. Performance skeletons represent a
fast, innovative and accu-rate approach to estimating the performance of long
running applications on diverse and unpredictable grid environments. Accurate
performance estimation with this method typically takes only a few seconds of
skeleton execution for applications that run for several hours. This project is
also developing a frame-work for resource selection in grid environments with
performance skeletons.&lt;br/&gt;
