SBR-9515319 Colin E. Thorn Bruce L. Rhoads U. Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) This
award provides funds to support travel and accommodation expenses for invited
participants in a symposium on "The Scientific Nature of Geomorphology," part of
the Binghamton Symposium Series (no connection with the university or the city),
to be held in September 1996 in Champaign, Illinois. The symposium will address
the current absence of a strong, unifying, intellectual framework for the field
of geomorphology. At stake are issues such as the field's origin and self-
identification as an earth science, while ascendant methods are those of physics
and chemistry; the division between "field" and "process" researchers; the
general disdain for philosophy of science within the field; and the extent to
which philosophies of science underlying ecological studies can also inform
geomorphology. The symposium will gather people who have written and researched
on these matters, and will result in a volume to be published by Wiley
(production of the volume is not part of the budget request). The symposium and
volume could be a landmark in the self-conceptualization of a central component
of physical geography.
