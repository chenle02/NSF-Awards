The general area of investigation in the project is excursions and local times
of Markov processes such as the Brownian motion. The investigator will continue
the study of asymptotic properties of additive functionals of Brownian motion.
Previous work in collaboration with Yor, has settled many important questions
about the integrals with respect to the Brownian motion. The new functionals are
integrals of functions of Brownian motion. Examples of such functionals include
the occupation times of sectors and Brownian Words. The last is a measure of the
self winding behavior of the process. The local time process viewed at local
times leads to existence questions of more general processes. Some of these
questions are settled by Krein's theory of strings. An arcsin process arising
from the process of the last time minimum of Brownian motion has many
interesting properties and has been as yet, unexplored.
