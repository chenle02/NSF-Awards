This is a two-year collaborative research project between Dr. Gerald W. Hohmann,
University of Utah and Professor He Jishan, Central South University of
Technology. This study plans to improve the resolution and exploration of
transient electro-magnetic techniques (TEM). Dr. Hohmann has developed a state
of the art of computer program for interpreting electrical conductivity data but
has no field data to verify the model. His Chinese collaborator at the Central
South University of Technology (CSUT) has been carrying out electromagnetic
field studies in China for several years and plans to conduct field measurements
using the newly purchased multi-purpose electromagnetic receiver. This is a
collabora- tive study jointly supported by the NSF and the Chinese State
Education Commission. The study will greatly benefit both U.S. and Chinese
scientists.
