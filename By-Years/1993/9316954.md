9316954 O'Hara The behavior of fluids at depth in deforming continental crust is
of current interest. This study will examine retrograde greenschist to lower
amphibolite grade mylonites in the Blue Ridge province of North Carolina and
Virginia where preliminary data suggest an inverse relationship between
metamorphic grade and bulk- rock chemical change. The work involve
characterization of mineral assemblages, oxygen isotopes and mineral
chemistries. Results will have important implications for understanding the
behavior of hydrothermal fluids at depth in the continental crust.
