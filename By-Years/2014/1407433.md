The goal of this project is for the American Society for Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology&lt;br/&gt;(ASBMB) to create a culture of inclusion and a sense
of community for primarily undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;institution (PUI), Minority
Serving Institution (MSI), and Community College (CC) faculty&lt;br/&gt;and
undergraduates at the ASBMB Annual Meeting. This will be accomplished by
increasing the&lt;br/&gt;visibility of high quality, outcome-oriented
undergraduate research and by offering enrichment&lt;br/&gt;events for PUI, MSI
and CC faculty and undergraduates throughout the meeting.
