The Association of Computer and Information Science and Engineering Departments
at Minority Institutions (ADMI) was established at the 1989 NSF/CISE Workshop in
New Orleans, Louisiana. Support is being provided for the continued effort of
making ADMI an effective instrument to further the interest of minority
institutions and the National Science Foundation in strengthening computer
science/engineering academic and research programs and increasing the number of
minority students selecting CISE supported areas as faculty/research careers.
Support is being provided during this formative period of ADMI for meetings of
the organization's elected officers and Advisory Board, and other projects until
strategies are developed to provide long term self-sufficiency. Immediate
support is for three board meetings, the 90 Annual National ADMI meeting, and
three proposal writing one-day workshops to be held in Baltimore, MD (Morgan
State University); Houston, TX (The University of Houston); and Davis, CA (DQ
University).
