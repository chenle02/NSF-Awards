The Hess Deep, in the eastern equatorial Pacific, is a rift valley providing an
exposure of young crust produced by fast- spreading on the East Pacific Rise. In
the walls of the rift valley a section of normal ocean crust is available for
sampling and study. The presence of lower crustal rocks in the basal wall and
rift valley floor suggests that drilling within the Hess Deep will provide rocks
from the plutonic layers of the crust and shallow mantle. A proposal for
drilling these deep crustal rocks has been highly ranked by JOIDES. The present
award will support a detailed geophysical study to constrain the crustal
structure in the region proposed for drilling. Specifically the project will
undertake sea-floor seismic and gravity experiments to elucidate velocity and
density structure in the region surrounding the proposed drilling locations.
These measurements will help to test differing models for exposure of deep
crustal layers in Hess Deep by serpentine diapirism or by low-angle detachment
faulting. Additionally, a short survey will be done of the west flank of the
East Pacific Rise on crust which is conjugate to Hess Deep to define the history
of spreading when the Hess Deep crust was formed.
