The primary objective of the project is to develop a competitive research
proposal on "Sound Absorption in Heterogenous Fibrous Materials." Support of the
project will assist a well trained, Black engineer to improve her research
capability and to complete the planning and development of a regular MRI
proposal. The planning activities, if successful, will significantly enhance the
potential of the investigator to compete for MRI and other research support.
