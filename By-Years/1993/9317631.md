9317631 Rosenstone This award provides continued support of the Foundation's
long- term commitment for the National Election Studies (NES). The National
Science Foundation created the NES research program to sustain and enhance the
diversified data base that supports basic research on voting, public opinion,
and political participation in the United States. NES data have served a wide
range of other purposes as well; serving as a testing-ground for a vast array of
theories regarded as basic across the social sciences. The current award
provides support for the 1994 and 1996 elections. The scientific integrity of
the time-series data collections set over a decade and a half ago for NES will
be preserved. The Board of Overseers will continue to function as a very real
partner in study planning and will maintain its full role as trustee and
representative of the larger community of users. There are opportunities for the
diverse national social science community to participate directly in the design
and execution of NES studies. There are resources for improving the quality of
the core NES time-series data and for testing innovations in theory,
measurement, and data collection. There is a new module of items assessing the
American electorate's attitudes concerning the environment. This research
constitutes the most important data base for the study of American politics and
American political behavior. ***
