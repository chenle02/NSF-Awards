Law 117-2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that
generate biodiversity is crucial for conserving and managing species over the
long term. Much of the planetâ€™s biodiversity has been generated through adaptive
radiation, a process in which a group of organisms diversifies into many new
species with different ecological roles. However, we lack a thorough
understanding of the genomic changes underlying these events, particularly in
marine ecosystems where there are no obvious barriers to migration. Rockfishes
in the genus Sebastes are a highly diverse (&gt;110 species) group of fishes
that live across a range of depths and habitats, making them an excellent model
for studying the dynamics of diversification. This CAREER project will advance
our understanding of how species diversify by examining the genomic processes
underlying speciation in rockfishes, as well as the accompanying shifts in
habitat, body shape, size and color among sister species. This research program
is integrated with educational activities, including undergraduate research
opportunities and teacher training, with the goal of contributing to a strong
and diverse workforce in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
study will combine genomic data with information on phenotypic diversity,
ecology and biogeography to develop a holistic understanding of the dynamics of
diversification in this extraordinarily species-rich genus. The first aim of the
project is to construct an updated, time-calibrated phylogenetic framework for
rockfishes using phylogenomic methods. In the second aim, whole genome
sequencing will be used to infer likely divergence scenarios among sympatric
species pairs, characterize patterns of genomic differentiation, and reconstruct
demographic histories of lineages in the context of speciation events and
oceanographic data. The third aim will examine the correspondence between
genomic and ecomorphological divergence by assessing overlap between sister
species across a suite of habitat factors and quantitative phenotypic
characters. These research aims will be integrated with educational objectives
via the development of a scaffolded set of classroom-based undergraduate
research experiences, and the creation of a learning and mentoring community
focused around biodiversity and evolutionary genetics. The project will also
support the development of K12 STEM teachers in rural communities by engaging
and training pre-service teachers in the principles of evolutionary biology and
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
