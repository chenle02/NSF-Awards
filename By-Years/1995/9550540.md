9550540 Lochhead Building on the successful development of four challenge-
enhanced, replacement science curriculum units for grade 9-12, the aim of this
project is to create and publish 12 units that use design challenges while still
emphasizing the learning of science concepts. Design and Technology for Science
includes challenges that involve biology, physical science, physics, integrated
sciences, and technology education topics. The curriculum focuses upon selective
process skills: information-gathering, designing, and planning and conducting
experiments. The units address national Standards and teach integrated science-
technology in a work-related context useful both in academic and vocational
programs. The units can be used flexibly by teachers who are creating science
and technology courses and by technology education teachers who want to
experiment with open-ended, constructivist-based materials that emphasize the
acquisition of science concepts. Optional low technology activities support the
use of microcomputer-based laboratory equipment in the classroom as well as the
use of graph-generating spreadsheets to collect and display data. Thus, students
take on the role of scientists and engineers as they experience hypothesis
generating-testing and design cycles in real-world settings, and engage in tasks
that integrate a wide range of scientific and technology-oriented skills and
concepts.
