This award supports the dissertation research of a graduate student in cultural
anthropology who will study changing gender relations in a pastoralist area of
east Africa. The research will analyze how changing local conceptions of social
and economic class and age affect gender relations in an overall situation of
fairly rapid and significant socio-economic development. Most studies on this
question have shown that development policies are slanted in favor of men, and
result in decreases in the standard of living of women and children relative to
changes for men. This project will look at these relationships in more detail.
The design is to compare three villages varying on dimensions of development and
income, using a combination of intensive ethnography, formal surveys, and
analysis of historical documents. The student has lived in this area before for
several years, and has the necessary linguistic skills, social and political
contacts to carry the research out. This research is important because gender
relations in economic development schemes have become a major focus of attention
in recent years. This detailed case study will provide material of value to
policy makers so that new projects can be designed that benefit women (and the
children who are in their care) as well as men.
