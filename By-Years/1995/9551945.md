To strengthen its undergraduate curriculum, the Department of Biology has
recently instituted a series of undergraduate research courses required for the
Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. The course series (1) begins with a
course in scientific methods and research proposal development, (2) continues
with a semester of directed undergraduate research, and (3) concludes with a
symposium presentation and a written thesis or journal publication.
Additionally, two new interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree programs with
concentrations in hazardous waste management or natural and cultural resources
management have been developed. This project provides new equipment to support
interdisciplinary undergraduate research activities to detect heavy metals and
chlorinated organic compounds in environmental samples; examine the transport of
these substances through water, soils, and sediments; and investigate the
applied use of plants and microorganisms in bioremediation. Additionally, the
equipment undoubtedly enhances the educational experience in the courses
physical geology, physical geography, soils, environmental chemistry, and
toxicological chemistry within the management degree programs. The major
equipment items include an automated gas chromatograph, an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer with computer station for equipment control and data analysis,
lab-top centrifuge with rotors, two bench-top incubator shakers, a portable
hand-operated sieve shaker, and a Spectronic 20, single-beam spectrophotometer.
The undergraduate research program, the envirolmental programs, and this new
equipment are essential components of the university's mission to seek a high
level of excellence in undergraduate education including the natural and
physical sciences.
