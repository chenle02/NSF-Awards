The overall goal of this work is to develop the computational tools to better
study "shaken baby syndrome". This project will develop highly accurate parallel
adaptive Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin techniques for the simulation of
fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. These techniques will be central to the
development of high fidelity simulation tools for investigation of pediatric
brain injury mechanisms and preventative strategies. Even the most powerful
computers today using the best available codes would need weeks or months to do
these calculations. Moreover, even those heroic calculations would not provide
reasonable simulations due to the poor numerical accuracy of the lower order
(O(h)) finite element / finite difference schemes and explicit time integration
schemes (O(Dt)) used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key element of the new strategy
is the development and use of parallel adaptive hp Lagrangian discontinuous
Galerkin schemes that provide the accuracy and efficiency necessary for dealing
with the complex geometric and material structure of the brain tissue,
associated membranes, and blood vessels. These schemes will enable the use of
higher order approximations to obtain accuracies that are O(hp) and O(Dtk), for
p, k &gt; 1. While the pediatric brain injury application will drive the
research into this new class of parallel computational techniques, the codes and
methodology should be useful for a much wider class of problems.&lt;br/&gt;
