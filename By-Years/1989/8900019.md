This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Beverly Chilton of
Texas Tech University and Dr. D. W. Bullock of Lincoln College, Canterbury. One
goal of this work is to determine whether prolectin in combination with
progesterone alter transformation and modification of uterine cells. More
specifically, considering the prolectin/progestrone environment, the
investigators intend to isolate a gene (uterglobin) which can transform and
modify uterine cells through binding with these cells. The project continues the
collaboration of these scientists who have worked on general definition of the
mechanisms by which prolactin enhances uterine response to progestrone. The
research will benefit from the recent major committment in space and facilities
made by Lincoln College to expansion to work in molecular biology. In addition,
interaction with investigators in molecular-and endocrine- related areas at
Australian instiutions such as DSIR, MAFTech, and the University of Centerbury
are anticipated. The research should add considerable to basic knowledge of
reproductive physiology, and has the potential of developing into practical
applications for regulating uterine fertility.
