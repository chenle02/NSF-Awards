This project concerns the mapping class group, which is the group of isotopy
classes of homeomorphisms of a surface. There is particular emphasis on the
Torelli group, the subgroup consisting of elements that act trivially on the
homology of the surface. We take a three- pronged approach, on the homological,
dynamical, and group-theoretical properties of mapping class groups. The
techniques include methods from combinatorial Morse theory, Teichmuller theory,
and geometric group theory. In joint work with Bestvina and Bux, we aim to
determine the homological finiteness properties of the Torelli groups; in
particular to answer the famous question of whether or not they are finitely
presented. With Farb and Leininger, we work on understanding the structure of
all low entropy pseudo-Anosovs; in particular to address the Symmetry
Conjecture, which asserts that all such pseudo- Anosovs are obtained as the
product of a rotation with a map supported on a subsurface of uniformly bounded
genus. With Brendle, we study the group structure of the hyperelliptic Torelli
group, in particular focused on the conjecture of Hain, which states that the
group is generated by Dehn twists.

The focus of this project is the mapping class group, which is the collection of
symmetries of a surface, such as a sphere or a torus. This is a central object
in mathematics, with connections to algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and
dynamics. Discoveries in this area have had influence on fields outside of
mathematics, such as string theory and cryptography. With my collaborators, I
have made progress on decades-old questions about the global structure of
mapping class group, and this project is dedicated to answering some of the most
important remaining questions. The techniques involved in this study are wide-
ranging, from combinatorial, to algebraic, to topological, to dynamical, and the
proposed work has applications to algebraic geometry, 3-manifolds, and group
theory. I will work on the research aspects of the proposal with several
collaborators and with students at various levels. In addition, I will host a
workshop for young researchers in topology, with the aim of training and
cultivating future researchers and educators.
