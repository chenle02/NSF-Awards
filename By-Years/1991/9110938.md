Real-time computer systems perform computations and I/O operations in a time
frame defined by processes in the external environment. This research addresses
the class of real-time systems characterized by the existence of strict timing
constraints that must be satisfied if the system is to function correctly. The
goal is to develop methods for assessing and ensuring the temporal correctness
of such real-time systems. There are two main thrusts to this research. The
first is the creation and analysis of more pragmatic models of real-time
systems. The goal is to extend the theory of deterministic scheduling and
resource allocation to encompass more realistic assumptions about program
behaviors and to accommodate new forms of timing constraints motivated by the
development of technologies such as digital video and high speed local area
networks. The second focus is on the design and construction of operating system
kernels that efficiently support the process model and scheduling policies
indicated by the analysis of the resource allocation problems. The goal is to
provide a facility for the predictable execution of real-time applications.
