9500021 Jiracek The Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience (SAGE) supplemented
by this REU program focuses modern geophysical methods on a major geologic
problem. Undergraduates first spend four summer weeks doing hands-on research
into the structure and tectonics of the Rio Grande rift using seismic reflection
and refraction, gravity, magnetics, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics,
and magnetotellurics. Follow the fields segment, most REU students continue
their research at their home campus or at one-week workshops held during the
following academic year. Students participate in every phase of the field
program; they process and interpret data and present results in both oral and
written form. The SAGE format provides extremely close interaction between
faculty and students, as all reside together. SAGE is sponsored by Los Alamos
National Laboratory and 5 schools, who furnish both faculty and equipment.
Additional equipment, workstations, and speakers are provided by SAGE Industrial
Affiliates, which includes major energy companies, contractors, and computer
manufacturers. The award supports 15 undergraduates, who join an equal number of
graduate students.
