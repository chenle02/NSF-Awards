Research in areas such as modeling and simulation, AI and machine learning,
large-scale geospatial analysis, automated data mining of large digital text and
image collections, and bioengineering produce terabyte and petabyte-scale data
sets that require production-level storage, access, and transfer services. The
Rice Collaborative Object Store adds an S3 compatible resource to on-campus
cyberinfrastructure services, providing much needed capacity for multi-terabyte
data, making that data available for local -or distant- computational analysis,
sharing with distributed collaborations, or available for public access. As the
research computing and data applications expand across fields, there is a need
to create opportunities for workforce development in the area of
cyberinfrastructure. This project introduces students to the advanced computing
ecosystem, providing training on local storage and compute resources, and user
facilitation. These student trainees actively participate in research engagement
with the collaborating use case groups to utilize this new resource and the Open
Storage Network (OSN).

The Rice Collaborative Object Store node joins the production-level OSN, which
is part of the nationâ€™s growing federated data fabric. Providing low-cost,
efficient services based on open-source software, the OSN has nodes at many of
the national or regional advanced computing centers. The system consists of
three compute nodes in a high availability configuration, 1.9PB disk, and Ceph
storage software, connected at 100 gigabits from the Rice University ScienceDMZ
network. The resource contributes 20% of the available storage to the common OSN
allocation pool that is available to researchers across the U.S.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
