The 23rd Quantum Information Processing Workshop (QIP 2020) will be held in
Shenzhen, China from January 4th to 10th, 2020. This workshop is the central
event in the area of Quantum Computing and, more generally, Quantum Information
Science, bringing together over 600 of the leading international researchers in
theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation, and play a role as
one of the most important venues for the groundbreaking research in theoretical
computer science. Students attending this event receive a broad exposure to the
most novel and exciting ideas and results in the field through contributed
talks, poster sessions, rump sessions, tutorial sessions, and industry sessions.
In addition, participation in this top conference is an excellent opportunity
for young researchers to develop necessary research skills in presentation and
collaborations. By enabling the attendance of students with financial difficulty
and encouraging the diversity of the participants, this travel grant potentially
has long-term benefits after QIP 2020 has concluded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project funds the participation of 20 US-based students in this event.
Participation at this meeting will enhance the research experiences for students
and provide increased opportunities for new collaborations. Organizers seek to
increase the number of student and postdoctoral participants by targeting women,
undergraduates, and under-represented groups for participation. The aim is to
support young researchers who might not otherwise be able to attend QIP 2020 due
to financial difficulty as well as to encourage the diversity of the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
