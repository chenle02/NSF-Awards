This targeted research project is investigating and developing tools and social
protocols to make more feasible the management and maintenance of distributed
digital library collections in which authors put material into the library and
librarians (collection managers) organize and annotate it for the library
patrons. While such "author-based" approaches enable a digital library to grow
rapidly, they can create confusion as resources are added, deleted, or changed
without warning. In the case of web sites that are pointed to, noticing when
those web sites go away, are rehosted, or change their underlying structure is
very time consuming. Additionally, when changes are made to the content of the
resources, the collection manager must decide if the new version is still
suitable for the collection and, if so, whether the document needs to be
recategorized. Towards the goal of improving the ability of collection managers
to maintain distributed digital libraries this project is developing: i)
algorithms and heuristics for identifying resources no longer available; ii)
methods for identifying the relocation of resources; iii) methods for
categorizing and evaluating the significance of changes to resources; and iv)
tools supporting social mechanisms (between resource authors, library managers,
and library patrons) to contend with document changes. The project plan includes
the evaluation of identification and categorization algorithms based on
technical and social metrics. These evaluations answer whether the algorithms
correctly identify network and server problems, whether resources that have been
moved are successfully located, and whether ratings of significance of change
match those of human evaluators. &lt;br/&gt;
