Friedlander-Abstract

The relationship between algebraic K-theory and algebraic cycles is of
fundamental importance. Friedlander proposes to consider his investigations of
this relationship by continuing to contemplate the spectral sequence developed
in collaboration with Suslin and by studying Chern classes to various cohomology
theories. Much of Friedlander's effort will be directed to semi-topological
K-theory (being developed in collaboration with Mark Walker) and its
relationship with morphic cohomology (developed in collaboration with Blaine
Lawson). Friedlander also proposes to further investigate the representation
theory of algebras related to algebraic groups, in part through the thesis work
of several Ph.D. students.

Throughout the twentieth century, algebraic topology (mathematics of "bending
and twisting") and algebraic geometry (mathematics of "surfaces" coming from
graphing polynomial equations) enjoyed a very positive interactive relationship.
The types of geometric objects ("surfaces") studied by topologists can be more
general than geometric "surfaces" called algebraic varieties, but many of the
most basic and interesting topological "surfaces" are algebraic varieties.
Constructions and techniques arising naturally in either geometry or topology
continue to be successfully imported to the other area, often with surprising
computational or conceptual results. Much of the proposed work is to use
techniques and to pose questions that are topological in character to gain a
better understanding of some central aspects of algebraic geometry.
