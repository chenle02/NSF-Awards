Abstract 0819567 Rahmatallah Shoureshi University of Denver

A US-Europe workshop is organized which will address Hierarchical Organization
of Biological and Engineering Design and Control of Intelligent Systems, an
emerging technology area that would advance engineering and bio, micro, and nano
technologies on an integrated platform. The workshop timely follows foot steps
of NSF's Workshop on Biosensing and Bioactuation held at University of Maryland
in November 2007.

This workshop is scheduled to be held in Italy in May, 2008. It is expected to
bring together expertise from US and Europe in: Biology & Bioengineering,
Advanced bio-inspired materials, and Nano and Micro Machatronics. Bio-inspired
system design needs to benefit from both biological understanding and
engineering innovations. The proposed workshop will be a strong
interdisciplinary effort that will bridge the gap between science and
engineering. This workshop will stimulate diverse domestic and international
talents to define a scientific and technological roadmap for biosensing,
bioactuation, and bio-inspired systems.

This workshop is jointly supported by NSF (CMMI/ENG & Statistics/MPS) and AFOSR.
