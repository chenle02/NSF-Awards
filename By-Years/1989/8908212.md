The research of Dr. Donald Deardorff is supported by the Synthetic Organic
Chemistry Program. Deardorff is an associate professor of chemistry at
Occidental College. He is studying new methods for the stereocontrolled
preparation of carbocyclic analogues of purine nucleosides, molecules having
important applications in the development of new medicines. In particular, new
approaches using organopalladium chemistry will be examined. The goal of the
project is to develop novel synthetic strategies which permit facile,
stereocontrolled access to both saturated and unsaturated carbocyclic analogues
of purine nucleosides. Strategies to be used make reiterative use of (pi-
allyl)palladium chemistry. Natural product targets used to showcase developed
synthetic technologies include neplanocin and aristeromycin. The introduction of
chirality into the synthesis will be accomplished by employing enzymatic
reactions to prepare key starting materials.
