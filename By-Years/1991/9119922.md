Current real-time systems have typically been designed under the assumption that
characteristics of the workload and the computing environment are both well-
known and well-specified at the time of system design. Future real-time systems,
however, will be required to operate in a more uncertain and stochastic
environment. As a result, the designers of these future systems face a much more
difficult task in developing resource scheduling algorithms and formally
establishing their performance, timing, and fault-tolerance properties. This
project is concerned with the design and performance evaluation of scheduling
algorithms for real-time systems operating in a stochastic environment. The
specific focus is on developing rigorous and formal approaches towards analyzing
and designing such systems in a wide range of settings including uniprocessor,
multiprocessor and fault-tolerant environments.
