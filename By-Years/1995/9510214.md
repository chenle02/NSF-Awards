This project is for Collaborative Research at Undergraduate Institutions,
involving biochemistry, molecular genetics and computational biology. A viral
microorganism that infects bacteria is the bacteriophage known as T4. Because it
has a relatively tiny genetic content, T4 has been a model genetic system
revealing many important principles of molecular biology over the years. The
entire gene sequence of T4 is now known, and more than 100 probable genes remain
uncharacterized. This project uses computer programs to analyze and select genes
of interest, molecular biology to clone and characterize the functions of their
purified products, and biophysics and biochemistry to study the phage proteins
and the host bacterial proteins with which they interact. Particular attention
is given to the potential role of these proteins in the context of microbial
ecology, under different environmental conditions in the natural habitat of the
host. This work has a potentially major impact on understanding mechanisms by
which viruses act on hosts, will lead to new tools for analyzing enzyme action,
and promises an integrated cross-disciplinary experience involving
undergraduates in research at the forefront of current techniques.
