This project will involve work on complex function theory using potential
theory and Riemann surface methods. The two areas of investigation are distinct
but related. First, work will be done on the geometry of image surfaces of
analytic functions - particularly inner functions defined in a disc, and entire
functions. The research derives from older work of Gross on the structure of
singularities of functions in the little Bloch space. The methods involve the
construction of Riemann surfaces using Brownian motion and potential theory. A
second thrust will be made into problems of circle packings in the plane,
motivated by a recent conjecture of Thurston. It is now established that one may
use circle packings to approximate classical conformal mappings. An alternate
approach to this theme will be pursued based on random walks which are expected
to provide a link between the graph and approximations to Brownian motion. This
work is expected to have application to numerical approximations to partial
differential equations as well as to potential theory and probability.
