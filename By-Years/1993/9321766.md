The proposed research covers a variety of topics in relativistic nuclear
physics. QCD sum rules will be applied to meson exchange models of nuclear
matter. The Nambu-Jona- Lasinio model will be used to study nucleon confinement
and nucleon correlators in nuclear matter. Nucleon structure will also be
explored in a quark-diquark model. ***
