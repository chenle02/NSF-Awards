The Doctoral Student Workshop, co-located with the Third Annual Conference in
Cognitive Systems, to be held at Atlanta (GA) in May 2015 aims at encouraging,
expanding and guiding the participation of young researchers starting their
research in cognitive computing. The Cognitive Systems conference attempts to
foster research carried out in the original spirit of AI, which aimed to design
and implement computer programs that exhibited the breadth, generality, and
flexibility often observed in human intelligence. Cognitive computing recently
has major successes represented by well known systems like IBM Watson program
and Apple Siri program among many others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference
sessions and workshops will help develop human research capital by enabling
interactions between senior and junior researchers and catalyzing new
collaborations. The doctoral student workshop will increase the exposure and
visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and train them
by providing early input and feedback in the field in an interactive and
constructive environment. The workshop is aimed at early- to mid-career PhDs,
specifically those in their second and third year of their PhD. &lt;br/&gt;
