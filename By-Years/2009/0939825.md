This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This grant will initiate a new project on the design of catalysts that can
harvest solar energy and relay this to the metal centers to promote the rate of
reactions or to induce desirable selectivity effects. Specifically, ligands are
designed to be in direct conjugation with the metal so that energy may be
transferred fast through bonds. Such chemistry will contribute to
environmentally benign methods for chemical synthesis as the reactions need only
sunlight to drive them, and they may lead to useful selectivities that could
only be achieved in this manner.

With this Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award, the
Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
Professor Kevin Burgess of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A & M
University. Professor Burgess' research efforts revolve around the development
of catalytic reactions for application in synthetic methodology. If successful,
these reactions will have an impact on synthesis in the pharmaceutical and
agricultural industries.
