Abstract

DMS-0304407

PI: Robert B. Lund

This research studies regression methods in time series settings with periodic
properties. The general goal of this work is to put statistical inference for
regression models with periodic error disturbances on the same footing as that
for its stationary brethren. The particular issues examined include (1) simple
linear regression for periodic series, (2) analysis of variance methods for
periodic series, (3) undocumented changepoint detection in periodic series, (4)
the adjustment of periodic series for documented and undocumented changepoint
times, and (5) trends in monthly extreme temperatures, and winter snow depths.
The work will advance and further connect the statistical areas of time series,
forecasting, extreme value analysis, and regression modeling.

On a practical level, the research will help resolve climate change issues
within the United States and, more generally, help quantify global warming. The
statistical methods developed will be used to study trends in United States
monthly extreme (maximum and minimum) and average temperatures. Trends in United
States snow cover (over seasonal maximums and snow water equivalent) will also
be examined
