Under the direction of Dr. Michael Schiffer, Mr. Axel Nielson will conduct
field research to collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will spend 18
months working in the community of Cerrillos located in the highlands of
Bolivia. Cerrillos is one of the few communities of the Bolivian Altiplano that
still practices a purely pastorial economy that has characterized the Andean
highlands for thousands of years. Inhabitants still maintain a long-distance
caravan trade using llamas as pack animals. Mr. Axel Nielson will conduct an
"ethnoarchaeological" study: that is he will examine present practices in an
attempt to understand the past. While it is known that pastoralism was practiced
prehistorically in many parts of the world, it is not well understood what role
this way of life played in the development of complex civilizations. In part
this is because archaeologists don't understand how to interpret the material
remains they recover. It is not clear what kind of archaeological "signals" a
pastoral way of life leaves on the ground. Mr. Nielson research will visit all
households in the community and select several for intensive study. He will
participate in caravan trips and in the main non-daily activities carried out
throughout the annual cycle. He will survey pastures and water resources and
conduct an in-depth analysis of surface refuse distributions at selected
settlements. This research is important because it will provide scientists with
the tools to interpret a little-understood aspect of the past. A major road
construction program is planned for this region and the behaviors Mr. Nielson
plans to observe will soon disappear. The project will also assist in the
training of a promising young scientist.
