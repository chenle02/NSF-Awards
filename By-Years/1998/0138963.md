Professor Christa Colyer of Wake Forest University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to perform studies on the use of
noncovalent dye labels for protein detection by Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)
after seperation by capillary electrophoresis (CE). LIF detection requires
labeling of proteins with fluorescent dyes. The proposed work aims to label
proteins noncovalently using dyes that are excited by near infrared photons,
allowing the eventual use of cheap laser diodes aboard microchip CE. Seperation
and quantitation of proteins, epecially from ultrasmall volumes, represents a
particular challenge in analytical chemistry. CE requires only nanoliters of
sample and so is appropriate for investigating the fluids of single cells. The
methods are of great use in the investigation of proteomics.
