This proposal seeks support to enhance the scientific skills of 72 middle
school teachers in Northern Florida and Southern Georgia. The project is for
three years and is designed to help the middle school teachers improve their
knowledge and understanding of science. The project also aims to decrease the
isolation of these teachers by increasing the communication between and among
teachers and a university- based team. These needs will be met through the
following set of interrelated activities: (a) Course work in science content and
curriculum and instruction; (b) Activities including seminar series on: the use
of computers for research, communication and instruction; issues in science
education, such as special needs of minority and female students, and current
topics in science; and leadership training; (c) Research in both science and
science education; (d) Short and extended site visits; and (e) Communication
including electronic mail, and meetings during the academic year. Teachers
participating in the project have the opportunity to complete the program in
three years and will have met the requirements for a Masters' Degree in Science
Education. Cost sharing is equivalent to 30% of the NSF award.
