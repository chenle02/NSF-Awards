Problems of fundamental physics in the context of string theory and gravity can
often be rephrased purely as problems in geometry, the space of vacua of string
theory and in particular the spectrum of supersymmetric (BPS) objects on them.
On certain "walls" in the moduli space of vacua, a BPS object can decay to less
massive BPS objects. Such a wallcrossing phenomenon has an extremely rich and
mysterious mathematical structure. It is proposed to study wall-crossings from
various points of views including vacua with high number of supersymmetries,
applying tools of mirror symmetry and string dualities. Understanding the
spectrum of BPS objects is important for calculating black hole entropy and
topological string theory. The PI proposes to uncover new geometrical invariants
which are necessary for physically characterizing these string vacua, and
explore the implications of a recently defined quasi-local mass which satisfies
all known consistency conditions. The projects address exciting questions that
have important implications for theoretical physics, and for differential and
algebraic geometry. Central to the proposal is the training of postdoctoral
fellows and graduate students to conduct cutting edge cross-disciplinary
research and to be effective in interacting with both the physics and
mathematics communities.
