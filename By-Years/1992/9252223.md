The beginning algebra skills class and the first-year calculus course are being
taught with computer classroom instruction as an integral part of the course
beginning with the 1991-92 academic year. The developing courses are focusing on
concept development, understanding, applications, and the use of technology to
enhance learning. Materials being developed as a part of the Five Colleges
Calculus project are being adapted and site tested as a part of this activity.
Approximately 700 students, the majority being female, continuing education and
mathematics education students, are enrolled in mathematics courses at Aquinas
each year and are benefiting from this laboratory and these approaches.
