Dr. Philip Kohl, in a collaborative project with Russian archaeological
colleagues, will lay the groundwork for a long- term archaeological research
project in the Transcaucasia region of Southern Russia. The team will examine
what are essentially uninvestigated remains which include large fortified Bronze
and Iron Age hilltop sites and burial mounds. Archaeological deposits from
earlier Mesolithic and Neolithic periods will also be examined. Sites will be
mapped using aerial techniques and surface materials collected. This research is
important for several reasons. First, although the Transcaucasia area is known
to be rich in archeological remains, very little systematic work has been
conducted. This project will help to fill that gap. Secondly, because of its
richness in raw materials such as obsidian (volcanic glass) and metals which
were widely valued in prehistory, this area probably played a major role in the
development of complex Old World societies, and research here will shed
additional light on prehistoric development over a broad geographic area.
Finally, Dr. Kohl's work should help to solidify ties between U.S. and Russian
archaeologists and open the way for future collaborative research.
