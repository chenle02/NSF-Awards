Newark Campus Course and Curriculum Newark, NJ 07102 Physics Title: Innovative
Introductory Physics Laboratory Course An Innovative Introductory Physics
Laboratory Course at Rutgers-Newark is designed to improve the understanding and
appreciation of the laws of physics, and of the instrumentation and methods of
modern physics and technology. The course which uses transducers interfaced to
microcomputers will be further developed and expanded during the period of the
present proposal, and the results adapted for and shared with a diverse
population of high school teachers and their students and 2 year college faculty
and students. The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark student body and the geography
and demographics of the Newark area, coupled with significant outreach efforts,
ensures a large minority student participation in this project. Teaching and
learning strategies geared to the needs of a diverse urban student population
will be developed. These strategies will utilize non intimidating but rigorous
discovery based and goal oriented experiments and will provide a meaningful and
accurate introduction to the excitement and creativity of scientific discovery
and analysis. The course will develop and use modern sensors for motion, force,
temperature, sound and electromagnetic field measurements. The sensors are
interfaced to microcomputers, allowing the students to acquire data and analyze
their measurements rapidly in order to explore alternative physical hypotheses.
The project will attract more students into physics and engineering, and will
produce better educated students with critical analytical skills in all majors.
