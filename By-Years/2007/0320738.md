With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Saint Olaf College will acquire a liquid
chromatograph-ion trap mass spectrometer (LC/MS) with electrospray/atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization. This equipment will enhance research in a number
of areas including a) studies on the abundance and structural forms of
therapeutic agents, metabolites, personal care products and their degradation
products in surface water systems located in agricultural areas; and b)
analytical methods development combined with biochemical combinatorial synthesis
with a goal towards understanding how an array of chemical structures influence
receptor binding sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid chromatography with mass
spectrometric detection (LC/MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
separation and analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially
strengthen scientific research at the Saint Olaf College, a primarily
undergraduate institution. These studies will have a solid impact in the area of
environmental chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
