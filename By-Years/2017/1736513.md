Subduction Zones are geologic faults that begin offshore where one tectonic
plate slides beneath another. Due to friction along the fault some of the down-
going plate motion is slowly transferred to the upper plate which bends and
contracts storing the motion. Occasionally, this built-up motion is rapidly
released as an earthquake and displaces the sea floor causing a tsunami. The
Cascadia subduction zone offshore northern California, Oregon and Washington and
the Aleutian subduction zone offshore Alaska have generated large earthquakes
and tsunami in the past and will do so again. Measuring where and how fast this
slow build-up occurs can improve understanding of the potential hazard. This
requires offshore seafloor sensors to collect data, and in the past, ships to
access this data. In this project, new methods will be develop and tested that
use fewer instruments and remotely-piloted, self-powered sea surface vehicles,
rather than ships, to lower the cost of data
collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a one-year project to implement
acoustic upload of data from the sea floor to a wave- and solar-powered sea
surface vehicle, and test a new lower cost method of collecting GPS-Acoustic
data in shallow water (&lt; 200 m) using a single seafloor transponder. An
onboard computer will be programed to control the acoustic ranging system to
operate in modem mode. A pressure sensor embedded with a transponder will be
deployed offshore SIO to test the upload capability at varying ranges and
depths. In addition, a transponder will be deployed offshore SIO and the sea
surface vehicle will be operated remotely to circle the transponder for up to
two weeks collecting GPS-Acoustic data. We will then evaluate if repeatability
of positioning in shallow water is comparable to the existing GPS-Acoustic
approach where data are collected from the center of an array comprised of three
or more transponders.
