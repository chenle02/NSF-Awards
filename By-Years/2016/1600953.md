Combinatorics is an active and central branch of pure and applied mathematics.
Because the field is concerned with the development of tools for analyzing,
organizing, and arranging discrete data, combinatorial methods are essential in
many scientific areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and
physics. The methods can often be traced back to research inspired by problems
in algebra and geometry. For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is
based on a combinatorial result in modular arithmetic. This research project is
devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that
connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a
subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics. The
investigation will make use of a computational symbolic algebra system and will
further develop the SAGE open-source mathematics software suite.

This research project spans combinatorial problems in representation theory,
algebraic geometry, and physics. The inspiration comes from the central
importance of constructions such as tableaux and Bruhat posets in the classical
studies of representations of the complex linear group and Schubert calculus.
The precision of combinatorics is carried to more abstract problems by a
distinguished Schur basis for the algebra of symmetric functions. The project
concerns variations on the classical theories that address subtle questions
about geometric Gromov-Witten invariants, symmetric functions over a field of
parameters, bi-graded representations, and quantum integrable systems. A
priority is to develop the necessary combinatorial framework for the
contemporary set of problems. The venture goes hand in hand with an
investigation of refined physical, geometric, and algebraic theories attached to
the combinatorics. The resulting combinatorial constructions will lend
computational facility to related application areas.
