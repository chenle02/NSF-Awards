A 3D model capable of efficiently simulating nonlinear gravity wave dynamics
has been developed and has shown that the dynamics of wave breaking in the upper
mesosphere and lower thermosphere, or mesopause region, is inherently three-
dimensional in nature. The PIs propose to modify this model to more accurately
simulate conditions in the mesopause region, and then couple the dynamical model
to a chemical airglow model for the purpose of studying the effects of nonlinear
gravity wave motions on mesopause region airglow. The coupled gravity wave and
airglow model will have the ability to treat the case of time-dependent
chemistry and will be able to simulate the effects of gravity waves on several
different mesopause region emissions. The model can then be used to strengthen
the role of airglow observations in understanding the dynamics of the mesopause
region. A comparison will be made between the model results and the results of
observations and linear theories.
