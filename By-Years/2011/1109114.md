This project will examine results from direct-imaging surveys of exoplanets
(planets orbiting other stars), and produce a distribution of planets from a
star that expands out to 1000 astronomical units from the parent star, where an
astronomical unit is approximately the average distance between the Sun and
Earth. New direct-imaging observations will be obtained, and data will also be
used from archival sources, as well as orbital measurements of planets detected
by other means, such as microlensing, radial velocity and transit techniques.
When feasible, follow-up spectroscopy will be performed of newly detected
planets. The modeling efforts will focus on whether there is a continuous
distribution of planets, or instead, any significant breaks are evident. The
team will also search for variations of planetary distance populations as a
function of stellar mass, age and iron content. The outcomes from these studies
are intended to provide strong tests of standard models of core-accretion planet
formation. As part of the process of identifying new planets from direct-
imaging, and ruling out background objects, the project is also expected to
reveal new high proper motion galactic halo stars. This project will provide
publicly-available software tools useful to the exoplanet and stellar stronomy
community. The PI will supervise and mentor undergraduate students, two doctoral
students, and a postdoctoral researcher.
