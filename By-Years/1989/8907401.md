The Trichoptera ("caddisflies") are distributed worldwide, they constitute an
important component of aquatic communities, and their larval capsules are used
as environmental quality indicators. Past taxonomic work has produced a
confusion of genus names and classifications, resulting from a failure to
compare Old and New World representatives. Dr. John Weaver proposes a revision
of the caddisfly family Lepidostomatidae (almost 300 species) from around the
world. A variety of adult characters will be used, resulting in descriptions of
new species, clarification of the limitations and classification of genera, and
publication of identification guides. Caddisflies are an important component of
stream habitats, and a worldwide revision would have impact on many areas of
research. Ecologists and environmental quality researchers would have reliable
criteria for identifying species, thereby improving our understanding of
nutrient flow in streams. The proposed generic revision would also provide a
foundation for future studies of caddisfly evolution and biogeography.
