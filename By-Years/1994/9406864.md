9406864 Sinclair This research is to develop an alternative failure criteria to
the standard stress intensity factor. The new approach relies on novel modeling
of the cracks to achieve better estimates of the crack tip stress fields. The
crack is assumed to be an elipse whose root radius is determined from atomic
force versus separation laws. ***
