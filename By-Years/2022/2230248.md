The National Science Foundation Historically Black Colleges and Universities
Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports projects that enhance undergraduate
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research
at HBCUs, as means to broaden participation in the nation's STEM workforce. This
HBCU-UP equipment award provides Florida A&amp;M University with funding to
support the purchase of a measurement system for near field passive measurement
and over the air measurement of antenna, antenna array, and electromagnetic
devices. This equipment supports research, teaching, and learning objectives in
electromagnetics, field propagation, high frequency circuit design, antenna, and
microwave measurement for undergraduate students and faculty in the Department
of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
