This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
native oxide confined heterostructure bipolar transistor. Oxidation of AlGaAs
has been successfully applied to a number of photonic and electronic devices
since its discovery in 1990. In particular, it is a critical technology for
current confinement in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers. This program
will design and develop native oxidation for application to AlGaAs
heterostructure bipolar transistors in order to increase the breakdown voltage-
frequency product, improve the reliability and efficiency of these devices. A
study of the oxidation properties of AlGaAs as it applies to heterostructure
bipolar transistors will be performed. Prototype AlGaAs heterostructure bipolar
transistors will be fabricated and delivered in Phase I. In Phase II the
technology will be extended to more complex device designs, including double
heterostructure bipolar transistors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercially the
project will address the need for improved performance in AlGaAs heterostructure
bipolar transistors for power amplifier applications. AlGaAs heterostructure
bipolar transistors with increased breakdown-voltage-frequency products would
benefit current markets for wireless communications.
