This project enhances electronics education at this community college. Students
are able to use this institution's automated circuits laboratory stations to:
calculate and set circuit parameters for their circuit designs, analyze circuit
performance using the computer simulator, and test the hardware version of their
design for its real behavior. The equipment that supports this lab, primarily
from Hewlett Packard, includes: Measurement Automation Systems, display
interfaces and resource managers, graphics printers, function generators,
digital multimeters, dual channel digital oscilloscopes, multimeters, power
supplies and programmable scanners. This award is being matched by an equal sum
from the grantee.
