The project is a continuation of research focused on a combination of data-
analysis using multi-point observations of magnetospheric substorm phenomena and
theoretical development of a substorm onset mechanism involving plasma
instabilities. Analysis will focus on isolated substorms using data from the
ground based arrays, the suite of ISTP satellites as well as others not in the
ISTP program such as DMSP. The analysis will focus on the conversion of magnetic
field energy to particle kinetic energy during the expansion phase and the
temporal and spatial relations of events observed on the ground and in space.
Results will be utilized to evaluate various substorm models and to guide the
theoretical development of the expansion onset mechanism.
