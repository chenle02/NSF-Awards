9412724 Magee This project involves a collaboration between French scientists
from the (French Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC))
Institut National des Sciences Appliquees (INSA-Lyon) and the University Claude
Bernard, and American engineers from I/UCRC for Hazardous Substance Management
Research at New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. The
objective of this research is to establish a scientific methodology that brings
together in a more comprehensive way the microbial, physico- chemical, and
engineering considerations needed to understand, plan, and diagnose in-situ
bioremediation projects. This project involves (1) selection of various soil
matrices from both the U.S. and Europe; (2) addition od substituted aromatic
compounds as model pollutants to the soils; (3) adsorption/desorption
measurements; (4) description of the microbial ecology; (5) investigation of the
impact of chemotaxis; (6) determination of the biokinetic rates and parameters
in batch flask and soil columns under aerobic and denitrifying conditions; and
(7) selection of suitable sites in both the U.S. and France for field tests of
the laboratory conclusions and methodologies. The researchers of both I/UCRCs
are well qualified to perform this joint research project. An evaluator is
funded to study the international industry/university interaction occurring
during this project. The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey
Institute of Technology be awarded $264,000 for 36 months ($240,000 for the
project and $24,000 for the evaluation study).
