This is a Minority Research Initiation award for developing a research proposal
involving the applicability of Japanese manufacturing culture and management to
U.S. manufacturing. The management and organization of manufacturing is widely
recognized as a major problem in the drive to increase U.S. manufacturing
productivity. This award will lead to a research proposal which will investigate
the transferability and applicability of Japanese practices to the U.S. setting.
