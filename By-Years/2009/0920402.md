among animals, from films of bacteria, to flocks of birds, to schools of whales.
Observations of such coordination between individuals have inspired computer
scientists and roboticists to try to build swarm-inspired devices. Theoretical
work has shown that individuals with simple behavioral and communication rules
can exhibit complex swarming behavior. Nevertheless, there remains a need for
experiments that clearly show the nature of information that is being exchanged
between individuals. Ants are unique among cooperative animals in that they
overcome physical obstacles by linking together to form self-assemblages such as
ladders, chains, walls and rafts. This is a simplified type of swarm behavior,
in which members of the swarm interact through physical contact with their
nearest neighbors. Such a model system allows us to visualize, to a high degree,
the dynamics and communication within the swarm. This system will be studied by
adapting high-precision measurement devices called rheometers, typically used to
study inanimate materials, to examine small-scale swarming behavior. The
physical cues that the ants use to communicate will be determined and general
principles for swarm robotics will be developed. Graduate students will be
involved in the project and undergraduate students, including those from groups
underrepresented in science and engineering, will be recruited to participate in
the research. In addition, an after-school program about bio-inspired design
will be initiated at a nearby high school. &lt;br/&gt;
