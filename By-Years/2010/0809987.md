In this award funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor David Jonas of University of Colorado will use
two-dimensional spectroscopy to study the role of the phase of an optical
excitation pulse on the dynamical control of molecular systems. In particular,
three broad areas will be examined. First, an approach for removing propagation
distortions in femtosecond 2D spectra of strongly absorbing samples will be
tested. Two-dimensional spectroscopy will then be used to probe the speed of
electronic motion from one orbital to another via conical intersections, which
are an important mechanism that facilitates bonding changes during chemical
reactions. Finally, shaped femtosecond pulses will be used to determine whether
phase control of weak laser fields can modify the outcome of light-driven
reactions in condensed phases without changing the intensity spectrum of the
light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional Fourier transform infrared and
optical spectroscopy is a relatively new technique that has the potential of
becoming an important analytical tool for the measurement of new molecular
properties. Just as in 2D-NMR, analogous 2D optical and infrared Fourier
transform spectra show characteristic spectra in two-dimensional patterns that
reveal adjacent bonds and their relative geometry. In particular, these studies
will help establish the theory behind the types of multidimensional electronic
spectroscopies currently being applied to a range of scientific problems.
Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who participate in this
research acquire new knowledge and skills in preparation for advanced studies or
entrance into the scientific/technological job market.&lt;br/&gt;
