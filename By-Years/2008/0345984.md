Victor Batista of Yale University is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry Program through a CAREER award to develop rigorous time-
dependent methods for simulating quantum processes in polyatomic systems. He
will apply these new methods in a computational study of photodissociation
dynamics in hydrated complexes, with emphasis on the ozone-water system. Also,
he will develop educational activities that introduce this novel research into
the undergraduate curriculum via the exchange and distribution of pedagogical
material on the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational studies such
as these address fundamental aspects of ozone reactivity at a detailed molecular
level, with high confidence that the methodology is accurate and tractable. The
impact of such studies is likely to add to the understanding of stratospheric
ozone depletion, changes in global climate, and the use of ozone in water
treatment processes. The educational activities introduce a selection of topical
research problems to the undergraduate science education, and the web archive
creates a public domain resource where both students and teachers can exchange
multiple approaches to the subject matter.
