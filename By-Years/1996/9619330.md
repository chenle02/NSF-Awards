Statistical data are often measured with errors. Many of the theoretical
constructions of economic, psychological, and sociological models also depend on
conceptual variables that are unobservable (e.g., permanent income, rational
expectation). To obtain meaningful statistical inference for models containing
unobservable variables requires either the expansion of existing data bases with
more precise measurements of variables of interest, or the development of
analytical frameworks to extract relevant information from currently available
data sources. Through the support of previous NSF grants, it has been
demonstrated that a structural approach, while often imposing hypothetical
assumptions, can yield useful information if properly conducted, and hence not
only provides a means to take advantage of information that otherwise might be
misused or totally ignored, but is also more economical. This award further
investigates the identification, estimation, and statistical inference of (i)
nonstationary time series or nonlinear models when variables are subject to
random measurement errors; (ii) systematic measurement errors in sample surveys;
(iii) the implicit market of attributes which forms the basis of new measurement
of inflation rate and other complicated market analysis and; (iv) unobserved
heterogeneity in panel data analysis. Classical parametric and nonparametric
methods and Bayesian inference via Monte Carlo (Gibbs Sampling) methods will be
explored. It is hoped that a successful completion of the project will provide
additional repertoire of tools to enhance the reliability and validity of the
research usefulness of federal or private statistical data.
