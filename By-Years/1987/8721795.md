From the 19th century on, farmers have turned to science to try to resolve many
of their more intractable problems. Dr. Wright is examining one of the efforts
on the part of chemists in the United States to help extricate farmers from the
effects of the Great Depression of the 1930's. These "Chemurgists" (a term
combining the Greek root for work with "chemistry"), led by Dow Chemical's
William J. Hale, claimed that "economic recovery would be achieved in the
laboratory, not the legislature," or, put more starkly, that internal
developments in chemistry dictated technological and economic policy. Backed by
the powerful Chemical Foundation, the Chemurgists promoted their ideas in the
technical literature and in the political arena as an alternative to the New
Deal's efforts at agricultural assistance. As their central demonstration
project, the Chemurgists produced and marketed power alcohol (or "agrol") in the
late 1930's setting off political and chemical controversies. In his study, Dr.
Wright will examine four questions: 1. What did Hale believe he discovered about
the relation of chemical research to national agricultural policy that caused
him to abandon a highly successful career as a chemist and research
administrator to become a Chemurgic proselytizer? 2. Should Chemurgy be
considered a successful applied research program? 3. Why was there such
protracted expert disagreement over the technical and economic adequacy of
Chemurgy's alcohol fuels given their simple chemical structure? 4. Was Chemurgy
successful as a political movement? In addressing these questions, Dr. Wright
will examine the ways both Chemurgists and their antagonists constructed
narrative histories of science to justify or criticize Chemurgy's research and
political claims. This study promises to enhance our understanding of the role
of science in agriculture in the 20th century and, more generally, the social
and political implications inherent in applied research.
