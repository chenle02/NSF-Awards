meristem (SAM) is responsible for development of all above ground organs in the
plant. Despite its essential roles during organogenesis, the molecular
mechanisms regulating SAM function are poorly understood. Owing to a unique
combination of biological advantages and genomic resources, maize is
particularly well positioned for investigations of the genetic networks
underlying SAM structure, function, and heterogeneity on a genomic scale. This
project will address five specific objectives: (1) genetic characterization of
candidate genes implicated in the regulation of SAM gene function and maize leaf
patterning; (2) use of laser microdissection and transcript profiling to
identify genes expressed during SAM initiation and development ; (3)
identification of small RNA-controlled networks in SAM meristem function; (4)
identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling SAM architecture;
and (5) identification of novel alleles (haplotypes) contributing to complex
leaf traits using linkage-disequilibrium mapping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader
impacts of proposed research: These genomic analyses of SAM function will
provide the intellectual framework for a strategy of scientific training and
public outreach designed to disseminate an understanding and appreciation of
plant science. Undergraduates at Truman State University, a small, public
liberal arts institution in Kirksville (MO) will be trained to perform
bioinformatic annotations of novel SAM genes, and carry out genetic, phenotypic,
and molecular analyses of maize SAM mutants generated during this project. The
Dolan DNA Learning Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will construct a
public website/podcast entitled "Weed to Wonder" that will present the history
of maize genetic research and celebrate its impact on human culture. All data
generated during this project will be released to public databases include
MaizeGDB (www.maizegdb.org) and Gramene (www.gramene.org), and seed harboring
newly discovered maize mutations will be released for public
distribution.&lt;br/&gt;
