This proposal seeks travel support for the 2010 IEEE International Symposium on
Performance Analysis of Systems and Software to be held on March 28-30, 2010 in
White Plains, NY. The ISPAS'10 student travel scholarships will be used to
target students that are typically underrepresented at computer science
conferences. The PIs are requesting funds to cover expenses of up to 20 US-based
students and junior faculty with no NSF travel support.
