Jimmie Doll of Brown University and David Freeman of University of Rhode Island
are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
Program to perform theoretical studies of the dynamics of many body systems with
specific applications to hydrogen in the near surface region of metals and
metallic clusters. They seek to provide a theoretical interpretation of recently
obtained depth-dependent experimental data on the spectroscopy and transport of
hydrogen in metals. Using a combination of conventional classical molecular
dynamics, diffusion Monte Carlo, protonic band calculations, and quantum
transition state methods, they will obtain theoretical insights into these
experimental observations. Hydrogen storage in metals and hydrogen embrittlement
are important technological problems. The fundamental work of Doll and Freeman
has a very good probability of providing significant theoretical insights into
these phenomena.
