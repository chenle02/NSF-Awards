With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
Program, the Department of Chemistry at New York University will purchase a Ion-
Trap Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
areas including 1) structure-based design of RNA binding ligands and the
fundamental rules governing RNA-proteomimetic recognition; 2) synthesis of
protein mimetics with novel properties; 3) construction of carbohydrate oligomer
mimetic libraries to discover artificial ligands for binding to proteins and
cell surfaces; 4) synthesis of chiro-optic switches; 5) development and
identification of novel, site-specific DNA base lesions; and 6) synthesis of
photoactive fullerene derivatives. The instrumentation will also be available to
researchers in the Faculty Resource Network (FRN), a consortium of 13
historically black colleges and universities in the South and 15 regional
liberal arts colleges.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. It is one of the fastest growing and most widely
used analytical instrumentation techniques. These studies will have a strong
impact in many fields, including biochemistry and materials science.
