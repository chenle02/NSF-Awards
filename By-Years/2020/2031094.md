Replication of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 – the causative agent of
COVID-19, is expected to involve protein factors from the infected host cell
that provide activities not encoded in the viral genome. This project focuses on
the need for the virus to co-opt a host 3’ to 5’ RNA helicase to synthesize the
negative-strand RNA that serves as template for copying the positive-strand
genome. A recent proteomic screen identified a candidate host helicase, DDX10,
that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The research will employ a suite of
experimental approaches to characterize this enzyme and two other host RNA
helicases also implicated in SARS-CoV-2 genome replication. Detailed knowledge
of how host proteins contribute to viral replication will provide new targets
for therapeutic intervention, importantly, in ways that help circumvent drug
resistance through viral mutation. The project will also support training of a
postdoctoral scholar and development of a new undergraduate biophysics course
centered on coronavirus-related topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biochemical and
biophysical techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM and single
molecule spectroscopy, will be applied to determine structure-function
properties that govern the helicase mechanism, including polarity, speed,
processivity and associated energetics, and how its interactions with the viral
NSP7/8 primase influence genome replication. The outcomes are expected to reveal
the workings of host proteins during SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thereby open
new avenues and novel drug targets to block its
proliferation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Genetic
Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using
funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)
Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
