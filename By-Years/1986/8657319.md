LeVeque is studying numerical methods for solving nonlinear partial
differential equations, particularly those arising in fluid dynamics such as the
Navier-Stokes equations or the inviscid Euler equations. The Euler equations are
a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with solutions that can involve shock
waves and other discontinuities. Special numerical methods are required to
determine highly accurate solutions with sharp dis- continuities. LeVeque is
studying a class of explicit methods that can be efficiently applied with large
time steps. This work involves both algorithmic aspects and extension of the
mathematical theory of wave interaction in nonlinear conservation laws. One
aspect of this work is the specification of boundary conditions with reasonable
time steps for bodies embedded in Cartesian grids. A related question, handled
by different techniques, is the proper specification of boundary conditions for
numerical methods that solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by
fractional steps. A sequence of easier subproblems is solved in each time step
that require special nonphysical boundary conditions. One application of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is to model wave propogation in the
cochlea (inner ear). LeVeque is involved in an ongoing project in this direction
with C. Peskin. LeVeque is also studying the interaction of solitary waves in
nonlinear partial differential equations such as the KdV equations arising in
elasticity.
