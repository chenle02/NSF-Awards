Mirczak This renovation project will modernize the Materials Research Center at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The building under renovation was built in
1965 and has not undergone significant renovation since it's construction. The
plan is to replace the roof; completely upgrade the mechanical systems to
current standards for air flow; provide a central chiller facility; upgrade and
modernize the electrical distribution system; test for and remove asbestos;
eliminate city water cooling systems; and comply with requirements for overall
accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act. This renovation project
will greatly enhance the ability of researchers to perform complex research in a
safe and productive manner. The key research areas that will be impacted by this
project include materials and environmental engineering, chemistry, and biology.
Within these fields, strong synergy has been developed and has become a spawning
ground for new technologies and their applications. Within this building there
are hand-on laboratories for graduate skills training as well as the integration
of engineering and science for development of an energy and environment
initiative crucial for emerging technologies. This building renovation will
directly change the research and training environment of 29 faculty, 12
postdoctoral fellows, 121 graduate students and 136 undergraduate students.
