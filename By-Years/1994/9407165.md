9407165 Oswald Pit-building antlions have fascinated generations of amateur and
professional biologists with their intriguing behavior of building conical pit-
fall traps in loose sand or soil to capture small ground-walking prey. These
animals are the larvae of a very successful group of approximately 1700 species
of small to medium sized insect predators assigned to the family Myrmeleontidae.
It has been suggested that an important factor in the diversification of this
group of insects was the development by their larvae of the ability to adapt to
living in loose granular substrata, particularly sand. These substrata may have
provided a relatively unoccupied ecological zone or niche into which antlions
could speciate because relatively few other animals had previously been able to
effectively utilize such environments. The research supported by this grant will
test this empty niche hypothesis by examining the distributions of morphological
characters among numerous species of antlions and other closely related insects.
Evidence supporting the hypothesis will have been found, if the first appearance
of characters that adapt antlions to a life in granular substrata correlates
with the origin of this group. %%% This study will provide important information
for improving antlion classification, interpreting historical (phylogenetic)
relationships among major groups of antlions and related groups, and studying
the origin and development of animal behaviors. The study is one component of a
longer-term research program aimed at improving our knowledge of relationships
among the 17 families of the insect order Neuroptera (lacewings), an important
group of predatory insects that includes several subgroups that are of interest
for their potential use in the biological control of crop and ornamental plant
pests. ***
