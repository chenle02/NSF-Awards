9312020 Caple The focus of this research is the elaboration of a stereoselective
protocol for carbon glycoside synthesis. Variations in the nature of carbon
nucleophiles capable of undergoing reaction with ESI intermediates derived from
the protected glucal, attempts to control stereochemistry, possible utilization
of a series of glycals and the synthesis of targets related to bioactive target
molecules will be carried out. %%% With this Research in Undergraduate
Institutions renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the
research of Dr. Ronald Caple of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
Minnesota, Duluth, which will done in close collaboration with Dr. William A.
Smit of the Zelinski Institute of Organic Chemistry, Rusian Academy of Science,
Moscow. The focus of the work is the development of methodology for the
controlled preparation of carbon glycosides. The involvement of undergraduates
is a vital component of the project.
