This is an award to support an exploratory study of the survival characteristics
of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) under conditions that may affect the
engineering design of facilities for treatment of wastes from facilities serving
infected individuals. This project involves determination of the adequacy of
standard methods for recovery of HIV from mixtures with wastes from non-
infected individuals, potential modification of standard procedures, and
survival characteristics of that virus as a function of time under conditions of
exposure typical of waste collection and management systems. This project was
initiated under the National Science Foundation's Program of Expedited Awards
for Novel Research, NSF 87-90. Results are expected to provide knowledge
regarding the direction of subsequent research that would address the
engineering design implications of the results of this project.
