Loras College, Clarke College, and the University of Dubuque request support
from NSF for connection of their campuses to CICnet as an affiliate member
through the University ofIowa. CICNet is the midlevel network located in this
part of the state of Iowa that will provide operations and network information
services. It will give the colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection to
the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone
network. The colleges needs greater functionality and network speed to be able
to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers along with being
able to implement a more reliable mail system. Students and faculty research
will benefit from the link. This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
explore innovative educational resources.***//
