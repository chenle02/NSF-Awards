97-28896 Mechanisms of Associative Learning Associative learning is a basic
form of learning that is generally thought to be central to the scientific
understanding of human memory and cognition. The grant research is directed
toward identifying and characterizing the fundamental mechanisms involved. It
follows and contributes to an approach that is shared by a substantial group of
investigators, namely the use of a simple, experimentally well-controllable
instance of associative learning about which a great deal of bevaioral and
biological information is available (in case, Pavlovian-like eyeblink
conditioning in the rabbit), and the attempted development of a quantitative,
neural-network account of the regularities observed. The focus of the grat
research at this juncture is on a set issues that have come to occupy great
current theoretical attention, involving the roles played by elemental versus
configural cues, in different instances of assoiative learning. The research
will evaluate the usefulness componential treatment in which elemental and
configural cues are generally presumed to compete with each other within an
adaptive-network environment. The conception holds promise of providing a
principled account of the very different patterns of generalization and
discrimination that is observed under what might appear to be minor variations
in the conditions of associative training.
