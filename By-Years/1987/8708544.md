The objective of the present work is to observe magnetic domain patterns on fine
particles of titanomagnetite and mag- netite with two high resolution
techniques, and to devise better methods for obtaining domain patterns at high
temperatures which are beyond the reach of conventional methods. It will
ultunately be possible to continuously image domain structure from room
temperature up to the vincinity of the Curie point. Such work provided the basic
physical underpinnings of paleomagnetism.
