This proposal requests funds for the development of novel flow cytometric
instrumentation and operating procedures for use in the cytoenzymological
analysis of large eukaryotic cells, those cells having diameters in the range of
20-l20 um. The research focuses on the development of novel substrates for use
in flow cytoenzymology and on the development of techniques to permit the real-
time analysis and sorting of cells based on surface area, volume, and
concentration. The techniques will be employed for the analysis of those factors
involved in the expression in plants of suitably engineered chimaeric genes,
specifically beta- glucuronidase, following transfer from bacteria, and for the
selection through flow sorting of living plant protoplasts according to the
level of expression of the introduced genes.
