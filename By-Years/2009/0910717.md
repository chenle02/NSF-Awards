Professor Stacey F. Bent of Stanford University is supported by the Analytical
and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the
reactivity of bifunctional molecules with Ge (100) and Si (100) semiconductor
surfaces. Attachment, displacement, and layer-by-layer surface modification
methods will be explored. A combination of experimental and theoretical methods,
including surface infrared, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal desorption
spectrometry, and density functional theory calculations, will be used to study
the effect of electronic, steric, bond strain, proximity, enthalpy and entropy
parameters on the reactivity and competitive binding of bifunctional molecules
at the surface. The proposed research aims for a better understanding of organic
attachment to semiconductor surfaces. Modifying the interfacial properties of
semiconductor systems by organic layers plays an important role in a variety of
applications, such as nanowire and quantum dot passivation, templated assembly,
MEMS devices, sensors, and organic photovoltaics. The educational activities
involve training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art
surface analysis methods.
