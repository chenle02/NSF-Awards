This study will test theoretical predictions about how genetic relationships
between traits change in response to natural selection. More specifically, it
will examine how genetic relationships between traits expressed differently in
males and females change in response to differing selection on males and
females. Using an insect species that exhibits little sexual dimorphism, the
experiments will impose artificial selection on the body size of either one sex
at a time or both sexes at once (simulating patterns of natural selection often
observed in nature) and examine (a) correlated evolutionary responses in the
alternate (unselected) sex, (b) correlated responses of other non-selected
traits (e.g., reproductive traits), and (c) the evolution of genetic variances
and covariances. The experiments will also impose selection on female fecundity,
and male and female development time. This will test the hypotheses that
selection for increased fecundity and selection for short development time
influence the evolution of sexual size dimorphism in a manner predicted by
theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although many studies have examined how traits are
genetically related to each other, few previous studies have examined how these
genetic relationships change when traits are subject to natural selection. Yet
natural selection is ubiquitous in nature; and human beings impose natural
selection on organisms in agricultural animal and plant breeding programs,
during application of pesticides to agricultural fields, in the use of
antibiotics, and whenever natural biological events are manipulated.
Understanding how genetic relationships among traits change as we impose natural
selection on these traits is critical to understanding the long-term
evolutionary responses of populations to this selection.&lt;br/&gt;
