DMS-0140408 Complex Dynamics in Higher Dimension Proposal Abstract

The principal investigator proposes to study the dynamics of meromorphic self-
maps of compact complex manifolds. If such a map expands some cohomology class
of the manifold, then the main idea is that there ought to be a distinguished
invariant current representing this class. Intersections between invariant
currents should in turn give rise to invariant measures that describe the
distribution of orbits where the action of the map is most complicated. Hence
the linear action of a meromorphic map on cohomology should go a long way toward
determining a probabilistic picture of the pointwise dynamics of the map. To
justify these ideas, the investigator proposes to use a combination of
techniques from complex geometry, smooth ergodic theory, and pluripotential
analysis. Various problems in physics and mathematics reduce to questions about
the dynamics of particular meromorphic maps. The investigator proposes to use
some of these as starting points and test cases for his research.

The study of dynamical systems has grown increasingly important in the past
several decades. Put briefly, a dynamical system is anything--e.g. the weather,
the stock-market, the solar system, etc--that evolves in time according (at
least theoretically) to definite and codifiable rules. The general goal in
studying a dynamical system is to make predictions about its future state given
its present one. If the future is very far off then this, as any honest
forecaster will admit, is typically quite difficult. Small changes in the
present state of the system can imply huge differences in eventual outcome. The
research proposed here is devoted to better understanding instability in
dynamical systems--when it occurs, why it occurs, and how to recognize it. The
research is also devoted to attaining partial control over instability by making
statistical predictions about the eventual behavior of an unstable system that
do not depend on perfect understanding of its present state. The dynamical
systems that the investigator proposes to study are mathematical in nature, but
they are also archtypes for the systems that one analyzes in connection with
real-world phenomena. The idea is that weather and the stockmarket and the solar
system ought not be treated as a separate and totally unrelated dynamical
systems but as particular examples of the same general phenomena and subject to
similar kinds of analyses.
