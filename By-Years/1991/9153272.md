Third semester calculus materials are being completed for teaching calculus as a
laboratory course. The work includes the expansion of the repertoire of
classroom and laboratory projects, development of versions of alternate software
and hardware environments, and completion of a high school version of the
course. The methods and materials for all three semesters are being evaluated
and widely disseminated by workshops for college-level and pre-college faculty,
by continued publication of a newsletter, and production of preliminary
materials.
