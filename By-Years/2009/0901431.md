The proposal is focused on problems which lie at the interface of representation
theory and mathematical physics. More specially, it aims at problems in the
representation theory of quantum groups at roots of 1, on invariants of
3-manifolds, certain problems in local quantum field theory (such as the
construction of perturbative Chern-Simons theory), and on problems in integrable
systems and solvable models of statistical mechanics.

One of the central questions in modern theoretical physics is the construction
of the model of fundamental interaction which is consistent with the experiment
and mathematically adequate. The framework of local quantum field theory is main
concept behind the standard model. However the framework of quantum field theory
still largely remain a mathematical puzzle. Part of my research will focus on
understanding this puzzle in the context of semi-classical quantization. The
goal of other parts of the proposal is the construction of topological and
integrable quantum field theories combinatorically and the study of emerging
algebraic and analytical problems.
