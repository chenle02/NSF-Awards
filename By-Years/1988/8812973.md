The study of Poly-a-amino acids are attractive as models for the conformational
behavior of the more complex naturally occurring proteins. The preparation and
study of synthetic polypeptides with well-defined structures have received
considerable interest because these molecules often exhibit stereoregular
conformations mimicking natural materials. The purpose of this proposal is to
synthesize well defined copolymers of azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and
2,4-methanoproline with proline, and to determine whether the conformation of
the polyproline helix can be altered by incorporating rigid proline analogs into
the polymer chain. The conformatrions of the polymers in solution will be
studied by spectroscopic methods (CD,NMR) and related to chain structure. This
investigation will give detailed information on the relative importance of
several factors stabilizing the helical forms of polyproline as well as provide
a more refined understanding of the role of residue rigidity in determining the
chain flexibility of helical polyamides.
