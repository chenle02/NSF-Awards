Professor Zilm is supported by a grant for exploratory research from the
Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to develop the NMR methods which would
take advantage of the newly discovered optical polarization techniques for
producing nearly perfectly spin-polarized Xe-129 nuclei in xenon gas. In
principle, the transfer of this polarization to nuclei in a molecule in a solid
xenon matrix can be achieved for enhancement of the NMR signals by up to four
orders of magnitude. These novel experiments are expected to have high impact on
the detection of orders of magnitude smaller concentrations of molecules in
xenon matrix isolation. This would mean that reactive species which are created
in very small steady state quantities in a chemical reaction could be detected
with NMR, providing detailed structural information. This would also mean that
low sensitivity nuclei, such as naturally abundant carbon-13 and silicon-29
could be observed even at these low concentrations. %%% This exploratory
research project will make use of the just discovered method of completely
polarizing the nuclear spins in xenon by using the xenon to transfer
polarization to other nuclei, thus enhancing their nuclear magnetic resonance
spectra by ten thousand fold. The preliminary experiments will determine the
conditions that are necessary for the efficient polarization transfer. The xenon
could be used as a solid matrix for the detection of very small amounts of
reactive molecules and molecule fragments. The xenon can also be laid down on a
surface to allow the detection of only surface atoms.
