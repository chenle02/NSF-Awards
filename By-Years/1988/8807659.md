This equipment grant provides microscopy, video and image analysis equipment to
study the fundamental aspects of interfacial dynamics of crystal growth. The
contributions of convection on dendritic growth will be studied. Scanning
electron microscope investigations of the dynamical evolution of two-phase
microstructure will be performed. Advanced materials can be better tailored for
future applications with knowledge of the interactions of the global process
variables and underlying molecular forces. The goal of this research is to
advance the understanding of the development and control of such forces during
solidification.
