*** 9704188 Iyer This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will
develop computer assisted manufacturing (CAM) planning software, based on
physical mechanistic models and accessed on the world wide web. The research
will focus on robust process planning modules oriented to the machine tool
industry. A reliable security scheme will offer adequate protection for
transmission over the Internet and storing of sensitive design data. An
innovative feature will be the availability of the proposed CAM system on the
Internet as well as Intranet suites for large institutional users. The system
will enable linkage of floor personnel in small- and medium-sized with design
and research engineers in large enterprises. The research will also develop an
adequate on-line, self-paced training facility with extensive design and
analysis examples, applications, and utilization notes. A commercial pay-per-use
process planning CAM suite service and a modified version for use on corporate
Intranets is expected for marketing to the machine tool industry. ***
