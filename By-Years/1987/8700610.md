This research will deal with a number of problems in matrix theory and
algebraic geometry. In matrix theory work will be done on estimating permanents
of nonnegative matrices, comparing permanents of positive definite matrices with
other generalized matrix functions, Knaster's conjecture for quadratic
functions, matrix aspects of graph isomorphisms, and invariants of finite
dimensional algebras. In algebraic geometry work will be done on the two
dimensional Jacobian conjecture, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for compact
algebraic surfaces, and the uniqueness of Henon's form under diffeomorphism.
This research focuses on two different areas: matrix algebra and algebraic
geometry. The breadth of the research is one of the appealing aspects of the
project. Friedland brings to bear his extensive knowledge of these two areas on
each other to produce some very original work. Results of great value will be
the result of this research.
