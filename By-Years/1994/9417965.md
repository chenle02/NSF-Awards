9417965 JEFFERY This award will support travel costs, subsistence, and meeting
registration for participants in a Conference on Development: Molecules,
Mechanisms, and Phylogenetics that will be held at Bodega Marine Laboratory,
University of California, Davis, in September 1995. Plans include selecting
eight young scientists (graduate or postgraduate students) whose attendance will
be supported. This is an exciting subject which integrates molecular
phylogenetic systematic methods with the study of development. %%% Such
comparative methods can be very important for understanding how developmental
mechanisms have changed within major groups of organisms and contribute to this
aspect of our understanding of the earth's biodiversity. ***
