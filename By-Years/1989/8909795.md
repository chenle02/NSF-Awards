This project investigates the design and implementation of logic- based query
languages. The goal of this research is to produce high-performance database
systems with the clean, declarative character of relational systems but with far
more expressive query languages. Research into the theory and algorithms
necessary for the efficient implementation of such systems will be conducted. In
parallel with this work, a main-memory based prototype will be implemented. The
performance and expressibility of the prototype will be evaluated and compared
with implementations of applications drawn from problem domains for which
current relational systems are inadequate. The technical contributions of this
research include the efficient implementation of declarative reasoning
capabilities over complex information structures, paradigms for exploiting the
computational power of multiprocessors and large memory machines used in
development of extremely high-performance high- expressibility database systems.
Such systems will be useful in applications raging from traditional business
applications to engineering applications to knowledge bases and expert systems.
