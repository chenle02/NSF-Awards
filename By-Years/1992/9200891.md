This project will bring ten students to the San Diego Supercomputer Center
(SDSC) for a ten week period in the summer of 1992. Students, from all areas of
science and engineering that rely on computing, will be teamed with faculty
advisors from their home institutions, and one or more of the SDSC staff
advisors. Students will work on a well defined research project in computational
science for the period. Included in the experience will be report seminars, a
final mini-conference, and the preparation of a summary paper for the
experience.
