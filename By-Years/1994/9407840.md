9407840 Emerson ABSTRACT One of the oldest questions in animal biology is "how
does a single cell - the fertilized egg - give rise to a complex adult body
form?". More specifically, how is the genetic information, which is identical in
all cells of an embryo, expressed such that cells become different? Dr. Emerson
proposes to use recently-developed molecular biological techniques, such as the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to address these questions. Since PCR requires
only small amounts of tissue, it is ideally suited to the identification of new
genes that control important developmental processes in the mammalian embryo.
