Marotz In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed
to meet the GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren
in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding
the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it. The project
intends to conduct a series of progressively more complex experiments on global
warming using meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol data collected by students
at five schools arrayed across five different climate zones. The Principal
Investigators, Mentor Teachers and Students are linked in a structure that
mimics the INTERNET in its design: the backbone of the net is based on climatic
characteristics, and the individual schools represent nodes. Results, products,
lessons, etc., will be disseminated along the INTERNET and on CD-ROM as well as
on other media. International cooperation is built into the structure of the
project. Training workshops will be offered during the summer at the five school
locations. Program evaluation will involve students as a principal source.
