9411595 Tuckness This research equipment grant is made for the acquisition of
computing equipment in support of a global position/inertial navigation system.
Such systems are typically used for a variety of dynamic vehicle-reflected
applications. A Kalman filter is used to process the measurements obtained by
the positioning system, and to enhance the performance of the navigation system.
In this project, improvements are made in the filter processing of navigation
information for sensor inputs supplied to the on- board computer, and the
resulting stability of integrated filter system is investigated. ***
