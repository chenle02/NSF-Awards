Many structural engineering problems involve incremental/iterative solution
procedures and require significant amount of computations. The proposed
investigation concerns with developing efficient reanalysis strategies in
advanced multiprocessing environments. This study involves application of
advanced mathematical concepts including graph- theoretic techniques and
multilevel algorithms for computational intensive engineering problems. The two
application areas identified for this research are adaptive finite element
analysis and optimization using substructures. The objective is to develop
efficient parallel solution procedures for these two computational intensive
problems. The algorithms developed will be important to the next generation
engineering software, and the work will enrich the knowledge in structural
engineering in advanced computing environments.
