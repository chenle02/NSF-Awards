9350334 DeSimone The goals of my teaching and research plan are to introduce
contemporary concepts of polymer science to our department which builds on
nationally recognized, in-house strengths. Research will focus on
environmentally benign monomer and polymer synthesis in supercritical carbon
dioxide and the synthesis and characterization of high performance thiophene-
based polymers. ***
