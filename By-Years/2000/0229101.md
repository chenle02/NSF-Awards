Our project will help the National Science Foundation as well as the larger STEM
community understand how laboratory-teaching experiences are delivered using
web-based information technologies. The project will ascertain how advanced web-
mediated learning technologies are used to "convey" laboratory experiences in
the undergraduate science and engineering curriculum. Our team will work to
build on an existing database and begin to evaluate what student learning
outcomes are being addressed. In addition, our final report will contain a
formal literature , project goals, and a methodology. Our findings will be
defended in a formal oral presentation to NSF personnel, WPI faculty and other
invitees. Finally the results from our project will be presented at the annual
Frontiers in Education Conference.
