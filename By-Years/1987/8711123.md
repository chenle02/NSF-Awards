Abstract Narrative The Sahaptin language was spoken aboriginally in central and
eastern Washington state, and along the middle Columbia and Deschutes Rivers in
Oregon. Sahaptin and Nez Perce, a language spoken in Idaho and northeastern
Oregon, together comprise the Sahaptian family. The Sahaptian languages are of
particular interest to linguists both in terms of their genetic and his- torical
relationships to other American Indian languages, and also because of their
grammatical properties, some of which bear directly on currently discussed
issues in linguistic theory. Documentation of the language, however, is scanty.
The purpose of this project is to produce a grammar of Sahaptin. The process of
preparing the grammar, with computational aids, will also result in the analysis
of a number of Sahaptin texts, which will also be an important contribution to
the field. The Co-Principal Investigator, who will be carrying out the bulk of
the work on the project, has worked for a number of years on the related
language Nez Perce. His work has been very successful, and has earned him a
reputation as an extremely talented young linguist. This experience has made him
entirely qualified to carry out the proposed new project to a successful
conclusion.
