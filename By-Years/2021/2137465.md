The field of model theory studies classes of structures: groups, fields, graphs.
This is a broad field to study, so important distinctions are made based on how
the class of structures is described (or axiomatized). If the class is
describable in first-order logic, it is called an elementary class. First-order
logic has many powerful properties, especially the property of compactness.
Compactness allows model theorists to build structures with exotic properties
and has driven much of the model theory of elementary classes, most notably
classification theory. However, many classes of structures are not describable
in first-order logic (these are called nonelementary classes). Lacking
compactness, the development of nonelementary model theory and classification
theory has proceeded much slower than its elementary counterpart. Recent work in
nonelmentary classes has shown that various fragments of compactness can still
hold in some nonelmentary classes and are still powerful enough to prove various
results of elementary classification theory. The PI will develop more of these
fragments in nonelementary classes. Additionally, the PI will run a program to
build research infrastructure at their home institution (an R2 institution and
HSI). The first year of the program will bring in a series of logic speakers
that focus on connections between logic and other fields. The second year will
support both faculty and student research in logic inspired by these
speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the PI will research
compactness properties in nonelementary classes using techniques from model
theory, set theory, and category theory. As stated above, compactness fails to
hold in nonelementary classes, but the PI will explore a variety of methods to
find to fragments of compactness in these classes. The first objective is to
extend compactness and other concepts of model theory to higher algebra. The
second objective is to develop nonstandard ultraproducts in nonelementary
classes using a category theoretic perspective. The third objective is to
continue the PIâ€™s exploration of connections between nonelementary compactness
principles and large cardinal in set theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
