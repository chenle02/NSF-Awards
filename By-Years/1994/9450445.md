9450445 The proposed research would be directed at (1) characterization of high
affinity choline transporter (2) gonadal hormones and neuropeptide Y receptors
in rats (3) identification and characterization of endogenous neuromodulators in
Aplysia and (4) conditioning related acetylcholine release in rat necortex. The
proposed work would also help expand research capabilities and training
opportunities in physiology, with an emphasis in neuroscience, at Meharry
Medical College.
