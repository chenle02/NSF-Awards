Because many hydrous marine sediments entering subduction zones lack CO2 (i.e.,
lack carbonate minerals), dehydration would be dominant over decarbonation upon
subduction. Under this funding, the PIs will compute subduction zone
devolatilization for the major lithologic types of CO2-free hydrous marine
sediments: red clays, hydrothermal (ferruginous) clays, turbidites, and mixed
lithologies, i.e., radiolaria/diatom oozes mixed with clays or volcanic ash,
using a variety of constraints from ODP drill sites off the Izu-Bonin- Marianas
and Costa Rica-Nicaragua. Because the carbonate content of altered basalts in
the upper oceanic crust increases with age, the PIs will compare metamorphic
devolatilization of oceanic metabasalts in subduction zones with Jurassic crust
(e.g., Marianas) with those subducting late Cenozoic crust (e.g., Costa Rica),
and will quantify the relative contributions of the various volatile-bearing
assemblages and assess the depth distribution of volatile release. A primary
goal of the proposed research is to quantify metamorphic devolatilization for
the lithologies entering these subduction zones and to compare the results with
the distribution of earthquake hypocenters and volcanic activity associated with
each subduction zone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
