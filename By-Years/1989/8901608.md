Hain intends to use the techniques of Hodge theory to study the topology of the
space of compact Riemann surfaces and the topology of the space of n x m
matrices over the complex numbers, all of whose minors are non-zero. Possible
applications include the construction of generalizations of Euler's dilogarithm
which satisfy natural generalizations of Abel's 5-term functional equation for
the dilogarithm. A graduate student will employ a computer program Hain has
written to aid in investigating the dilogarithm. The program decomposes
representations of symmetric groups, which arise as huge tensor products. A
high-powered personal computer will be devoted to this task.
