9505742 Farley This research project is designed to be a definitive study of the
applicability of the (U-Th)/He system for geochronology and thermochronology of
common accessory minerals (particularly apatite). This system has significant
potential to provide temporal constraints on geological events which are
difficult to date with alternative techniques. The project involves laboratory
diffusion experiments to constrain He retention characteristics, as well as
measurement of He ages for intercomparison with ages determined by independent
methods.
