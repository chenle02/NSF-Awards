This award gives travel, housing, and registration-cost support to selected
students and other young researchers from U.S. universities for their
participation in the International Summer School on Planning and Scheduling,
which is affiliated with the 19th International Conference on Automated Planning
and Scheduling (ICAPS-09) held September 19-23 in Thessaloniki, Greece.
Artificial Intelligence planning and scheduling is relevant to a wide variety of
applications such as software engineering, manufacturing, transportation, and
robotics. The ICAPS-09 Summer School includes a poster session, where students
present their research ideas for commentary by more senior researchers, as well
as intensive study of foundational material and the latest research in automated
planning and scheduling. The Summer School realizes an integration of research
and education in its preparation of emerging scientists.
