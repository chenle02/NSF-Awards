9302468 Field This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program
will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana in the
purchase of a 300 MHz, multinuclear, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectrometer. This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number
of areas including the following: 1) Solution dynamics of main group-transition
metal clusters, 2) Anomalously large kinetic deuterium isotope effects in
transition metal cluster hydrides, 3) The chemistry of low oxidation state metal
clusters in water, 4) Chemical mechanisms in thermal polymerization of
glycosides and in pyrolysis of polysaccharides, 5) Hydrogen/deuterium kinetic
isotope effects using unlabeled (natural abundance) reagents, 6) Solution
chemistry of triplet cyclohepta-trienylidene and triplet cyclonona-
tetraenylidene, 7) Competition kinetics in the cycloheptatri-
enylidene/cycloheptatetraene system, 8) Development of methodology for the
synthesis of homochiral compounds containing nitrogen. %%% A nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to obtain information about molecular
structure (what types of carbon and/or hydrogen atoms are present, what are the
relative number of each type of atoms and how are they connected to one another
in the molecule) and molecular dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of
the molecule moving). This instrument is essential for any meaningful, modern
synthetic chemistry research program. ***
