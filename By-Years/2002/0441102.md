GLORIAD: Global Ring Network for Advanced Applications Development

The Global Ring Network for Advanced Applications Development (GLORIAD) aims to
better integrate, with an advanced network infrastructure, the science and
education (S&E) communities of the US, Russia, China, Korea, Canada and
Netherlands - as well as broader Europe as well as Eastern and Central Asia. It
includes: a jointly managed, hybrid circuit-switched and routed network designed
in a ring topology encircling the northern hemisphere; and services to support
increased S&E cooperation for both general and highly advanced (in terms of
network needs) user communities. In addition to supporting active scientific
exchange with network services, the project will provide a production
environment for advancing the state-of-the-art in collaborative and network
technologies, including Grid-based applications development, end-to-end circuit
provisioning, IPv4/IPv6 an d unicast/multicast services, advanced network
monitoring, performance measurement and network security research. Supporting
the increased growth in global S&E cooperation, GLORIAD is actively cooperating
with the world's most advanced S&E networks and programs to create a rational,
coherent strategy and architecture for the future of S&E networking.
