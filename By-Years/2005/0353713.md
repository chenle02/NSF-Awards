A symposium entitled "Regulatory genes and the evolution of plant phenotype"
will be held at the Evolution 2003 meeting in Fort Collins, Colorado, June
25-29, 2004. The symposium will feature speakers at a variety of career stages
from graduate students to full professors. The speakers will explore a number of
topics related to the role of developmental regulatory genes in morphological
evolution. Additionally, they will bring five undergraduates, primarily from
underrepresented minorities, to the conference. The symposium will enhance
communication among plant evolutionary developmental biologists and between
plant and animal biologists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The
conference will enhance the cohesion of the field of plant evolutionary
developmental biology and support the career advancement of a number of young
scientists. Additionally, the engagement of undergraduates in such a scientific
conference will contribute to the recruitment of the best students (especially
minority students) into the scientific career track.&lt;br/&gt;
