This project is for the development of a surface analysis system equipped with
latest generation high resolution electron energy loss (HREEL) spectrometer.
This instrument is capable of an increased signal of at least 20 times for a
fixed energy resolution and 5 times better energy resolution compared to other
available spectrometers. These improvements will allow HREELS to be applied to
the characterization of the vibrational properties of the surfaces and
interfaces of a variety of technologically important materials, including,
polymers, semiconductors, and metal oxides, at a new level of detail. The
projects for which the spectrometer will initially be used include the molecular
characterization of polymer surfaces and interfaces, semiconductor surface and
interface dynamics, and reactivity of metal oxide surfaces.
