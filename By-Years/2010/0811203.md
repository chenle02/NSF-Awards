In recent years the heat equation on a weighted graph has been used to attack
problems in image processing, including denoising, segmentation, and inpainting.
In many cases the data used to build the graph is the set of patches or feature
responses from a single image; and even then, patches or filter responses are
usually only compared with their spatial neighborhoods. On the other hand, it
has become practical to manipulate large collections of images, and using the
statistics of large collections of images has become an important image
processing tool. The PI will investigate how to use larger databases of images
and image features in a PDE framework. For some of the proposed work, it will be
necessary to invent new theory to lift notions of the smoothness of a surface
embedded in Euclidean space to maps from the discrete grid into a weighted
graph; and perhaps further to maps from a more general weighted graph into a
weighted graph. Other proposed work will try to make use of (and improve) recent
methods for sparse feature extraction, and solidify the theory underlying the
NL-means method of Buades, Coll, and Morel.

A large class of popular image processing techniques making use of the theory
of partial differential equations operate locally; that is, the behavior of each
step of these algorithms at a given pixel in an image is determined solely by
the neighboring pixel values. In recent years, it has become possible to
manipulate large databases of images; and such databases of images have become
available from many sources, including the world wide web. The PI will work
towards extending the local techniques to make use of these large databases. The
long term goal is image processing techniques which understand and utilize the
content and context of images; such techniques would have many important
applications, for example in medical imaging, hperspectral imaging, and computer
vision in general.
