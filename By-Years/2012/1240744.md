This award will support an NSF/CMBS regional conference to be held at Kansas
State University in the summer of 2013 on the global behavior of solutions to
critical nonlinear wave equations. The principal speaker will be Professor
Carlos Kenig from the University of Chicago. The lectures will cover such areas
as local and global well-posedness, scattering, finite time blow up, and soliton
resolution for classes of nonlinear dispersive equations. In addition to the 10
main lectures by Dr. Kenig, lectures will be presented by other experts in these
fields.

Hallmarks of the NSF/CBMS regional conference series are focus on a single
important and timely area of research by a leading practitioner, a published
monograph for a wider audience, and continued effect and local stimulation
through regional recruitment emphasis. For this conference, the lectures will
also be posted online to provide greater access. This award will support
approximately 25 participants in the conference, mostly at early stages of their
careers.
