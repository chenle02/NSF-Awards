9316251 Reed Support is requested to assist academic personnel, particularly
younger researchers and graduate students, who are engaged in Micro Electro
Mechanical Systems (MEMS) research by providing either wholly or partially for
travel to and subsistence at the 1994 IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems
Workshop, which is to be held in Oiso, Japan, January 25-28, 1994. The 1994 MEMS
Workshop is an international research meeting, seventh in a series begun in
19987 (originally entitled "IEEE Micro Robots and Teleoperators Workshop"). The
site of the 1994 MEMS Workshop is in Japan; this will place a financial stress
on established as well as new academic entrants in the field. Adequate funds for
attendance at the 1994 MEMS Workshop is therefore not included in the budgets of
many, particularly younger, researchers. Likewise, adequate travel money is
often not in the budgets of some of the more established advisors whose students
would benefit by attending. The presence of these researchers and students would
enhance the value of the meeting to the engineering and scientific community in
the United States. ***
