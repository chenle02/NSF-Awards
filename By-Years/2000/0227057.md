The project is proposed by a partnership, which includes three institutes of
higher education, the Vermont State Department of Education, the Vermont
Mathematics Initiative (VMI), the Vermont Institute for Science, Mathematics,
and Technology (VISMT) and 4 school districts. The project is building upon the
VMI Exemplary Teacher Model, a leadership model in K-6 mathematics by expanding
the effort to include middle and high school mathematics, whole school systems
and preservice education. To enhance student achievement the partnership five
major goals are.

1. To prepare teachers and preservice students who deeply understand mathematics
and can translate their knowledge into student learning. 2. To develop school
support systems that are rich learning opportunities for both students and
teachers. 3. To utilize valid reliable ongoing assessments and feedback systems
to continuously improve mathematic results for all students. 4. To develop a
preservice and inservice curriculum that deepens teacher's knowledge and
understanding of mathematics, equity strategies to assure no child is left
behind and leadership strategies that enable scale up of the Partnership's
initiatives throughout Vermont and beyond. 5. To foster collaborative research
involving mathematicians, mathematics education faculty and preK-12 educators
contributing to the state and national research base in the teaching and
learning of mathematics. The partnership is seeking success in all schools, for
all teachers and all students.
