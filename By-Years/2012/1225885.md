This project is an expansion of a successful preliminary study that implemented
and distributed a virtual internship for first-year bio-engineering
undergraduates. The project is using a virtual internship to provide simulated
work experiences that allow students to begin understanding the role of
engineers in industry. The expansion will produce a virtual internship for
mechanical engineering and ultimately will produce a suite of virtual
internships for the core engineering disciplines. The virtual internships are
based on fictional product lines of a parent company. The impacted students will
experience a simulated working environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific
outcomes of the project include an increased motivation to persist in
engineering and an increased understanding of what engineers do. Through wide
dissemination the program is having an impact on a large number of students at
multiple sites. Project results will significantly increase the accessibility of
internship experiences for non-traditional students and students studying in
rural or non-industrial areas.
