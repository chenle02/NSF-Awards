Although sophisticated polymorphic type systems have become a standard part of
functional programming languages, such type systems have had little impact on
imperative languages. This research is aimed at developing a new type discipline
for a class of implicitly-typed imperative programming languages with subtyping,
coherent global overloading, and polymorphism. Technical problems include
preserving principal-typing and subject-reduction properties with polymorphic
references, developing an appropriate notion of coherence, and finding
algorithms to decide whether a set of subtyping and overloading constraints is
satisfiable. A novel aspect of the work is the implementation of an incremental
algorithm for on-line type inference, suitable for use in programming
environments where partial definitions may be given and updated. The
implementation is a structured editor generated automatically by the Synthesizer
Generator from an attribute grammar specification. Incremental type
recomputation is implicit in this paradigm.
