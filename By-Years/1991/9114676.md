A detailed formulation of vehicle traffic behavior will be developed as flow on
a Markovian network. Algorithms to track the model's parameters using real time
data, and real-time control methods will also be developed and validated. The
results will be a model which considers traffic signal operations and drive
information strategies in a unified manner, thus, permitting real-time
integrated management of traffic systems.
