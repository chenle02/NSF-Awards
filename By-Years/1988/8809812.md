Male reproductive fitness is dependent in part on the ability of a male to
transfer sufficient sperm to the female to ensure ovum fertilization. Thus, male
copulatory behavior should function to optimize sperm transfer to the female.
Dr. Tokarz will investigate the sensory determinants of optimal sperm delivery
while using the lizard reproductive system as an experimental model. The
research to be performed addresses both causal mechanisms and functional
outcomes of male copulatory behavior. Results from this research promise to
increase our understanding of how sensory feedback influences the orientation
and duration of copulation. It should also provide insight into how copulatory
behavior affects sperm delivery and thus male reproductive success.
