The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports Professor Peter Chen at
Spelman College to develop and utilize high resolution coherent 2D spectroscopy
to study molecular systems too complex for existing spectroscopic techniques.
Also under study are small but important molecules (e.g., EPA priority
pollutants like NO2 and SO2) for which strong perturbations and mixing effects
yield spectra too complicated to study using existing (one-dimensional)
spectroscopic techniques. Dr. Chen and his group develop new coherent two-
dimensional spectroscopic techniques to deal with these problems and to study
the dynamics of important photochemical processes in the atmosphere.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project may improve fundamental understanding of the
photochemistry of NO2 and SO2, which are among the six priority pollutants
targeted by the Clean Air Act. It provides exceptional research training of
African American women at one of only two Historically Black Colleges for women.
