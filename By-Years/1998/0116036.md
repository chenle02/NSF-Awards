With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Lake Superior State University will acquire an
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will be used for
research on environmental issues of the Upper Great Lakes region; as a tool for
undergraduates working on environmental research projects as part of their
senior thesis; to introduce modern mass spectrophotometric techniques to the
undergraduate curriculum; and to support faculty and community partnering on
environmental projects. Specific projects include establishment of a long-term
monitoring program for trace metals in the Lake Superior Watershed, including an
emphasis on changes in isotopic ratios for key elements such as lead; and the
analysis of sediments and biota for trace metals in the St. Marys River Area of
Concern.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details
and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic,
and organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact
in the area of environmental chemistry and public health.
