9507151 Hardin This work will seek to investigate a specific interaction between
mesenchymal and epithelial cells, the attachment of secondary mesenchyme cells
(SMCs) to animal pole ectoderm. This interaction occurs during the process of
gastrulation in the sea urchin embryo. The sea urchin offers the advantage of
ease of manipulation and observation of single cells. This laboratory will use
both embryological manipulations and molecular biological techniques, taking
advantage of available sea urchin homologues of mesoderm-specific transcription
factors to examine the interaction of these cells with their target epithelium.
The following questions will be investigated: i). what is the time course of
molecular differentiation of a known target for mesenchymal attachment, the
animal pole?, ii). is msx-2 gene expression regulated by cell-cell interactions
in the animal pole target region?, iii). how does incorrect expression of msx-2
transcripts affect epithelial-mesenchymal interactions?, and iv). how is
expression of the snail gene regulated during mesenchymal interaction? This work
is likely to provide important information regarding the nature of epithelial-
mesenchymal interactions during development. ***
