The goal of the human psychophysiology project at Oberlin College is to
introduce undergraduate psychology students to the inter-relationships of
behavior, body, and brain by offering an innovative course in human physiology
in which students will learn basic psychophysiological measures (e.g., EEC, EMG,
EDA, blood pressure, respiration) as well as the biological principles
underlying these measures. Structured weekly laboratory sessions, in which
students will learn procedures and follow protocols using one another as
subjects will provide hands-on experience. The psychophysiology laboratory will
also allow students and faculty to conduct independent research projects related
to psychophysiological function. The project should serve as a model for
developing a program in human psychophysiology at the undergraduate level.
