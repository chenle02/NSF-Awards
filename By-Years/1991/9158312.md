The research supported by this grant consists of two general areas: glass-
ceramics for electronic applications, and thermodynamic modeling of
ferroelectric ceramics. In the first area, the objective of the research is to
develop an understanding of how compositional and processing control of the
microstructure can be used to tailor the dielectric, thermal, and mechanical
properties of glass-ceramics. The research will also include the microstructural
design of piezo-, pyro-, and ferro-electric glass ceramics. In the second area,
the objective is to utilize thermodynamic principles to explain the phase
stability in ferro- electric ceramic systems. This research will be useful in
providing new glass-ceramic materials for future microelectronic applications.
