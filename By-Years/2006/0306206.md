Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the not too distant future, semiconductor
designs are expected to integrate billions of transistors on a single chip and
will operate at frequencies in excess of 10GHz. This dramatic progress will
introduce unforeseen challenges and will require dramatic changes of the tools
and methods used to design highperformance processors. With high operating
frequencies, accurate performance verification of the design will be come
paramount. At the same time, noise in the design will rise to dramatic new
levels due to the coupling between closely spaced devices on the same die. High
noise levels will impact the performance by slowing down the critical delay
paths in a circuit and will therefore threaten the achievable operating
frequencies. We therefore propose new methods for the analysis of processor
performance in the presence of high-noise levels. Furthermore, we intend to
develop new methods for performance optimization in noise dominated circuit
environments for future high-performance processor and systems-on-chip
designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
