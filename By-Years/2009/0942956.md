This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate a novel
method for producing large amounts of high-quality DNA sequence data for
phylogenomic applications. The project will extend a strategy called
"microarray-based genome selection" (MGS), which is capable of enriching a DNA
sample for thousands of genes, to simultaneous enrichment across distantly
related species. As a result, this study has the potential to address the
remaining practical obstacles to microarray hybridization across species (cross-
species hybridization) and result in hugely increased scaling of MGS technology.
Such a scaling up will expedite the assembly of the Tree of Life and accelerate
the adoption of next-geenration DNA sequencing technologies in many biological
fields. Frogs, a diverse group broadly used in biology, will be the model group
for this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new genomic enrichment strategy
will broadly extend the use of new sequencing technologies by accomplishing two
main goals: 1) construction of significantly larger, cheaper and time-efficient
molecular datasets, and 2) increasing the number of genetic markers in common
across taxonomic groups, which will allow different parts of the Tree of Life to
be merged together. The new lab procedures and design strategies will be
published via a website and in peer-reviewed journals, further disseminating the
MGS enrichment strategy to related disciplines, such as biomedical
engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
