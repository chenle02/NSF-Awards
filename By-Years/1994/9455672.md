Computer laboratory projects are being introduced in all sections of the basic
multivariable calculus course at the University of Michigan (1500-1700 students
per year). The computer is being used as a discovery tool. The projects' main
features are: promotion of active learning and hands-on experience,
visualization through computer graphics, gradually introduced Maple syntax,
furtherance of conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and quantitative
reasoning. Several activities are included in the project: to develop a library
of laboratory projects (long term: each project is to culminate with a problem
applied to science, economics or engineering); to develop and implement
cooperative learning techniques in the computer laboratory environment; to
develop and implement motivational material suitable for feedback techniques in
large lecture classes, using a workstation in every classroom connected to an
LCD plate; to write TA and instructor manuals and videotapes, and to create an
intensive TA and Faculty training program. The composition of the student body
is very diverse. The materials are being written with the consideration that
some students have no prior computer experience. Diversity in the cooperative
groups will strengthen them.
