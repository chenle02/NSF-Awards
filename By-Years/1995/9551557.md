This project incorporates a multinuclear high-field NMR instrument into the
undergraduate chemistry curriculum. An NMR instrument is being used in the
organic, inorganic, polymer, biochemistry, and quantum chemistry courses, as
well as in student research. In addition, a new course is being developed to
teach the theory and practice of NMR spectroscopy. Experiments in these courses
have been designed to enhance student understanding of proton, carbon, and
phosphorus NMR spectra and to provide experience in analyzing these data in the
elucidation of structure. Furthermore, NMR is being used as a tool in kinetic,
mechanistic, and quantum mechanical studies. In the 3-year period of this
project, an estimated 400 chemistry students can gain skills that will better
prepare them to characterize reaction products and study important reactions
being investigated in academia or industry.
