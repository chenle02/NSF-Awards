Modeling nonpremxed turbulent combustion is a formidable task due to coupling
between the thermochemical equations and the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations. There is a strong incentive to decouple the chemistry problem from
the turbulence. Laminar flamelet modeling is a salient approach to decoupling,
and is often used in current combustion modeling. The principal objective of the
proposed research is the investigation of the validity of laminar flamelet
modeling of turbulent diffusion flames The approach to this scientific objective
is to perform direct numerical simulation of turbulent diffusion flame cases.
The research via simulations will be combined with theoretical investigations in
one of the cases when the chemistry is kept simple. In order to investigate a
realistic model of hydrogen flames the partial equilibrium chemistry model will
be implemented in conjunction with the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. The analytic
investigations will be performed in interaction with ongoing laboratory work
elsewhere. Improved understanding of the validity of laminar flamelet modeling
will significantly contribute to turbulent flame modeling efforts, with eventual
applications to critical issues in combustion systems such as ignition and
pollutant formation.
