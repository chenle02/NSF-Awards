Support is provided for research on the mechanisms by which phenolic substances
are degraded by anaerobic microorganisms. This research is specifically directed
at chlorinated phenols, nitrophenols, and methylphenols which are produced
synthetically or which may be an intermediate decomposition product of more
complex organic substances. Metabolism of these compounds under methanogenic and
nitrate reducing conditions will be characterized as to the rate, extent, and
major metabolites of degradation. In addition, their genotoxicity and any
changes in genotoxicity as a result of anaerobic metabolism will ber determined.
Completion of the work will elucidate the differences or similarities in the
anaerobic metabolic pathways of the compound under the two reducing conditions
and relate them to genotoxicity.
