In this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in biochemistry between
Biserka Kojic-Prodic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute in Zagreb and William L.
Duax of the Medical Foundation of Buffalo, the investigators will study the
regulatory action of a plant growth hormone, auxin (or idoleacetic acid), at the
whole plant, cellular and molecular levels. Compounds and deriatives of
idoleacetic acid will be synthesized or isolated from natural sources; analyzed
for structural and chemical properties, and correlated with the plant's
biological activity. The Yugoslav group is particularly expert at synthesis and
structural analysis while the U.S. group is reknown for its work in structure-
activity chemistry. The research is significant and is expected to yield new
information about receptors, enzymes, and the structure of auxin and its
relationship to hormonal activity, in particular. This project was approved by
the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is
supported through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the
governments of the United States and Yugoslavia. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include
dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav
scientists' living expenses in the U.S.
