Foraging organisms typically must consider many factors when making decisions
about how and when to move within and between patches of food. The objectives of
this research are to (1) contrast the responses of two streams insects which are
morphologically and behaviorally distinct to combinations of costs and risks
experienced while foraging, (2) examine in detail how one potential cost, the
presence of competitors, influences foraging behavior, and (3) determine the
influence of forager density and resource levels on growth and reproduction.
Behavioral observations of responses to forced contacts with competitors and
predators under different environmental conditions will be used to compare the
relative importance of the different factors. Behavioral observations of
interactions between feeding individuals at different densities and resource
levels will be used to determine the nature of interactions between potential
competitors. Experiments which measure growth rate and fecundity will determine
if resource levels and the presence of competitors influence fitness. The
principle contribution of this research will be an assessment of interactions
between multiple concurrent costs and risks faced while foraging, and a
determination of the role of competition. Potential applications of the findings
include: management of trout in stocked streams, and prediction of effects of
alterations of stream habitats. Basic information from the study will also
contribute to the understanding of mechanisms that maintain species diversity
and increase the robustness of conservation practices.
