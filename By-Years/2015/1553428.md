Graphs are at the heart of computer science and many other fields. They model
various complex systems, such as the structure of web links, social networks,
road systems, protein interactions, and the brain. Also, many elements of our
everyday life, such as web search, driving directions, online advertising and
parcel delivery, crucially rely upon graph algorithms. Despite this central role
and extensive research on graphs, however, some of the most prominent questions
in algorithmic graph theory remain unresolved. Additionally, in the era of big
data, the graphs that we have to deal with are often massive - they have
hundreds of billions of edges - which renders many classic graph algorithms
completely infeasible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to
address these challenges by augmenting our traditional graph-algorithmic
techniques with methods borrowed from continuous optimization. In particular,
the PI aims to forge a unified toolkit that is powerful enough to make progress
on a variety of fundamental graph problems. An integral part of this effort will
be to broadly disseminate the acquired insights. Dissemination will encompass
undergraduate and graduate curriculum development, production of freely
available lecture notes/survey, as well as training students, of all levels, to
equip them with the skill set that is essential for tackling modern graph-
algorithmic challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a more technical point of
view, the main focus of this project will be to combine the classic
combinatorial approaches of algorithmic graph theory with core continuous-
optimization primitives, such as gradient descent methods and interior-point
methods, to break longstanding running time barriers for a variety of
fundamental flow and matching questions. Additionally, the PI expects that this
work will shed new light on one of the central challenges of mathematical
programming: the convergence behavior of interior-point methods, and will also
lead to novel extensions of that optimization framework.
