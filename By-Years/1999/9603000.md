9603000 LYNCH The project focuses on the hydrodynamics observed on Georges Bank.
The project will dynamically link the Dartmouth Georges Bank (GB) model with the
Rutgers North Atlantic Basin (NAB) model in order to conduct a quantitative
investigation of dynamical linkages between Georges Bank and the adjacent basin-
scale ocean. If successful, the work will strengthen the predictability of how
circulation fields (e.g., mesoscale rings and eddies, fronts, etc.) operate at
the shelf break and seaward. The development of simulations from the GLOBEC
process studies and on the identification of interannual variability in remote
forcing effects on Georges Bank will be emphasized. This project is a part of
the U.S. GLOBEC Northwest Atlantic Field Studies, Phase 2 program. ***
