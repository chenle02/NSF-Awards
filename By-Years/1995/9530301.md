The PI plans to measure D-region parameters using incoherent scatter technique,
then using the measured parameters to improve understanding of mesospheric
physics, dynamics and aeronomy. Some of the issues involved are: (1)
interpretation of incoherent scatter data, (2) derivation of ionospherically
interesting parameters, (3) scattering from collision-dominated plasma
containing heavy ions, and (4) understanding of mesospheric chemistry in terms
of minor constituents and their reactions. The PI will use existing data from
Arecibo, as well as experimenting for additional data acquisition. This project
will pave the way for a ground-based method of studying temporal variations in
mesospheric aeronomy.
