This project has two related parts. The first studies the economics of
compatibility standards, especially those that are set by relatively
"cooperative" committee processes, rather than the market processes typically
analyzed in the economics literature. Many standards are set by committee:
telecommunications offers especially many examples. The second part studies the
economics of competition over time in markets in which buyers become locked in
to the sellers from whom they buy. The analysis includes both the case of no
long-term contracts, in which a buyers only protection from ex-post exploitation
is the sellers desire to sell to new buyers; and the case of long-term
contracts, in which it is possible to specify in advance some or all of the
features of the relationship. The research is significant for the understanding
it will give about the standard setting process. The research adds significant
elements of realism by making the framework for analysis a combination of
committee and market outcomes.
