This study will continue modeling studies of coupled estuary-shelf subtidal
frequency circulation, both density-and wind driven. Five particular objectives
are posed: 1. A critical evaluation of plume models developed during previous
work in comparison with observations of the Chesapeake plume obtained during the
MECCAS program; 2. development of a simplified version of the estuary plume
model that can be used to model plumes in ambient, inner shelf waters that have
more complicated dynamics than the uniform longshore current how assumed; 3.
Improvement of the existing steady-state plume model to include the effects of
interfacial friction, mass entrainment, and buoyancy loss by vertical mixing
beneath the plume; 4. Development of diagnostic models of density- and wind
driven shelf circulation offshore of a major estuary; and, 5. Use of the results
of the fourth for the inner shelf circulation description of estuary plume model
of the second to provide a description of estuary plume dynamics on the inner
continental shelf to include all major physical mechanisms for both the density
and the wind-driven parts.
