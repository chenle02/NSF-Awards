This project is an equipment grant under the activity Grants For Scientific
Computing Research Equipment For The Mathematical Sciences program. The project
involves the purchase of special purpose equipment dedicated to the support of
research in the mathematical sciences. In general, this equipment is required
jointly by several research projects and would be difficult to justify on one
project alone. This research equipment support from the National Science
Foundation is coupled with discounts and contributions of equipment from
manufacturers and significant cost-sharing from the submitting institution. This
project provides a good example of university, industrial, and government
cooperation in the support of basic research in the mathematical sciences. This
equipment will be utilized to support the following research: (1) MACSYMA,
MACAULY, BMDP, and SPSSx will be used to study the relationship between
numerical invariants of rational plane curves, (2) parameter spaces of complex
dimensional families of invariant quadratic differentials will be examined
graphically, (3) Julia sets of entire and meromorphic functions and stable sets
of Kleinian groups will be examined, and (4) the connection between measures and
recurrence coefficients involving orthogonal polynomials will be studied. The
projects involve high speed multiple precision arithmetic, large memory
requirements, and artificial intelligence.
