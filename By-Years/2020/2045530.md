Quantum information processing offers orders-of-magnitude enhancements in the
precision of sensing systems. At the same time, many practical sensing scenarios
require both active-probe transmission and covert (i.e., low probability of
detection/intercept -- LPD/LPI) operation to prevent an adversary from detecting
the probing attempt. This project focuses on quantifying the fundamental
improvements to the security and accuracy of covert ranging and reflectance
sensing offered by quantum information processing, as well as the systems and
algorithms applied to achieve these gains. Aside from the clear applications for
national defense, this project yields the technology necessary to implement
next-generation privacy architectures, as well as broad insights into the
mathematics of sensing and estimation. Additionally, the research team mentors
graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project, and conducts a
comprehensive educational program focused on growing the nationâ€™s quantum
workforce by engaging the undergraduate students from underrepresented
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preventing transmissions from being detected by the
adversary requires employing very-low-power signals. Even though the application
of such signals to covert communications is an active area of research in
information theory, the fundamental limits of their use in sensing applications
has barely been explored. Furthermore, while quantum methodology has been proven
to yield significant improvements in sensing accuracy, these gains seem to be
manifest only when SNR is low and noise level is high. This regime is highly
unusual in standard sensing systems; however, it is a natural state for covert
sensing. Thus, this project takes on the quantum perspective to covert sensing.
It looks to determine the fundamental limits of covert ranging and reflectance
sensing, secure against the adversary who is only subject to the laws of
physics. This assumption yields mathematically-provable covertness against the
most powerful adversary possible. Performance enhancements from quantum
resources such as entanglement, quantum states of light, and joint-detection
receivers are explored. Furthermore, transmitter and receiver structures and
algorithms are sought to achieve these improvements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
