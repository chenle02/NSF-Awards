The plant growth substance abscisic acid plays an important role in plants in
several physiological processes, such as responses to environmental stresses,
seed maturation and dormancy, and membrane transport. Abscisic acid reduces
water losses from plants by causing stomatal closure, while at the same time
stimulating water uptake by the roots. During water stress the level of abscisic
acid in leaves increases dramatically. To understand the physiological role of
abscisic acid, it is important to know how plants control their levels of
abscisic acid. This project deals with the biosynthesis and degradation of
abscisic acid. The proposed research is based on the hypothesis that abscisic
acid is a degradation product of certain xanthophylls with xanthoxin as an
intermediate, and that the oxidative degradation of carotenoids is the step in
the pathway that is stimulated by dehydration. Objectives are 1) to obtain
conclusive evidence that abscisic acid is a degradation product of carotenoids
and is not synthesized directly from mevalonic acid, as are certain
sesquiterpenoid stress metabolites; 2) to determine which carotenoid is
oxidatively degraded to abscisic acid; 3) to find out which steps are involved
in the conversion of xanthoxin to abscisic acid by the use of mutants; 4) to
develop a cell-free system for oxidative cleavage of xanthophylls that is
relevant to the stress-induced abscisic acid production, and 5) to study in
vitro how the hydroxylation of abscisic to phaseic acid is regulated. Once the
pathway to abscisic acid has been worked out, it will be possible to find out
how a water deficit plant stimulates biosynthesis, and how restoration of turgor
causes rapid breakdown of abscisic acid. These studies are therefore of interest
in connection with the response of plants to water deficits.***
