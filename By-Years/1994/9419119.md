The proposed research is on layout driven synthesis, i.e. the intersection of
logic synthesis and physical design. The focus is on restructuring logic
networks in synthesized digital systems. Four topics, which meet the goals of
improving routing efficiency or power consumption, are being investigated. These
are: 1) Incremental logic resynthesis to control wiring, 2) Coupling wiring with
logic restructuring and finding optimizations to eliminate wiring overflows. 3)
Use of generalized Reed-Muller forms to analyze logic as an aid to: - designing
cell libraries and for technology mapping, - developing new multi level
optimization techniques, - designing networks of provably good testability. 4)
Develop new methods for power optimization, at the technology independent and
technology dependent levels in logic synthesis, and also find better routing
tools to handle power constraints.
