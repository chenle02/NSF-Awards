The theory of uniquely decipherable (UD) codes has been widely developed in
connection with automata theory, combinatorics on words, formal languages, and
monoid theory. Recently, the concepts of multiset decipherable (MSD), set
decipherable (SD), and numerically decipherable (ND) codes were developed to
handle some special problems in the transmission of information. Unique
decipherability is a vital requirement in a wide range of coding applications
where distinct sequences of code words carry different information. However, in
several applications, it is necessary or desirable to communicate a description
of a sequence of events where the information of interest is the set of possible
events, including multiplicity, but where the order of occurrences is
irrelevant. Suitable codes for these communication purposes need not possess the
UD property, but the weaker MSD property. In other applications, the information
of interest may be the presence or absence of possible events (or may be only
the total number of events). The SD (or ND) property is adequate for such codes.
This project extends the investigations carried out by several researchers on
decipherability of codes. Unique decipherability, multiset decipherability, and
set decipherability of codes turn out to be particular cases of a more general
concept of decipherability in monoids which establishes a close connection
between some classes of codes, called varieties of codes, and some classes of
monoids, called codifiable varieties of monoids. This connection may allow the
use of monoids to better understand decipherability of codes. Most of the
procedures are based on game techniques, graph congruence techniques,
categorical techniques, as well as techniques related to dominoes and to graph
algorithms.
