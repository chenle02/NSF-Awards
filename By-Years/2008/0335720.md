Existing Security scoring methods are expensive to implement, lack management
orientation, and are "best practice" based, and thus have only transient
meaning. This research investigates the feasibility of a web application
security assessment method based on a security scoring vector (S-vector). The
S-vector assessment method would be used by IT administrators to manage the
security of their web applications. It shares some analogous features with the
R-value for insulation. Like the R-value, it is designed to be used by non-
expert decision makers. Like the R-value, the numerical score must be compared
with requirements to judge the adequacy (attic insulation requirements are
higher than garage door requirements). Unlike the R-value, this characterization
will not consist of a single number, but rather a set of numerical
characterizations along a number of security dimensions. The proposed research
will determine whether a method based on an S-vector can meet these requirements
and, if so, how to identify the appropriate elements, how to estimate their
values, how to compare performance against requirements, and how to structure
and present the results to management. This research is being conducted in
partnership with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State
and local governments must manage security by allocating scarce resources to
problem web applications, and demonstrate security improvement over their
complete set of web applications. If successful, the S-vector approach will
identify the most vulnerable web applications and suggest the nature of their
weaknesses. S-vector scores will allow governments to benchmark with each other
to find what works and what doesn't. In addition, Homeland Security issues will
require action: there inherently will be a tension between web access and web
application security. An S-vector permits a way to present security targets and
assess gaps. Finally, the product of this research may provide opportunities for
new high-tech businesses related to security assessment. &lt;br/&gt;
