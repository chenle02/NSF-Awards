This research is an investigation of the petrologic, major and trace element
characteristics of recent volcanic rocks, basement rocks and xenoliths from the
region of Osorno and Calbuco volcanoes, 41o-41o45' S, Chile. The objective of
the research is to determine the role of the continental crust in influencing
the composition of magmas erupted at the two stratovolcanoes and a chain of
small monogenetic eruptive centers (MEC) that are aligned along the Liquine-
Ofqui Fault Zone, a major crustal fracture. A specific goal is to distinguish
the importance of contrast in crustal composition versus the absolute extent of
assimilation in influencing magma composition. Individual projects to be carried
out are: 1) the analysis of volcanic rocks for major and trace elements by
ICPES, 2) collection and analysis of Paleozoic basement rocks, including mineral
analysis by electron microprobe, and 3) mineral analysis of granulite crustal
xenoliths collected previously. These data will help to develop quantitative
models for the evolution of magma in this region.
