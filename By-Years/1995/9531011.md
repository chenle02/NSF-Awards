9531011 Raven This award provides initial funding to establish the new U.S.
Civilian Research and Development Foundation for the independent States of the
Former Soviet Union (CRDF). The CRDF is a nongovernmental, non-profit foundation
to support collaborative basic research and collaborative applied research
projects between American scientists and engineers and their counterparts in the
12 independent states of the former Soviet Union. The projects should enhance
the conservation of the scientific and technological infrastructure in the
countries concerned, promote defense conversion, and contribute to the
transition to market-based economies. Fields of science and fields of
application will be determined in consultations between the CRDF and
counterparts in the former Soviet Union. CRDF is being established in accordance
with the purposes of Section 511 of the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992. ***
