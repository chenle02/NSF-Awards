Fundamental aspects of the interaction of transition metals with silicon
surfaces, particularly Ni, Co and Pd on Si(111) will be studied using advanced
surface characterization techniques including "hot STM" with on-stage deposition
for in situ, real time observations of atomic scale processes, synchrotron X-ray
diffraction for studying buried interfaces, and Low Energy Electron Microscopy
(LEEM) which allows real time observations of crystal growth at high
temperature. With these complementary techniques, we aim to first characterize
stages of overlayer growth from atoms to clusters to islands to layers, and
secondly to monitor the growth process between these stages, emphasizing the
connection between bulk and surface silicide phases. The long term goal is to
develop quantitative and predictive models for reactive crystal growth processes
relevant to advanced processing methods including low temperature molecular beam
epitaxy, codeposition and template layers. %%% This research is expected to
provide fundamental new information about metal-semiconductor interfaces,
particularly in the silicide systems, which are widely used for interconnects in
VLSI technology. State-of-the-art surface characterization instruments and
methods will reveal atomic scale features of surface interactions in real time
as reactions occur. The metal/semiconductor materials under study have wide
applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices, and a greater
understanding of their primary materials science properties is expected to
improve the performance of devices made from these materials. New devices and
device configurations may result from these studies as well as significant
improvements in devices and integrated circuits currently used in computing,
information processing, and telecommunications.
