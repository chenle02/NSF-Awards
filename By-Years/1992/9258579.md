A novel electronic phenomenon of commensurability resonances in quasi-one
dimensional metals will be experimentally investigated. Low temperature, high
magnetic field, high angular precision torque, magnetoresistance, and
magnetothermal anisotropy studies will be undertaken, aimed at understanding the
nature of this new effect.
