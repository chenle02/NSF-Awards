This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of fiber optic biosensors. Professor Bright will pursue the development
of an immunosensor based on the immobilization of fluorescently labeled antibody
fragments on fiber optic surfaces. This research will use time-resolved
fluorescence spectroscopy to optimize the development of the surface
immobilization chemistry. The long term goal of this research will be to develop
fiber optic immunosensor schemes that may be applicable to in vivo analyses.
This is not a goal of the present research. Success in this research would
provide a means of quantifying both haptens and antibodies in vivo.
