The investigator works in the area of Recursion Theory, in particular, Turing
degrees of unsolvability. Consider the natural partial ordering of the degrees
of sets computable from A. The investigator will study this in the case where A
is Cohen generic for n-quantifier arithmetic. A property is not easily seen to
be satisfied in this ordering for n-generic A if it has more complexity than n.
One needs a priority argument as well as a forcing argument. The investigator is
developing this theory. He has provided a complementation theorem and minimal
cover theorem. He plans now to study whether these results hold for l-generic
degrees. He will also try to solve isomorphism and automorphism questions which
are related to the homogeneity conjecture for the whole structure of Turing
degrees. These questions have been open for more than twenty years. The degree
of computability of a set is measured by its Turing degree. Higher degrees
signify the need for more powerful computational principles. Although actual
machines cannot embody these higher powers, the mind-set engendered by recursion
theory has been fruitful for those studying machine computability.
