Extension of the period of useful forecasts by dynamical- numerical models of
the atmospheric circulation is the goal of a rapidly growing body of ongoing and
proposed research in large scale dynamic meteorology. Recent success in
improving the accuracy and utility of short (0-5 day)-, and medium (5-10
day)-range numer- ical forecasts has stimulated intensified interest in the
problems associated with developing models that can exhibit forecast skill in
the extended (10 day to seasonal)-range and beyond. One line of research
concerns the set of observed atmospheric flow phenomena with characteristic
periods of variation in the extended range, and generally of hemispheric/global
spatial scale (in particular, mid- latitude "blocking", teleconnection patterns,
and zonal index cycles of the jet-stream and its associated storm-track
regions). The PI's propose to study the processes leading to the onset and
evolution of similar features in a suite of simple theoretical models which have
exhibited similar behavior in their prior research. Understanding these
processes in such simple models will help to guide the interpretation of
forecast errors in the solu- tions of the more complex quasi-operational models
now being used in experimental dynamical extended-range forecasts, and the step-
wise elimination of the sources of these errors.
