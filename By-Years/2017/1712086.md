This project will take advantage of emerging augmented reality technology to
provide students with an interactive tool to access information they need to
understand laboratory instruments, precisely when they realize they need the
help. Laboratory instrumentation plays a vital role in modern scientific
discovery, so it is critical that laboratory experiences in the undergraduate
curriculum help students gain knowledge and comfort with instruments. This
learning about instruments takes place while students also grapple with new
science content, so the challenges they encounter in laboratory courses are
amplified. Students will use the camera on their devices (a cell phone or
tablet) and capture a laboratory instrument. The software then superimposes an
interface above the instrument, augmenting the real-world instrument. Students
will then use the provided links to learn what they need to know about how to
use the instrument or how the information provided can be used to understand the
chemistry being explored. In addition to designing and testing the application,
research will be conducted to see how access to this new tool influences student
knowledge gains, both about the instrument and the science that the instrument
helps students explore.

The project will develop a new augmented reality interface that incorporates
camera-based recognition of selected laboratory instruments using the Unity and
Vuforia development suite. Usability testing will be used to optimize the design
parameters of this interface. Once development of a high-level beta version of
the software has been completed, testing will be carried out in general
chemistry laboratories with different cohorts of students accessing the
application for different experiments. Testing of both cohorts will probe the
effect of augmented reality on both the procedural and informational
transparency of instrument use and its impact on conceptual understanding of the
chemistry content of the labs.
