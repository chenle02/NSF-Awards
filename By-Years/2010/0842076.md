This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines two groups of
highly unusual members of the blueberry family, including some species without
leaves. Goals include how to tell the species apart, and determining how the
species in each group are related to each other and to the rest of the family. A
faculty member and his students will analyze morphological and DNA sequence data
from field-collected specimens to build evolutionary trees from which
conclusions will be drawn. A web-based module that teaches species analysis
skills will also be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classification of these
plants, most native to the USA, has been uncertain for over 200 years. This work
will yield well-defined groups with names that anyone, including conservation
professionals, can use. The study of evolutionary relationships will reveal how
many times loss of leaves, uncommon among plants, has happened in this group. It
will also place the leafless group solidly as a model for further evolutionary
studies, which is important because of the special relationship that these
plants have with fungi. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in
all aspects of the work and the species analysis teaching module will be
available for broad use.
