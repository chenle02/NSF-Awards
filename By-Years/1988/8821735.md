Results from the institution's prior research efforts on this subject have
demonstrated that supplemental damping can be an effective means for reducing
forces and displacements of structures during earthquakes in both the elastic
and in the inelastic ranges of structural response. The prior research effort
has identified specific issues requiring additional study before wide spread
utilization by the design profession is possible. This research project
establishes the conditions and limits whereby equivalent viscous damping can be
used to represent various damping device energy dissipation characteristics,
demonstrates that supplemental damping devices can effectively reduce both
elastic and inelastic response of multistory buildings, and initiates building
code subcommittee consideration of appropriate provisions for utilitization of
supplemental damping devices in earthquake resistant design. The results
achieved in this effort in combination with previous conclusions will provide
the background information necessary for acceptance by the design profession of
added damping as a valuable alternative for earthquake resistant construction.
