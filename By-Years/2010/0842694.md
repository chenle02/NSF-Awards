Large-scale Internet attacks such as worms and Distributed Denial-of-Service
(DDoS) attacks are increasing in scale and sophistication, and are posing an
escalating threat to our society, government, economy, and critical
infrastructures. Designing defenses against worm and DDoS attacks is thus one of
the most urgent research challenges. This research proposes novel approaches and
techniques to defend against these large scale Internet
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, this research proposes a new approach for
automatic defense against worms. By designing novel automatic methods to detect
software exploit attacks quickly and accurately, and to generate and disseminate
accurate filters/signatures, this approach aims to protect vulnerable hosts and
provide an easy-to-deploy and effective defense against devastating new worm
outbreaks, including zero-day exploit attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, this
research proposes to design a DDoS-resilient Internet infrastructure. This
research will investigate the design characteristics and security mechanisms
necessary to prevent DDoS attacks not only in the current Internet, but more
importantly, in the next generation Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will provide fundamental new techniques for defending against large-scale
Internet attacks, and will have broad impact in providing foundations for
building an attack-resilient communication infrastructure.
