9713073 Poulos While gravity waves have received increasing recognition for
their role in atmospheric dynamics, the significance of gravity-wave-induced,
near surface perturbations have not been studied to any significant degree.
Under this award, the Principal Investigator will use numerical simulations and
detailed analysis of dynamics to investigate the interaction of topographically
forced gravity waves and the terrestrial atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The
Principal Investigator will investigate: how the perturbations to the lower
troposphere due to evolving mountain waves create boundary layer flow
variability; and the influence of the diurnally evolving ABL on mountain wave
characteristics, such as momentum transport, breaking, and reflection. An
understanding of the feedbacks between these two atmospheric phenomena will also
be pursued. Analysis will focus on results from a non-hydrostatic, primitive
equation, mesoscale model, which will be run for a series of 3-dimensional,
idealized simulations of increasing complexity. There will be three types of
control simulations: 1) the diurnal cycle of boundary layer flow without
mountain wave influence, 2) mountain waves without boundary layer influence, and
3) ducted lee waves without boundary layer influence. Particular attention will
be given to periods when the mountain wave is breaking and micro-timescale
interactions are likely. It is expected that these studies will yield a far more
complete understanding of how topographically induced gravity waves and the
lower tropospheric boundary layer mutually interact. Potentially this research
could yield insights and improvement in forecasting of the severity of wind
gusts in complex terrain ***
