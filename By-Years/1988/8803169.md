Professor Vladimir Bondybey from The Ohio State University is supported by a
grant from The Physical Chemistry Program to study the structures and properties
of metal clusters trapped in rare gas matrices at very low temperatures. This
information is invaluable in the development of refined theoretical methods for
studying the properties of metal clusters and for modeling chemical reactions
which occur on catalytic metal surfaces. Vaporization techniques using pulsed
lasers will be used to generate clusters of virtually any material including
most refractory elements and materials. Clusters produced in this manner will be
studied in the gas phase and as isolated clusters trapped in inert gas matrices.
Spectroscopy of both homonuclear and heteronuclear metals and semiconductor
dimers such as oxides, nitrides, and carbides will be studied by laser induced
fluorescence in the jet. The matrix trapped species will be studied by
monitoring the laser induced infrared fluorescence using a Fourier Transform
infrared spectrometer.
