The principle aim of their research program is the systematic development of new
organic conductors, semiconductors, and superconductors through a detailed
understanding and chemical control of the electronic properties. This approach
depends on a coherent interplay of synthesis, physical characterization and
analysis to determine how molecular structure affects intermolecular
interactions in organic solids. These interactions which are responsible for the
electrical, magnetic and optical properties of these materials are highly
sensitive to chemical modification. Their past work based on this approach has
resulted in significant accomplishments in innovative synthesis, physical
experiments, and theory of organic donors, acceptors, and radical salts. Their
synthetic program will initially focus on three areas: (1) the development of
synthetic procedures leading to the long-sought donor TMTTeF
(tetramethyltetratellurafulvalene), the Te-congener of TMTSF from which evolved
the first organic superconductor; (2) the preparation of a broad class of
tetraoxafulvalenes and mixed dioxadithiafulvalenes donors; (3) the preparation
of spiro-donors which may provide more two- and three-dimensional solid state
interactions. Evolution of our synthetic program will continue to depend on
guidance from concurrent correlated studies of the structural, electrical,
optical, and magnetic properties of these compounds. In the electrical switching
aspect of their program they hope to achieve a more complete understanding and
chemical control of the formation and electrical properties of these materials
that can reversibly switch relatively large amounts of current in a short time
span.
