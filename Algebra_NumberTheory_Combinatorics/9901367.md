ASCHBACHER 9901367

Aschbacher will complete his project(with S.Smith) to produce a classification
of the quasithin groups. This work will fill a significant gap in the
classification of the finite simple groups. Aschbacher and Smith have produced a
first draft of a proof, but because of the magnitude of the problem, a lot of
effort is still required to produce a manuscript in final form. Aschbacher will
also continue his project to produce a unified, accessible and complete
treatment of the existence, uniqueness and structure of the sporadic simple
groups. With G. Prasad, Y. Segev and G. Seitz, he will continue work on the
anisotropic unitary case of the Margulis-Platonov Conjecture.

This research is in the area of group theory which can be thought of as the
algebraic theory of symmetry in the abstract. As such it has many direct
applications to many areas of physics and chemistry. In the last thirty years
group theory has been useful in solving problems in data transmission.
