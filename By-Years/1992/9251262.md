As part of the continuing development of its nationally recognized Workshop
Physics program, the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Dickinson College is
replacing Macintosh SE computers located in two introductory physics
laboratories with Macintosh IIsi computers and color monitors which are linked
by Ethernet to a file server, laser printers, and two video analysis stations
already developed at Dickinson. This equipment is being used intensively by both
introductory physics students in the Workshop Physics courses and upperclass
physics majors. It is also being used by other groups at various levels: non-
science students taking freshman seminars and other required science courses in
the department; college and university teachers attending NSF sponsored summer
workshops; minority high school students; high school girls visiting for a
science career day; and local citizens learning to monitor radiation.The upgrade
of equipment is occurring for several reasons. Our older computers and Apple
Talk network, now in their fifth year of service, lack the memory, disk storage
capacity and speed to allow us to make full use of the capabilities of new
software for spreadsheet modeling, video analysis, symbolic equation solving,
data sharing and simulations. Two recent NSF grants allow collaboration between
Dickinson College, Tufts University and the University of Oregon for laboratory
curriculum development aimed at helping other institutions make use of
integrated computer tools and interactive teaching methods. The work of these
projects is being greatly enhanced by the availability of state-of-the art
laboratory computer tools for the development and classroom testing of
curricular materials.
