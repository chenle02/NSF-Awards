NB2a/dl neuroblastoma cells provide a model system for the study of axonal
cytoskeletal dynamics. Following differentiation with dbcAMP, NB2a/dl cells
express and phosphorylate all three neurofilament protein subunit (NFPs) and
assemble them into neurofilaments in a sequence of events closely paralleling
that observed in vivo. Axonal microtubules of these cells contain acetylated
alpha.tubulin, a post.translational modification of tubulin that confers
stability to microtubules. NB2a/dl cells also express calpain, the
calcium.activated protease that preferentially degrades cytoskeletal proteins
and its regulatory molecule, calpastatin. In this project, the sequence of
events of NFP and alpha.tubulin synthesis, modification, assembly and
degradation, and the synthesis and activity of calpain and calpastatin will be
defined during differentiation by: 1. immunoblot analysis of steady.state levels
present in cytoskeletal and soluble fractions utilizing antisera specific for
unmodified subunits: 2. immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled . J H.subunits; and
3. proteolysis of isolated subunits by endogenous calpain. The hypothesis that
alterations in one or more of the events is responsible for axonal atrophy will
be tested by withdrawal of dbcAMP (which induces resorption of axons) followed
by analysis of cultures by the above methods. Direct introduction into cells of
calpain inhibitory molecules will be utilized to further examine the role of
proteolysis in axonal atrophy.
