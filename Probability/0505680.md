The PI will investigate several problems concerning the spectra of random
matrices and random Schroedinger operators. Foremost, the PI will continue his
study of random matrices with no symmetry, establishing fluctuation results for
linear spectral statistics, limit theorems for the spectral edge, and further
investigating the connections between these ensembles and roots of random
polynomials. In the realm of Hermitian random matrices, the PI will employ the
Riemann-Hilbert Problem method to investigate the behavior of the Janossy
densities for large dimensional 'Unitary Ensembles'. The goal is to then use
these results to establish the speed of convergence of the largest eigenvalue
distribution to its limiting Tracy-Widom distribution. Finally, the PI will
generalize his recent results on the distribution of the ground state eigenvalue
of a one-dimensional periodic Schroedinger operator with White Noise potential
to a broader class of random potentials.

The random matrix models under study in this proposal have important
applications to such disparate areas as multivariate statistics (principal
component analysis), theoretical physics (energy levels and resonances of
quantum systems) and electrical engineering (signal processing and wireless
communication). Schroedinger operators with random potential on the other hand
have long been studied as fundmental models in disordered solids. The PI brings
to bear a variety of techniques from Probability and Analysis to study the
detailed behavior of basic classes of random matrices and random Schroedinger
operators in physically relevant limiting regimes. An overall goal of this
proposal is to uncover new commonalities, or universal properties, of these
models through asymptotic analysis.
