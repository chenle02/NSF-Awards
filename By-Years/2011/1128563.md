The objective of this program is to develop low dislocation density semi-polar
AlGaN templates and substrate technology and demonstrate their feasibility for
fabricating polarization-free high power, high-efficiency deep ultraviolet light
emitting diodes (UVLEDs). Another leading objective is to integrate scientific
research with innovative educational programs aimed at training high school,
undergraduate level, graduate level students and post-doctoral researchers at
University of South Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to
understand and fabricate the polarization free deep UVLEDs with emission
wavelengths from 250 to 365 nm for applications in water/air purification,
analytical scientific instrumentation, bio-agent detection systems, and emerging
medical instrumentation. Although the polar (c-plane) based deep UV devices are
able to penetrate some niche markets, the output power is far below that which
is required for penetration of the largest UV market segments. Polarization
free, semi-polar deep UVLEDs have great potential to overcome the current issues
faced by polar UVLEDs for integration in systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impacts are very significant as this program will create high tech jobs
in the state of South Carolina. The proposed research activity will also help to
support the research at the University of South Carolina at Columbia. The
knowledge created will be broadly disseminated. The funds will provide learning
opportunity for under-represented groups. Moreover the application of deep
UVLEDs in air-water purification will provide a tremendous benefit to society in
general. The proposed technology is thus transformative in nature.
