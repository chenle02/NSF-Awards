9452300 McNulty An undergraduate mathematics computation laboratory for students
majoring in the natural sciences, engineering, and the mathematical sciences is
being developed. The central thrust of this development is to integrate the use
of computer graphics, symbolic computation, and numerical approximation
techniques into the freshman and sophomore level courses in calculus and
differential equations taken by almost all students majoring in these
disciplines.
