The anticipated results of this research are: o a methodology for designing
concurrent objects that exploits inheritance. The methodology has related
components for reasoning about the observable behavior of an object using a
formalism based on CCS, expressing that behavior using a new mechanism named
behavior sets, and guaranteeing that behavior during execution using the ACT++
prototype based on MCC's ESP distributed object-oriented kernel. o a more mature
technology for the garbage collection of active objects. This technology serves
not only the specific needs of ACT++ but also contributes to other systems and
languages based on concurrent objects or fine-grain processes. o the first
realistic comparative study of concurrent object-based languages. This study
will employ a common set of medium-scale problems and involve in the evaluation
process leading members of the international research community. The enhanced
ACT++ prototype system will be made available to other researchers.
