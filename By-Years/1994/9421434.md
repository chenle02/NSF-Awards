This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
supports research by Dr. Lisa McElwee-White of the Chemistry Department,
University of Florida, on the use of metal carbynes in organic synthesis. New
routes to seven- and eight-membered metallacycles, cyclobutanones, fused
vinylcyclopropanes, furans, oligomers, and other products will be developed.
Radical cation and carbene intermediates are formed during photolysis of
molybdenum and tungsten carbynes. After rearrangement and loss of the carbyne
ligand, generation of a variety of organic products is possible. For example,
complexes with carbyne substituents which contain tethered olefins and dienes
can trap the intermediates by intramolecular ene reaction, cyclopropanation,
metathesis or 4+2 cycloaddition. Carbon-carbon bond formation by attack of the
radical cations on unsaturated species can also be exploited, as can
intramolecular trapping to yield cyclized products. Organometallic compounds in
which the metal is bound to carbon by a triple bond are called carbynes.
Although much is known about the reactions of these compounds, they have not
been used in organic synthesis. In this research, a wide variety of cyclic
organic compounds will be prepared using this approach, which may offer a simple
route to many complex organic structures.
