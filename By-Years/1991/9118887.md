The Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD), an IBM PC- compatible
computerized database, and CarbBank, the database management system were created
to provide structure and citation information system to meet the needs of
persons interested in complex carbohydrates. CCSD and CarbBank, which were
initiated by an international body of carbohydrate scientists, have been in
development since 1986 and have been commercially available since 1989. We
propose to continue developing CarbBank-associated software, to continue
building the CCSD, and to make this software available as part of larger
database efforts administered by the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS). We intend to create
a completely open format for the CCSD and portable, well- documented program
modules that will ultimately be available to academic and commercial groups
interested in creating computer programs that access CCSD data. The CCSD and
CarbBank will also be made compatible with several additional computer
environments. The CCSD is expected to grow from its present 3,888 records to
over 20,000 records. It is our goal to ensure that CarbBank plays a key role in
managing carbohydrate structure information in the global biotechnology arena.
