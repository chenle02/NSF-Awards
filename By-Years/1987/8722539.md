This proposal is designed to elucidate the changes in composition and diversity
of mammals during the Paleocene Epoch, approximately 66 to 54 million years ago.
During this interval of time mammals underwent a major adaptive radiation and
became dominant land animals. Specifically, the data collected during the tenure
of this grant will be analyzed to elucidate the general pattern of mammalian
faunal evolution across the middle- late Paleocene boundary and to test previous
hypotheses correlating faunal and climatic changes.
