This scholarship program is bringing together a number of partners to
cooperatively recruit, train, employ and induct 40 new math, science and
technology teachers for the Chicago Public Schools. Partners include the
Department of Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Mathematics, and Physics; The
College of Education at ISU, The Center for Mathematics Science and Technology
at ISU, the Little Village School Partnership of Chicago, and the City Colleges
of Chicago. The project is significantly increasing the number of preK-12
teachers by recruiting and fostering new STEM teacher candidates, and financing
their attendance for up to two years in existing high quality NCATE-accredited
certification programs for teacher preparation. Sixteen scholarships for
undergraduates and 24 stipends for post-baccalaureate students in the areas of
math and science are being provided. In addition, the project is making
particular efforts to recruit and support under-represented and minority
populations from the Chicago Public Schools Little Village Area into the
teaching professions. An ongoing research program is being conducted on a factor
analysis of the pre-service experiences that lead to particular urban career
patterns of retention, quality, and student achievement. This is of particular
relevance for this scholarship program, and is providing specific evidence of
the types of experiences which can lead to teacher retention, and student
success in mathematics and science. Further, when comparisons are made with the
greater ISU teacher education candidate population, the research is expected to
lead to programmatic changes and insights in urban mathematics and science
teacher preparation.
