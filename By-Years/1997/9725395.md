9725395 Duffy The elastic properties of minerals at high pressures and
temperatures are of fundamental significance for a range of problems in solid
Earth geophysics and mineralogy. The P. I. will determine single-crystal elastic
properties in minerals to 35 GPa and 1000 degrees C using Brillioun scattering
in the diamond anvil cell. New synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments will
also be conducted to constrain strength and elasticity of Earth materials.
External and laser heating experiments will be conducted to determine crystal
structures and phase diagrams. The results will be used to develop improved
models of deep Earth composition and structure. ***
