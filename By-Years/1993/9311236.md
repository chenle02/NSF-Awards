The Polar Cap Observatory (PCO) is considered essential for continued progress
in understanding the Sun's influence on the structure and dynamics of our
planet's atmosphere. An essential first step to the establishment of the PCO is
the development of infrastructure in Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories,
Canada, and to conduct preliminary scientific investigations in Resolute Bay.
The PIs propose to provide the necessary infrastructure to begin the Early PCO
(EPCO) phase. This includes a building with laboratory space, optical domes and
living quarters, along with road construction and installation of power lines.
The PI will also provide a spaced-receiver scintillation detector and
ionospheric drift monitor and a frequency-agile radar for preliminary scientific
investigations. These investigations will focus on polar cap E fields, plasma
structure, polar cap auroral arcs, and polar mesospheric echoes. In addition,
the proposed infrastructure would be capable of supporting instruments proposed
by other researchers that might include a spectrometer, interferometer,
photometer, magnetometer, digisonde, riometer, MF radar, ST radar, and others.
