9406211 Shock This award provides one-half the funding required for the
acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer system to be
installed and operated in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the
Washington University in St. Louis. The University is committed to providing the
remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment. The analytical capabilities
of the instrument are needed in research and graduate teaching within the
University's new program of Environmental Geochemistry and Dynamics, as well as
in a wide range of research projects in environmental geochemistry,
cosmochemistry, fluid/rock interactions, analysis of sediment deposits by the
Missouri and Mississippi floods of 1993, and migration of trace metals from
sites of oil field brine contamination. ***
