NER: Particle Light Valves &lt;br/&gt;PI. Rod Ruoff, Northwestern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract. This project concerns fabrication of
identical disc-shaped particles in the ~300 to 1000 nm diameter size range and
of small and uniform thickness (ranging from 10 to 50 nm, approximately), and
study of their light scattering when immersed in a liquid and oriented by an AC
electric field. Our team includes an expert in particle fabrication and
properties measurements (Ruoff), and in electrodynamics and fluid dynamics
modeling (Schatz and Patankar, respectively). &lt;br/&gt;The fluid mechanics,
electrodynamics, and light scattering studies of this effort are forefront
science, and fabrication of the particle size and type in sufficient quantity is
a challenging nano-engineering problem. This work will lead to understanding of
the electrokinetics of the interaction of an AC field and particles of
appropriate size to well scatter visible light, and the interaction of light
with such particles. The understanding that will be generated should be of
immense interest to the colloid, fluid dynamics, particle fabrication, and light
scattering communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
