One model system for the study of thyroid hormone action is amphibian
metamorphosis. During the change from tadpole to frog an induction of urea cycle
enzymes occurs, and in particular a large increase of hepatic ornithine
transcarbamylase (OTC) activity, have been shown to be induced by thryoid
hormone. In this proposal one of the primary aims is to determine the
relationship between the time of thryoid hormone administration and the changes
in OTC mRNA and enzyme activity. These experiments will involve treating
tadpoles for various periods of time with thyroid hormones or selecting tadpoles
during various stages of natural metamorphosis and measuring the hepatic levels
of OTC activity and OTC mRNA levels using a tadpole OTC cDNA probe. Dr. Jaffe
will analyze and compare the time course of the induction of OTC mRNA and enzyme
activity by thryoid hormones as well as the relative magnitude of their
induction. Using similar techniques he will determine if the OTC mRNA is induced
in a tissue specific manner. The next series of experiments will employ nuclear
run-on assays to determine the extent to which the increase in OTC mRNA is due
to a thyroid hormone effect at the transcriptional level. In addition, an
analysis of the time course of the change in transcription rate will be compared
to the change in OTC mRNA and enzyme activity. The final series of experiments
will be aimed at cloning the tadpole OTC gene. Various cell lines will be
transfected with chimeric plasmids constructed by ligation of the 5' flanking
regions and its various subfragments of the OTC gene to the chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase gene, to determine the region responsible for the thyroid
hormone inducibility and tissue specific expression of OTC. If successful these
studies will provide information on the molecular action of thyroid hormone as
well as the regulation of development.
