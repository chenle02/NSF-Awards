A workshop entitled, "Advances in Discrete Networks," will be held at the
University of Pittsburgh on December 12-14, 2014. A network is a very general
concept, encompassing any structure that can be represented as a collection of
discrete nodes, some of which are joined by links called edges. An extremely
broad variety of systems can be represented as networks; these range from man-
made constructs such as power grids, the internet, and rigid structures, to
abstract entities such as social interaction and disease contact networks, to
biological systems such as neuronal or genetic networks. Mathematical and
computational tools being developed to analyze such networks offer great
potential for impact, given that the same mathematical framework can be used to
represent such a wide diversity of systems.

The three-day workshop will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas relating
to quantitative research about networks, pursued with a variety of perspectives
and approaches. The event will bring together leading researchers in the field,
with backgrounds in areas such as applied mathematics, mathematical biology,
statistical physics, and computational methods, along with a diverse pool of
graduate students, postdocs, and other scientists who are early in their
careers. By doing so, it will highlight cutting edge advances in the analysis of
network dynamics and structures, it will foster connections across mathematical
areas and disciplines, and it will promote the involvement of junior researchers
in the field.
