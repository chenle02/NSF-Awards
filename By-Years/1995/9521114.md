OCE-9521114 Hall The magnetic polarity reversal time scale is a building block
of plate tectonics. This time scale is also valuable to other fields of
research, yet much of the time scale is based on indirect methods that are not
dated absolutely. Absolute dates using the 40 Ar/39 Ar can now be checked by an
independent measure of time based on the periodic fluctuations in climate that
are linked to changes in the Earth's orbit. Hall plans to calibrate ages of
fluctuations in the orbitally tuned time scale so that scale can be extended and
to precisely date significant magnetic reversals. The PI has the equipment with
the precision to date minerals in ashes so that the older parts of the time
scale can be tied down.
