This award, provided by the Antarctic Aeronomy and Astrophysics Program of the
Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation, supports a workshop
to develop recommendations about future scientific objectives and technical
needs for the Antarctic space physics and space weather research community. The
last attempt to create a general framework for Antarctic space physics research
occurred in the beginning of 1990s as the U.S. Antractic Geophysical
Observatories (AGO) project was defined and initiated. It is timely now to
review the experience and results from the AGO project and to consider new
technologies and methodologies that could support a new measurement strategy to
advance a space weather research agenda.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The
workshop will be international in scope, with participants from Denmark, Japan,
United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The workshop activities will
improve and enhance international collaboration on Antarctic sciences and will
help to develop a well-integrated science community with international
partnerships for future interdisciplinary research. Workshop results will be
reported at international science symposia, future-planning workshops focused on
Antarctic research frontiers, and via established community World Wide Web
sites, to ensure broad dissemination.
