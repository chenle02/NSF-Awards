Ice forms on surfaces in cold and humid environments through various processes,
including the freezing of condensed vapor and deposited airborne droplets. The
fundamental understanding of the ice formation and ice removal on soft surfaces
will lead to development of more effective anti-icing surfaces. The proposed
research will contribute to improving the robustness of national infrastructures
against icing. This study has the potential to enhance ice-resistant sensors for
machines and drones exposed to extreme manufacturing conditions or outdoor
weather.

Current approaches to icing problems are limited by the incorporation of rigid
surface textures and/or coatings. This project aims to visualize and understand
the water freezing processes on soft materials (such as a layer of synthetic
hair) under the forced convection of humid air. An advanced X-ray imaging
technique will be used to visualize the phase change processes and droplet
dynamics under heat convection conditions. The in-situ observation of ice
formation and its removal on soft surfaces will generate valuable insights
spanning various fields, including transportation, renewable energy, and
telecommunication.
