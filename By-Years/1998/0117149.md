Science Summary: This proposal requests support for a detailed (millennial to
centennial scale) multiproxy study of the surface and deep water dynamics along
the continental margin in the NE Atlantic. Work will focus in the area involving
interaction between the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream. Multiproxy study
of high accumulation rate cores from the Continental Shelf, Slope, and
Laurentian Fan will allow identification of salinity and temperature changes and
source of deep waters. The study will focus on rapid changes associated with the
Little Ice Age, Medieval Warm Period, the 8.2 ka cold event, and the Younger
Dryas. &lt;br/&gt;
