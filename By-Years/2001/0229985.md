Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project is
directed toward the study of deformation in Pleistocene push moraines, using a
combination of laboratory analog modeling and structural field mapping. The
experimental component of the project is designed to explore how the
distribution and style of deformation in sediment pushed by a glacier depends
upon the kinematics of the push and the composition and frozen or unfrozen state
of the deforming sediment. The goal is to use quantitatively analyzed lab models
in order to understand better the great variety of folds, faults, and associated
structures that are widely observed in push moraines.&lt;br/&gt; The field
component of the project is directed towards applying to the push moraines of
Long Island two techniques potentially capable of shedding light on deformation
of the kind being modeled in the lab component of this project. Measurements of
clast fabric axes in various parts of the lobate Harbor Hill Moraine allow
comparison with the results&lt;br/&gt;of lab models, testing the idea that clast
orientations record the distribution of strain in the moraine. Ground
Penetrating Radar (GPR) is ideally suited to porous sediments, but has not been
extensively applied to push moraine deformation. Imaging of buried structures
using GPR offers the possibility of mapping otherwise unobservable folds and
faults. In&lt;br/&gt;combination with the results of lab modeling, these field
investigations are intended to advance the application of structural and
tectonic techniques to understanding the development of glacial push moraines.
