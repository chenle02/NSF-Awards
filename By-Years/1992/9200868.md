This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Professor
Harry M. Walborsky at Florida State University. The chiroptical properties of
acyclic 1,3-dienes will be studied. A general method for the preparation of
chiral atropisomers of acyclic 1,3-dienes will be devised which utilizes as a
key step a cyclopropyl carbinyl rearrangement. The relative and absolute
configurations of the chiral 1,3-dienes as well as their chiral precursors will
be determined and correlations with various sector rules will be attempted. The
rates and activation energies for the thermal racemizations of the dienes will
also be established. %%% Compounds which exist as nonsuperimposable mirror
images by virtue of hindered rotation about a single bond between two carbon
atoms will be examined. A new method for constructing these molecules will be
developed. The three dimensional arrangement of the atoms will be determined and
the rate at which the two mirror images interconvert will be determined.
