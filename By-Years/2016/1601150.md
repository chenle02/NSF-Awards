Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business,
industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect,
and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has
created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge
and skills. As an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) center, CyberWatch has
been addressing this workforce need for over a decade. In 2005, it was launched
as an ATE regional center, with a focus on colleges and employers in the
Washington-Baltimore region; and in 2012, it evolved into an ATE national
center. The National CyberWatch Center (NCC) has achieved major national impact
in cybersecurity education by establishing and validating education and training
standards; creating a new annual conference focusing on cybersecurity education
at the community college level; validating cybersecurity skills using
performance-based assessments; and building new cybersecurity curricula tied to
job roles and industry certifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its next phase,
the center will expand and enhance its leadership role by developing and
promoting (1) programs and services designed to attract diverse populations into
cybersecurity education and careers; (2) skills-based curricula; (3)
collaborations among industry, government, and academia; (4) education,
training, and assessment standards; and (5) other resources that increase the
number of faculty members and colleges capable of offering high-quality courses
and curricula in cybersecurity across the nation. One new focus will be to study
and support students' transitions from two-year to four-year institutions in
cybersecurity in order to increase the number of community college students who
enroll in and complete CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS) programs.
