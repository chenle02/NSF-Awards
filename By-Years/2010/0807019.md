This project awards scholarships of $5,000 per year for 2 years to 52
academically talented low-income, full-time students (in three separate cohorts)
to obtain degrees in engineering at Wichita State University (WSU). The
recruitment efforts specifically target low-income students in various
populations: women, minorities, and students from underserved urban schools. The
objectives include: (1) increasing the graduation success among low-income
students; (2) increasing the number of students in the target populations who
earn baccalaureate degrees in engineering; and (3) developing programs to
increase retention and providing students a transition to work through the WSU
coop program or as an undergraduate research assistant. The graduation rate of
students in engineering at WSU is 25%. The graduation rate of students in the
merit-based engineering scholarship program is 86%; more than three times the
college-wide graduation rate. Building upon the success of this existing
scholarship program, this project adds a new need-based scholarship program with
mentoring, academic tutoring, group support, community living, and student study
arrangements.
