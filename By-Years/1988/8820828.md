A Phillips CM-12 transmission electron microscope will be acquired and utilized
in the study of a variety of topics spanning animal, plant, and bacterial
systems. Included among the studies are activities related to understanding: 1)
the movement of peptidoglycans across the cell membrane, 2) bacterial adaptation
to nutrient deprivation, 3) structure-function relationship in mammalian muscles
and lens proteins, 4) symbiotic relationship between eukaryotic plants and
bacteria, and 5) the role and function of membrane proteins involved in signal
reception and ion transport.
