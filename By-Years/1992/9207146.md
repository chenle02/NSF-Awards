This research will take stock of existing knowledge in applicable fields of
knowledge on natural hazards, for example, physical science, social science and
engineering. It will assess the state of applications of that knowledge in the
nation at relevant levels of human aggregation. It will determine research and
applications priorities given prevailing contextual realities such as national
and global trends, the potential for being applied, likely payoff, and existing
constraints and incentives. This is the first phase of the effort and will
involve a workshop to determine proper direction for the assessment proposed.
