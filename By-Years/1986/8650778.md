The introduction of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) into biology
and chemistry laboratory courses (with a limited introduction into psychology)
is being accomplished through the modular upgrading and computerization of an
existing high performance liquid chromatograph at Earlham College. The recent
acquisitions of an isocratic pump plus a gradient solvent delivery system, two
detectors (variable wavelength UV and refractive index), a recorder and a
microcomputer-based data acquisition system and several columns for general
purpose and specialty use allows assembly, with the existing HPLC, of three
complete systems in a variety of configurations for different applications.
Students from the Departments of Chemistry, Biology and Psychology are being
exposed to significantly improved laboratory experiences in an interdisciplinary
mode. Seven courses are affected, as well as student research in all three
departments.
