9322714 Johnson The objective of this research effort is to develop analytical
solutions, by means of asymptotic methods, for deformation processing. Such
models will provide a rich environment in which to explore processing
alternatives. The work will be done in collaboration with industry. Two areas of
deformation processing will be modeled, hot mill rolling, particularly reversing
miss, and thin section extrusion. Results from finite element analyses will be
used to validate the analytical solutions. The work on hot sheet rolling mills
is primarily aimed at evaluating through- thickness and thermal effects. The
study is divided into two areas, thermal effects resulting from roll surface
thermal boundary layers and temperature dependent constitutive behavior, and a
thick slab, three-dimensional rolling model based on generalized plane strain.
The work on extrusion will be a non-standard application of asymptotic methods
aimed at developing a die design tool for thin section extrusion. The
application of results obtained from this research will include both hot
reversing mills and hot continuous mills. The lack of good models for
deformation processing has been a limiting factor in the optimization and
control of these processes.
