This research is focused on developing accurate and efficient numerical methods
for the simulation of astrophysical flows. This project will build on a class of
high-resolution shock-capturing methods that have in the last few years gained
popularity in astrophysics. Several numerical challenges will be investigated
including computing high Lorentz factor flows; maintaining divergence-free
magnetic fields as dictated by Maxwell's equations; incorporating space-time
curvature for general relativistic flows; including radiative cooling physics;
and accurately simulating multi-component flows. Adaptive mesh refinement
techniques will be incorporated into the simulations in order to resolve regions
of the flow where the solution is rapidly varying, and conversely, to use less
resolution in regions where the solution remains nearly constant. Special
attention will be given to two application problems: the special relativistic
problem of the interaction of pulsar wind nebulae with supernovae remnants and
the general relativistic problem of accretion onto a rotating black hole.

Astrophysics, much like weather prediction and climatology, is a field of
science in which observations are possible, but direct experimentation is not.
Therefore, direct experiments are replaced by computer simulations. In order to
carry out these simulations, sophisticated tools from computational mathematics
are required to approximately solve the nonlinear system of equations that model
astrophysical flows. Examples of such flows include the formation of pulsar wind
nebulae and the accretion of matter into a black hole. A feature of these flows,
and consequently the equations that model them, is that they can lead to
complicated solutions with sharp discontinuities. Over the past few decades, an
important class of computer methods has been developed to accurately and
efficiently approximate such solutions. More recently these methods have been
applied to astrophysical fluid dynamics. This research will focus on developing
and implementing generalizations of these methods and also on the application of
these methods to specific astrophysical problems. The P.I. is actively involved
in collaborations between researchers in both the Mathematics and Astronomy
Departments at the University of Michigan.
