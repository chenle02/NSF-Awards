This award funds two of the nations leading infrared observers in a study of
the activity in the nuclei of active galaxies - both those undergoing bursts of
rapid star formation and those which exhibit non-thermal emission presumably
associated with a collapsed central object. These investigators have developed
new infrared instrumentation which will permit more sensitive probes of the
central regions of these systems.
