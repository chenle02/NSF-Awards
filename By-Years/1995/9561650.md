9561650 Rice This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
develop a new process for depositing and patterning RuO2 contacts for use in
ferroelectric thin film capacitor memory devices such as non-volatile memories
(NVRAMs) and ultra-high density dynamic random access memories (DRAMs). RuO2 has
been shown to form a good contact with ferroelectric films such as PZT
(PbZr1-xTixO3); this leads to substantially lower fatigue, better I-V
characteristics, and improved time-dependent breakdown properties compared to
PZT devices having metal contacts such as Pt. However, the lack of a convenient
processing technology has impeded the implementation of RuO2 contacts in
practical devices. The new process incorporates two key innovations: first, the
RuO2 films will be deposited as metallorganic precursors by a spin-on process,
and patterned by wet chemical methods before firing. This will enable a simpler,
less damaging, and less expensive process than plasma etching, which is the only
current method in use for patterning RuO2. Second, the metallorganic precursor
will possess organic groups which are photochemical crosslinkable. The process
will allow photolithographic patterning of the conductive oxide contact without
requiring the use of a separate resist, thus saving process steps. Phase I will
develop soluble precursors to RuO2 having organic substituents capable of UV
crosslinking, deposit these materials on substrates by a spin-on process,
demonstrate photolithographic patterning, and assess the quality of fired RuO2
contacts. This development will enable the practical fabrication of advanced
ferroelectric thin film devices with superior performance compared to the
current state-of-the-art. Commercial applications of the proposed technology
include non-volatile memories for smart cards and pagers, and gigabit-scale
DRAMs for computer applications.
