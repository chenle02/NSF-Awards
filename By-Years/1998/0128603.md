This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
security of operating systems. This approach is based on developing
specifications that capture security-relevant behaviors of programs, and
constraining their execution to ensure adherence to these specifications. Since
all security-relevant operations are administered through system calls, program
behaviors are modeled in terms of sequences of system calls made by them,
together with their arguments.

The system will achieve enhanced security without compromising on functionality
by (a) being able to protect against known as well as novel kinds of attacks,
(b) maintaining a very low false-alarm rate, and (c) reduced maintenance needs.
