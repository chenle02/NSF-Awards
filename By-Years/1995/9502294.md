The goal of this project are 1) determining the communication, synchronization,
and architectural requirements for supporting DSM and 2) developing design
guidelines to build efficient wormhole- routed networks for supporting the DSM
models. The research is focused on four research directions: developing
multicast algorithms for effective cache-coherency, mechanisms and algorithms
for barrier synchronization, techniques to alleviate hop-spot problems, and
determining the necessary architectural supports. Theoretical and probabilistic
analysis together with simulation experiments are being used to develop and
validate the results. The educational activities of this project include
enhancing and strengthening the computer architecture curriculum (undergraduate,
graduate core, and graduate research courses), formulating a capstone design
course, undergraduate mentoring, and creating challenging and interactive
environment for graduate learning.
