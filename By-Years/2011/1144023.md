1144023 Identifying metrics of impact of public and private investment in
developing an emerging technology such as nanotechnology is the primary
"intellectual" objective of the proposed symposium/workshop. It is an important
objective, which extends beyond nanotechnology to other emerging technologies.
In addition, this symposium/workshop serves to provide economic information to
the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).

Intellectual merit: This project aims to elucidate long term return on
investment (ROI) from national investments in new science and technology
research through a symposium/workshop vehicle. The project involves two parts: a
Symposium on the Economic Value of Nanotechnology, followed by a Round Table
that aims to scope the specific needs of governments in this field and to
identify collaborative work to meet those needs. The first part will gather
information and expert opinion on the appropriate metrics for evaluating the
economic impact of nanotechnology generally, which would be a first step towards
evaluating the economic impact of the NNI specifically.

The organizers intend to engage stakeholders to explore the issues involved in
national innovation initiatives and their underlying laws, strategies, workforce
issues, etc., first, in a single-day symposium on the economic value of
nanotechnology and then in a single-day roundtable workshop on how stakeholders
can work together to fulfill needs identified on the first day.

Broader impacts: The results of this symposium/workshop would be of value to the
US Government, particularly those agencies involved in planning future support
for NNI projects. In addition, the symposium/workshop will help collaborations
among governments to increase the economic impact of research in nanotechnology.
