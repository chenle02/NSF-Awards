This project seeks to evaluate the relative importance of the various sources
of atmospheric formaldehyde, formic acid and acetic acid at remote continental
locations within the US from the isotopic composition of collected samples. At
chosen locations: (a) The carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric
formaldehyde will be determined and compared to the compositions of the
principal sources at those sites - methane and natural non-methane hydrocarbons.
The relative contributions of these sources to the carbon flux through
formaldehyde to carbon monoxide should thus be evaluated. (b) The carbon
isotopic compositions of formic acid and non-formic light mono-carboxylic acids
will be determined and compared to each other, to formaldehyde and to other
major organic emissions, both anthropogenic and natural, to deduce likely source
contributions. Specifically the project will refine existing collection and
work-up techniques, determine the 13C and 14C content of the three atmospheric
species, estimate the 13C content of local plant emissions, and determine the
relative anthropogenic influence.
