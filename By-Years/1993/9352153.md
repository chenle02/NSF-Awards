9352153 Silver This project creates a computer-aided software engineering (CASE)
laboratory to promote the application of software engineering practices. The
current laboratory facilities are inadequate for supporting full-lifecycle,
CASE-oriented software development. This severely constrains the complexity of
projects students can address and limits both their ability to understand the
need for this discipline and their exposure to leading-edge technology.
Undergraduates will use this laboratory to create, document, and evaluate
systems specifications, software designs, code units and test cases for a
variety of large Ada artifacts. The CASE tools will increase the productivity of
student teams, increasing the size of development or maintenance projects they
can complete. The laboratory will also support the creation of a repository of
reusable specifications, designs and code spanning several generations of
students. This will allow students to participate in a project which otherwise
would be too large to complete in a single semester. ***
