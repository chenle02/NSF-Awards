A common dilemma in ecosystem modeling is the complexity of biological systems
and the lack of sufficient data. Traditional modeling approaches require
quantitative data and detailed knowledge of the ecological system. Although such
data may be available for small controlled systems such as the laboratory
microcosm, in most cases sufficient information is not available for large
natural systems. Qualitative modeling is a recent modeling approach developed to
alleviate this problems. Qualitative models encapsulate more complex submodels
by replacing continuous quantitative variables with descriptive state variables
and equations with "if...then" transition rules. This approach follows the
recent development in hierarchical ecosystems theory and provides a compromise
position between complex models and insufficient data. The use of qualitative
models in ecology has been limited up to now and the software tools for the
researcher has been constrained to programs implemented for specific case
studies. In this study the investigators propose to develop a general
qualitative modeling program applicable to wide range of ecological problems.
The program will be based on an intuitive graphical interface conferring the
benefits of easy access for users without specialized programming knowledge.
