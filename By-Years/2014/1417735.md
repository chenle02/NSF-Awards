The use of active learning strategies has long been advocated in the sciences,
but high school science instruction remains highly didactic across the country.
This project addresses this longstanding concern by examining the potential of
two research-based and college-tested learning strategies in high school
classrooms: Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) and Peer
Instruction. The POGIL strategy was developed initially for chemistry classes,
and Peer Instruction was developed within physics classes. These two learning
strategies will be adapted for implementation in biology classes, with the goal
of determining which strategy shows the most promise for increasing student
achievement and attitudes toward science. The project will also study the
influence of these instructional strategies on teacher beliefs about active
learning and the contributions of these beliefs on student success in biology.
Creation of the professional development model and materials for this project
bring together high school biology teachers, university biology faculty, and
science education specialists.

The project will conduct design and development research to iteratively develop
the instructional materials through a collaboration of high school teachers and
college faculty members experienced in using the instructional approaches being
compared. Adaptation of the learning strategies for use in biology was chosen
because biology is the science course most often taught across schools in the
country, and it is required for graduation in the state where this project is
being conducted. To compare the outcomes of the two instructional approaches, 42
teacher pairs will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: POGIL,
Peer Instruction, or traditional instruction. Outcomes of the instructional
approaches will be measured in terms of conceptual gains among teachers and
students, attitudes toward science, personal agency beliefs, and instructional
implementation fidelity.
