The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of using a beam of
high-energy electrons for reducing the emissions of volatile organic
hydrocarbons that are contained in gases emitted during combustion processes.
Specific objectives of this initial phase includes determination of the
characteristics of an electron-beam sustained-discharge that must operate in
contaminated air mixtures, theoretical studies to identify the primary chemical
mechanisms that must be known for efficient operation of the process and design
of the approach by which the commercial feasibility of this concept will be
determined. This is a Phase I award made in accord with Program Solicitation NSF
90-31, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR). The project addresses a
significant problem in dealing with treatment of combustion gases prior to their
emission to the atmosphere to reduce emissions of air pollutants. It may find
applicability to treatment of emissions from oil, gas and coal-fired power
plants, trash incinerators and from industrial processes for production of
chemicals and application of coatings. Award of an SBIR Phase I is recommended
as proposed.
