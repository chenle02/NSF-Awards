Low-level motion control and high-level decision-making algorithms must be
integrated to enable full automation of complex dynamic systems. This project
investigates knowledge representation and inference mechanisms for end-to-end
plan construction in domains, such as spacecraft flight, where resource
consumption is dependent both on computational processes and physical
characteristics of each vehicle and its environment. This is an important and
difficult problem that has been somewhat neglected by the robotics and AI
communities. To address this challenge, the project aims to develop a Task and
Motion Planning Architecture (TAMPA) and apply it to two realistic problem
domains: ground transport and spacecraft mission design. TAMPA is composed of
task and path planners, resource scheduler, and plan executor, bridging the
long-standing gap between cognitive (symbolic) strategic-level and physics-based
(continuous) tactical-level reasoning algorithms. Single and formation
spacecraft missions will be designed in terms of science data quality and
quantity, observation costs, and tradeoffs between algorithm complexity and
solution optimality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education component of this award
cuts across K-12 and higher education. This project plans to pursue engineering
and K-12 curriculum enhancements to encourage computationally-aware students at
all levels, working toward a basic understanding analogous to that achieved for
math and science. Outreach to K-12 and undergraduate researchers will use hands-
on robotic experiments to draw students of all ages into a second century of air
and space operations in which autonomy will enable missions previously
considered impossible.&lt;br/&gt;
