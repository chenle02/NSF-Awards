The Pennsylvania State University proposes to coordinate U.S. participation in
an international scientific workshop sponsored by the U.S. National Science
Foundation. The primary objective of the workshop is to support the long-term
development of sustainable infrastructure by spurring new advances in the
science and technology of multifunctional materials and distributed energy
production. This will be accomplished by engaging and exposing researchers from
outside the traditional CEE disciplines to the state-of-the-art as well as
current challenges in these areas. Special consideration will be given as needed
to ensure that members of groups typically underrepresented in science and
engineering are invited.
