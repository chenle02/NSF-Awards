The investigator studies two topics concerning the analysis of mixture
distributions which are relevant for the analysis of flow cytometry data. The
investigator develops a rigorous theoretical basis for the inference on the
mixture complexity, i.e. the number of subpopulations in the mixture. This
understanding allows to develop new methodology that provides finite-sample
confidence statements, is more powerful than existing techniques, yet at the
same time is more generally applicable. The second topic addresses the
quantitative characterization of differences in two multivariate distributions,
based on samples from these distributions. The research develops methodology to
detect regions where the two distributions differ, provides scientifically
meaningful and interpretable descriptions of these regions, and provides
confidence statements for the corresponding differences. The underlying
methodology is also applicable to other problems, such as the detection of
spatial clusters of disease cases.

Flow cytometry instruments are among the most widely used biomedical instruments
in the world, but the lack of appropriate statistical methodology for analyzing
the data generated by this instrument is a roadblock to harnessing its full
potential. The investigator studies two topics that arise in the analysis of
flow cytometry data, but which are also important for other applications. Those
data are comprised of various subpopulations, and the investigator develops
rigorous methodolgy to determine how many such subpopulations can be
distinguished, and how to characterize differences in two samples that may have
different numbers of subpopulations. These are important tasks for the anlysis
of flow cytometry data which to date have not been satisfactorily resolved.
Advances in the statistical methodology methodology for the above topics have
the potential of a significant impact in biomedical research and in the clinical
setting, and have furthermore important applications in the detection of spatial
clusters in bio-surveillance, ecology, astronomy, and medical imaging.
