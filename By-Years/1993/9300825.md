The Texas A&amp;M University will operate the R/V GYRE during 1993 as a general
oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects. The Gyre is a
182' general research vessel constructed by the US Navy in 1973 and modified in
1980 and 1984. The Navy is in the process of transferring the title for the
vessel to TAMU. The ship is scheduled for 110 operating days in 1993, of which
23 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs. The ship operates primarily in
the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic. This vessel is part of a fleet
used by the National Science Foundation to support oceanographic research
projects. Most oceanographic research projects require highly specialized
equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An increasing number
of research projects require equipment that must be permanently installed on a
ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such equipment also
requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation. These
vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels,
and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically
dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by universities
and research institutions around the country.
