It is well understood that randomness in manufacturing systems is a common
occurrence due to machine breakdowns, maintenance and many other factors. Recent
studies show that jump diffusions are good approximations for these analytically
intractable systems. The objective of this research is to model and analyze the
stochastic resource allocation problem in multiple class jump diffusion networks
which arise in production systems and computer communication networks. A
stochastic intensity model allows resource allocation problems to be described
in terms of intensity scheduling and drift control. With such a framework,
schedulings in discrete queueing network model and fluid network model turn out
to be special cases. This research will characterize, compute, and search for
heuristics of the optimal allocation rule by defining allocation rules using
state space decomposition and finding sufficient optomality condition on the
defined control sets. Intuitive scheduling control rules will be obtained by
simulation; and the conjectured results will be verified using discrete time
approximation.
