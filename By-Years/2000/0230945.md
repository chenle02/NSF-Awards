This project will investigate the phenomenon of broadband electrostatic noise
(BEN) that has been observed in the Earth's magnetotail. The project will
examine a recent model for the production of BEN which involves both trapped
solitary waves and an untrapped, large region of non-solitary waves. It will
focus on developing two aspects of the model: (1) the non-linear theory of
trapped solitary waves in a general magnetized plasma, and (2) the evolution of
non-solitary waves associated with beam-plasma instabilities in inhomogeneous
plasmas.
