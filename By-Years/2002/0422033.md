This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce a
prototype low-rate fluid flow instrument for nuclear power plants that
incorporates several novel features that permit its use as a clamp-on
measurement device having minimal installation costs and complications. By
utilizing waste heat on piping lines, and wireless data links, the flow sensor
system avoids the requirement for an extended wiring system that interconnects
and powers the instrumentation within the containment&lt;br/&gt;vessel. Accurate
and reliable measurement of critical flow systems will ensure piping thermal
stresses remain below design limits, for safe continued generation of electric
power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed flow sensor
should significantly enhance nuclear power plant system safety by providing a
robust, self-contained, zero-maintenance, zero-power instrument for monitoring
in-plant piping systems. In addition, the platform for the flowmeter instrument
may serve as a basis for a new family of monitoring systems for nuclear power
plants and other environments where instrumentation wire runs are costly or
prone to failure.
