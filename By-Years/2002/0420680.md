0420680&lt;br/&gt;Davidson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant, made through the
Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, provides support for acquiring a
microanalysis system for an existing scanning electron microscope at Carleton
College. The addition of a energy dispersive spectrometer based microanalysis
system will greatly enhance the research, research training, and educational
capabilities in Geology, Chemistry, Physics, and Anthropology at the college.
Microanalysis is an essential tool for characterizing the chemical composition
of solid materials at the micron scale. Current student and faculty research
that will be enhanced by the acquisition of a new microanalysis system include
1) metamorphic petrology and tectonic studies in Southeast and south central
Alaska; 2) evolution of Yellowstone volcanism; 3) characterization of
sedimentary layers in early hominid sites in eastern Africa; and 4)
investigations into the processes that control biogeochemical rates and species
diversity in simple, microbially-dominated ecosystems. In addition, the new
microanalysis system will be used in various courses to enhance the quantitative
reasoning skills of science and non-science majors at the
college.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
