Kalos 9404888 This proposed research plan will design, implement, and apply a
parallel path-integral Monte Carlo method. PIMC program using the massively
parallel IBM SP-2. The parallel program will use a robust, general, and tested
serial PIMC code as a starting point. We will initially apply the code to the
long-standing and unsolved question involving the nature of the so-called plasma
phase transition.
