The department of Chemistry is purchasing computerized interface systems for the
acquisition, display and analysis of experimental data in the lower division
undergraduate laboratories. The systems are being used by both non-majors and
majors and in the preparation of pre-service elementary school teachers. Through
use of the systems students are having more time to consider the chemistry that
is taking place and concentrating less on the repetitive, time consuming
experimental methods. The use of computerized interface systems reflects the
manner in which modern chemistry takes place in research and industrial
laboratories.
