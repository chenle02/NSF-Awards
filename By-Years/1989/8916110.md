The Georgia State University (GSU) program in speckle interferometry has
provided most of the modern high resolution, high accuracy measurements for
binary star astrometry. This award will support a new spectroscopic facility to
complement this program based upon a fiber optic fed spectrograph and a novel
Multi-Telescope Telescope. This instrument will be installed at the newly
commissioned GSU Hard Labor Creek Observatory and will extend capability in two
several new areas of stellar astrophysics. For example, spectroscopic
observations of binary stars in combination with speckle orbits can greatly
increase the accuracy of stellar mass determinations. The facility will be used
to measure radial velocities near critical phases of those speckle binaries with
periods of the order of one year or less, those with eccentrics orbits, and
those with faint secondary components. Another major effort to be undertaken
with the new facility will be to determine whether the mass loss of Be stars
into the surrounding disk is the result of both rapid rotation and the presence
of nonradial pulsations. Observations of variable photospheric He I and
circumstellar Hb emission over hours to days during an outburst are required.
Both of these efforts require a dedicated facility.
