Lev-Ari This research aims to develop efficient model-based techniques for non-
stationary signal analysis and spectral estimation, with a particular emphasis
on Burg's maximum-entropy approach and the order-recursive realization of linear
predictors. The ultimate objectives are: 1. to construct numerically-robust
adaptive algorithms for estimating the parameters of such models; 2. to
establish the statistical properties (e.g., rate of convergence, tracking
capability and steady-state error) of such algorithms when applied to both
persistent and transient non- stationary signals; and 3. to obtain simple
procedures for recovering spectral characterizations, such as the Wigner-Ville
distribution or the cyclic spectrum from the estimated model parameters.
Adaptive algorithms that efficiently estimate periodically- varying model
parameters associated with cyclostationary signals have been constructed. The
ultimate goal is to extend these results to a broader family of signals,
including stationary, cyclostationary, harmonizable, and asymptotically-mean-
stationary signals. In particular, multiresolution wavelet basis functions are
used to characterize the dynamics of time-varying model parameters, leading to
the construction of adaptive estimation algorithms that are recursive in time,
order and resolution.
