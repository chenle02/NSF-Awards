The chloroplast genome utilizes regulatory mechanisms at both the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The development of a technique
to introduce defined mutations into the Chlamydomonas chloroplast by this
laboratory has made it possible to take a genetic approach to studying the
translational control of chloroplast electron transport genes. Since mRNA
stability is one mechanism for regulating gene expression post-
transcriptionally, RNA-binding proteins and ribonucleases which can affect such
stability will also be identified and characterized. %%% The information
resulting from this study of the mechanisms involved in post-transcriptional
regulation of gene expression in the chloroplast will give greater insight into
process which permits life forms to exist on this earth.
