EIA 0301844&lt;br/&gt; Sears, Jay A&lt;br/&gt;Corporation of National Research
Initiatives (NRI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER: KDD Research and
Evaluation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will coordinate Knowledge
Discovery and Dissemination research efforts to support overall program goals.
Special emphasis will be given to the coordination of data collection and
distribution, plus challenge problem process design. The proposal will explore
data, tasks, and evaluation strategies to integrate many different projects
funded under the KDD interagency effort. A complex task will be designed that
will both focus individual research efforts and help to integrate the variety of
efforts being funded. Additionally, attention will be devoted to the design of
an unclassified testbed capability that would include data, integration, and
evaluation processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
