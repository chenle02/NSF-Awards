The goal of this workshop is to advance the algorithmic frontier of machine
learning. Target areas include Bayesian statistics, in which many of the core
algorithmic problems bear similarity to problems that have been studied
intensively in the theoretical computer science community; and large-scale
optimization, in which a host of interesting challenges arise at the interface
of theory and practical deployment.

The workshop will bring together researchers in algorithms, statistics,
mathematics and artificial intelligence. It will be open to all potential
participants, and the workshop findings (including videotapes of presentations)
will be distributed to the public for comments and engagement. The organizers
will encourage students to attend the workshop, and will actively recruit
scientists from a diversity of backgrounds to contribute to a wide range of
algorithmic topics.
