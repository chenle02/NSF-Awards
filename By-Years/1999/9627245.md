The project is a continuation of an on-going effort to develop a comprehensive
model of ionosphere - magnetosphere coupling. The emphasis in this phase of the
project will be on coupling the horizontal convective motion with field-aligned
transport processes. An important aspect of the work is the inclusion of both
magnetospheric drivers (field-aligned currents, hot plasma, field-aligned
potential drops, and kinetic instabilities) and ionospheric drivers (varying
boundary conditions at low altitudes). The overall goal is to elucidate the
interplay between horizontal convection and the microphysics associated with
field-aligned transport for different solar cycle, seasonal, and magnetic
activity conditions.
