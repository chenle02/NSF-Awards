CAREER: Fundamental Research in Geometric Folding

Folding and unfolding is an emerging field of computational geometry studying
the continuous motion and reconfiguration of geometric objects such as linkages,
paper, and polyhedra and their physical manifestations such as proteins,
packaging, and sheet metal. Folding problems arise in surprisingly many
contexts, ranging from pure computational geometry to ad-hoc wireless networks
to protein folding. This research aims to build a basic theory of geometric
folding and, as this theory develops, to explore potential applications
throughout science and engineering. Potential applications include air-bag
design, space deployment, and drug design.

This research addresses several fundamental unsolved problems in geometric
folding. How can one efficiently compute motions that reconfigure a planar chain
linkage between any two desired configurations? Do such motions always exist for
3D chain linkages whose edge lengths are all equal? Which configurations of
proteins (viewed as a 3D chain linkage) can be biosynthesized by a ribosome? How
efficiently can one-design proteins in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic model that
fold stably into a desired shape? How efficiently can wireless beacons locate
themselves in a global geometry given just local information about their
neighbors? How efficiently can be design optimal foldings of paper into desired
shapes? How many pieces must a polyhedron be cut into to unfold without overlap?
In addition to solving problems such as these, the investigator is coauthoring a
book about folding and is pursuing education of folding both as an interesting
area in its own right and as a vehicle for presenting material in other areas.
