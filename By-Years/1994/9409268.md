9409268 Chai This is a Research Initiation Award to study the damage
characterization of structural elements and systems subjected to seismic
loading. Several damage indices have been proposed and are being used in the
earthquake engineering community. However, these are based on initiative
rationale and unverified assumptions. This project will examine the
applicability and consistency of various currently used damage indices based on
experimental work. Several specimens will be prepared, both with symmetric and
asymmetric lateral load deformation characteristics, and tested under monotonic,
cyclic and randomly sequenced cyclic loadings. The calculated damage indices
will be compared with the observed values. If the currently used damage indices
are found inadequate to represent the experimentally observed behavior, the new
methods to calculate damage indices will be developed. ***
