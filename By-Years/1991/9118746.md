The proposed work investigates the signals that initiate formation of the
central nervous system during embryonic development. Specifically, it examines
the relationship between two cellular events that occur in response to neural
induction in the Xenopus embryo: the increase in activity. It further
investigates the roles of the increase in pHi and the activation of protein
kinases in the switch from epidermal to neural development. This work will
identify the ionic regulatory mechanisms resposible for the pHi increase and
determine whether protein kinase activity mediates this pHi increase in ectoderm
cells, via microfluorimetry experiments involving the intracellular fluorescent
pH indicator BCECF-dextran. Other studies use immunohistochemistry and RNase
protection assays to ask whether increases in either pHi or protein kinase
activity are responsible for changes in gene expression in the responding
ectoderm. These studies should provide fundamental insight into the cellular
basis of developmental commitment, pattern formation, and the initiation of
neurogenesis.
