0204099&lt;br/&gt;Erlandson&lt;br/&gt;This grant continues the successful Design
Projects' activities supported by award 9707720 in which students design and
build custom projects for individual persons with disabilities. The objectives
of the program are to enhance engineering education, provide students with
insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people
with disabilities, and serve the community. The projects meet special needs of
individual disabled persons not addressed by commercial devices.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students from four engineering disciplines participate in
the Design Projects activity: Mechanical Engineering; Electrical and Computer
Engineering; Industrial Engineering; Biomedical Engineering. (ETL) student
project devices and systems are being used daily at schools and businesses
throughout southeastern Michigan. ETL is part of a consortium of eight Regional
Educational Service Agencies, representing eight counties in southeastern
Michigan (termed Region IV) and the majority of ideas for student design
projects come from teachers working at schools within that Region. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Descriptions of completed design projects are found in the Annual
Review of Design Projects at http://nsf-pad.bme.uconn.edu.&lt;br/&gt;
