The goals of the project are to calculate corrections in support of experiments
such as parity violating electron scattering that are searching for signals of
physics beyond the standard model; to calculate accurately electromagnetic
corrections to nucleon masses accounting for all we have learned about nucleon
structure in recent times; to study potential nuclear physics applications of
twisted photon states, which are photon states that carry very high angular
momentum; to continue obtaining hadron theory results from the remarkable
correspondence between the gauge theories that describe nuclear interaction in
our world and theoretical models of gravity in higher dimensions; and to use
nuclear physics knowledge to accurately obtain important nuclear size
corrections to atomic energy splittings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects
will help bridge the gap between the theory of hadrons (particles that interact
via the strong, or nuclear, force) and observed phenomena, and lead to greater
understanding of the mechanisms of hadronic reactions. One project will also
connect to another field, the field of atomic physics. They will also train new
students, including undergraduates. The PI has had two successful women Ph. D.
students, and the present project may extend opportunities for women entering
the field. The PI is regularly at the Jefferson Laboratory and bridging the gap
between university and national lab as well as between data and theory.
