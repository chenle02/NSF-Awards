Lignin is a polymer comprised of a network of propylphenyl subunits linked by a
series of phenolic ether bonds. It is known that the major precursor of lignin
can survive, with only ring demethoxylation, early diagenesis during
coalification and that subsequent transformation into aromatic macromolecule
occurs during catagenesis. The application of lignin as a paleo- vegetation
marker depends on the number of methoxyl groups present in the phenolic
component of the lignin polymer. However, the stepwise degradation or
demethoxylation of lignin in the diagenetic stage has not been extensively
investigated. The research project will examine the lignin degradation products
after short-term thermal alteration of wood and immature coals with and without
mineral (clay) matrices. The results from this study should contribute
significantly to the understanding of the chemical changes undergone by the
precursors of coal during peatification and early coalification. The data should
provide important information on the use of lignin as a paleo- vegetation
biomarker and paleoclimatic indicator in sedimentary rocks, peats and coals.
Further, the artificial pyrolysis trends could be applicable to real geological
samples such as coals in correlating the diagenetic changes of lignin phenols.
