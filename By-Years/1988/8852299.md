The quality of chemistry course offerings is being improved both in terms of
coverage as well as in facilities and equipment. Accordingly, a complete
renovation and reassessment is being made to upgrade and improve the general and
organic chemistry courses currently offered with special emphasis on
instrumentation. The PI is spearheading the major improvement plan. The major
equipment being added to the basic general and organic chemistry laboratories
includes a computer and accessories, a student model gas chromatograph, an
infrared spectrophotometer, balances, pH meters, a polarimeter, a Spectronic 20
as well as other minor items. The introductory and organic lecture sequence is
also being totally revised to reflect the availability of the new equipment. The
grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.
