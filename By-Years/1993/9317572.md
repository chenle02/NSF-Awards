9317572 Rohlf The field of morphometrics is concerned with methods for capturing
information on the size and shape of biological structures and the analysis of
shape change and shape variation in populations. Geometric morphometrics is a
relatively new approach that takes into account the geometrical relationships
among the features (positions of the landmarks and shapes of outlines, etcetera)
rather than just measured distances or angles. The proposed research is
concerned with the development, evaluation and application of new statistical
and visualization methods for geometric morphometrics. The methods used will be
applied to several datasets. these will include: two-dimensional data on the
wings of mosquitoes, 3-dimensional data on yellow-bellied slider and painted
turtles, and data from others. A large number of artificial datasets will be
generated for the simulations that will be used to test the robustness and
stability of the methods.
