The proposed research focuses on the estimation of velocity, density, and flow
fields from video recordings of freeway traffic, using data from the Berkeley
Highway laboratory, which has recorded thousands of hours of traffic flow on
freeway I-80. The investigators are particularly concerned with recordings which
are not sufficiently well resolved to allow unambiguous vehicle identification
and tracking. They propose to investigate two broad classes of methods. The
first, building on an initially encouraging approach, is based upon local
semiparametric statistical modelling of the velocity field. The second is based
upon simulation using microscopic models. Both of these present challenges for
the development of statistical methodology and theory.

Broader impacts include: the development of effective, practical methods for
video surveillance of traffic, which would be of widespread utility; the
compilation of a large empirical body of velocity fields, which will be a
valuable resource for researchers in traffic flow theory; extension of the
methodology to the more general problem of estimating optical flow in two
dimensions, which has widespread applications in computer vision; and the
involvement of undergraduates and graduate students in research.
