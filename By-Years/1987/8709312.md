Most-probable-state (MPS) analysis is a technique for estimating general
characteristics of large populations divided into regional and local component
groups. MPS is a means of analyzing and forecasting movements among regional and
local units and therefore of making regional population forecasts. Professor
Smith has been conducting research on developing and refining MPS analysis with
Foundation support. This award will support research on further extensions of
the technique and on elaboration of its applications. MPS offers the potential
for unifying the theoretical basis for modelling spatial interactions among
regions and places. The applications of such a unification would result in
improved techniques for measuring and analyzing spatial interactions of all
kinds, but especially those that bear upon regional changes in population and
employment.
