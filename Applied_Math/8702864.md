The PI will continue his research program on partial differential equations of
fluid dynamics in several directions involving both compressible and
incompressible flows. As primary goals, he will focus on the following four
topics: 1. Classical weak solutions and measure-valued solutions of the
incompressible Euler equations in 2 and 3 dimensions. 2. Breakdown of smooth
solutions for the 3-D Euler equations. 3. Multi-dimensional conservation laws
and geometric shock dynamics. 4. Nonlinear development of instabilities in
supersonic shear layers. The research is in the general area of applied
nonlinear analysis which is currently an important and active research area of
applied mathematics. The mixture of analytical and numerical approaches to the
solutions of research problems enhances the success potential of the research
program. One can expect research results from the program with significant
impact on both the mathematical science community and the general science and
engineering community.
