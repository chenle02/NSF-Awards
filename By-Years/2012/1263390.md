The research objectives are to advance the state of the art in methods of
wireless health. Projects span the range of end-to-end systems including robust
inference using body networks of sensors, real-time and energy efficient
analysis of sensor data using smartphones, development of effective interfaces
and other feedback mechanisms, and construction of readily searchable large-
scale databases of time series data. Collectively, the projects enable
quantitative determination of patient state and compliance with therapy, and
thus facilitate large-scale clinical studies that evaluate the effectiveness of
particular therapies. Projects related to inference of human motion and
provision of appropriate feedback also have application to sports training and
the learning of other physical skills. The broader impacts include training of
undergraduate researchers by graduate mentors and their inspiration to pursue
graduate studies. The summer research is designed to develop materials that
refresh capstone design courses and produce hands-on activities that are added
to lecture courses. The research of the graduate mentors, the summer research,
and the capstone design activities are all closely related in a cycle that
advances research and training in each phase.
