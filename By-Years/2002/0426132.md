The aim of this project is to allow the PI to begin new research with colleagues
in chemical engineering by spending a year integrated into the WPI Chemical
Engineering Department. The work should significantly increase our fundamental
understanding of electrochemical reactions in Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM)
fuel cells. Previously, the PI has studied mathematical problems coming from
molten carbonate fuel cells, and the PI has mainly worked with colleagues in
material science and physics rather than chemical engineering. The new work will
concern mathematical issues associated with the electrochemical reactions in PEM
fuel cells, but it is expected that other research opportunities will also
arisen during the year. The PI will teach at least one course and work on a
routine basis in WPI Chemical Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IGMS
project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
(OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
