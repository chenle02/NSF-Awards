Mesophotic Coral Reefs are deep reefs (~100-500 ft depths) that exist below the
depth limits of most stressors impacting shallow coral reefs. As such, there is
hope that these deep reefs might represent a “lifeboat” for species that can
reseed shallow reefs to ensure their survival. Although the biodiversity of
these deep reefs is well examined, many recent significant studies address the
ecology, evolution, and management of these unique reefs. The 2nd Gordon
Research Conference on Mesophotic Coral Reefs provides a forum where the leading
scientists, and future scientists, focused on these questions can compare data,
techniques, and site-specific differences to increase our understanding of deep
reefs, and their role in coral reef resilience. Funds from this project support
the inclusion of early-career researchers.

Mesophotic Coral Reefs (MCRs) are increasingly studied in the context of a
refugia for a variety of broadly-distributed reef species that are impacted by
stressors. However, there is also evidence that some MCR species have distinct
populations with unique molecular and physiological adaptations along a shallow
to deep depth gradient. While MCRs are frequently the subject of opportunistic
exploration and sampling, recent advanced studies within these ecosystems
address fundamental questions regarding the ecology, physiology, and
evolutionary biology of species living within this steep gradient of abiotic
factors. The theme of the 2nd MCRE GRC will be the changing scientific questions
and techniques, that are rapidly transforming our understanding of MCR processes
and their broader role in coral reef biomes.
