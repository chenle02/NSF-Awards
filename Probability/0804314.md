Recent years have seen important progress in the understanding of two
dimensional statistical physics. The rigorous study of macroscopic random
geometric structures generated by microscopic random inputs and interactions has
been greatly stimulated by the introduction of Schramm-Loewner Evolutions (SLE)
and related objects. This enabled to establish results predicted by Conformal
Field Theory (CFT) in Theoretical Physics, most often without matching the
techniques. The P.I.'s research program is primarily directed at realizing CFT
concepts from SLE based constructions. The methods and issues involve an
interplay of geometric, functional analytic and representation theoretic
aspects.

The goal of this proposal is to analyze mathematical models of the physical
phenomenon of phase transition. A phase transition describes a sharp qualitative
change in a physical system under variation of an external paramater, such as
freezing of water (transition from liquid to solid phase as temperature
decreases). At the phase transition, a random macroscopic geometry may emerge,
akin to the wiggly interfaces separating non mixing fluids like oil and water.
The study of those fluctuating interfaces is rooted in both Probability Theory
and Theoretical Physics. Special focus will be placed on the interaction between
these two approaches, and other areas of mathematics involved in the analysis.
