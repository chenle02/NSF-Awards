The control Engineer is often confronted with the task of designing controllers
for noisy systems whose parameter variation is so severe that classical or state
space based controllers cannot handle it. This problem provides the material of
Adaptive Control Theory. There are several aspects to Adaptive Control Theory.
The first is to produce algorithms that will estimate varying parameters in real
time and then use these estimates to modify the controller settings. The next is
to study the behavior and performance of such algorithms. This involves
questions of global stability, robustness to model error (parasitics) and
performance (e.g. output power and control signal power). The major thrust of
this research concerns issues related to performance analysis of Adaptive
algorithms, namely; convergence, misadjustment and excess lag. The latter two
have yet to be investigated for Stochastic Adaptive Control. To do this, some
new premises are needed. The premise of parameter convergence is no longer
relevant, instead the almost sure behavior of performance indices must be
directly analyzed. Finally, it is possible to do approximate sensitivity
calculations for Adaptive Controllers. It is expected that this research will
yield a better understanding of stochastic adaptive control and eventually to
better control algorithms.
