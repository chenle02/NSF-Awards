Differences in reproductive behaviors can prevent interbreeding between
populations, thereby promoting the formation of new species (speciation). How do
differences in the brain contribute to behavioral divergence and speciation?
This project combines functional neuroanatomy, genetics, and behavioral
experiments to study differences in the brain that may lead to different mating
decisions between populations in a single species. The researcher will focus on
variation within a species of a frog, Physalaemus petersi. The experiments will
test which sensory cues the females in the two populations of P. petersi are
using to make their divergent mating decisions, and identify which brain regions
function differently to cause these behavioral differences. The proposal is a
novel attempt to understand fundamental questions about the neural mechanisms of
natural decisions. The proposed work will take significant steps in linking
evolution of the brain to the behavioral differences that, by promoting
reproductive isolation between populations, may contribute to speciation. The
proposed work will include numerous opportunities for training. Four US
undergraduates and four Ecuadorian undergraduates will participate in the
project and receive training in neuroscience, behavior, and field experiments.
One of the Ecuadorian students will spend a semester in the US working with the
researcher and the US undergraduates to experience the laboratory side of
research in neuroethology.
