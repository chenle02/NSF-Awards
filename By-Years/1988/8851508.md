The objective of this project is to familiarize undergraduate students with
experimental methods of studying the mechanical properties of composite
materials. There is great demand in industry for young mechanical engineers who
can deal with the unusual properties of the recently developed composite
materials. Traditional mechanical engineering courses have not trained students
to deal with the highly anisotropic nature of these materials; i.e., the
stiffness and strength properties are highly dependent on the direction load is
applied. To teach undergraduate students about the anisotropic characteristics
of composite materials, a special course will include both theory sessions and
at least eight lab experiments. Of the equipment needed, one major piece is
already on hand. The existing static test frame needs to be augmented with the
following new equipment: multichannel data acquisition unit interfaced with a PC
for the purpose of collecting strain gage data and load signals, a compression
fixture, a shear fixture and electronic instrumentation. Full characterization
of composite materials requires a determination of the volume fraction of fibers
in the material through weighing the fibers in a sample after dissolving the
matrix. For this purpose a precision balance is necessary.
