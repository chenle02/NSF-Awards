Abstract Sreenvasan Yale CTS-9520155 This proposal seeks to address a
fundamental problem in fluid dynamics; turbulent drag reduction in water due to
small amounts of polymer additives. The PI seeks to resolve the mechanism for
this phenomenon in light of recent theoretical work which suggests that elastic
rather than viscous effects are essential. The successful completion of this
work would resolve this issue and would permit optimal use of polymers for drag
reduction.
