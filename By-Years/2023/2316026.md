This award will provide student and early career travel funding support to
attend the 21st International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols
in Australia in 2023. The primary broader impact of this grant would be to
contribute to the scientific and professional development of young researchers
working in various aspects of nucleation and aerosol research. Previous support
of this type has supported awardees with high success and retention rates in
these research fields.

This travel award aims to facilitate student and early career researcher
participation in the 21st International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric
Aerosols, one of the premiere regular (4-year) international meetings concerning
of the formation, physical, chemical and biological properties, transformations
and cloud impacts of atmospheric particles. This meeting offers a unique
opportunity for young scientists to share research results with, and network
with, an international cross-section of experts in their fields. The meeting
will be held in Brisbane, Australia from 26 June 2023 to 30 June 2023 at the
Science and Engineering Centre of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT).

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
