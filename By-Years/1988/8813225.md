The overall objective of this project is to develop a learning controller for
robot manipulators, using neural network techniques. This approach has the
advantages of being highly portable, numerically efficient, and applicable to
nonrepetitive operations. Current research goals are to further investigate the
properties of a learning controller (which was previously developed at the
University of New Hampshire) through real time experiments using a five-axis
industrial manipulator, to extend the theoretical analysis of such learning
systems, and to develop design methodologies for applying the learning technique
to other complex control problems.
