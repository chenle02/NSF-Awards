O244144&lt;br/&gt;Carlstrom&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the
participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar on cosmology
with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) to be held in Kiyosato, Japan from June
16-20, 2003. The co-organizers are Professor John Carlstrom at the University of
Chicago and Professor Naoki Itoh at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan. The
meeting will bring together research scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two
countries where new instrumentation and technologies, as well as new theoretical
developments in this area of science are now emerging as a powerful probe of
cosmology. The Japanese participants will include Dr. Rashid A. Sunyaev, the
father of the field. The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect is a small spectral
distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (the remnant glow from
the big bang) due to its interaction with large-scale structure as the radiation
traversed the universe. The SZE can be used as a powerful probe of cosmology as
it provides a sensitive probe of the formation and evolution history of
structure in the universes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-organizers have
complementary scientific expertise in the field. This enables them to evaluate
and attract the best physical scientists to participate. It is expected that the
new SZE surveys offer an independent method for probing the properties of the
enigmatic dark energy which is believe to be the dominate energy density in the
universe today and yet defies explanation by conventional physics. The seminar
organizers have made a special effort to involve a large number of postdocs and
graduate students as both participants and observers. The exchange of ideas and
data with Japanese experts in the field will enable U.S. participants to advance
their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.
Following the seminar the organizers plan to establish a workshop web page.
Conference proceedings will be published on this web site.
