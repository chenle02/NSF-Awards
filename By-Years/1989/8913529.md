Much of what we learn about human sensory processing comes from experiments
that use the approach known as psychophysics, in which carefully quantified
stimulus parameters are used to obtain highly reproducible, quantifiable
responses. Such tests can include, for example, threshold measurements in which
a subject responds by telling whether or not a particular stimulus is perceived.
Much of what we learn about how the cells of the brain process information comes
from animal experiments, in which quantified stimuli produce recordable neural
activity that can be measured in a variety of ways. Recently it has become clear
that both approaches can be used on some of the same sensory issues. This
conference has the specific intent of bringing together vision researchers using
both approaches, to address recent successes in relating physiological and
psychophysical results from primate and human work, and to stimulate new
interdisciplinary and cooperative research in vision among the international
community. The publication from the conference will likely have impact on
sensory scientists in general, in addition to its value to visual neuroscience
and psychology.
