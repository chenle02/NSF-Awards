Large-scale optimization problems are common in a broad range of practical
applications from manufacturing to transportation to healthcare systems. Such
problems are routinely attacked using heuristics to provide good, although
suboptimal, solutions. The basic premise of the research supported by this award
is that significant advances in solving large-scale optimization problems can be
achieved by combining heuristics and data analytical approaches from statistics.
If successful, not only will this research lead to improved solutions at a lower
computational cost, but the quality of the resulting solutions will be supported
by statistical theory, which is not generally available for heuristics.
Significant educational impact is also expected, through incorporating the
results of this project into existing graduate courses and through a new
graduate course in data analytical optimization that will be developed as part
of the award.

In this project, two particular data analytical approaches will be investigated.
The first approach will estimate the limiting extreme value distributions in the
search region using the recently developed Peaks-Over-Threshold inference
method. The second approach will utilize the tail quotient correlation
coefficient (TQCC) in the search for global minimizers. In statistical
inference, the main usage of TQCC is to measure the tail dependence (tail co-
movement) in tail regions under very high downward threshold values. In
optimization problems, values of the objective function evaluated at random
sample points in tail regions (valleys) behave like tail co-movement. Using TQCC
in searching the most promising regions is expected to lead to highly efficient
search, a phenomenon observed in preliminary experimental trials on univariate
optimization problems with objective functions with multiple local optima. Even
better performance is expected in high-dimensional optimization problems due to
the nature of tail co-movements in all directions in any local valley.
