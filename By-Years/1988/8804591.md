Research is proposed in neutrino physics at LAMPF. There are three components
to the program: (1) completion of neutrino- electron and neutrino-nucleus
scattering experiments using the E225 detector at LAMPF; (2) analyzing ultra
high energy gamma ray induced air shower events for muon content using the E225
detector; and (3) development work on the LAMPF Large Cerenkov Detector
experiment which will test higher order effects in electroweak interactions.
