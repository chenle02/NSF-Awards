This research will analyze earthquake models to explain how extreme ground
accelerations can be expected under certain circumstances. Earthquake strong
ground motion data recorded over the past two decades have unequivocally shown
that ground acceleration can exceed 1.0 g (one g is the acceleration of gravity
at the surface of the earth) and in some cases 2.0 g. These accelerations are
truly spectacular given that many analyses place smaller limiting values on peak
acceleration. These extreme accelerations are unusual in that nearby
accelerometers do not simultaneously record similar peak amplitudes. The extreme
accelerations will be analyzed using a kinematic model of the earthquake rupture
history that incorporates both the distribution of slip and the time dependence
of the propagating rupture front. After determining the critical parameters
based on the kinematic description of the earthquake, the analysis will be
extended to incorporate the dynamics of an earthquake to ensure that the
kinematic models are physically realizable.
