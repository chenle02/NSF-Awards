This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
Program supports the research and education plans of Charles R. Cornman of the
North Carolina State University. The goal of the proposed research is to develop
metal-based complexes that can mediate biological signal transduction. An aim is
to define the details of vanadate inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases
(PTPs), which are components of signal cascades that regulate growth and cell
differentiation, and to use this knowledge to prepare vanadium-polypeptides that
should act as inhibitors of specific PTPs. Vanadium complexes will be designed
in an attempt to control specific intracellular signals pertaining to cell
growth and disease. An introductory chemistry course will be developed that
allows for exploring shared interests between instructors and students, with
electronic communications enhancing this interaction. In a second educational
project, student groups will propose a project to reproduce a published result
with real-world constraints of time, cost and instrument availability.
