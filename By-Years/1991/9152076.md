laboratory to support the teaching of a cluster of classes at all undergraduate
levels in Physical Geography and Cartography. Students enrolled in science core
curriculum classes in meteorology and climatology are using the equipment in
conjunction with the reception and analysis of satellite weather data. Students
in advanced classes use the laboratory in the study of data structutres,
conversion between coordinate systems,
