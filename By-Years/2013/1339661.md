The NSF Division of Chemistry and Environmental Protection Agency support
Professors Brian B. Laird, Raghunath V. Chaudhari, Bala Subramaniam, Ward H.
Thompson and Jon A. Tunge of the University of Kansas for a collaborative effort
on Networks for Sustainable Molecular Design and Synthesis. One challenge facing
the chemical industry is the development of sustainable manufacturing processes
that eliminate the use of hazardous materials, minimize waste, conserve
resources, and improve safety. In this project, Professor Laird and his team of
chemists and chemical engineers use an integrated approach to address this
challenge. This research effort uses molecular modeling, synthesis, reactor
engineering, kinetic studies and life-cycle assessments to develop and optimize
the design of industrial catalytic processes for minimal environmental impact.
This framework is being applied to two examples of high-volume chemical
processes. One is a safer, phosgene-free route to dimethyl carbonate, which is
used to manufacture polycarbonates and polyurethanes. The other process is a
cleaner, more efficient route from butadiene to adipic acid, a commodity
chemical used to make nylon.

Phosgene, although a common industrial chemical, is toxic and detrimental to the
environment. The development of green chemistry which bypasses toxic
intermediates is an important goal. The discoveries and methodologies developed
for the chemicals studied here find broader applications for other major
chemical processes. In addition, the next generation of scientists and engineers
are being trained to work in multidisciplinary teams and become skilled
communicators. By translating project results into educational laboratory
activities, which include high school students and/or college freshmen, a broad
cross-section of the nascent workforce benefits.
