There has been a pronounced upsurge in interest in food colorants of natural
origin. The anthocyanins are well known but they are unstable and sensitive to
pH. Recently a new group of anthocyanins show good promise as food colorants.
Pigments from Tradescentia dracaenoides have multiple acyl groups on the
molecule which lends stability on storage when formulated into foods. In effect,
these pigments show high coloration at high pH values whereas conventional
anthocyanins are nearly colorless at pH values above 4. Purified pigment
extracts will be formulated into sugar, citrate/phosphate model beverages and
pectin gel preparations for storage studies. Color will be monitored by
tristimulus colorimetry. A new method of analysis will be developed to monitor
anthocyanin degradation, since conventional methods do not work. A new method of
purifying the crude pigment extracts will also be developed. The pigment will be
isolated and identified using resin columns, HPLC, paper chromatography and
spectrophotmetry.
