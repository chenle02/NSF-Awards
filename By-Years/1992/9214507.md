Research in pion physics and weak interactions will be carried out at LAMPF and
at PSI. The LAMPF work will measure the pion-pion scattering length to test
various QCD inspired theories of the strong interaction. The method used
involves threshold pion production in pion-proton scattering. New data will be
taken at LAMPF, and combined with a global phase shift analysis fit to all
higher energy data. The PSI experiment is a measurement of the charged pion beta
decay to a neutral pion. A new cesium iodide calorimeter and wire chamber
tracking array is required for this purpose. A collaboration has been formed to
build this detector. The experiment will determine elements of the fundamental
mixing matrix which relates transitions between different quark generations. New
constraints will be placed on the standard model of fundamental interactions.
