The long-term goal of these studies is a clear understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that ensure the proper expression of genetic information in the form
of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in eukaryotic cells. The experiments focus on a
nuclear mRNA surveillance pathway in cells that destroys aberrant mRNAs before
they cause toxic effects on cell growth. Central to this pathway is a conserved
complex of proteins called the exosome, which degrades mRNA molecules that fail
to undergo critical steps during their formation. A major unanswered question
addressed by this research is how this complex distinguishes between normal and
aberrant mRNAs. Previous studies identified Rrp6p, a nuclear exoribonuclease
component of the exosome and showed that it plays a critical role in degrading
aberrant mRNAs in the nucleus. Recent evidence indicates that a second complex
called TRAMP plays a key role in activating mRNA substrates for degradation by
the nuclear exosome. Experiments described here aim to (i) identify the
components of the TRAMP complex required for enhancement of Rrp6p activity, (ii)
elucidate the role that TRAMP and Rrp6p play in a general and a specific pathway
for mRNA degradation. These studies should shed light on the mechanisms that
cells use to recognize and destroy potentially toxic RNA molecules, a process
essential for the survival of all organisms. These studies will provide training
for graduate and undergraduate students, including women and minorities. These
studies will also generate novel cell lines that will be made available to the
general scientific community for experimentation.
