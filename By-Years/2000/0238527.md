This career grant project offers a novel research approach to attempt to reduce
our uncertainty of climate system sensitivity to greenhouse warming by
quantifying cloud radiative feedbacks in the historical data record. The study
focuses on the three clouds types believed to have the greatest radiative impact
on the climate system: Oceanic subtropical low-level; oceanic summertime storm-
track; and tropical deep convection. The data set to be utilized as a basis for
the research is the cloud catalogue created by Warren and Hahn (1999) which
offers a record beginning in 1952, pre-dating the satellite record by three
decades. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity is expected to enhance
scientific understanding of cloud feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity,
contributing towards improvements in understanding and modeling global warming
associated with climate change. The results of this project will be communicated
to the general population via public lectures and education of K-12 students and
their teachers.
