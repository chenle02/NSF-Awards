This project is developing two sets of interactive examples and tools to assist
in the teaching and learning of mathematical proof techniques. While the primary
target audience is pre-service teachers at the secondary level and elementary
teachers with a concentration in mathematics, the tools are also being piloted
in an upper division abstract algebra course. Both the CounterExamples package
and the ProofReader package are being designed to facilitate extensibility in
that other faculty can add problems to both. The Mathematics Digital Library
(www.mathdl.org) is serving as a primary repository. In addition, discussions
with a publisher are underway for the examples and tools to complement an
existing discrete mathematics textbook. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
