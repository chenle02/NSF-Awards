The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes smart
algorithm-driven superior stents for use in Urology, Gastrointestinal surgery,
ENT surgery and Neurosurgery. Patients suffering from malignant obstruction,
benign biliary strictures, biliary leaks, bile duct stones, transplants,
pancreatic strictures due to malignancy, pancreatic fistulae, chronic
pancreatitis, and pancreas divisum would potentially benefit from this
technology. Almost 112,000 people are treated for these conditions every year in
the U.S. The invention is expected to significantly improve performance over
currently used plastic/teflon based stents and also augment functionality on
many fronts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will focus on assessing
the market requirements to refine the design of a novel Multi-Axis Deformable
Sensor/Actuator that is based on the principle of tensegrity. It offers a
lightweight actuator system with 6 degrees of freedom of manipulation. This
provides the opportunity to create 3-dimensional structures that can be
delivered to a desired anatomical/surgical site in the human body for the
purpose of repairing strictures, in a low profile and can be expanded to the
desired shape. This system offers a new generation of intra-body luminal space
maintainers, stents, and expanders. The main value proposition is guaranteed
stent retention. The device involves smart algorithms that sense the states
(angles, loads) of the system and locally activates them to achieve a desired
spatio-temporal support. These algorithms are run in real-time, in embedded
processor.
