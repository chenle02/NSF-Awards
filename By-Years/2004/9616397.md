CISE/EHR/ENG/MPS Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies Program: A
Design Education Center: Using Cognitive Science and Technology to Facilitate
Learning and Doing Design Georgia Tech has been awarded funding in the amount of
$50,110 for a period of 12 months to initiate a planning effort to design a
multi-institute, multi-disciplinary, collaborative center to design, develop and
evaluate environments (both physical and virtual) for design education at all
education levels; to design, develop and evaluate curricula, curriculum
guidelines, and classroom practices for learning and doing design. The center
will serve as a research center, a forum for issues in design education, a forum
for teacher and faculty development, and an agent for pragmatic dissemination of
the results of its research. Partners in this planning grant include MIT,
University of Colorado, University of California at Berkeley, University of
Wisconsin, Addison-Wesley Interactive, Apple Computer, and Netscape.
