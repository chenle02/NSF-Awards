9506588 Foley This award is made under NSF's CAREER Program. The principal
investigator is a young scientist who has chosen to pursue the challenging
course of interdisciplinary research. The research portion of Dr. Foley's
project is focused on improving understanding of global environmental systems,
particularly the interface between the living biosphere and the physical climate
system. Climate is of paramount importance to both natural and managed
ecosystems; conversely, the terrestrial ecosystems significantly influence the
exchange of moisture, momentum, and energy at the land surface-atmosphere
interface, affecting climate. To properly investigate the dynamics of these
interactions and to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on the
system require the use of models which capture the key elements of the physical
and biological processes involved. Dr. Foley seeks to improve the representation
of biophysical and biogeochemical processes in global and continental-scale
ecosystem models. This will be done by constructing an integrated biosphere
investigation model composed of four sub-models to handle surface fluxes,
vegetation cover, nutrient cycling and hydrologic processes. The educational
portion of his project involves the development of new interdisciplinary
instructional materials and interdisciplinary courses for the undergraduate
level. The support for this award is shared by three divisions - Environmental
Biology, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences as part of the Water and Energy:
Atmospheric, Vegetative, and Earth Interactions (WEAVE) Program under Global
Change.
