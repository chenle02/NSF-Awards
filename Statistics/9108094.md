Much scientific research now involves obtaining large numbers of observations
which are interrelated in highly complicated ways. Quantitative work for such
research is often best served in a supercomputer environment because of both the
enormity of the data and the complexity of the relationships. In this
exploratory project the principal investigator will examine the statistical
interface with supercomputing to determine areas of statistical theory and also
applications where the comparative advantage of supercomputing is great. Then
with a selected area or application as the focus, essential statistical issues
may be defined or redefined for the supercomputing context.
