With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor
Robert Paley from Swarthmore College and colleagues Liliya Yatsunyk, Kathleen
Howard and Stephen Miller will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal
is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas
such as (a) diastereoselective spirocyclizations directed by planar chiral metal
carbonyl complexes; (b) interaction of G-quadruplex DNA with small molecule
ligands; (c) application of NMR methods to elucidate how an integral membrane
protein induces curvature in cholesterol containing membrane bilayers; and (d)
studies of interspecies quorum sensing signal processing proteins.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools
available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials
chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching
as well as research not only at Swarthmore College but also at collaborating
institutions such as Ursinus College, LaSalle University, Saint Peter's
University. The instrumentation will also impact some industrial collaborators.
