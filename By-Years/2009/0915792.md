Elections are a broad model for collective decision-making. Since around 1990,
worst-case hardness notions (most particularly, NP-hardness) have been widely
studied as a method for protecting election systems from manipulation, bribery,
and control. Such protective worst-case results have by now been obtained for
many problems and many election systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this
project is to study the ways that these protective results can be bypassed for
the election manipulation, bribery, and control problems. This project will seek
to transform the way security of elections is viewed: to make vividly clear by
actual proofs and algorithms that worst-case protections can on important real-
word systems and situations be shredded, and thus that bypass attacks are a true
threat. The project will do this through exploring the extent of worst-case
protections and by finding the extent to which those protections can be
bypassed, via studying restrictions on and assumptions about models, domains,
and distributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a wide range of
broader impacts, including information dissemination, bringing together local
researchers interested in computational social choice, training of students, and
service to the community. In addition, the topic itself is of broad relevance to
society. Elections are of great importance both in human settings and in a
rapidly expanding range of electronic settings, and indeed the study of
elections is of active interest in computer science, economics, political
science, operations research, and mathematics. The core research of this project
seeks to better understand when the protection offered by worst-case hardness
results about election systems can be bypassed, and thus is relevant within a
broad range of contexts in which elections are used for collective decision-
making: from spam filtering to critical human elections to sports tournaments to
multiagent systems. Showing which important, known-worst-case-safe election
systems are vulnerable to bypass attacks serves the interest of the citizenry,
since system designers can then avoid those systems, and in the long run more
broadly secure systems can be developed.&lt;br/&gt;
