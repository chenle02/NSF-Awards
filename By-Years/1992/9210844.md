The research to be performed on this RIA award will investigate fracture
behavior of bimaterial interfaces through the use of new types of bimaterial
specimens and test fixtures. Based on a full range of mode mixities, failure
loci of various bimaterial interfaces will be determined. This study will
provide an understanding of those mechanisms which are important to improving
the macroscopic toughness of brittle composites.
