Biomass holds great potential as a fuel as it addresses two important issues ?
global climate change and the demand for renewable fuels. Biomass generally has
high moisture content and is usually dried before being utilized. Nonetheless,
there are a number of applications where ?wet? biomass can be useful. For
example, when biomass is burned with oxygen in a power plant and the resulting
carbon dioxide is stored underground, the process leads to carbon negative power
production.

This program seeks to gain knowledge of the physico-chemical processes
associated with combustion of high-moisture content fuels. Three types of
biomass/water mixtures will be studied: alcohol/water solutions, algal
suspensions, and biomass solubilized in water. The vaporization and combustion
characteristics will be studied in single droplet experiments and in a spray
combustor. Analytical models of two-component droplet vaporization and
combustion will be used to understand and interpret results.

This work will provide fundamental data needed to support technologies for a
sustainable approach to power generation with carbon capture and storage. The
research will be an important educational tool, exposing our youth to novel
approaches to renewable, sustainable technologies. In addition, an innovative,
interdisciplinary experiential course on Energy and Environment will be
developed.
