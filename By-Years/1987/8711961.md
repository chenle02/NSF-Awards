Individual taxpayers' perceptions of formal and informal sanctions for tax
cheating influence their patterns of noncompliance with income tax laws. Factors
which shape these perceptions include personal experiences with tax collection
agencies, exposure to mass media and interpersonal communications about tax
compliance and enforcement, and differences in economic and work situations of
individual payers that affect the objective probability of their detection.
Using survey data from 2000 Minnesota residents, Drs. Smith and Kinsey examine
the effect of these factors on sanction perceptions and on past and future
compliance by testing causal models. Their study explains patterns of
noncompliance and offers ways of modelling the tax compliance process. More
broadly, it contributes to understanding the process of deterrence by examining
perceptions and also by expanding the application of deterrence theory to a form
of deviance especially challenging in that it involves knowledge and
interpretation of complex and ever changing laws.
