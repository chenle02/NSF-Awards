This research addresses the surface modification of two classes of materials
using a specially designed device in which fibers, wires, and powders can be
surface modified. The materials will be exposed to a plasma in which an organic
monomer is injected. The objective of this research project is to design, build,
and thoroughly test two bench-top size reactors in which bundles of fibers and
batches of powdery materials can be coated with plasma-polymerized films. This
technology will constitute a new process for surface modification of these
materials which is nonpolluting, as opposed to existing technologies which
usually employ solvents. One attractive aspect of a plasma polymerization
process for surface modification of materials is that a wide range of polymers
with different properties can be obtained from one monomer. Thus, the film can
be tailored to the application in terms of adhesion, chemical and thermal
stability, mechanical and other properties. Additional important aspects of the
process are the low energy requirements and the absence of solvents, making the
process environmentally attractive.
