Number Theory Conference in Honor of Harold Stark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harold
Stark and his students have had a profound&lt;br/&gt;influence on number theory,
especially on the analytic&lt;br/&gt;theory of algebraic numbers. Particularly
noteworthy &lt;br/&gt;have been the contributions to the theory of
special&lt;br/&gt;values of L-functions, of Siegel zeros, and
on&lt;br/&gt;automorphic methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will
serve as a followup to the successful&lt;br/&gt;meeting on Stark conjectures
held two years ago with NSF's&lt;br/&gt;support at Johns Hopkins, but will have
a more broader&lt;br/&gt;agenda, covering all of Stark's work and related
areas.&lt;br/&gt;There has not been any recent meeting devoted to
this&lt;br/&gt;area, and in view of the recent progress that has
been&lt;br/&gt;achieved, a conference summarizing current knowledge
and&lt;br/&gt;directions of research will help spread the
information&lt;br/&gt;and generate new ideas. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
