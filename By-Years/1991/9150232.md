This proposal is directed at the development of a cadre of Science, Technology,
and Society (STS) teachers at the middle/junior high school level in rural areas
of central Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. The goal of the proposal is
to establish a cadre of STS teacher leaders who will have the ability to develop
and implement STS units. The proposal will also investigate the effectiveness of
the teachers in disseminating STS materials in their own schools as well as to
the larger community of science educators. Cost sharing is equivalent to 8% of
the NSF award.
