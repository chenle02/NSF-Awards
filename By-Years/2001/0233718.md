The Biodiversity Project is requesting funds to plan a national conference on
the topic of global biodiversity. The goal of the conference is to build an
education agenda for biodiversity that will identify successful programs,
provide strategies for reaching underserved and underrepresented groups, foster
collaboration and coordinate financial support for biodiversity across agencies.
The planning process will yield a conference agenda, a list of invitees, a list
of potential speakers, goals, themes and activities, as well as identification
of model projects. A budget and fundraising plan will also be developed.
