9553592 Vesel The principal investigator proposes to design, field test,
evaluate, publish, and market new material to extend the scope of the seven
units in the NGS Kids Network series for Elementary Grades. Kids Network is a
telecommunications-based science curriculum that allows students in grades 4
through 6 to learn science content and process as they conduct hands-on
investigations and share data and ideas with students on a computer network. The
new product will supplement each of the extant units with new material that will
include: (1) open-ended, student-centered activities, (2) activities for using
the Kids Network software and other available, recently developed technology,
(3) diskettes with text files to be read or printed with the Kids Network
software, (4) open-ended activities that extend the program into mathematics,
language arts, and social studies, (5) flowcharts and tables to help teachers
plan and to see how a unit supports the national standards, and (6) authentic
assessments. The project will be a collaborative effort of three partners: TERC,
The National Geographic Society (NGS), and the NETWORK. TERC will be responsible
for the development of the supplemental material, The NETWORK will be
responsible for the field testing and evaluation, and NGS will be responsible
for publication, marketing, and dissemination.
