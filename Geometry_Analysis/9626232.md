9626232 Croke The proposed research lies in the area of Riemannian Geometry.
More specifically, the investigator plans to study the induced action of
fundamental groups on the boundary of the universal covering space of manifolds
of non-positive curvature; to pursue spectral rigidity problems for compact
manifolds of negative sectional curvature; to continue his study of
isoperimetric inequalities. Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of spaces
possessing a notion of distance. These are abstract spaces in that a Riemannian
manifold does not have to sit inside an ambient space, unlike curves and
surfaces in 3-space. The overall shape of such a space is then determined by its
so called topology as well as the distance function. The proposed research has
to do with understanding this interaction between the topology and distance
function.
