This award supports participation in the international conference "Arithmetic
2015: Elliptic Curves, Diophantine Geometry, and Dynamics" to be held at Brown
University in Providence, RI from August 11 - 15, 2015. The conference will
bring together experts, young researchers, and graduate students working in the
broadly-defined areas of arithmetic geometry and number theory. It will provide
an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to interact with
leading experts and to learn about recent results. The conference is expected to
attract approximately 200 participants. It will feature 23 distinguished invited
speakers along with a poster session highlighting the work of graduate students
and recent Ph.D.s. The grant will support the participation of approximately 30
graduate students and young faculty, as well as several of the invited speakers.

The study of elliptic curves, diophantine geometry, and arithmetic dynamics are
all modern extensions of the classical, even ancient, study of integer solutions
to polynomial equations. Among the many important concepts in the field, two
principal ideas lie close to the heart of all three topics: the study of
rational points on algebraic varieties, and the theory of arithmetic height
functions. The conference will foster collaboration across these different areas
of arithmetic geometry and number theory by focusing on these two unifying
themes. More information can be found at the conference website
