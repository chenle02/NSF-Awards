San Juan College is improving its laboratory for electrical engineering and
technology students by incorporating equipment for computer supported data
collection and wave analysis. With the new equipment for four workstations,
students experience the control and storage of data through use of a personal
computer. These workstations are PC controlled, and each uses a high speed
digitizer capable of storing simultaneous readings, using Assystant-GPIB
software. Students, over a quarter being Native Americans, learn better
measurement methods, and are expected to take these skills into the workplace,
helping local industry keep pace with current engineering practice.
