Two computer laboratories are being used to support mathematics instruction by
implementing a wide variety of computer tools designed to make mathematics
learning more of a "hands on" exploration of mathematics, much like a natural
science laboratory. While Mathematica will be one of the tools employed, it will
be used primarily as a calculation engine designed to serve other, more course
specific computer tools developed by the faculty and tailored to the needs of
the students. The NeXTSTEP development environment is used to create computer-
based
