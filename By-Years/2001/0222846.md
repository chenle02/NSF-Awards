The project plans to solve two important network problems facing distributed
computation and Grids. The first problem is to provide a sufficiently flexible
and robust framework for authentication and authorization, and the second
problem is to provide secure mechanisms to allow researchers to upload new or
enhanced measurement tools in a secure and trustworthy fashion. Building on the
National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI), the project plans to evolve
NIMI to a truly large scale implementation. Work involves migrating messaging,
authentication and authorization to commonly used components, and mitigating
some of the security problems associated with uploading measurement tools by
building fine-grained delegation support and different levels of security. These
structures can be used for various forms of distributed passive monitoring and
security monitoring such as intrusion detection
systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIMI architecture will be extended to support
open large-scale grid technologies. The overall vision is to encourage
researchers, especially grid-proejcts, to build clients which will interact with
the NIMI infrastructure. The infrastructure can then be used for secure,
flexible command and control mechanisms, and also be sued for distributed
passive monitoring. &lt;br/&gt;
