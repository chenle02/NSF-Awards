Rhode Island proposes to create systemic change by establishing a support
system consisting of leadership teams in the department of education, a cadre of
ten science and mathematics specialists located a five sites in the state, and
building level teams in every school. Ancillary goals include building a
capacity to initiate and sustain change at the state, district, school, and
classroom levels; increasing the interest of women and minorities in science and
mathematics; and enlisting the involvement of the community in the schools
through the establishment of a partnership involving business, industry,
parents, and the schools. Cost sharing: 24%
