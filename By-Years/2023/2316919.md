In this project, managed by the Chemistry Division and jointly funded by the
Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Yitong
Dong and his students at the University of Oklahoma (OU) will study lead halide
perovskite nanocrystal growth at the single-particle level to advance the
development of low-cost single photon emitters (SPEs). SPEs that emit photons on
demand are necessary to build future quantum photonic networks that ensure
secure quantum communications. This project will enable accurate spectroscopy
measurements of individual perovskite nanocrystals without interferences from
post-synthesis nanocrystal degradations. Furthermore, the findings will advance
the understanding of the growth mechanism of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals.
The project will integrate new material synthesis approaches into different
research programs and centers at OU. Professor Dong will also create
opportunities to engage undergraduate students through the project and encourage
the participation of prospective students through a series of outreach programs.

Professor Dong and his students will create a nano-sized liquid/liquid (L/L)
interface confined to the tip of a nanopipette for nanocrystal growth. The
diffusion and delivery of crystal precursors will be regulated by tuning their
electrochemical potentials. The nanocrystal nucleation and growth kinetics are
expected to be tunable by controlling the dimensions of the nanopipette tip and
the electrochemical biases applied across the L/L interface. They will also use
a confocal fluorescence microscope to monitor the photoluminescence spectra of
nanocrystals during their growth and photon correlation measurements to assess
the number of nanocrystals generated on the L/L interface. These efforts will
achieve single lead halide perovskite nanocrystal growth.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
