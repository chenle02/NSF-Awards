The American public remains deeply divided about a range of social issues from
inequality to immigration. Social media sites are often blamed for deepening
such divisions by creating "echo chambers," or preventing people from being
exposed to opinions from those who do not share their views. This research
examines whether experimentally disrupting such echo chambers--by exposing a
large sample of two antagonistic groups to social media messages from the
opposing group--can increase moderation and compromise. The results of this
research will thereby promote cooperation by helping policy makers and industry
leaders design whether and how to regulate social media sites and ensure the
inclusive deliberation that is essential for the function of our public
institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social scientists have become increasingly
concerned that selective exposure to information within social media echo
chambers may contribute to political polarization and divergent public attitudes
about controversial issues such as inequality and immigration. This research
draws upon social network analysis and social psychology in order to develop a
set of hypotheses about the relationship between social media echo chambers and
political attitudes and evaluates them via a mixed-method field experiment on
Twitter that combines quantitative surveys, automated text analysis, and
interviews with a large sample of Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
