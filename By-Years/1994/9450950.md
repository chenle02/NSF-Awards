9450950 Tseng An interdisciplinary project involving the Departments of Biology,
Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics on incorporates computer imaging
technology into the biology curriculum. A multi-functional computer image
analysis system with the custom designed software has been developed for such a
purpose. This master system combines three major functions (electrophoresis gel
analysis, chromosome analysis/karyotyping, and morphometric analysis) into a
single unit, a workstation. Twenty of these workstations are used for 1)
teaching of a new course in Bioimaging, and 2) incorporation of the imaging
technology into four biology courses (Microbiology, Cell Biology, Genetics, and
Recombinant DNA) and one Computer Graphics course. The Bioimaging lab is also
used for honors projects involving image analysis.
