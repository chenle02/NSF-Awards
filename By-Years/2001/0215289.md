This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will seek to achieve a
quantum leap in sensitivity of gamma ray astronomy in the 100 keV to 10 MeV
region through development of a novel high pressure xenon (HPXe) detector
element for imaging the region of interest. This development will incorporate
(1) a cost-effective means of containing HPXe safely up to pressures of 3240
psig, (2) innovative means of measuring the spatial coordinates of gamma ray
interactions within the HPXe detecting element for high quality spatial and
angular measurements, and (3) novel methods of realizing the optimal
spectroscopic properties of HPXe at a density of 0.55 g/cm3 to achieve an energy
resolution approaching 0.45% at 1 MeV. A large array of such detecting elements
could provide the ideal detector for a next generation HPXe Compton gamma ray
telescope, having an angular resolution of a few tenths of a degree and
providing a hundred-fold increase in sensitivity over that predicted for the
upcoming Integral (SPI) satellite gamma observatory. A scaled down version of
such a telescope could also be used for regional neutron activation analysis of
the Martian surface, remote detection applications, or an excellent alternative
to HPGe detectors currently used in laboratory
settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The anticipated outcome of this project is a new
basic detector element, which can be used for a variety of space physics, field
detection, and laboratory applications. The physical characteristics of such a
detector combined with an order of magnitude improvement in energy resolution
make it well suited for gamma detection in the 100 keV to 5 MeV band aboard
satellite or balloon-borne instruments. Another very exciting application of
this technology is a spectrometer for detection of radiation emitted as a result
of neutron activation of the Martian surface. Such research could provide
important data regarding planetary soil composition. In addition to astrophysics
applications, a high energy resolution detector element based on high pressure
xenon cylindrical detectors has significant commercial potential as a
replacement for HPGe because the requirement of cryogenic cooling is eliminated,
resulting in greater convenience and broader applicability. HPGe is currently
employed in many laboratory settings, and the proposed technology could offer a
cheaper and much more convenient alternative.&lt;br/&gt;
