This award will support collaborative research between Professor James T. Hynes,
University of Colorado, Boulder, and Dr. Mark S. Child, Theoretical Chemistry
Department, Oxford University. These researchers will investigate the mechanisms
of energy flow within molecules that are derived from thermal vibrations, and
will construct a theory for energy flow between vibrational modes induced by
molecular rotation; they will study in particular energy flow in and resultant
dissociation of hydrogen peroxide. Dr. Hynes has considerable experience in the
theory of chemical reactions, but this study of energy coupling by rotational
modes goes beyond earlier studies which have involved coupling only by
vibrational potential or kinetic energy. The U.S. investigator has extensive
experience in the theoretical study of chemical dissociations, while his U.K.
collaborator has complementary expertise in the analysis of intra-molecular
dynamics and in particular of vibrational and rotational modes of energy
storage. The researchers will pursue their theoretical studies using both
analytic and computer methods, and classical and quantum approaches. Significant
benefits may eventually be obtained for the field of laser physics, where proper
understanding of phenomena occurring at the molecular scale is lacking.
