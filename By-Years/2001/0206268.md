This project will provide for a national tour of a 5,000 square-foot exhibit
about the great Inca archaeological site of Machu Picchu, and will give a
national public audience the opportunity to view one-of-a-kind and seldom
exhibited Inca artifacts, while also learning about archaeological science
through engaging interactive exhibits and displays. The exhibit demonstrates how
understanding the past through science has made it possible to determine the
purpose, activities and the nature of daily life on a royal Inca estate.
Laboratory research is at the core of the visitor experience, which will include
osteology, paleopathology, astronomy, stable carbon isotope analysis, faunal
analysis of animal bones, compositional and structural analysis of metals and
ecological analysis of the flora and fauna of the Machu Picchu National Researve
in Peru. Project funding will also create a Website including a virtual exhibit
tour, a self-guided tour of Machu Picchu and web-based archaeological science
curriculum for classroom use. The larger project also includes an international
scholarly symposium entitled "The Archaeology of Inca Cuzco." The exhibit will
open at the Yale Peabody Museum in January, 2003, and after six months, will
travel to Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Denver, Washington, DC and Chicago, before it
returns to New Haven for long-term installation at the Peabody. The project will
reach an audience estimated at well over 2,000,000 visitors, school children,
and Website users.
