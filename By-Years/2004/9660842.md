*** 9660842 Squillante This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
will develop a solid state, large area, high resolution imaging detector by
combining the semiconductor film (lead iodide, PbI2) technology being developed
by the firm with the large format amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) readout technology
which has been developed by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, a collaborator in
the research. Argonne National Laboratory will also collaborate in the effort
and will be involved in developing low noise electronics for the detector as
well as in conducting macromolecular diffraction studies. Macromolecular
crystallography is a very important technique for determining structures of
complex biological systems such a proteins, nucleic acids, and viruses. Due to
such research on atomic level, the understanding of important biological
processes such as enzyme catalysis, viral infection, immune response, hereditary
information encoding, and photosynthesis has increased considerably.
Macromolecular crystallography in a typical laboratory setting is performed
using a rotating-anode X-ray source and an imaging X-ray detector to record the
diffraction pattern from various biological samples such as proteins and
viruses. Important requirements for the X-ray detectors used in such experiments
include large area (&gt;10 cm x 10 cm), high resolution (100-200 um), wide
dynamic range (104), high sensitivity, and low cost. None of the existing
detectors satisfy all requirements and have serious limitations in terms of
permanence, size, or cost. The goal of the Phase I project is to demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed approach in meeting these requirements. Potential
commercial applications of the research include X-ray diffraction,
nondestructive testing, mammography, radiology, X-ray astronomy and
environmental studies. ***
