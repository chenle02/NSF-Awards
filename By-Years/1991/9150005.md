A national survey of science and mathematics teachers and principals will be
conducted during 1992-93 school year for grades K to 12. It will obtain
information about science and mathematics course offerings and enrollments,
teacher background preparation, textbook usage, instructional techniques, and
availability and use of science facilities and equipment. Information provided
by this survey will provide a third year measurement of science and mathematics
participation to permit analysis of changes over time. It will also provide new
information on qualification of mathematics and science teachers, the amount of
time spent on instruction, teacher objectives for science and mathematics,
differences in objectives for students in different class composition, and about
the availability of science and mathematics facilities and equipment. //
