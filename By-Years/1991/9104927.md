This proposal addresses the detailed examination of cumulate- textured and
layered igneous rocks from a geologic environment not yet thoroughly evaluated
in terms of cumulate processes. This project plans a comprehensive study of
hundreds of Mauna Kea xenoliths from many cinder cones. The PIs will apply
petrography, electron microprobe, ion microprobe, XRF, INA, and O-isotopes to
develop models for crustal/cumulate processes, compositions of liquids that
produced the cumulate rocks, relationships among the different rock types, and
the attending crystal/crystal and crystal/melt fractionations for a closed
igneous environment. The results should contribute to a better understanding of
cumulate processes, and constrain future crystallization models for Hawaiian
basaltic magmas.
