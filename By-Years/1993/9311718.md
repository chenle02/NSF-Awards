The project is designed to conduct studies at a manufacturing facility dealing
with surface mount technology and the development of the processes required to
monitor the placement of surface mount components, before and after the reflow
process. The intent of the research effort is to develop in line process
monitors and to verify if such monitors are useful in controlling the placement
of fine pitch surface mount components on printed circuit boards after the
reflow process is complete.
