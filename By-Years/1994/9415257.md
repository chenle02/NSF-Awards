9415257 Leimkuhler This project is a pilot study of a collaborative model, using
graduate student "externships" to demonstrate a method for universities to
interact with small companies. An externship is defined as having a graduate
student work under the supervision of faculty advisors on problems which have
both commercial and academic significance. Three specific extern projects will
be done by three engineering graduate students with different areas, advisors,
and companies. These pilot projects will help resolve the financial, legal, and
marketing challenges of such a program. It is intended that this concept will
aid in the U.S. efforts to improve the manufacturing capability of the small-
and medium-size firms.
