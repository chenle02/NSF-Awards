This project focuses on the Johan Adrian Jacobsen collection in the Museum fu
CLS1 r Volkurkunde in Berlin. This is a very large collection of Yup'ik
artifacts along with ethnographic and linguistic information. The collection has
not been researched and until recently was thought to be destroyed during the
World War II Russian occupation of Berlin. The project brings a group of Yup'ik
elders to Berlin to examine and comment on the articles in the collection. In
addition it creates photographic and videographic documentation of the
collection that will be brought to Yup'ik communities (from which the artifacts
were originally collected) for additional study and community comment. Combining
ethnographic analysis and museum studies, the result of the project will be a
"visual repatriation" that can help Yup'ik people, particularly young Yup'ik own
and understand their past as well as provide valuable information to
anthropologists and museum professionals. CLS1
