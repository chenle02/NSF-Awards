Workshop on Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement Grid Methods, being held March
12-13, 1997 at the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications at the
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement
(SAMR) methods are playing an increasing role in tackling difficult scientific
applications, including compressible flows, cosmology, and electronic structures
arising in local spin density calculations. Providing adequate software support
for SAMR codes is challenging even on sequential implementations. In parallel
implementations, program complexity increases qualitatively due to computation
and communication requirements that are dynamic, data-dependent, and irregular.
The rapid evolution in target parallel systems only further complicates design
decisions. A workshop is proposed that will bring together experts in
applications, numerical methods, and software development from academia,
national labs, and industry. The goal of the workshop is to identify common
ground in the application and implementation of SAMR, as well as issues
requiring specialization. The specific objectives of the workshop are : (i) to
improve the general understanding of the application of SAMR to practical
problems, (ii) to identify issues critical to efficient and effective
implementation on high performance computers, (iii) to stimulate the development
of a community code repository for software including benchmarks to assist in
the evaluation of software and compiler technologies. The proceedings of the
workshop will be published by Springer-Verlag as part of the IMA (Institute for
Mathematical and its Applications) Book Series.
