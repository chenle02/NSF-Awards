This award will enable collaborative research between Dr. Marvin L. Sears of the
Yale University School of Medicine and Dr. Eichi Yamada of Fukuoka University,
Japan. They will conduct studies on the structure and function of the ocular
ciliary epithelium in relation to intraocular pressure regulation. How the
ocular ciliary epithelia regulates aqueous inflow into the posterior chamber of
the eye will be analyzed using coordinated anatomic, physiologic, and
pharmacologic techniques. Understanding the fundamentals of aqueous humor
formation by the ciliary body in the eye is essential for continued progress in
the treatment of glaucoma, which can cause a progressive and irreversible loss
of vision. Dr. Sears has extensive experience in ocular physiology and
pharmacology, while Dr. Yamada is a renowned ocular anatomist.
