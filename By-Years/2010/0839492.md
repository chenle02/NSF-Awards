This Small Business Innovation Research Project will develop next generation
high power deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes with high quality p-type
AlInGaN layers with digital doping control. Advancements in AlInGaN material
system and device technology have resulted in commercially viable UV light
emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the spectral region from 240 nm to 365 nm.

This innovative technology is positioned to create new applications that were
previously unattainable due to the inherent limitations of existing UV lamps or
lasers. Primary markets include water/air disinfection, bio-medical and
analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, ink curing, and phototherapy.
