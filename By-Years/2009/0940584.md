The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) propose to broaden participation in
computing by leveraging the Broadening Engagement program of the SC
("Supercomputing") conferences for 2010-2012. For more than 20 years, the SC
conference series has been the "goto" venue for technical development, community
building, and interdisciplinary activity in high performance computing,
networking, and storage. SC brings together computer scientists, applications
scientists, government, industry, and education and can play a major role in
facilitating the diversification of the computing community and workforce. The
SC conference has continued to reach out to underrepresented groups to stimulate
their successful engagement with HPC. The current proposal leverages SC
Broadening Engagement programs for SC2010-SC2012 and extends community support
and development and builds on existing networks and alliances in the BPC
community to visibly increase the level of participation of underrepresented
groups in high performance computing and computing disciplines. The project will
foster lasting, collaborative relationships between faculty, IT professionals,
students, and computer and research scientists who attend the conference. The
project will be co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and ACM and with NSF
support will provide participation grants, networking, mentoring and research
opportunities during and beyond the SC10-SC12 conferences.
