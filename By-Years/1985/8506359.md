Fundamental aspects of the creation of optical fiber preforms are being studied.
The main thrust of the study is to determine means by which the deposition
processes may be significantly enhanced. The research has already demonstrated
that laser radiation interacting with the aerosol produces dramatic results in
deposition quality and quantity. The index profiles of preform rods will be
tailored for specific optical fiber sensor applications, such as the measurement
of temperature and magnetic fields.
