9308659 Collins The general aim of this research project is to understand the
process of maintaining erect posture. The study involves the analysis of the
trajectory of the center-of-pressure recorded during quiet stance. The goal is
to determine parameters that can be extracted repetitively that characterized
the open-loop and closed-loop postural control mechanisms being used by an
individual. Also, the effects of visual input and center-of- pressure position
feedback on the control mechanisms will be investigated. This study is important
since it could lead to the development of a clinically viable methodology for
objectively and quantitatively assessing the degree of postural stability
changes resulting from injury, disease and/or the aging process through a
simple, non-invasive test. ***
