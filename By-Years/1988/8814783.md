Properties of normal, superconducting, and magnetic states in highly-correlated
metals (heavy-fermion compounds and high- temperature superconducting oxides)
will be investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and relaxation. For
heavy fermion compounds, efforts will focus on the uranium beryllium system and
its alloys, using beryllium nuclear magnetic resonance. For high-temperature
superconducting oxides, both yttrium barium copper oxide and lanthanum-based
materials will be studied.
