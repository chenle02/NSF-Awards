The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry,
the Atmospheric Chemistry program of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace
Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) will
support the collaborative research program of Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern
University and Prof. Scot Martin of Harvard University. Professor Geiger,
Professor Martin, and their students will combine laboratory and field
experiments to test the hypothesis that just like the two hands of one person
can use string to produce chiral string figures, the oxidation of chiral
biogenic volatile organic compounds can produce chiral organic material in
atmospheric particles, with important effects on further chemical reactivity and
physical properties. The two research groups will use an environmental chamber
to synthesize and analyze chiral secondary organic material from mixes of chiral
biogenic volatile organic compounds under well-controlled tropospherically
relevant conditions. Climate-related properties of the newly formed secondary
organic material will be investigated as a function of the stereoisomeric mix in
the gas phase and correlated with the chemical composition and chirality of the
organic material using nonlinear optical chemical imaging and nonlinear optical
laser spectroscopy. Laboratory model studies will be benchmarked against
chemical composition, size distribution, and origin of organic aerosol particles
collected in the central Amazon Basin, which features pristine conditions with
minimal anthropogenic input. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying chiral
aerosol chemistry has the potential to allow for the discovery of fundamentally
new aerosol processes, which could help improve the prediction of radiative
forcing of the climate system. Chiral atmospheric stereochemistry could also be
developed towards a chiral marker to distinguish, for instance, burning fossil
fuels from burning forests. This could potentially transform current methods for
source apportionment of biogenic vs. anthropogenic emissions, which are commonly
based on costly isotope analysis. The project will provide excellent training
opportunities to students, including to members of under-represented groups, who
wish to pursue a professional scientific career in an area of great societal
importance.
