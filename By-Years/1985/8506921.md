The First International Conference on Fundamentals of Adsorption was held in
West Germany in May 1983. The recent research and development activity in both
gas and liquid phase adsorption throughout the world has been dramatically high.
The first conference was an acknowledged success and the fact that the second
international conference is planned for the U.S.A. is a tribute to recent
achievements by our best researchers. Scientists from leading international
institutions will attend. NSF support will allow the participation of some
leading U.S. academic researchers and a few selected speakers from Europe. There
will be strong benefits for all active U.S. adsorption researchers from this
meeting.
