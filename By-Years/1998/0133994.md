This research project will develop techniques and systems that answer the
following question, independent of content type: "What items have the highest
probability of being both interesting and relevant to my information need?"
Whether or not an item (document, resource, etc) is "interesting" for a given
information need will depend on the user's background and taste. Book and web
page recommenders will be built and evaluated that predict relevance and
interest based on content and interest ratings entered by each member of a large
Internet community. A content rating indicates how much a user believes that a
relationship exists between an item and a content attribute while an interest
rating specifies the user's level of interest in an item. Affinities between
users' interests and users' perception of content relationships will be
leveraged to transfer recommendations implicitly between users. The career
development plan involves a) the development of a graduate focus in "Intelligent
Information Systems," which allies approaches from artificial intelligence,
information retrieval, and human computer interaction against problems of
information overload, and b) development of a summer REU program with the goal
of increasing the number of broadly educated US Citizens (particularly women) in
Ph.D. computing graduate programs.
