The PIs propose to develop a statistical model for inferring past mean global
sea level (GSL) and ice sheet volumes from geological indicators of changes in
local sea levels. This model will employ a Bayesian statistical framework to
combine geological observations and their uncertainties with a geophysical model
of the spatial and temporal sea level patterns associated with different
meltwater sources. The proposed work focuses on three specific applications: (1)
evaluating the contribution of different ice sheets to high GSL during the Last
Interglacial stage, ~130-115 thousand years ago; (2) assessing ice sheet history
from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present, in particular estimating the
net ice volume change across this time interval and assessing the relative
contributions of the Laurentide and Antarctic ice sheets to meltwater pulse 1a
at ~14.3 thousand years ago; and (3) over a broader sweep of the Quaternary and
Pliocene, investigating the relationship between Northern and Southern
hemisphere ice volumes and paleoclimate proxies.

The geological record of past ice sheet responses to climate change can serve as
a key data source for testing forward physical models of ice sheet dynamics
under different climate scenarios. The model developed in this project will be
an effort to synthesize such a data set, evaluate its associated uncertainties,
and employ it to strengthen understanding of the relationship between key
climate parameters (such as polar and circum-polar temperatures) and ice sheet
stability.
