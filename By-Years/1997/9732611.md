This experimental program focuses on the investigation of coherent interactions
of atoms with a laser field and the interference that can occur when two
interactions are driven simultaneously. Three projects will be undertaken: (a)
the study of interference between two direct two-photon ionization processes,
which is insensitive to the laser phase; (b) the study of the role of
autoionizing resonances in coherent control processes; and (c) studies of even-
odd interference as a form of coherent control which allows one to determine the
phase differences between wavefunctions of continuum
states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
