The sintering process is generic to powder processing of materials, and is
important both in powder metallurgy, reactive and refractive metals, and ceramic
fabrication. Concerns with respect to material properties and microstructure
quality create interest in control of the sintering process. Beyond time and
temperature control, the heating and cooling rates, as well as the sintering
environment prove crucial to successful sintering of materials. This furnace
system is an important step in developing a better understanding of enhanced
sintering processes and full density sintering. This furnace system will allow
new materials research with an emphasis on processing factors and their impact
on the microstructure-property links in sintered materials. Research
applications range from austentitic stainless steels to titanium aluminides, and
includes areas relevant to the processing and manufacturing of advanced
materials. The furnace will be located in the Particulate Materials Center at
Penn State and will be available for use by the PI and the entire faculty.
