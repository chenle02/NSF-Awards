In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program, Prof. Thomas
Lectka of Johns Hopkins University develops new chemical methods that employ
several independent catalysts working synergistically to produce chemically
interesting and useful products not easily accessible in other ways. Besides
theoretical interest, operational simplicity, low catalyst loadings, mutual
compatibility, and broad scope will be fundamental goals as well. The foundation
of the approach will be polycomponent catalysis (for example, a catalytic
nucleophile in combination with an organometallic complex, a Lewis acid, and/or
a phase transfer catalyst) that results in powerful methods for the synthesis of
pharmaceutically relevant functionalized targets, including chiral fluorides,
alkaloids, lactams and related compounds. A focus on new methods of fluorination
is especially noted; fluorinated organic molecules provide fruitful and exciting
new leads for drug discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would serve
three main goals: 1) the development of complex yet highly worthwhile new
chemical processes; 2) fundamentally new approaches to the synthesis of
pharmaceutically relevant targets and other useful molecules; 3) and practical
training in synthetic chemistry for graduate students (including members of
underrepresented groups). Equally, exposure of numerous undergraduates to
synthetic projects (especially at hospital-oriented Johns Hopkins) will help to
prepare them for careers in health-related occupations.
