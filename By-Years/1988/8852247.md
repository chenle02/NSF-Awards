A broad-based education which emphasizes interrelation of the classical
divisions of chemistry is increasingly important. The cross-disciplinary
applicability of modern measurement techniques will be exemplified by two "mini-
laboratories": a solid-state chemistry laboratory and a laser-based measurement
laboratory. These mini-laboratories will be utilized in physical, analytical,
and senior interdisciplinary laboratories in chemistry and will introduce upper-
level undergraduate students to some of the most current problems and modern
techniques in chemistry. This ILI award from the Chemistry Shared
Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Tennessee at Knoxville to acquire laser instrumentation and instrumentation
appropriate for solid-state studies. This instrumentation will be used to
enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction and aid in chemistry curriculum
development.
