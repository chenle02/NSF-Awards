This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
research of Dr. G. Barney Ellison, University of Colorado, to study the infrared
absorption spectroscopy of jet-cooled organic radicals. The reactions of
radicals with ions will also be studied in a fast flow reactor. Radicals are
unstable reactive intermediates which are of paramount importance in many
combustion processes and high temperature plasmas; spectroscopic probes are
needed to monitor the fate of these metastable species. The enterprise is to
develop an experiment which will enable preparation of intense radical beams via
a free jet expansion. Radicals such as methyl, allyl, and cyanomethyl will be
prepared by a variety of photochemical and thermal sources. Sources will be
monitored by a photoionization mass spectrometer. Radical densities on the order
of 1 mTorr will be prepared and these reactive species will be cooled by the jet
to rotational temperatures of about 20 K. These radicals will be investigated by
infrared absorption spectroscopy with an FTIR. Selected for study are the family
of methyl radicals: methyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and
cyanomethyl. In all cases, it is planned to establish the molecular geometries
and vibrational frequencies. The allyl radical is of similar interest since it
is the simplest conjugated hydrocarbon. Clean, characterized radical beams will
be used to study the reactions between negative ions, such as hydroxide ion or
methoxide ion, and hydrocarbon radicals such as allyl or benzyl. Dr. Ellison
hopes to establish the gas phase acidity of allyl to contrast with propene or
toluene. Separate experiments will use these radical sources to study the
scattering of methyl radicals off clean gold or graphite surfaces. This will
establish the sticking coefficients of these radicals as well as the rate of
molecular deposition.
