ABSTRACT 0138308 Olvi Mangssarian U of Wisconsin-Madison

Support vector machines (SVMs) have played a key role in broad classes of
problems arising in various fields. Much more recently, SVMs have become the
tool of choice for problems arising in data mining. This proposal de-scribes
some aspects of support vector machines that the proposer would like to study
and contribute further to. These include: generalized SVMs (a gen-eral
mathematical programming framework for SVMs), unconstrained SVMs (a strongly
convex minimization reformulation of SVMs solvable by a fast finite method),
Lagrangian classification (an unconstrained Lagrangian rep-resentation of SVMs
leading to an extremely simple iterative scheme capable of solving
classification problems with millions of data points) and reduced data
classification (a rectangular kernel classifier that is characterized by as
little as 1% of the data).
