9316749 Palm A great deal of attention has been given to the development of
cross-national policy in earthquake hazard reduction-particularly under the
aegis of the International Decade for Natural Hazard Reduction. For example,
California officials have investigated some of the policies and practices in
force in Japan-and the ways in which these policies might be translated in the
U.S. context. Previous research shows a relationship between the ways the risks
are communicated and their salience to individuals. Studies have also analyzed
the effects of public policy on individual behavior. But are the relationships
observed in U.S. studies applicable in other cultures? Indeed, have our own
conclusions possibly been biased and therefore impoverished as a result of their
mono-cultural empirical base. Using survey methodology the study has two
specific goals: (1) to determine cross-cultural similarities and differences in
perception and understanding of earthquake risk; and (2) to determine cross-
cultural similarities and differences in the adoption of mitigation measures,
including non-mandatory earthquake insurance. ***
