The NSF S-STEM Transitions Program is granting scholarships to recruit, mentor
and support eligible students in Biology, Chemistry, Engineering and
Mathematics. Forty students are participating for three years. The Transitions
program is recruiting students from trigonometry, college algebra and pre-
calculus courses, who qualify for financial aid and show academic promise.
Scholarship recipients are assigned faculty mentors, complete educational plans,
and during the two years of participation, students complete the requirements
leading to completion of an Associate's degree and/or transfer to a four-year
university. The program promotes student/faculty interaction; provides students
with academic support and enrichment; promotes career exploration; enables
attendance at professional conferences; and facilitates transfer preparation.
The project provides opportunities for student scholarly work on research
projects. The project design is based on the award-winning MESA program.
