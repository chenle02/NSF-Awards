Over the past three years, 32 chemistry faculty from Iowa's community colleges,
private colleges, and regents universities have participated in the Iowa General
Chemistry Network (IGCN). They have helped each other develop and implement a
variety of instructional strategies and techniques. This adapt/adopt project
allows members of the IGCN to continue reform of their undergraduate chemistry
courses and curriculum. The project is a collaborative effort among members of
the IGCN and four of the existing initiatives in the Systemic Changes in the
Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum program. The following components were
identified for implementation in IGCN institutions: instructional modules
(University of California-Berkeley), Conceptual Questions and Modern Materials
(Wisconsin-Madison), Peer Teaching - Workshop Chemistry (City College of New
York), and Guided Inquiry Labs - Theme Based Approach (Beloit College). Faculty
from IGCN institutions are adapting components from one or two of the above
initiatives. Members share their experiences and based upon these experiences,
the most promising components are being incorporated into other participating
members courses. Participating members use the IGCN state-wide fiber optics two-
way audio and visual system to implement adaptation and to conduct meetings
among faculty from member institutions. In addition, summer workshops conducted
by leaders from the systemic change projects are assisting IGCN faculty members
in adapting the targeted components. This continuous forum for communicating and
working among all participants is facilitating reform of introductory chemistry
courses. Both formative and summative evaluations are designed to provide
meaningful assessment. The goal of this project is to involve students more
actively in understanding important chemical concepts. The project also serves
as a model for regional collaborative efforts to improve learning in chemistry
through adapting the results of the major chemistry initiat ives to a variety of
local environments.
