Mealybugs of the subfamily Sphaerococcinae are an important agricultural pest
in the tropics, as well as a virus vector. Dr. Michael Kosztarab proposes to
complete a species-level revision that includes new observations of both male
and female adult morphology, and the first thorough documentation of the
morphology of immature stages of both sexes. A monograph of the subfamily will
be produced, including descriptions, illustrations, and identification keys.
Host plant associations will be determined, and cladistic methods will be used
to reconstruct ancestor-descendant relationships within the scale insects for
the first time. The proposed research will establish a new level of reliability
in mealybug systematics by incorporating data on both sexes at all stages of
development. The project also represents the first extensive application of
phylogenetic methods on the group. Results of the project will have significant
impact in pest management and environmental monitoring.
