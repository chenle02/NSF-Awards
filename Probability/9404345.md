Pitman The investigator plans to continue present lines of research into
stochastic processes, particularly Brownian motion, random partitions, and
related processes. Particular subjects proposed for study are the following:
random partition structures associated with a subordinator, the two parameter
generalization of Ewens' random partition structure and its relation to the
excursion theory of Brownian motion and Bessel processes, random scaling
operations on the paths of Brownian motion and Bessel processes, and various
subfiltrations of the Brownian filtration. The investigator will continue
present lines of research into stochastic processes, particularly Brownian
motion, random partitions, and related processes. Random partitions find
applications to combinatorics, physics, and genetics. These models are useful in
the study of random phenomena involving clustering or aggregation in a wide
variety of contexts. This is fundamental research into the mathematical
structure of stochastic processes. Progress in this direction enhances our
understanding of these processes and has potential for application in numerous
fields of knowledge.
