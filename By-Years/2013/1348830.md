This award provides funding for the travel and accommodation expenses for
graduate students in computational linguistics whose papers have been selected
for presentation at the Sixth International Conference on Generative Approaches
to the Lexicon (GL2013) conference in Pisa, Italy, in September 2013. The
overall goal of the GL conferences is to bring together researchers in
theoretical and computational linguistics, computer science, cognitive science,
and lexicography to explore the problem of semantic compositionality -- how the
meaning of expressions in natural languages derives from the structure of the
lexicon, or dictionary, of semantic formatives (words or idiomatic multi-word
expressions) in a natural language. GL2013 specifically aims at exploring the
relation and potential synergies between generative approaches, which assume
that semantic formatives are structured objects, and distributional semantics,
whose proponents typically assume that they are internally unstructured and
analyze their semantic contribution by means of their distribution in linguistic
contexts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award enables talented students working on
computational semantics to interact with professionals in a variety of fields
and perspectives related to that domain, and to present their work in a major
international venue. This in turn will help to nurture a lasting interest in the
upcoming generation of computational researchers in what is likely to remain a
major area of interdisciplinary study for a very long time.
