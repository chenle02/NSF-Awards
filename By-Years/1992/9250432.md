This proposal will introduce fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in course-
related laboratories and in the required student research program. To accomplish
this goal, a Mattson GL-5022 FTIR will be purchased. The instrument will be
configured with an MCT detector to allow kinetic studies to be performed, and
will provide a spectral range of 6000cm-1 to 400cm-1 with a resolution of
0.75cm-1. The instrument will include capabilities in diffuse reflectance and
photoacoustic measurements. It will be used for instruction in principles and
applications of FTIR in the physical, advanced inorganic, biophysical, and
advanced organic course sequences.
