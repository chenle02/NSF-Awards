In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program,
Professors Krishna Foster and Matthias Selke of California State University, Los
Angeles are investigating the impact of urban particulate matter on the lower
atmosphere of Earth. The project is performed in collaboration with Professor
Donald Dabdub of the University of California at Irvine. Urban particulate
matter contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) generated from incomplete
combustion processes, including motor vehicles fueled by gasoline and diesel.
Although some PAHs are known to transfer energy to oxygen forming more reactive
molecules, it is hard to know which PAHs are responsible for this energy
transfer and how many times this occurs in the environment. The scope and
accuracy of these energy transfer measurements is being improved with this
project. Success in this research may improve air quality models and that are
used to understand the impact of pollution on people, especially those living in
urban areas. The students assisting in this research reflect the diverse
population of southern California. Consequently, this project has the potential
to increase the number of underserved students that select careers in the
chemical sciences and pursue graduate education, addressing the nation's need
for students preparing for chemical sciences careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
investigators work to identify PAH and oxygenated-PAH that are net sources of
singlet molecular oxygen in solution by measuring singlet oxygen quantum yields
and quenching rates. Alkene oxidation products formed from reactions with
singlet molecular oxygen are characterized using multiple analytical techniques.
Both laboratory experiments and air quality models are used to determine the
potential role of PAH photoexcitation on oxidation in emission plumes and at the
air/particle interface.
