This project is concerned with a variety of topics in algebraic geometry.
Research will be done on the construction and computation of Chow groups of
moduli spaces and orbit spaces, and related intersection theory; the problem of
algebraic versus homological equivalences of cycles; toric varieties; and
branched coverings. Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects
arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one
of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics with
widespread applications in mathematics, computer science and physics.
