The Science Source Pathways Project will conduct initial work designing and
testing a new model for providing news on STEM related topics to the rural and
Native American communities in Montana. This project will enhance understanding
of how the communication of scientific research reaches and impacts
underrepresented audiences. A collaborative model will be developed between the
environmental journalism program at the University of Montana and various local
television, radio, and online media outlets that are either operated by or reach
Native Americans on reservations and throughout the state.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables include a survey and analysis of
current science reporting reaching this audience; and production and testing of
prototype science news stories for dissemination on various platforms (print,
radio, TV, web). The development of science news pieces will be led by graduate
students in the School of Journalism under the careful guidance and mentorship
of experienced professors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the
communication and amount of STEM content delivered to underserved groups, and
provide diverse opportunities for them to engage in STEM related environmental
issues that affect their local communities.
