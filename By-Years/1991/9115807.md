This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
cooperative research in physics to be conducted by Dr. Ezra T. Newman of the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh and Dr.
Karlos Kozameh of the faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics at the
University of Cordoba, Argentina. The focus of the project is to probe a novel
and unconventional viewpoint towards geometry and the Einstein field equations
of general relativity. The research relies on the reformulation of general
relativity that allows the equations to be split into two parts, where one part
allows the D'Adhemar-like formulation while the other part yields equations for
the determination of the light cones. The award will foster continuation of a
productive U.S.-Argentina collaboration.
