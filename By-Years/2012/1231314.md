Proposal summary&lt;br/&gt;We propose to design, fabricate, and experimentally
demonstrate a millimeter-scale, continuous-wave THz emitter based on a
whispering-gallery resonator that is pumped by a standard telecom-compatible
infrared light. Unlike existing THz sources based on nonlinear optical effects,
where enhancement of nonlinear optical phenomena is by compressing light into
ultra-short pulses our enhancement mechanism is based on multiple recirculation
of an IR light in a high quality-factor whispering-gallery resonator enabling
efficient THz generation.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
work presents an entirely new perspective on the potential use of whispering-
gallery resonators to radically improve the performance of existing THz sources.
Theoretical investigations provide a deep understanding of fundamental
conversion efficiency limitations of whispering-gallery enhanced THz emitters
based on parametric oscillation and difference frequency generation.
Additionally, the experimental efforts provide an intuitive insight to practical
constraints and solutions to develop proper THz couplers and
waveguides.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;The success of the proposed
research will enable high-performance medical imaging, biological sensing,
security screening and chemical identification systems.&lt;br/&gt;Integration of
education with research activities:&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students and summer
interns will be recruited for the research activities, special priority will be
given to women and the members of underrepresented groups. New graduate courses
will be developed and new teaching modules will be included in undergraduate
courses, an update on our research results and educational tutorials will be
disseminated to the public via easy-to-navigate web pages, bi-annual seminars
and open house visits and scientific demos will be arranged for high school
students.
