The recent acquisition of a diode array ultraviolet-visible (UV/VIS)
spectrophotometer, interfaced with a computer, is allowing undergraduate
students in the Chemistry Department at Earlham College to develop a familiarity
and competence with modern computer-controlled instrumentation. The system has
the capability to collect data rapidly under a variety of circumstances and to
manipulate and graph the data in various ways. Spectral analyses of metal
complexes, chemical kinetics in biochemical systems, detector use in
chromatographic separations, and use in independent study are among the
applications of the system which students will explore.
