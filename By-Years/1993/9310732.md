9310732 Liu The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of Arizona will purchase video, radio frequency (RF), and fiber
optics equipment to facilitate research on video and multimedia communications.
The equipment to be purchased includes: spectrum analyzers, bit error rate (BER)
testset, video frame grabber and editor, and computers. The equipment will be
used for research projects including (1) multimedia acquisition and interface,
(2) video processing, (3) video transmission performance evaluation, (4)
transmission processing in subcarrier multiplexing (SCM), (5) interaction
studies on high speed networking and multimedia processing, and (6) multimedia
processing design and optimization. These research projects will build the
important knowledge base for video and multimedia communications. As a result,
we can develop cost-effective video and multimedia services to significantly
enhance national education and research. ***
