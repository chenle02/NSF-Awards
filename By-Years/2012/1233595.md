The objective of this project is to establish a coherent theory of how the organ
of Corti (cochlear sensory epithelium) optimizes the force from the outer hair
cells in order to magnify tiny vibrations of the basilar membrane. The research
takes two innovative approaches. First, it integrates cellular physiology and
macro/micro mechanics of the cochlea. Second, computational and experimental
models are investigated in parallel to reduce the animal use while maximizing
the research outcome. The computational model will focus on the interaction
between the outer hair cells and their supporting structures, and minimize the
mechanical assumptions by building realistic 3-D finite element models of the
organ of Corti and individual outer and inner hair cells. The simulated
predictions will be fully validated through experiments with rodent cochlear
tissues. An isolated cochlear sensory epithelium will be transplanted to a novel
micro-chamber system that imitates the electrical and chemical environments of
the cochlear duct. This will enable us to take full control over the mechano-
transduction of the isolated cochlear tissue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed
study will make a direct impact on understanding various hearing disorders.
Besides hearing sensation, mechano-transduction plays a crucial role in other
tissues such as muscle, bone and articular cartilage. Therefore, the findings of
this research will advance the general understanding of mechano-sensation.
Educationally, we will exploit the multi-disciplinary nature of this project?it
involves various topics such as acoustics, mechanics, electrophysiology, micro-
electro-mechanical systems and computational methods. The project will provide
engineering students across disciplines with opportunities to get closer to life
science by introducing them to how engineering principles can be successfully
applied to biological/medical problems, and how engineers can get insights from
the sensory organs for better sensor design. We will develop a graduate level
course with examples adopted from the proposed research.
