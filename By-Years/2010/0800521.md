The PI will study interactions between operator algebras and
conformal&lt;br/&gt;field theories which have proved to be very fruitful lately.
The main&lt;br/&gt;emphasis of this research is placed on the study of
&lt;br/&gt;certain representation theory questions such as Kac-Wakimoto
conjecture, orbifolds and boundary states in &lt;br/&gt;conformal field theories
using operator algebraic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;The applications of these
operator algebraic techniques&lt;br/&gt;will lead to proofs of representation
theory questions&lt;br/&gt;and shed lights on exotic subfactors such as those
coming from &lt;br/&gt;conformal inclusions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of operator algebras was introduced
by John von Neumann &lt;br/&gt;in order to provide a proper mathematical
framework for Quantum &lt;br/&gt;Mechanics. Conformal field theory was a theory
&lt;br/&gt;describing critical phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;condensed matter physics,
and it also plays an important role in &lt;br/&gt;string theory. The remarkable
interactions between operator algebras&lt;br/&gt;and conformal field theory has
led to many interesting mathematical&lt;br/&gt;issues. The aim of this
research&lt;br/&gt;is to find solutions to some of the important mathematical
issues that &lt;br/&gt;surface in this context which have a wide range of
applications.
