Estonia is an uncommonly appropriate setting for study of attitude change, life
course patterns, and inter-ethnic attitudes and contact. Since the nineteenth
century, Estonia has been in the forefront of social change in the Russian
Empire (until 1920) and in the Soviet Union (since 1940). In the late nineteenth
century, the provinces that become Estonia and Latvia were the only parts of the
Russian Empire in which there was evidence of voluntary fertility control in
rural areas. Currently, the population of Estonia has the highest educational
level of any republic in the Soviet Union. Depending on the indicator used,
either Estonia or Latvia has the highest standard of living within the Soviet
Union. Gorbachev has used Estonia as a test case for some aspects of
perestroika. It could be argued that if perestroika could not work in Estonia,
it could not work anywhere. Social changes in Estonia have often foreshadowed
changes elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Thus, examination of attitutde change in
Estonia can throw light on future developments elsewhere in the Soviet Union and
also provide a useful comparison to changes now occurring in Eastern Europe. In
addition, Estonia has a long tradition of survey research by sociologists. This
project investigates continuity and change in social and political life in
contemporary Estonia through analysis of a re-interview household survey jointly
planned, designed, and directed by the U.S. and Estonian scholars involved with
this project and conducted in 1991. The new survey updates the content of the
initially administered 1979 questionnaire and adds items that will facilitate
international comparisons and allow testing of hypotheses from the current
sociological and comparative politics literatures. Specifically, it focuses on
life course issues relating education, marriage, childbearing, labor force
participation and career advancement; and on intra-generational change in social
and political attitudes from the Brezhnev to the Gorbachev period and the
process of inter-generational transmission of values and attitudes. This project
will contribute to our understanding of the relations between education,
childbearing, and labor force participation; political socialization; political
participation; and patterns of regime support and the bases of that support.
This project will also contribute to the support and strengthening of the
infrastructure of sociological research in Estonia.
