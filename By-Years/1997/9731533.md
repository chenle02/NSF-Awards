Beyond Perception: The Experience of Risk in an African American Community The
consequences of chronic, long-term environmental contamination can be
devastating to individuals. Extensive research has been done to quantify the
effects of exposure in such setting as well as the perceptions of this exposed.
What has been less thoroughly examined are the more qualitative consequences of
long-term exposure to contaminants on individuals' perceptions of themselves and
their communities. In this research project, the PI s will gather qualitative
data from the primarily African American residents in a heavily polluted site in
Georgia. This research will provide a more complete understanding of what the
experience of exposure to environmental contaminants entails - integrating the
quantitative measurements of perceptions with more narrative and personal
descriptions of life in such situations ó ªñ+ú^ó|úñ +▒+¬ ó ¬ñ«¬^áúú¬^|+ñ +▒+¬ ó
