Each year for two years, a faculty enhancement program is being offered to 25
faculty members from a groups of universities and two-year colleges in Puerto
Rico. As a short term goal, the program aims to introduce mathematics faculty
members to the use of technology in the undergraduate mathematics classroom as a
way of enhancing their teaching as well as the learning experiences of their
students. Because the program is targeting academic institutions and students of
modest economic means, there is a focus on technology which is relatively
inexpensive. This will allow participating colleges and universities to
implement what they learn on a large scale. The workshop will focus on topics in
precalculus and calculus. Follow-up activities are establishing a base for
continued collaboration among participating institutions on issues concerning
the use of technology and other curriculum matters in undergraduate mathematics
education. The program consists of three main activities: software workshops,
graphic calculator workshops, and a conference cycle.***//
