This project provides geophysical instruments used by archaeology students to
collect and portray data on the subsurface nature of archaeological sites. The
primary instrument is a proton magnetometer that can sense disturbances caused
by the activity of prehistoric inhabitants and thereby establish where
productive excavations may be carried out. Supplementing the geophysical
instruments are a field computer, laboratory computer, and related software that
allow the data to be stored, processed, analyzed and displayed. Such equipment
is becoming an important supplement to traditional field methods as it employs
non-destructive techniques and can be pursued without disturbing archaeological
sites. Using the instruments requires the student to apply knowledge in basic
geologic and cartographic principles, trigonometry, and surveying practices. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
