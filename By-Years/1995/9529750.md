9529750 BUSKEY "Brown tides" are persistent blooms of phytoplankton that reduce
the penetration of sunlight in the water column. A direct consequence of this
phenomenon is a reduction in the growth of seagrass beds which can reduce
nursery habitats for fishes and winter food resources for migrating waterfowl.
Completion of this research project will provide an understanding of the
ecological factors that regulate the initiation and persistence of such harmful
algal blooms. Field mesocosm experiments will investigate the effects of
nutrient additions on brown tide growth and phytoplankton species composition.
Laboratory studies of algal growth rates will explore light, temperature,
salinity and allelopathic effects. ***
