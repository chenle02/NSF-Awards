9522963 Nnaju Research conducted under this award is to develop a product
assembly modeler (PAM), which provides detailed information for successful
mechanical or manual assemblies of a product. This modeler includes requirements
for the assembly environment, feasible approach directions, precedence
constraints, symmetries, and spatial relationships. The spatial relationships of
the design give product specifications, functional requirements, and define the
mating positions and degrees of freedom of motion of components. PAM is equipped
with its own on-board graphics capabilities for visual assistance. This research
applies the mathematical theory of symmetry to spatial reasoning in an effort to
simplify the computation and geometric complexities of product assembly. If
successful, the result will be a stand-alone product assembly moderler, designed
to assist in the assembly of product that accurately demonstrates the designer's
intentions.
