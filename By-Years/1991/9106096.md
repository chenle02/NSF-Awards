The objective of this proposal is to expand research capabilities and
opportunities in physiology, including neuroscience, at Meharry Medical College.
This expansion will center on a multifaceted research and training program
organized along the theme of cellular communication. The proposed research-
centered program will focus on fundamental questions associated with
communication within and among cells. The proposed program aims to accomplish
the following: 1) To enhance the development of a core neurochemistry laboratory
equipped to handle such neurochemical procedures as cellular/subcellular
fractionations and in vivo sampling, neuroactive substance delivery, and
sensitive quantitative analysis; 2) To contribute to the improvement of a
research environment conducive to effective collaborative interactions; and 3)
To provide additional training opportunities for minority graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows. Four detailed projects are presented as core cellular
communication projects. These core projects will be heavily served by the
expanded core neurochemistry laboratory. Additional brief project descriptions
are included as further examples of research to be served by the expanded core
neurochemistry laboratory.
