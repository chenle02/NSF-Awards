The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to enable tools to inform
methods to reduce air pollution. Air pollution increases the risk of cancer,
stroke, heart disease, respiratory infections; further, it may play a role in
Alzheimer's disease and diabetes, resulting in trillions of dollars of health
care costs globally each year. Half of these costs may be attributed to roadway
traffic sourced pollution. Traffic sourced pollution is possibly intercepted by
trees, although improperly configured roadside trees do not produce these
benefits and creating the opportunity for improved health via targeted
engineering of roadside tree placements. This project will develop analysis and
design tools to make sure that such tree plantings optimize benefits for
ecosystem designers, health insurance companies, governments, and local
businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR project will develop a system to
optimize high-resolution site-specific tree placement for pollution reduction.
Trees are known to reduce air pollution by acting like filters as their high
surface area attracts pollutants. Tightly packed trees of a type with high
surface area placed on the leeward side of a busy roadway can intercept &gt; 30%
of traffic sourced pollutants. This project will perform ground-based, high-
resolution vegetation analysis on neighborhoods under study. These data will be
used to train an algorithm to infer high-resolution vegetation properties from
widely available, low-cost data streams. These inferred vegetation metrics will
be integrated with a geospatial ecosystem design automation pipeline to create a
software tool. To accurately predict the capture, high-resolution vegetation
surface area measurements, tree crown spacing information, wind speed, wind
direction and roadway traffic volumes will be aggregated in a comprehensive
model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
