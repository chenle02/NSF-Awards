Experimental investigations are carried out directed to demonstrating that
positive gain may be achieved in a uranium Nd- like soft x-ray laser. A
successful demonstration could lead to realization of an x-ray laser at 70 A,
which would be an important new tool in photobiology, x-ray crystallography,
materials research, and x-ray laser assisted processing.
