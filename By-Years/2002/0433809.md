This is an interdisciplinary research program involving synergistic interactions
between mathematics (probability theory, statistics, singularity theory) and
astronomy (gravitational lensing of quasars, dark matter on galactic scales).
This research addresses two pressing scientific issues: the flux ratio anomaly
problem in gravitational lensing, and difficulties with the cold dark matter
picture. It will open up new mathematical directions, including a generalization
of Morse theory to a stochastic setting, and a study of the statistical geometry
of random magnification excursions sets.

Results from the research will be incorporated into an undergraduate seminar on
the mathematics of gravitational lensing and a graduate course on general
relativity, and presented at major international scientific conferences. This
study also creates scientific partnerships among several US institutions and
Potsdam, Germany.
