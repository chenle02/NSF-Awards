In this study periodic multilayer thin films and their component parts (single
layers, bilayers, trilayers, etc.) are grown and characterized by vibrating
sample and torque magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonance, transmission electron
microscopy, and X- ray diffraction. The goal is to determine the
interrelationships between multilayer ferromagnetism, film microstructure,
interfacial structure and composition, and growth processes. Model experimental
systems and systematic incremental annealing treatments are used to establish
direct correlations between the structural and compositional evolution of the
interphase interfaces and the concurrently developing ferromagnetic properties.
The role of crystalline anisotropy in diffusional mixing, interfacial compound
formation, and interfacial magnetism is also under investigation. Attention is
being directed to nickel-based multilayer systems with copper, aluminum, or
titanium intervening layers.
