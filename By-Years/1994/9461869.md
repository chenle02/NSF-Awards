This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the
development of a low-cost on-line sensor for rapid on-site analysis to measure
trace metallic contaminants in process chemicals commonly used in semiconductor
manufacturing. Detection and quantitation of trace heavy metal contamination in
MOS integrated circuit fabrication is of great importance becoming even more
critical as device geometries are scaled. At present, all such analyses are
carried out off-line, involving sampling of process fluids and analysis using
costly laboratory equipment, remote from the fab line. This approach causes
lengthy and costly delays making on-line or at least `in-fab` methods extremely
desirable. ChemTrace Corporation proposes to apply a novel anodic stripping
voltammetry system to provide a low cost, on-line solution to this problem.
Their approach involves a micromachined iridium microelectrode array on silicon
and a single-chip, full-featured potentiostat which (when combined with a low-
cost microcontroller chip) can be directly interfaced to a personal computer's
serial port. This approach will reduce analysis latencies from many hours to
minutes and provide unprecedented flexibility and early warning capability for
contamination.
