This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). The supported research will build on earlier discoveries
concerning the stereospecific reagent controlled homologation (StReCH) of
boronic ester derivatives by enantioenriched main group chiral carbenoids.
StReCH enables a programmable iterative synthesis of stereochemically complex
molecules, but to date this methodology has only been successfully demonstrated
for the elaboration of polyalkylated materials. Studies designed to widen the
scope of StReCH to encompass the synthesis of polyoxygenated molecules will be
undertaken. In pursuing this endeavor, two types of scalemic carbenoid species
capable of introducing oxygenation will be investigated: alpha-metallated
oxiranes and alpha-metallated S,O-acetals. New methods for the generation of
these sensitive organometallic reagents will be explored and StReCH based
processes employing them will be strategically deployed for the total synthesis
of representative alkaloid and polyketide natural
products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Paul R. Blakemore of
the Department of Chemistry at Oregon State University. Professor Blakemore's
research efforts focus on the development of new methods and concepts for the
achievement of stereocontrolled organic synthesis. By targeting the development
of tools that facilitate molecule building, the research will ultimately benefit
society at large by speeding the discovery of biologically active agents and
other potentially useful carbon based materials&lt;br/&gt;
