Dr. Elizabeth M. Sanford has been awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Sanford's doctoral degree was from UCLA under Professor Francois
Diederich. She intends to continue research with Professor Jean Frechet at
Cornell. In Frechet's laboratory, she will learn the synthetic techniques for
creating particularly large structures and characterizing them. She will also
gain experience in the techniques of polymer chemistry. These skills will help
prepare her for her long-range goal of preparing polyporphyrin dendrimers for
the study of electron transfer. %%% The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry
Program is viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to broaden
the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into meaningful
careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
