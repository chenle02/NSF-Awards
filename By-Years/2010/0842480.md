Existing Bayesian network-based diagnostic approaches often produce either
underspecified explanations that do not fully account for given observations, or
overspecified explanations that contain variables unnecessary in explaining the
observations. This project addresses these limitations by elaborating a new
framework, Most Relevant Explanation (MRE), for explanation in Bayesian networks
that can automatically identify the most relevant fault(s) for given
observations. In particular, the project includes development and evaluation of
approximate, efficient diagnostic algorithms for multiple faults based on the
MRE framework. Because diagnosis is quite likely the most successful application
of Bayesian networks, MRE-based methodologies will significantly improve the
current practice of computer-aided diagnosis by improving the comprehensibility
and efficiency in areas such as medicine and manufacturing.
