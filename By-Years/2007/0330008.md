ABSTRACT

Proposal #: 0330008 Title: SENSORS: Cooperative Robotics and Geometric
Optimization for Mobile Sensors PI: Bullo, Francesco University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign

This project focuses on mobile and tunable sensor networks and on the
algorithms required to perform spatially-distributed sensing tasks including
coverage, surveillance, exploration, target detection, and search. To achieve
these desirable capabilities, the major objective of this project is the design
of cooperative control algorithms for sensor networks. Practically meaningful
algorithms need to take into careful consideration all constraints on the mobile
sensor network. In particular, this project will focus on algorithms that are
amenable to implementation in a cooperative setting, i.e., they are required to
be distributed, asynchronous, adaptive, and verifiably correct.

The innovative technical approach relies on the following two main ideas. First,
optimal sensor coverage is formalized as an aggregate performance metric via
methods from geometric optimization. Second, a class of cooperative control
algorithms are synthesized by generalizing the classic Lloyd algorithm from
quantization theory. The resulting control laws are interaction protocols
between the mobile sensors and include behaviors such as, ``move away from your
closest neighbor,'' and, ``move toward the geometric center of your sensing
region.''

Broad dissemination of this research will take place through regular
publications, conference presentations and technical reports. Undergraduate and
graduate students in the College of Engineering at UIUC will be involved in
building the experimental setups and implementing cooperative control algorithms
both in the teaching-oriented Mechatronics and Robotics Laboratories as well as
in the research-oriented Agile and Coordinated Vehicles Laboratory.
