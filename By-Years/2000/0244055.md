This award supports a five-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site at the University of Pennsylvania entitled "SUNFEST - Summer Undergraduate
Research Program in Sensor Technology". The REU Site will provide an eleven-week
summer research experience for ten undergraduate students in the general area of
sensor technologies. The goal of this program is to excite students' interest in
research and encourage them to continue their studies through pursuit of a
graduate degree. The program will make a special effort to recruit students from
colleges with little or no opportunity for research activities for undergraduate
students. The program will also focus on attracting students from groups
underrepresented in research fields in engineering. Students will participate in
research projects chosen for their educational value and appropriateness for
undergraduate research. Research topics will include novel approaches to
sensing; sensors and materials technology; modeling and design of sensors and
microstructures; bio-inspired sensors; and sensor systems.
