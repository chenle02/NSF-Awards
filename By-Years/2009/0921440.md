This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5). Fires in steep chaparral landscapes are often followed by
catastrophic debris flows. Because of this threat, another potentially
significant post-fire erosional process, wind erosion, has been under-
appreciated. Observations from a burned area in Southern California suggest that
wind erosion may be as important as runoff erosion in burned semi-arid
landscapes. Although the removal of vegetation, which protects the soil surface
from the wind, undoubtedly plays a role in higher rates of wind erosion from
burned areas, fire-induced changes within the soil itself may be more important
in increasing the vulnerability of the soil to eolian transport. Undisturbed
chaparral soils are covered by a biotic mat, a dense network of fine chaparral
roots overlain by algae, lichen, and moss, which acts to armor the soil
underneath. High severity fires, however, appear to combust the biotic mat,
leaving the soil exposed to the wind. In Southern California, large fires are
often driven by Santa Ana winds that can reach hurricane speeds. Because the
conditions for these winds generally occur from September to March, the areas
scorched by fire are then subjected to high winds for many months. Field
observations and satellite images testify to extreme rates of wind erosion under
these conditions. This project will investigate the relationship between fire,
the biotic mat, and wind erosion through a program of wind-tunnel experiments.
Undisturbed soil surface samples, collected from chaparral hillslopes, will be
subjected to controlled wildfire conditions in the laboratory to simulate fires
of varying temperatures and durations. The samples will then be placed in a wind
tunnel to determine their threshold friction velocity, a measure of the soil's
erodibility by wind.

The main impact of this project will be to provide information on a source of
airborne dust that can affect human health in Southern California. It should
have implications for many similar environments elsewhere. It has been estimated
that airborne dust pollution is responsible for thousands of premature deaths
annually in California; satellite images indicate that burned areas are
important sources of dust blown westward to the Los Angeles area during Santa
Ana conditions. One of the goals of this project is to develop relationships
between easily measured soil parameters and wind erosion potential for use by
air pollution control districts. This project will also provide an educational
opportunity for an undergraduate student from a minority-serving institution.
