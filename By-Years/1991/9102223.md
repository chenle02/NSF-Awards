The objective of this proposal is to study the development of concentrated flow
channels in the soils when flow velocity exceeds a critical value in order to
have a better understanding about the behavior of very soft soils during
consolidation. The formation of flow channels could invalidate the application
of consolidation theory to these cases and potentially could have a beneficial
effect by increasing the hydraulic conductivity and accelerating the
consolidation process.
