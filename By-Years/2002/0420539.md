This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program in DMR will allow Coe
College to purchase a scanning probe microscope. The microscope will allow Coe
College researchers to study a variety of novel surface effects in the areas of
physics, chemistry, and biology. The researchers will look at light scattering
by roughened glass surfaces, phase separation in borosilicates and
borovanadates, and corrosion of varied glass families by aggressive gas
radicals, dilute acids, and water. Other studies will focus on the effect of
surface features on the mechanisms of reductive transformations of pollutants in
water by zero- and low-valent metals, and on the formation of biocements by sea
worms. The first external use will carry out electrochemical measurements on
colloidal particles that have been functionalized with polyoxometalates. Over
ten undergraduate students, from Coe and its associated REU site, will receive
training in the techniques of nanoscience every year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award from the Major Research Instrumentation program in DMR will allow Coe
College to purchase a scanning probe microscope. The scanning probe microscope
will allow the researchers to carry out new work in physics, chemistry, and
biology. The microscope will permit the researchers to see how tiny features in
glass scatter light, like in frosted panes, and how water, acids, and corrosive
gases can also damage glass surfaces. In the environmental chemistry project the
PI's will observe the role of iron oxidation on the reactions of pollutants in
water. The microscope will allow them to investigate the way that sea worms
cement sand grains together to make sea reefs, even underwater. Another project
will study how tiny particles (colloids) can be made more useful by attaching
specialized molecules on their surface. The microscope will also help train many
undergraduates in the techniques of nanoscience, an area of national importance
and growing interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
