&lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger Maps and Related Problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract
of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt; Ioan Bejenaru&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
is to study the Schroedinger map equation. This is a nonlinear Schroedinger
equation which arises from geometrical considerations and also as a version of
the Heisenberg model of ferro-magnetism. The fundamental question is, under what
conditions on the data, is there global existence of the solutions and when is
there "blow-up" of solutions. To study this, we shall investigate the dynamics
of solutions with very rough initial data and will use fine tools from harmonic
analysis and Riemannian geometry as well as partial differential equations
methods. It is expected that the analysis will be more difficult than the Wave
map equation which has been studied extensively recently. The Schroedinger map
equation has a special nonlinear term; under this project various other non-
generic nonlinearities will also be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the
primary problems to be studied in this project arise in well-known physical
theories, the results obtained should have some impact for theories of
electromagnetism and ferromagnetic materials. They may well prove to be
prototypical problems for a number of other important equations that arise in
geometry and physics and for which existence and blow-up results are yet to be
obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
