This planning grant is to bring together the elements needed for writing and
submitting a district wide grant for teacher enhancement in the area of
environmental studies and earth sciences. Specifically, the planning grant will
be used to build a consensus of support from among the local businesses,
colleges, government agencies and secondary teachers; establish two high school
teams of teachers to plan two curricula; plan the instructional components
needed for the proposed institute. The system is now planning to establish a
school within a school in 1993-1994, devoted to the environmental and earth
sciences which is closely tied to research projects at sites of various state
and federal agencies. The plan is then to broaden the participation in these
projects to all of the district schools in the coming years. The project builds
upon the district's strategic location where there are many locations of ongoing
research including; 1) Loxahatchee River, a federally designated wild and scenic
river, 2) Jonathan Dickinson State Park which includes a number of threatened
ecosystems, 3) Jupiter Marine Science Center, 4) Marine Life Center of Juno
Beach and 5) MacArthur State Park. The Loxahatchee River Environmental Control
District has already provided the annual rent and a full-time staff member to
the Jupiter Marine Science Center for this project.
