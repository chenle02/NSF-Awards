This research involves the study sensory information processing in the
electrosensory system of gymnotiform fish. Electrosensory information is used in
social communication, such as the jamming avoidance response (JAR), as well as
for the detection and identification of objects. By intracellular labelling of
physiologically identified neurons, the P.I. can explore morphological features
and their significance for particular tasks in the processing of information. By
tracing anatomical projections of identified classes of neurons, the routes and
way stations of pathways along which specific forms of information are processed
can be determined. Research efforts will be concentrated upon connections from
the torus semicircularis and tectum opticum of the midbrain to the complex of
the nucleus electrosensorius (NE) in the pretectum. Neurons in the torus and the
tectum have more general response properties and are less sensitive to specific
stimulus features than are neurons in the NE. The higher response specificity
and sensitivity of neurons in the NE appears to result from extensive neuronal
convergence.//
