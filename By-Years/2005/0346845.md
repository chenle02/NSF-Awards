The aim of the RIA summer school is to nurture the next generation of RIA
scientists so that the community will have sufficient manpower to realize this
goal and effectively use it when RIA comes online. A special emphasis will be
made to train Ph.D. students from US universities and young post-docs starting
to work in one of the fields related to radioactive ion beams. The format of the
school is morning lectures, given by prominent researchers in the field,
followed by hands-on traning sessions in the afternoon. The students will be
instructed in how to produce a radioactive ion beam using the National
Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory Coupled Cyclotron Facility. On the last day
of the school they will have the opportunity to produce a beam. The School will
be jointly organized by the 88-Inch Cyclotron, ATLAS, HRIBF, and NSCL, and is an
annual event, rotating among these laboratories. The first school was held at
the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility in Oak Ridge, August 12-17, 2002.
The second school will be held at the National Superconducting Cyclotron
Laboratory from August 4-9, 2003. This proposal is for subsistance support for
graduate students and post-docs attending the school.
