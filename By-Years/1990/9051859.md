This project implements a laboratory for use in two courses, Electro-Optical
Engineering" and "Fiber Optic Devices and Applications." Students perform eight
required experiments in each course. Experiments involving helium neon lasers,
diffraction, polarization and modulation of light, and holography and spatial
filtering are performed in Electro-Optical Engi- neering. Experiments in Fiber
Optic Devices and Applications focus on components, such as optical fibers,
diode lasers and photo detectors, and their applications in optical
communication systems and sensors. Optical benches, lasers, fiber optic kits and
basic measuring equipment such as power meters and an optical time domain
reflectometer provide senior level undergraduates with "hands-on" experience in
Optical Engineering and Design. The award is being matched with a greater amount
(102 percent) by the principal investigator's institution.
