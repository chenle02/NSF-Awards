With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at New York University will acquire large-scale parallel
computational resources for biological and materials modeling. This equipment
will enhance research in a number of areas including a) the application of novel
conformational sampling tools to protein structure prediction; b) modeling of
DNA polymerase mechanisms; c) studies of metalloenzyme mechanisms; d) analysis
of protein-ligand binding; e) accurate treatment of hydrogen-bond dynamics in
supramolecular complexes; f) materials design for proton-exchange membranes; g)
computationally aided design of novel RNAs; and h) development of linear scaling
electronic structure algorithms.

A cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the
computing needs of active research departments. Such a "computer network" also
serves as a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms,
provides state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports
research in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing. These studies
will have a significant impact in a wide number of areas, including biochemistry
and materials science.
