Mechanism synthesis can be accomplished by many methods. One of the more popular
techniques is the Burmester Theory. The principal investigator proposes the
development of an alternative method, the Inverted Coupler Curve Method, which
has significant advantages over the Burmester Theory. Such improvement can have
a significant impact on four-bar linkage design. Linkages hold the promise of
higher speed for automatic machines when compared with cam mechanisms.
