Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences founded in 1992 with the purpose of
creating a lively informal environment where the latest results of Geometry and
Topology are discussed by active experts and young researchers along with
enthusiastic graduate students. Though many world experts frequently visit
Gokova, the main emphasis of these conferences have always been on the young
researchers and graduate students. By looking back on its 15 years old history,
we can now proudly say that many young now-well-known mathematicians of the
field got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences, many
instances by giving their first talks there. We hope to continue these
conferences.

In these conferences we plan to discuss the most recent discoveries in the
field of Topology and Geometry. By putting together the experts along with young
researchers and graduate students, we hope to energize these fields and create a
new environment for further study, and train future experts. Topology and
Geometry has not just helped to settle deep problems in mathematics, it has been
also a prime tool for solving deep problems in physics (e.g. quantum topology,
string theory).
