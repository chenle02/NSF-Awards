The aim of the project is the manufacture of net shapes of high performance
composites at high rates via high production rate plasma spray technology. If
such shapes can be quickly produced from a variety of materials, product design
and even manufacture can be greatly expedited. The spray forming of net shapes
is currently limited by a lack of understanding of the materials science and
process science bases of the technology. The project will address the key issues
related to this technology in order to optimize water-stabilized plasma (WSP)
and electromagnetically coalesced plasma (EMCP) processing. An interdisciplinary
program will be developed for process diagnostics/modelling and microstructural
and mechanical characterization of the deposit. Industrial collaborators are an
integral part of the research team that has been formed to address plasma-based
manufacture of net shapes. The high powered water-stabilized DC plasma torch and
electromagnetically coalesced torch may enable production of free- standing
structural forms, comprised of ceramics, metal alloys and composite materials.
WSP spray processing of materials can be carried out at considerably higher
temperatures than is possible for gas-stabilized plasmas (viz. 30,000K versus
15,000K). The EMCP route enables the spray-forming of ceramics or composites
from feed materials that are in the liquid or slurry forms. These processes
permit the use of both larger particulate-sized feedstock powders and an
increase in spray processing through-put by at least an order of magnitude;
i.e., from 5 to 50 kg of alumina (for example) per hour.
