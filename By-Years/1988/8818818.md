The primary objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research
project in coordination chemistry between Dasan Radanovic Svetozar Markovic
University, Kragujevac, Yugoslavia and Bodie E. Douglas, University of
Pittsburgh, is to use circular dichroism (CD) (crystals) as a stereochemical
probe in order to obtain more information about the structure and function of
certain metal ions in enzymes important to the optical activity. Past
collaboration has resulted in numerous parallel and joint publications. The
crystal samples will be developed by Dr. Radanovic's research group. The
analytical work will take place at the University of Pittsburgh. This grant was
approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and
Technology and is funded through a joint fund consisting of matching
contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S. contribution is
provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved. Grants
are made to the principal Yugoslav institute. Dollar funds are included for U.S.
scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in
the U.S.
