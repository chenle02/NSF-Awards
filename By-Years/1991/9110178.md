The objective of this project is basic research in the development of an
intelligent learning sensor model. Intelligent control systems provide functions
beyond conventional control systems, including learning and expert decision
making. Each intelligent sensor, within a control system, will possess those
aspects of intelligence appropriate to its function, and this intelligence will
operate only on information available to the sensor. Intelligent sensors will be
modeled as objects in an object oriented programming environment, where
properties and functions of generic intelligent sensors are inherited by more
specific sensor objects. The object oriented approach provides a means of
isolating sensor specific code in the object representing that sensor and a
knowledge base that can make the sensor self educated and self organized. The
model of the intelligent sensor will be created, in first instance, as an empty
structure where the various aspects that define the model will be filled as the
work progresses. The research will specifically develop the aspect of learning
as an essential functional characteristic of the intelligent sensor. Two other
characteristics, interpretation and estimation, have been extensively researched
and will be directly implemented as part of the model. Models of intelligent
ultrasonic and temperature sensors will be created for experimental
verification. //
