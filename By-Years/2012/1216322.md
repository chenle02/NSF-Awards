Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) proposes to support technical services
on R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 170? general purpose UNOLS research vessel operated
by BIOS as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
research fleet. They request support for basic services and will provide two
technicians on each seagoing research project of R/V Atlantic Explorer. They
will support seagoing research projects and maintain, calibrate and provide for
qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research instrumentation.
The budget in this proposal is for the first year of a 5-year continuing
grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of
the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support
for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support
of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo
separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The support of
maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded
researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated
instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and
expanding the base of potential researchers.
