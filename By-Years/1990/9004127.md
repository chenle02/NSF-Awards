Massively parallel architectures have been proposed for large scale problems in
associative processing, database management, artificial intelligence, image
processing, etc. In a very large machine the cost of the PE interconnections is
significant. The perfect shuffle and exchange connections are an attractive
alternative to other connection schemes such as two-dimensional meshes, multi-
stage networks and hypercubes. This project studies a massively parallel
architecture where the processing elements are interconnected with perfect
shuffle and exchange networks. Issues being investigated include how to best
divide a machine into modules, how to add redundancy, how to control data
routing, the architecture of each processing element and how to control each
processing element.
