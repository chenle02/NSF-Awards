This project is concerned with several problems at the interface between
holomorphic dynamics, geometric group theory, and combinatorics. Its goal is to
obtain a deeper understanding than currently exists of combinatorial structures
that arise in dynamical problems and to use this information in the enhancement
of known analytical results. The project involves research on the following
topics: the structure of iterated monodromy groups (in particular, their growth
and spectral properties); the development of a puzzle technique for Julia sets
in the Devaney family of rational maps, with a view towards establishing the
local connectivity of its connectivity locus; and recursive properties of the
linearizing map of quadratic Siegel disks.

The objects of study in dynamical systems have very complicated (fractal)
structures that require detailed combinatorial descriptions. Not only are these
descriptions a prerequisite for tackling hard dynamical problems, but they also
serve the purpose of exposing connections between dynamics and other areas of
mathematics, as well as between dynamics and other sciences. The proposed
research will focus on three such structures, linking holomorphic dynamical
systems to geometric group theory and combinatorics.
