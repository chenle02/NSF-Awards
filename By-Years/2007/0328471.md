Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a new and vibrant international,
multidisciplinary research endeavor that strives to develop innovative content-
based searching schemes, novel interfaces, and evolving networked delivery
mechanisms in an effort to make the world's vast store of music accessible to
all. Librarians, musicologists, psychologists, audio engineers, music teachers
and students, computer scientists, legal experts, music rights-holders, and
business executives are all involved. This project is designed enhance the
efforts being made to establish a scientific evaluation paradigm within the MIR
research community. Major issues addressed in this project include the
comprehension of the complex nature of music information; adequately capturing
the complex nature of music queries; and an in-depth examination of the
"relevance" problem in the MIR context. To these ends, this project undertakes
the creation of comprehensive set of data-rich query records that are both
grounded in real-world requirements and neutral with respect to retrieval
technique(s) being examined; the adoption, and subsequent validation, of a
"reasonable person" approach to "relevance" assessment; the establishment of
scientifically valid experimental protocols; and, the ongoing acquisition of
music information (audio, symbolic and metadata) to enhance the development of a
secure, yet accessible, research environment that allows researchers to remotely
participate in the use of the large-scale testbed collection. Because this
project significantly enhances the infrastructure of MIR research, it plays a
pivotal role in improving access to the world's vast music resources. Thus, this
project impacts the way music lovers, scholars, educators, students, industrial
and commercial developers, and all other interested parties, will be interacting
with music in the future. The project Web site (http://music-ir.org) provides
access to the research materials, publications and updates.
