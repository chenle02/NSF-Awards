The American Meteorological Society, in coordination with Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), is organizing a Policy Forum which will lead to findings
and recommendations on how to improve the safety and operations of the nation's
highway system through better application of weather information. The Forum will
be held on November 4-5, 2003 at the Army Navy Club at 901 17th Street, NW in
Washington, D.C. Forum participants will be drawn from the weather information
provider community and transportation users, managers, and developers in both
the public and private sectors, at the federal, state, and local levels. The
report of the Forum will be given wide circulation. All of the Forum documents
will be placed on the AMS web site. An article that summarizes the Forum
findings and recommendations will be published in the Bulletin of the American
Meteorological Society that is provided to every member of the Society.
