This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Tobias Owen, State
University of New York at Stony Brook, and a group of French astronomers, led by
Dr. Therese Encrenaz, at the Meudon Observatory, CNRS, in France. The objective
of this research is to continue a joint study of planetary atmospheres, with
particular emphasis on unresolved questions concerning the atmospheres of Venus
and Neptune; the historical presence of water on Mars; and the composition of
the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. In this project, new infrared spectra of the
atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune will be obtained and analyzed. In
addition, Voyager spacecraft data from Mars will be analyzed. Astronomers at the
Meudon Observatory are world leaders in the field of infrared spectroscopy.
Although many of the high-resolution spectroscopic measurements are made at the
Canada-France-US Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the Fourier Transform
Spectrometer used there was developed by one of the French collaborators. The
collaboration thus contributes greatly to the acquisition of the precise
experimental data required for this project. The joint experience is also
expected to be useful to both sides in the development of future instruments
suitable for infrared spectroscopy, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.
