DMS-0210822&lt;br/&gt;Dennis P. Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the
effective techniques of mathematics for dealing &lt;br/&gt;with problems of
several parameters or dimensions is &lt;br/&gt;combinatorial, or algebraic,
topology. In that field, &lt;br/&gt;geometric objects, called cycles, associated
to constraints&lt;br/&gt;are grouped into deformation or homology classes which
then &lt;br/&gt;combine and decompose in various combinations to define
&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures of such richness to provoke a theoretical
&lt;br/&gt;study in the own right of a variety of algebraic structures.
&lt;br/&gt;Recently some of these structures have appeared in theoretical
&lt;br/&gt;physics in the attempted formalism to describe term by term
&lt;br/&gt;models for quantum phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration,
the principal investigator has recently &lt;br/&gt;discovered related algebraic
topology structures in the &lt;br/&gt;space of strings (open and closed) filling
up a space (time) &lt;br/&gt;model. This award will sponsor investigations to
&lt;br/&gt;conceptually clarify the occurance of algebraic topology
&lt;br/&gt;in theoretical quantum physics and to relate the results
of&lt;br/&gt;these investigations to new string algebra.&lt;br/&gt;
