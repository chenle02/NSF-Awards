This 3 1/2 year grant will support two faculty, two postdoctorals, three
graduate and three undergraduate students to participate in experiments at CERN,
in Switzerland, and at the AGS proton accelerator at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The CERN experiment studies in a new unique way the--as yet not
understood--fundamental CP (particle-antiparticle exchange, space inversion)
symmetry violation, by producing beams of neutral kaons and anti- kaons by
annihilation of stopped antiprotons using LEAR (Low Energy Antiproton Ring). The
symmetry violation manifests itself in asymmetries in the kaon decay rates. The
data taking phase was completed recently and the data analysis will require tow
years of effort. Part of this grant is provided through the MPS/Office of
Multidisciplinary Activities equipment initiative, allowing acquisition of
needed computer workstations and tape drives for this analysis effort. At the
AGS a high precision measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the
muon will be performed using a 600 ton superconducting magnetic storage ring.
Under construction since 1988, this experiment begins data taking this year. The
improved precision (factor 20 to 0.35 ppm) of this measurement will provide
information regarding the fundamental theory of the electro-weak interaction,
specifically with regard to supersymmetry and possible muon or W-boson
substructure. These measurements complement those obtained from very high-energy
accelerators, such as at Fermilab and the Large Hadron Collider, now under
construction at CERN.
