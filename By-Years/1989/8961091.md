A new memory cell using magnetic films and High Critical Temperature
Superconductors (HCTS) is examined for application in supercomputer mass
memories. Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology has densities
projected in excess of 108 bits/cm2, but at these high densities read-access
times are limited to about 10 microseconds. With the proposed memory cell,
signal-to-noise ratios are improved by a factor of about 30, which would
decrease access times to about 10 nanoseconds. It may also offer a significant
cost reduction in random access memory systems. Supercomputer performance is
increasingly dominated by performance of the memory hierarchy, particularly
access time of disc memory. Installing and maintaining a liquid nitrogen cooling
system may be an acceptable cost for improved supercomputer performance
utilizing the subject memory scheme. If feasible, this concept may substantially
advance supercomputing technology, and as nitrogen cooling becomes less
expensive, it could have widespread use in both mainframe computers and work
stations.
