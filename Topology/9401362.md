9401362 Bridson This project focuses on three areas of geometric group theory:
quasi-isometry invariants for finitely generated groups, in particular, the
study of isoperimetric inequalities; the geometry of spaces of non-positive
curvature and the structure of their isometry groups; and automatic group theory
and its generalizations, with emphasis on the task of distinguishing bewteen the
various classes of groups which have arisen in this context. Examples drawn from
geometry and low-dimensional topology are of particular interest in each case.
More specifically, attacks are planned on the problems of determining the
structure of the (countable) set of functions that arise as Dehn functions of
finitely presented groups, and the structure of the set of flats in a CAT(0)
space. (This last problem is of particular interest in the case of 3-manifolds.)
Geometric group theory is a young and highly dynamic area of research in which
techniques from geometry and topology are adapted, extended, and used to solve
problems in algebra. Conversely, geometric problems are converted into questions
in group theory (encoding the symmetry of the geometric problem in algebra) with
startlingly powerful results. For example, questions concerning the area of
minimal surfaces (like soap films) can be converted into questions about how
hard it is to solve equations in finitely presented groups. In many cases this
leads to a sharp solution of the original geometric problem; this is the nature
of the 'isoperimetric inequalities' and 'Dehn functions' referred to above.
Remarkably, if one pursues this line further, then deep and fascinating
connections become apparent between linguistics (formal grammars), computer
science (automata theory), and the geometry of interesting spaces such as
3-manifolds (e.g., the universe). The goal of this project is to deepen our
understanding of these connections. ***
