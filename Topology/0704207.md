Tomova's research centers on Heegaard splittings of 3-dimensional manifolds and
bridge surfaces for knots in manifolds. Given a knot in a closed 3-manifold, a
bridge surface is a surface that decomposes the manifold into handlebodies and
also cuts the knot into simple arcs. In the last year and a half Tomova has
proven several important results about the behavior of bridge surfaces. She
intends to extend and generalize her results and apply her work to several open
problems in the area.

With the discovery of the DNS molecule and the recent advent of string theory,
the study of knots has come to the forefront of modern science. Knot Theory is a
subarea of Topology which studies the properties of knotted strings and is the
main area of interest of Maggy Tomova. Her study of knots also requires an
understanding of 3-manifolds, objects that locally look like 3-dimensional
space.
