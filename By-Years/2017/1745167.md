The 14th International Conference on Mid-IR Optoelectronics: Materials and
Devices provides a prominent international forum for reporting new developments
in the area of fundamental and applied optoelectronic materials and devices.
This activity benefits society by advancing the knowledge base of the infrared
materials and devices needed for present and future engineering grand
challenges, including emitters and detectors necessary for homeland security,
pollution detection, information and communication technology, and sustainable
energy conversion. The proposed activity advances discovery and understanding
while promoting teaching, training, and learning by bringing together
researchers and students with broad areas of expertise to understand and
discover the fundamentals of infrared materials and the novel devices enabled by
these materials. Moreover, the proposed activity enhances science and technology
through broader dissemination and understanding via face-to-face interaction at
the conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference activity advances knowledge
by bringing together experts, junior researchers, and students from all over the
world to interact and exchange ideas in the area of mid-infrared optoelectronic
materials and devices. The conference provides a distinguished international
forum for reporting new developments in the areas of infrared emitters and
detectors; interband and intersubband materials and devices; infrared
optoelectronic devices, components, and systems; fundamental and applied
infrared optoelectronic materials development, growth, and characterization;
novel architectures based on new materials and low-dimensional structures; and
non-linear infrared optoelectronics. The technical program will integrate oral
sessions, poster presentations, and social activities, providing numerous
opportunities for discussion and interaction between high-ranking researchers,
junior researchers, and students.
