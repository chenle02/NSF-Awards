This award will support the development of new analytical techniques to optimize
the application of the newest generation electron microprobes on the market
today. These instruments provide chemical composition data at scales less than
one micrometer, which is crucial to unraveling the history of many earth science
processes. This research and development project has significant potential
impacts for providing guidance to utilization of these instruments for research
being performed at the University of Wisconsin, in other NSF-funded facilities,
and elsewhere around the world. The project will employ a postdoctoral research
student for two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects supported by this new
instrument include many studies of deep-crustal processes:
petrogenesis&lt;br/&gt;of magmatic systems, causes of explosive volcanic
eruptions, conditions of granulite and of eclogite facies metamorphism, the
genesis of economic deposits of metals and fossil fuels, tectonics of major
shear zones, Hadean zircons, and meteoritics. Studies of near surface processes
include: astrobiology, paleoclimatology (biogenic carbonates and foraminifera,
speleothems), diagenesis and basin evolution, cementation in shallow fault
zones, and nano-minerals.
