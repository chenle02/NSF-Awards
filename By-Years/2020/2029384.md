This project investigates the extent to which, among older adults, the ability
to comply with public health guidelines is affected by demographic position and
how this contributes to differences in exposure risk and health consequences.
This study builds on an earlier study of activity patterns of a diverse sample
of older adults to measure risk of spatial exposures prior to the pandemic and,
through the collection of new waves of data, to measure spatial responses to the
pandemic. The data from this project will inform future modeling of disease
spread, providing more sophisticated assumptions regarding implementation and
adherence to guidelines. The data also provide information that can be used to
help decision makers develop and target interventions to minimize the emotional
and physical health impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable populations.

Building on three earlier waves of data collection in 2018 and 2019, three
additional waves of data are collected during the pandemic. Respondents carry
smartphones and answer several surveys a day providing location and other
objective and subjective data concerning their activities. A brief telephone
survey follows in 3-6 months. Analysis assesses effects of demographic and
locational characteristics as well as change over time.
