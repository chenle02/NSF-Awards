9455570 Chapman The UCLA Science Challenge began in 1991 as a five-year program
with a mission to bring innovative, research-level instruction to
undergraduates, particularly lower division students in order to retain lower-
division science majors, recruit new science majors, attract more minority
students to science, and to improve student attitudes toward science. The goal
is to infuse every lower division course in the physical sciences with new
material and to create new interdisciplinary courses that reflect the breadth
and overlap of the physical and life science disciplines. As we enter the fourth
year of the program, we are on target to meet our charge. During the first half
of the project, we primarily attacked both the largest general education classes
in the division, the Astronomy and Atmospheric Science courses, which
collectively enroll 8000 non-science majors each year, and also courses for the
physical science majors in Chemistry and Physics. Our major focus now will be on
the Physics course for Life Science majors. Our minor focus, for the enormous
General Chemistry course that all Life Science and Physical Science majors must
take, will concentrate on modules that allow students to visualize 3-dimensional
molecular and crystalline structures. We will keep a small presence in the Earth
and Space Science department, in Astronomy, and in Atmospheric Science in order
to maintain the coherence of the renovation of the Physical Sciences at UCLA and
to fulfill our commitment to complete the modules which these departments have
begun.
