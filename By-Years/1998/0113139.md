This project will design and implement a distributed rendering platform that
consists of off-the-shelf commodity components, yet delivers real-time
photorealism on a large scale. This parallel rendering system was inspired by a
similar system recently built at Princeton University. Proposed extensions to
that work include a significant expansion in scale, new task-scheduling
algorithms, a new integrated network design that links graphics card drivers to
network interface card drivers in distributed Linux systems, and an extension of
the Keller technique, called instant radiosity, to deliver real-time, global
illumination. Design and implementation of the platform should provide graduate
students in computer science with valuable hands-on experience in designing
large-scale systems for distributed processing. The resulting platform should
serve as a valuable research tool for several groups including the NSF ERC
group, which will use visualization to explore product and process design for
new fibers and films. The enabling code extensions, to widely-available open
software systems that this project builds, will be freely available over the
Internet.
