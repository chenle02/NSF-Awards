The research is to focus on various classical questions in complexity theory, as
they are posed anew in various settings of two-person probabilistic games,
specifically interactive and zero knowledge interactive proofs, and games
against nature. The kinds of questions considered include (a) comparing the
strengths of different models of probabilism, e.g. one-sided error, two-sided
error, unbounded error; (b) limiting the number of random bits used, or
questions analogous to more classical questions involving pseudorandom number
generation; (c) understanding the power of alternation or interaction; and,
finally, (d) restricting the flow of information.
