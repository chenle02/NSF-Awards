This research project, under the direction of Dr. Kleinhaus, will examine the
effects of two neurotransmitter, serotonin and FMRF- amide, on the intracellular
calcium levels in identified nerve cells of an invertebrate model system. There
is evidence suggesting that these two neurotransmitters are involved in the
regulation of essential behaviors in the leech. These neurotransmitters have
been shown to alter the effects of calcium and modulate the excitability of
Retzius cells, multifuctional nerve cells that have been implicated in the
control and integration of at least two behaviors, swimming and feeding, in this
animal. A combination of optical and electrophysiological techniques will be
used to monitor the dynamics of calcium concentration in selective nerve cells
to establish a relationship between membrane potential and internal calcium
level. This investigation will provide additional knowledge regarding the
mechanism of action and effects of serotonin and FRMF-amide on the nervous
system.
