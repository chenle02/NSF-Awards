A Computer-Integrated Process Engineering Laboratory is established that
uniquely incorporates computer integrated engineering concepts into the
undergraduate curriculum by providing 'hands on' experience with modern
instrumentation and control systems, databases statistical analysis methods and
computer-aided engineering tools as they apply to the operation, analysis and
design of industrial processes. A networked cluster of engineering workstations
and realtime database servers interfaced with on-campus utility systems serves
as a generic platform for studying the application of computer integrated
manufacturing concepts in the process industries. The real- world, on-campus
utility data base coupled with state-of-the-art computer software/hardware tools
is an effective environment for studying approaches to defining and solving
problems in product quality and process productivity improvement. Additional
utility and relevance of the laboratory include: focusing attention on problem
areas of national technical and economic importance - energy and
competitiveness; being readily reproducible - almost all campuses have utility
systems; and, potentially providing direct economic benefits to universities
utility cost reductions.
