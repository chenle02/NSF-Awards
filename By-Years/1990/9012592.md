The investigators will follow the proliferative and migratory behavior of
individual precursor cells and their progeny in mouse telencephalon. They will
accomplish this by monitoring the spatial and temporal properties of development
dynamically in cultured slices of cerebral cortex, which has never been
attempted before. Precursor cells in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon
will be marked by either intracellular injection of fluorescein dextran, by
extracellular labeling of small numbers of precursor cells with a lipophilic
dye, or with a retroviral lineage marker. Subsequently, at selected time
intervals, the individual labeled cells as well as their progeny will be
visualized by video-enhanced confocal fluorescence microscopy.
