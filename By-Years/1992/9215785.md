Vaidyanathan This research addresses coding gain optimization in one dimensional
paraunitary filter banks. Paraunitary filter banks include both subband and
transform coders as extreme special cases, and have the advantage of perfect
signal recovery in the absence of quantization. This approach opens up a large
class of problems, some fundamental, in signal processing and in systems theory,
all of which are being addressed. A number of properties of the filter bank
transformer that parallel traditional Fourier transform properties (e.g., the
convolution theorem) are also being addressed. Again, the coding gain
optimization for paraunitary and orthonormal convolvers is being addressed. The
above research is also being generalized to nonuniform filter banks (i.e.,
systems with unequal decimation ratios, as in the most common discrete time
wavelet transformers). Finally, several extensions of these ideas to
multidimensional multirate systems are being considered.
