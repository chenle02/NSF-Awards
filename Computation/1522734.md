In this project the PI will develop and analyze computational models describing
the evolution of methane hydrate. Methane hydrate is an ice-like substance of
great interest in geophysics, climate studies, and energy engineering, because
it can release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and drilling hazard; hydrates
can also serve as a potential unconventional energy source. This work will
involve several spatial scales from the kilometer scale of hydrate bearing
subsea sediments and Arctic permafrost regions, to the micro-scale at which one
looks at the pores of the sediments. The PI's mathematical analysis of hydrate
models, under some simplifying assumptions, has so far revealed very unusual
features absent, e.g., in ice-water phase transitions. Based on these analyses
the PI will formulate more accurate algorithms for the simplified and for more
complex realistic models, which in turn can further our understanding of hydrate
formation and dissociation in nature. The software the PI will develop will be
shared with the geophysics community.

In PI's prior work, she has framed a simplified model of methane hydrate as a
parameter-dependent free boundary problem, and her analyses show that its
solutions can develop multiple singularities beyond those known, e.g., for
Stefan problem of ice-water phase transitions. In this project the PI will
develop new techniques for the simplified model extending substantially the
classical results known for the non-parametrized case, and studying fundamental
research questions concerning, e.g., nonlinear degenerate diffusion and
conservation laws with the particular type of parameter-dependent monotone
operators. The will extend the delicate time-stepping analyses in the abstract
setting, develop a priori and a posteriori error analyses, and robust algorithms
for the couplings across multiple time and spatial scales. In particular, the
will consider the porescale at which she formulates reduced and dynamic models
for many of the constitutive relationships needed for macroscale. In additional
to computational mathematics, the project will impact the geophysics community
involved in hydrate modeling, and more broadly other applications in porous
media.
