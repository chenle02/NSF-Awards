Many speech sounds and musical tones are composed of harmonics, which are
frequencies that are roughly integer multiples of the lowest frequency present.
The lowest or fundamental frequency of a harmonic sound usually determines its
pitch. Yet when the fundamental frequency is removed while the upper harmonics
remain intact (as is the case for low voices heard over the telephone), the
pitch remains unchanged. Furthermore, shifting the upper frequencies causes the
pitch to change in complex ways. This research will involve the refinement and
testing of a theory of auditory perception that accounts for these and other
phenomena. The theory postulates that as a result of the properties of auditory
neurons and general principles of neural connectivity, exposure to speech
results in the neural encoding of harmonic patterns. These neural encodings in
turn filter the sounds we hear so that frequencies that are blocked or distorted
during transmission are effectively restored by the auditory system. The
research will test the theory using computer simulations of a neural-net model
and using perceptual experiments. Understanding how the auditory system
recognizes sound patterns may in the future guide the development of "smart"
hearing devices that can compensate for selective loss of auditory function.
