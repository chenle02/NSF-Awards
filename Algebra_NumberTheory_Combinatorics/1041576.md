The school on noncommutative geometry will take place in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, on July 26-August 7, 2010. It will include eight lecture courses by
leading experts covering the basics of noncommutative geometry (K-theory, index
theory, deformation quantization, quantum groups) as well as most recent
developments in the subject and in its connections to other fields, such as
topological quantum field theory, symplectic geometry, vertex operator algebras
and other topics of mathematical physics.

Noncommutative geometry is the subject of mathematics that generalizes the
classical methods of studying spaces to the noncommutative case, i.e. to the
situation where the identity xy=yx is no longer valid. This generalization is
needed for many applications: quantum physics (where noncomutativity is a
mathematical manifestation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle); geometry,
theory of differential equations, topology, etc. (where symmetries of a space or
of another system do not commute, i.e. one gets different results if one applies
two symmetries in different orders). Perhaps less intuitively, to develop the
methods of noncommutative geometry themselves, one needs advanced techniques of
algebra, geometry, and topology that are inspired to a large extent by
mathematical physics. The school will bring together the leading experts in the
field, as well as in the adjacent subjects, with hmany young researchers from
the US, the Americas, and Europe.
