This proposal continues the study of the static and dynamical properties of
polymeric systems into regimes of higher concentration. The major effort in the
future will be directed towards developing systematic methods for treating the
physics of more concentrated systems, in accord with our plan to climb up the
ladder of concentration step by step. As the concentration rises, he encounter
richer and richer physics. He focus especially on: (A) dynamics of many chain
systems; (B) fundamental study of rubbers and gels; (C) semimacroscopic dynamics
at first order phase transitions. His goal is to construct a conceptually sound
semiquantitative theory of polymer and related systems capable of direct
confrontation with experiment.
