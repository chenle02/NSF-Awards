It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that understanding the
organic/inorganic interface and the geobiochemical role of bacteria and clay
minerals in sedimentary basins is crucial to development of accurate,
comprehensive models of equilibrium and mass transfer in diagenetic processes. A
myriad of reversible and irreversible reactions occur in these processes, all of
which are in principle amenable to thermodynamic analysis. For example,
thermodynamic calculations can be used together with compositional data to
identify stable and metastable equilibrium states in diagenetic systems and
assess kinetic constraints on reaction progress. Calculations of this kind can
be carried out with the aid of equations of state developed in this laboratory
over the past several decades. These equations make it possible to investigate
the chemical and thermodynamic consequences of reactions among a wide variety of
minerals, gases and aqueous species at elevated temperatures and pressures. The
purpose of this proposal is to request long-range support for continuation of
this research in the context of diagenetic processes with emphasis on
organic/inorganic reactions and those of geobiochemical interest. The goals of
the project over the next five years include comprehensive calculation of the
thermodynamic properties of organic liquids, solids, gases and aqueous species
as a function of temperature and pressure, investigation of the extent to which
metastable equilibrium prevails among organic molecules in petroleum, aqueous
species in oil field brines, and authigenic mineral assemblages in hydrocarbon
reservoirs and source rocks, quantification of thermodynamic constraints on the
role of bacteria in diagenetic processes at elevated temperatures and pressures,
and calculation of mass transfer involving organic/inorganic reactions and clay
minerals in sedimentary basins.
