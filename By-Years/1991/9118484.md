This award supports a paleomagnetic study of East Antarctica where early
Paleozoic reference poles are not well established. The investigation will
provide new poles from South Victoria Land (SVL) in cratonic East Antarctica for
the time period between 550 and 450 million years ago, (the Early Cambrian to
the Late Ordovician). New paleomagnetic data from East Antarctic Cambrian and
Ordovician rocks will constrain the early Paleozoic Gondwana apparent polar
wander path and increase our understanding of East Antarctic's early paleozoic
tectonic evolution.
