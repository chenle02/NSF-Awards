The objective of this research is to develop an object-oriented paradigm for
building complex real-time systems. By extending the polymorphic structure of
data types to the performance domain, this paradigm allows the system timing and
performance to be defined explicitly in the program and verified and enforced
mechanically. A real-time program component is implemented as a set of
functionally correct methods with different performance requirements, one of
these methods will be selected for execution either dynamically or statically
based on the actual resources available. In addition, flexible scheduling
policies are used to ensure that the timing constraints of all jobs are
satisfied. By utilizing the performance flexibility for program execution and
scheduling, the timing correctness of real-time programs can be better
guaranteed.
