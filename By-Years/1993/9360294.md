9360294 Abramson This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is designed to
provide an opportunity for small business, particularly the small high
technology firm, to participate in NSF research. Phase I of the SBIR program
serves as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the firm can
do high quality research. Phase II is the principal research project. Phase III
is the conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications and
technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or other
non-federal financing. The focus of this Phase I project is to develop the
technology of a new kind of CDMA which uses only one common code for all users
of the network. It would replace or work with the three different types of
multiple access protocols which are used in most wireless data networks today -
TDMA, CDMA and ALOHA. The protocol is called Spread ALOHA CDMA, and could
simplify the implementation of CDMA while increasing the overall efficiency of
the multiple access protocol.
