The reproducible crystal growth of thin films with the correct stoichiometry
and appropriate morphology is the key to the commercialization of devices
incorporating film high temperature superconductors. Metal oxide chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) has the potential to meet these needs coupled with relative
ease of scaling to manufacturing volumes. However, recent work on MOCVD has been
plagued by two major limitations: (l.) films grown at temperatures less than
800C are amorphous mixtures of oxides, fluorides and/or barium carbonate and
(2.) as-deposited films exhibit cauliflower-like morphology which is indicative
of low surface mobility growth. Surface mobilities can be increased without
elevating the temperature of the substrate through the use of a plasma.
Moreover, plasma assisted laser ablation, sputtering and reactive evaporation
have already been used for the in-situ growth of superconducting thin films at
temperatures as low as 400C, even when BaF2 has been used as the Ba precursor.
These results suggest that plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) may
effect the in-situ growth of superconducting thin films with the existing
reagent technology. The goal of this first phase of research is to demonstrate
the PECVD of in-situ superconducting thin films of YBaCuO at substrate
temperatures below 600 C.
