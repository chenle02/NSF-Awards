This grant supports fundamental and applied research on modeling and automating
decision making under uncertainty. The project is developing tools for
eliciting, modeling, and managing complex and probabilistic information,
algorithms for building models based on this information, and planning
algorithms. These will all be applied to the Kentucky Welfare to Work program
and to academic advising at the University of Kentucky. The algorithms and
software developed will be available for use in other domains.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given formal models of, for instance, Welfare to Work's
offerings and of the constraints inherent in legal requirements, logistics, and
an individual client's goals and preferences, planning algorithms and heuristics
find a plan that optimizes the client's expected utility. (The outcome for a
given client in a given program is never certain before the program
begins.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a unified suite of tools
for extracting and eliciting probabilistic information and managing it in a
flexible and efficient database management system, a formalism and software for
eliciting constraints, preferences and goals, and planning algorithms that take
into account both hard and soft constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
applications will engage clients and service providers in the Welfare to Work
system and students at the University of Kentucky in the processes of
determining their own goals and preferences and in planning that will determine
whether those goals and preferences are satisfiable. The work will help them
strive for maximum satisfaction.&lt;br/&gt;
