9312625 Murdocca A method for dealing with the decoder limit through the use of
reconfigurable optical interconnects is proposed here. A significant aspect of
the proposed effort is that the decoding mechanism supports fast access to
arbitrarily sized sections of memory. A number of previously reported optical
addressing schemes only support access to entire pages, or involve more complex
page composing mechanisms than the simple approach proposed here. ***
