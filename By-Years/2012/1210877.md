The goal of this program is to develop a large suite of cosmological ray-tracing
simulations to create a library of simulated maps of weak lensing by galaxies,
in order to study their cosmological information content by examining and
combining several different non-linear statistics. Special attention will be
paid to baryonic effects and to other systematic errors, and tools will be built
to best extract the cosmological information. The simulation library and
emulator will be necessary to realize the full potential of the Large Synoptic
Survey Telescope and other future weak lensing datasets.

Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate
students, release of simulation data, and outreach to the public via work at the
Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History.
