The P.I. will test and evaluate a numerical scheme designed to cut
computational time, with the end product potentially being applicable to large
scale global models that include photochemistry as well as other 3-D models. The
PI plans to develop a numerical method for solving the equations of
photochemical production and loss. The distinctive feature of the proposed
procedure is the derivation of an iterative solution for OH based on production
and loss terms for odd hydrogen. Initial results suggest that the new procedure
requires five times less computation time compared to implicit solution
procedures.
