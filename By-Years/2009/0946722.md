OISE 09-46722&lt;br/&gt;Kenith Meissner&lt;br/&gt;Texas
A&amp;M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for a
planning visit to Swansea University in Wales, United Kingdom. The US principal
investigator is Kenith Meissner from Texas A&amp;M University. The foreign
collaborator is James Abbey. The purpose of this planning visit is to develop
collaborative research and educational programs between the two
universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The visit will be organized around themed,
workshop-style meetings, breakout sessions, lab tours and research planning. A
rich array of research areas have already been identified through preliminary
discussions. General areas under consideration include taoxicity and
nanoparticles; nanoparticles/microstructures for biomedical imaging and sensing;
and process safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This visit will expose US faculty and
students to international research, enhance infrastructure for research and
education through coupling of complementary expertise and develop international
education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
