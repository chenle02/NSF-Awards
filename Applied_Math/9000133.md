The general objective of this project is to understand and to predict the
surface structures and geometries of crystals which have been subjected to
various kinds of thermal or mechanical treatments. The principal investigator is
also interested in analyzing the behavior of defective crystals. These problems
concentrate on areas that are the subject of intense work of material scientists
but they escape the framework of classical mathematical theories. Therefore,
accomplishing these goals is not only important for the industry and technology
but it also contributes to the advance of mathematics, since it requires
manipulation of very recently developed mathematical tools and maybe the
introduction of new ones.
