Rapid advances in networking and Internet technologies has fueled the emergence
of the "software as a service" model for enterprise computing that enables
organizations to outsource many Information Technology (IT) services. This model
allows organizations to concentrate on their core business instead of sustaining
large investments in IT. IT outsourcing results in savings from the economies of
scale due to leveraging of hardware, software, personnel, as well as maintenance
and upgrade costs. Outsourcing is a common practice in Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) domains and it is
gaining popularity in basic services such as email, storage and disaster
protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore the data privacy
challenges that arise in outsourcing data management services. Data management
systems are among the most common, expensive, and complex software systems used
by almost all types of organizations. In the envisioned "database as a service"
(DAS) model, the client's data resides on the premises of the service provider
and is accessed using SQL queries. Since clients' data as a very valuable asset,
the service provider must implement sufficient security measures to guarantee
data privacy. The research will explore the resulting challenges: (1) Privacy
protection from malicious outsiders: protecting service providers from theft of
customer data (e.g., hackers breaking into a provider's site and scanning all
disks). (2) Privacy protection from database service providers: assuring that
clients' encrypted data cannot be decrypted at the service provider. Thus,
techniques to evaluate queries over encrypted data at the service provider need
to be developed. (3) Ensuring Integrity of the Results: developing scalable
techniques to ensure that the service provider returns exactly the right answer
set to the client's query.
