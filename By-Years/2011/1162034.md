The research goal of this award is to design operational models to provide
decision support for markdown pricing by e-tailers. The models will include
strategic customer behavior in the presence of business rules, and will have the
potential to be applied operationally. Existing models for MDO with strategic
customers make strong assumptions about customer behavior that are difficult to
estimate or validate with the data that can practically be collected. Our
research focuses on pricing models that can be estimated with customer visit
data. Such data is already being collected by e-tailers through user logins and
cookies. Such information would not be practical to collect for brick-and-mortar
stores, the traditional context for the MDO problem. The research plan is to
first try to understand the impact of limited strategic (i.e. returning but
myopic) customers on the optimal prices for an e-tailer in a single-item
setting. Next, we will build upon the foundation such MDO models by additionally
considering business rules - these are practically important hard constraints
that retailers impose on the sequence of prices. Finally, we will generalize our
models to the case of multiple items. We will analyze these models first from a
theoretical standpoint but also will exploit the relationships between them and
test them in practice using real data. This research will employ methodologies
from a variety of fields with the long term goal to deepen our understanding on
issues in dynamic pricing as they relate to the retail industry and beyond. We
will develop an integrated framework, models and methods for the application of
stochastic and robust optimization to key pricing problems.

If successful this research will fill a gap between theory and practice in the
existing research that will transform the pricing processes of e-tailers. It
will empower them to benefit from a better understanding of strategic customer
behavior. This is vital because e-commerce an increasing segment of retail
business. Further, we believe that the applications of this research go beyond
the field of pricing. We will share our integrated framework, models and
methods, to help both academics and practitioners. From an educational
perspective, the results of this project will serve as components in teaching
modules at MIT. These include modules in core courses for which the PI already
has shared responsibility. This project lends itself ideally to mentoring
undergraduate and graduate students in research on tractable practice-based
optimization.
