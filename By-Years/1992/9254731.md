The primary purpose of this project is to establish a national dissemination
network and disseminate the results of Project Kaleidoscope-Phase I, an NSF-
supported effort to begin a major reform movement in science an mathematics
education at the undergraduate level, with a focus on liberal arts institutions.
The dissemination effort, to be coordinated by the Independent Colleges office,
includes the following activities: A series of regional colloquia, symposia, and
workshops, and two national PKAL colloquia; Presentations at regional and
national meeting os disciplinary and educational associations; Implementation of
a system of mentor/consultants available to assist institutions in their reform
efforts; Publication of meeting proceedings and major position papers on
critical issues in the reform movement and Evaluation of the impact of reform
efforts in undergraduate science and mathematics education. Building the network
and dissemination efforts will be strengthened significantly by utilizing an
electronic network to be established on the Internet. The electronic network
will be used for communications, conferencing, and file exchange.
