The computational GRID vision is that everyone at a desktop machine could
eventually have the power of a supercomputer at his or her fingertips. The GRID
takes its name from the electrical utility analogy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GRID
computing holds the promise of transforming the Internet, now used for
communication, mainly e- mail and instant messaging, while the Web is an
information retrieval system, enabling computer users to have access to text,
images and music. Grid computing builds on the result of previous and ongoing
research in networking, distributed computing, seamless computing, meta
computing, web technologies, and other related topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In
this proposal, the National Virtual Observatory, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Large
Hadron Collider experiments, all well-presented science projects (two of which
have support via NSF Major Research Equipment funds) have data needs appropriate
for GRID based technologies and are depending on such technologies for the
successful operations of their experiments. The experiments will serve as test
beds for GRID concepts. &lt;br/&gt;
