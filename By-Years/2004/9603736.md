Dudley 9603736 Inherent limits to exercise performance an athletic capacity of
animals are little-understood. For animal locomotion generally, the highest
known rates of aerobic metabolism are found in flying forms, particularly among
hummingbirds and insects. Dr. Dudley will examine the physiological and
biomechanical limits to flight performance in hummingbirds and in insects of
comparable body mass. Oxygen concentration and air density of experimental gas
mixtures will be simultaneously variesd so as to aerodynamically and
physiologically challenge hovering hummingbirds and moths. The limits to flight
performance will be evaluated behaviorally by determining the air densities and
oxygen concentration at which these animals can no longer sustain hovering
flight. Simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption will evaluate the
associated maximal metabolic rates, while aerodynamic models will be applied to
the observed wingbeat kinematics to estimate the associated expenditure of
mechanical power by the flight muscle. An additional series of experiments will
then be implemented that provide enhanced oxygen availability at equivalent air
densities, so as to test the hypothesis that diffusive oxygen flux is the
limiting step in maximum aerobic performance of these two taxa. Increased rates
of oxygen consumption under such conditions will indicate that diffusive
constraints limit maximum locomotor performance, whereas no such increase will
suggest limits of convective flux within the respiratory system, or
biomechanical constraints on flight mechanics. The null hypothesis predicts that
the tracheal respiration of moths will ultimately be limited by oxygen
availability, whereas the pulmonary-based ventilation of hummingbirds will show
no such energetic enhancement under conditions of increased oxygen availaility.
More generally, this research will demonstrate inherent design constraints of
both vertebrate and insect resporatory systems under conditions of maximum
performance.
