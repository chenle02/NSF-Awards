The long term objective of the project is to study the polypeptide structure of
the nuclear pore complexes in Drosophila melanogaster. Work will focus on a
myosin-like ATPase recently localized to Drosophila nuclear pore complexes and
thought to participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport. The specific goal of this
proposal is to biochemically identify the nuclear myosin-like protein. Work will
concentrate on the purification of this protein from Drosophila Kc tissue
culture cells and/or early embryos using affinity chromatography strategies.
Once the nuclear myosin-like ATPase protein has been affinity purified, amino
acid sequence information will be used to generate monospecific antibodies and
oligonucleotides to clone and sequence the gene encoding the Drosophila nuclear
myosin-like ATPase and to confirm its nuclear pore complex localization. Nuclear
pores are the sites at which movement of proteins, nucleic acids, and
nucleoprotein complexes take place between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This
is an important area of current research in cellular biology, since
communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is critical to the
eukaryotic cell. Very little is known about the transport process or the
macromolecules which are involved. It is generally accepted that there is an
ATPase associated with nuclear pores. Affinity photolabeling of a candidate
nuclear pore ATPase led to the identification of the putative myosin-like pore
protein, which will be studied further with the support of this award.
