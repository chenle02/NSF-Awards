This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the
subfield of analytical spectroscopy. Professor Harris will study changes in
molecular structure during laser-initiated chemical reactions using time-
resolved laser spectroscopic methods. This research will examine the reaction
mechanisms involved in condensed phase laser-initiated reactions involving
atoms, free-radicals and polymers. Time-resolved photothermal spectroscopy and
resonance Raman spectroscopy will be used to characterize the reactions over
time scales ranging from fractions of nanoseconds to seconds. The impact of this
work will involve improving the understanding of condensed phase reactions that
give rise to interesting products such as polymers.
