9652678 Groffman Recent research has revealed that snow-covered soils often do
not freeze, while snow-free soils freeze and thaw many times over the course of
the winter. This insulating effect of snow protects plant roots from freezing
damage, and allows soil biological activity, including the cycling of key
nutrients such as nitrogen, to occur during the winter. Research in this project
will further understanding of the importance of snow as a regulator of soil
processes and will assess a possibly important effect of global climate change.
The researchers will experimentally reduce snow cover on forest plots to
simulate an early winter "snow drought" as may occur with global warming. It is
hypothesized that snow reduction will result in increased soil freezing, root
death and nutrient loss from forest plots. The work will be conducted at a site
funded by the National Science Foundation for Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER), allowing the investigators to evaluate the importance of snow relative
to other factors influencing the structure and function of forest ecosystems.
