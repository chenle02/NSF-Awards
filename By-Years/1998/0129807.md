This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program, addresses the formation mechanisms of self-assembled monolayer thin
films. Professor Daniel Schwartz and his group at the University of Colorado use
a combination of methods to examine the detailed microscopic mechanism of
monolayer growth, including two and three dimensional transport of molecules,
the structure of the growing film, and the aggregation of molecules in the
layer. Scanning probe microscopy is used to monitor the morphology of the
growing monolayer, and reflection absorption infrared and X-ray scattering
methods are used to provide molecular structure information. Phosphonic,
sulfonic and carboxylic acid monolayers growing on mica and sapphire substrates
are examined under a systematic variation of growth conditions. The overall goal
of the research is to develop a detailed and quantitative model of the formation
of self-assembled monolayers from solution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic thin
films have important applications in material surface modification and as models
for biological membrane systems. The detailed understanding of the mechanisms of
growth of these self-assembled monolayer materials is the goal of this research
project. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the
goal of this research project is to obtain molecular level information about the
growth of a range of molecular acid monolayers on oxide substrates, and to
develop a detailed model of the growth process. The results of this research
will be useful in the understanding of these technologically important model
systems, and in their subsequent design and application for the modification of
material surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
