This award will provide support to defray expenses of participants in School on
Analytic and Functional Inequalities with Applications under the name ``Entropy
and the Quantum" that will take place March 16-20, 2009 at the University of
Arizona, Tuscon, AZ. Support will be provided to participants who do not
currently hold NSF awards, with exceptions made for main speakers. It is
understood that much of the funding will be directed to graduate students,
postdocs, and junior faculty but that certain senior participants will be funded
as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will feature four speakers, each to
deliver three lectures, and several contributed talks. The principal objective
of this school is to introduce young mathematicians to the field, as well as to
provide a forum for presentation of the current state of the art of the theory.
The organizers intend to actively involve young mathematicians, female
mathematicians, and mathematicians from other under-represented groups. Several
graduate students are expected to participate at the meeting.
