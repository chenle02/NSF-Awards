9734265 Palsberg The goal of the project is to develop type inference algorithms
for object-oriented software which are practically useful for tool developers
and language designers. An example application is tool support for transforming
a dynamically typed prototype application into a statically typed product. The
currently known algorithms do not handle the combination of features found in
commonly used languages, and none of the algorithms are known to scale well. The
project will develop new type inference algorithms, it will perform large scale
experiments with them, and it will investigate new language designs where type
inference is smoothly integrated. Along with this, a hands-on course on
programming languages is being developed, focusing on the similarities and
differences between object oriented and functional programming. ***
