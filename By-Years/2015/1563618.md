This project will develop fundamental understanding of how integrated social
science and agent-based modeling approaches can improve life safety under threat
of near-field tsunami hazards. The targeted hazard scenario is a magnitude 9.0
earthquake and tsunami from the Cascadia Subduction Zone, threatening
communities along 1,000 miles of the US Pacific Northwest coastline. This
project develops close collaboration with a number of organizations responsible
for public safety during the response extreme natural hazards, including the
Oregon Department of Transportation, Oregon Office of Emergency Management,
Oregon Parks and Recreation, and Oregon Sea Grant. Social science data from
diverse groups will contribute to a growing body of knowledge on evacuation
decision-making. A collaboration with the Oregon Museum of Science of Industry
(OMSI) will leverage the museum's ongoing activities, including those which
reach underrepresented groups. Modeling source code will be shared and
distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates the disciplines of
sociology with engineering to investigate multiple forms of tsunami information
and its potential impact on evacuation decision-making by the general public and
the unique professional community responsible for coastal visitor safety. The
project objectives are (1) to identify the cognitive and social factors that
influence multimodal evacuation decision-making behavior; (2) to utilize an
Agent-Based Modeling framework to provide realistic/credible hypothetical
scenarios for near-field tsunamis hazards; and (3) to determine the
usability/acceptability of social science-informed agent-based modeling for
understanding evacuation decision-making. This work will therefore improve
understand of how decision-making affects life safety, with broad outreach to
diverse audiences both to assess the feasibility of this approach and for
purposes of outreach.
