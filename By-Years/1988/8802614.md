This work will emphasize new mathematical directions in the treatment of
nonlinear wave equations in which geometry and dynamical systems play a
significant role in the qualitative theory. The general theme of the work is to
analyze singularity formation and stability properties for nonlinear equations
arising in geometry and physics (particle field theory in particular). One
particular objective is to continue studies on the nonlinear sigma model
described by nonlinear maps from Minkowski space to complete Riemannian
manifolds. The mathematical interest in these models is centered on the
existence of solutions defined on all space-time and the development of
singularities. Local existence results are known, and in higher dimensions
solutions with small initial data can be shown to exist for all time. Recent
results show that weak solutions with initial data of any (finite energy) for
restricted target manifolds. Work will now be done in an effort to relax this
condition. A second line of investigation focuses on the classification of
differential equations close to critical points as first developed by Poincare.
The fundamental problem is that of establishing analytic transformations which
conjugate equations into linear ones. In the ordinary differential equations
case, the answers lie in the nature of the spectrum (resonance). For partial
differential equations the situation is different, although some positive
results are available. Work will continue toward the establishment of both
analytic and nonanalytic transformations for nonlinear Schrodinger equations.
