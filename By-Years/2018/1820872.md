This award funds the research activities of Professor Alexander Vilenkin at
Tufts University.

The theory of inflation, which has been the leading cosmological paradigm over
the last three decades, has led to a major change in our global view of the
universe. According to the new worldview, much of the volume in the universe is
in the state of explosive inflationary expansion. We live in a region where
inflation has ended, and other such regions with diverse properties are
constantly being formed. Professor Vilenkin will develop methods to test this
multiverse theory observationally. As part of this research, Professor Vilenkin
will also study possible observational signatures of cosmic strings. Cosmic
strings are very thin and highly energetic linear objects. Many models of
particle physics predict that such strings must have formed in the early
universe, and if so they can produce a variety of effects which are observable
at the present time. In particular, such strings could be responsible for cosmic
rays at the highest energies, which are hard to explain through conventional
astrophysical processes. A detection of cosmic strings would be of great
importance, as it would open a unique window into the physics of very high
energies, inaccessible in particle accelerators. As such, this research is in
the national interest by furthering the development of basic science in the
United States. Professor Vilenkin will also continue his efforts to communicate
these ideas to the general public.

At a more technical level, the predictions of the multiverse model will be
explored using the powerful statistical methods developed by Professor Vilenkin
and his collaborators. One of the predictions is the formation of black holes
with a very wide distribution of masses. This effect, which may explain the
origin of supermassive black holes observed at the centers of most galaxies,
will be studied using numerical simulations.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
