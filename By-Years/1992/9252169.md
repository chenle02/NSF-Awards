The Department of Chemistry is combining two work stations and two computers and
a variety of software for a laboratory facility to support the instructional
program in computational chemistry/molecular modeling for several upper-level
chemistry courses. Emphasis is on acquiring a versatile system that permits
undergraduate students to carry out the sophisticated calculations and molecular
manipulations that are now routine in research settings. These include realistic
quantum and molecular mechanics calculations for small molecules, including
simple inorganic and organic compounds and metal containing organometallic and
coordination compounds, and molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics
calculations for the large molecules that are central to a clear understanding
of modern biochemistry/molecular biology. The graphical display of these models
is a central feature of the facility and of the instructional applications being
developed.
