In this project, a modern, computer-aided design and test laboratory will be
constructed. It will include ten integrated electrical engineering workstations
consisting of an interconnected IBM PC/XT with Hewlett Packard electronic
benches attached. These workstations will be used to teach modern computer-aided
testing, measurements and experimentation in circuits, electronics and advanced
laboratories. The result is expected to be a significant improvement in the
laboratory education of electrical engineers
