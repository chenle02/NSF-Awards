Problems of combinatorial optimization concern finding the optimal value of a
function defined on a finite, though very large, set. Such problems have many
real world applications and, for the most part, are notoriously difficult to
solve, because the set of possible solutions is prohibitively large. The P.I.
intends to investigate such problems through the approach of partition
functions, the method inspired to a large extent by statistical physics. This
will lead to new efficient algorithms in previously intractable problems.

The particular problems addressed by the project include efficient computation
of partition functions associated with perfect matching in (hyper)graphs,
Hamiltonian cycles and cliques in graphs, graph homomorphisms, and systems of
multivariate real quadratic equations. It will allow one to identify efficiently
solvable cases of hard problems. For example, one will be able to efficiently
distinguish graphs with sufficiently many (but still hard to find) Hamiltonian
cycles from graphs that are sufficiently far away from Hamiltonian.
