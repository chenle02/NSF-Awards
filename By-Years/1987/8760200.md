Research in remote calibrations of electrical measurements and remote
identification of defective instruments is proposed in response to the electric
power industry's need for an efficient and less costly methodology. Power system
reliability and economy of operation requires accurate measurements of current,
voltage, real and reactive power. Typically, the number of measurements is in
the thousands. The primary sensors, transducers, and other instruments in the
measurement streams are subject to drift and deterioration with time,
temperature and environment. They need periodic inspections and calibrations.
The proposed research would attempt to replace the present procedure where
individual instruments, rather than the resulting measurements, are periodically
inspected and calibrated on locations by field calibrating equipment, a process
which is: labor intensive, untimely, introduces its own errors, and interferes
with normal operation of the power system. The proposed research has the
potential of remotely identifying defective instruments and remotely calibrating
measurements, thus drastically reducing the effort required in the periodic
inspection of several thousands of instruments spread over a wide area, and
significantly improving the quality of measurements needed for power system
operation.
