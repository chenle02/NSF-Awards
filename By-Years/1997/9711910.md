Superconducting microwave devices are posed for entry into the
telecommunications markets. A combined experimental and theoretical research
program will be undertaken to market. A combined experimental and theoretical
research program will be undertaken to study the microwave response of high Tc
superconductors in superconducting circuits. The proposed activities will impact
a nascent technology by providing a database of materials parameters, and new
circuits and systems realizations.
