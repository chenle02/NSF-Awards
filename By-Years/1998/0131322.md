The emphasis of this work is two fold: 1) development of new photochemical
reactions and 2) the theoretical as well as experimental understanding of
mechanisms of organic photoreactions. On the synthetic organic photochemistry
side, several new photochemical rearrangement reactions will be explored as well
as some new heterocyclic photochemistry that should lead to a photochemical
beta-lactam synthesis. Host-guest or solid state photoreactions which occur
within a crystal lattice will continue to be explored. Three different
theoretical methods for predicting and modelling organic photochemical processes
will also be studied.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Howard E. Zimmerman of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Wisconsin. Dr. Zimmerman will explore new organic photochemical
reactions and work to theoretically predict and model the outcomes of existing
photochemical reactions. The photochemical reactions studied will serve as the
foundation for new synthetic organic procedures and thus have potential
applications for the preparation of antibiotics (particularly the heterocyclic
photochemistry to be studied) and other pharmaceuticals. Students educated
during the course of this work will be broadly trained in theoretical and
experimental organic chemistry and preparative photochemistry and gain skills
needed by the pharmaceutical industry.
