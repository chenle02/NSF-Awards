In recent years, work in persistent data structures had yielded interesting
algorithms with applications to many areas of practical interest. Techniques
have been given for making classes of data structures persistent, and an
important underlying problem, the order maintenance problem (OMP), has been
discovered and solved. This project explores ways to improve existing
algorithms. The elimination of amortization in list labeling and in general
persistence techniques, and the development of an optimal algorithm for a
generalization of OMP are two parties. The hope is that this new algorithm will
be useful in a practical as well as in a theoretical sense. In addition, the
project explores lower bound problems associated with persistent data
structures. These lower bounds will confirm that existing algorithms are in some
ways optimal. and many produce proof techniques applicable to other data
structure problems.
