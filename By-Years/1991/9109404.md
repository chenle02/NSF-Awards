This project addresses the design, development, and implementation of a new
approach to sensitivity analysis in the context of linear programming (LP) that
does not require the knowledge of an optimal basis. The main application of this
sensitivity analysis approach is in the context of interior point methods. Range
analysis is the main emphasis of this research project. Parametric analysis is
also discussed and serves to motivate the approach to range analysis. The
approach is based on a new view of the parametric linear programming problem
developed by Adler and Monteiro. A new interpretation for ranges of the cost and
right hand side coefficients is given and it is shown that the computation of
the ranges for the LP problem reduces to the estimation of optimal values of
certain LP subproblems. Two major tasks are involved in this research. The first
is to understand the affect of degeneracy. The second is to develop efficient
ways of estimating the optimal values for the subproblems. This project promises
to enhance (and possibly change) our understanding of LP sensitivity analysis.
