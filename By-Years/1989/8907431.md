This award provides funds to the University of Texas Medical Branch at
Galveston for the purchase of 15 items of equipment to be used for core
laboratories doing DNA and protein sequencing, tissue culture work and
densitometry. These labs will provide research services and training to
researchers using molecular techniques to study a variety of biological
problems. These include enzymes and peptides involved in the nervous system, the
mechanism of action of steroids and of protein hormones at the gene and at the
cell membrane, antigenic variability in bacteria, and mitochondrial gene
regulation. The rapid advance of our understanding of a variety of biological
processes has been due in no small part to the development of sophisticated
instruments for the purification and analysis of nucleic acids and proteins. The
equipment purchased through this award will enable a large group of
investigators with diverse interests to pursue a variety of projects concerned
with the action of hormones, with the regulation of cell growth and function,
and with other aspects of the control of gene activity. The rates of progress on
these projects and the experimental skill of the various investigators, their
associates and their students will be augmented by the equipping of core
facilities made possible through this award.
