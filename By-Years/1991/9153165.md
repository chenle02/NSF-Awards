Scientific psychology has grown and produced a number of discrete domains of
research. Although the Psychology Department offers courses that cover these
domains adequately, there are presently no laboratory sections which accompany
any of its upper-level courses. In response to the growing need to introduce
further experience in empirical, quantitative analysis of behavior, the
Psychology Department is presently making changes that permit the addition of
laboratory courses that expand on the foundations developed in the lower-level
Experimental Psychology course. The additional laboratory courses in learning
and Physiological Psychology will allow the Department to better utilize its
faculty members and existing equipment.Laboratories in Learning and
Physiological Psychology often involve special techniques that require
supportive equipment and instruments for their methods and procedures. If this
equipment is acquired, it would allow the Department to satisfy increasing
student demand for laboratory experience in scientific aspects of psychology.
