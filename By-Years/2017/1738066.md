The National Academies' Board on Mathematical Sciences and Analytics (BMSA)
provides a broad interface between the research enterprise and federal agencies
that rely on the mathematical sciences. The Board provides objective and
authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics,
operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk
analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of
national importance. Over its nearly 33 years of existence, the BMSA has
produced 81 reports. Through its work, the Board strengthens the policymaking
process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical
sciences; and identifies growth areas for the
discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board provides objective and authoritative
advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations
research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis,
systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national
importance. It consists of pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative
fields with experience in academia, industry, government, and national
laboratories. Board members carry out their work by identifying important steps
of value to federal agencies and the mathematical sciences, and then recruiting
leading mathematical scientists to participate in workshops, studies, and other
activities focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.
