Due to the disparate nature of environmental conditions in oceanic and
freshwater systems, the characteristics of these environments strongly influence
total population structure of species with plastic life history patterns. To
conduct meaningful research on these processes, it is essential to identify
which life history stages and/or environmental events are significant. The
Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) is characterized by a variety of
morphological types. These morphs appear to be reflect differences in
environmental conditions. This project will investigate the relationships
between morph, growth and environmental history. This research will apply novel
analytic techniques to evaluate the periods in the life history of the Arctic
charr. The otoliths of fish have incorporated within their structural and
chemical components a large amount of life history and physiological
information. Age, growth rate and environmental perturbations will be determined
from otolith microstructure, while environmental trends in the history of an
individual will be determined through elemental composition analyses of
otoliths. The result of these investigations will be a comprehensive and
detailed understanding of physiologically and ecologically induced changes in
otolith microstructure and chemical composition. This knowledge is vital to an
understanding of the processes foundational to adaptable life history patterns
and should make it possible to link growth and migration to nutritional and
environmental occurrences.
