The purpose of this project is the construction of an inexpensive but powerful
parallel computing environment that will allow the physics department of
Mansfield University to introduce advanced topics in physics to undergraduate
students in a special course using large scale simulations of physical systems.
The students will be able to perform computer experiments on realistic models
and will be introduced to the basics of computational physics using a parallel
machine. In particular the computer system proposed will have the following
characteristics: (1) High computing power at a very modest cost, that will allow
them to simulate realistic physical models. (2) A true parallel environment with
extensive use of parallel languages and hardware. (3) The possibility of
expansion by adding extra processing units to the system, and a flexible
parallel geometry that allows easy modifications. The equipment consists of a
small network of transputers controlled by an inexpensive PC-type host computer.
It will allow students in a course in computational physics not only to deal
with serious problems in several areas of physics but to gain familiarity with
some of the parallel computational techniques and to do experiments in a true
laboratory for computational physics. The university will match the award with
an equal amount of funds.
