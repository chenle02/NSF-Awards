The objectives of this work are two fold. Professor Stewart first proposes to
use metabolically active but nongrowing E. coli cells to effect stereoselective
organic functional group reduction reactions. E. coli cells will first be
engineered to produce yeast reductases with desirable properties then quantities
of the desired cells will be grown and used to effect syntheses of
enantiomerically enriched, biologically relevant targets. The principal
investigator will then investigate NADPH-dependent enzyme reactions again using
nongrowing E. coli cells with the aim of developing whole cells capable of
effecting either oxidation or reduction reactions depending on the amount of
NAD/NADPH present.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
the research of Dr. Jon D. Stewart of the Department of Chemistry at the
University of Florida. Dr. Stewart will work on the development of E. coli cells
capable of catalyzing a number of chemical reactions. This group will explore
stereoselective reduction reactions using enzymes contained in these whole
cells. These reduction reactions produce molecules which are chiral (have two
nonsuperimposable mirror images) and make only one of the two possible forms (a
single enantiomer). Development of this family of reactions is one of the most
important problems facing the pharmaceutical industry today. When developed, Dr.
Stewart's work could be applied to the environmentally friendly syntheses of a
number of biologically active molecules. Students trained during the course of
this work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical industry which now
produces a number of single enantiomer compounds.
