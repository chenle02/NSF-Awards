This is a project in the area of mathematics called number theory. Professor
Katz will investigate varieties defined over finite fields, in particular their
cohomology and the distribution of the zeros of L functions on such varieties.

This is a project in the area of mathematics called number theory. The main
focus of this project can be described as the study of certain kinds of
solutions to polynomial equations called "modular solutions." Many of the
applications computer scientists have for number theory involve these kinds of
solutions. Professor Katz is considering questions involving the number of such
solutions, how this number changes as the polynomials change, and how the
solution sets of different polynomials are related.
