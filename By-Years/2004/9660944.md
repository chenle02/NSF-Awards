This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and market
a long span, advanced composite material (ACM), structural system for use in
pedestrian and vehicle bridge and building applications. A state of the art
pultrusion process will be assembled, including use of resin-injection/air
evacuation equipment and computerized numerically controlled (CNC) machining, to
achieve this long span system. Carbon and aramid fibers will be incorporated
into the E-glass matrix to increase strength and stiffness of the advanced
composite material. Custom profiles will be designed using this new material. A
successful Phase I effort will lead to full scale testing of this new building
system in Phase II. Commercial applications will include long span pedestrian
and vehicle bridges, long span building components for roofs and canopy type
applications, and long span industrial support structures.
