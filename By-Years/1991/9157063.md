Supported by a grant under the Presidential Young Investigator program,
theoretical and modeling research will be conducted on various aspects of two
phase flow. Initial focus will be on interfacial instability in co extrusion of
immiscible viscoelastic liquids, numerical simulation of water lubricated
pipeline transport of heavy viscous liquids, and buckling instabilities between
co flowing liquids. The modeling will permit increased realism and accuracy in
the prediction of multilayer polymer processing, transport of crude oil, and
other two phase engineering flow systems.
