This project is directed at the properties of weak coupling effects in
superconductors, with emphasis on glassy superconductive behavior, vortex
pinning, and chaos. Two categories of experiments are planned. The first
involves measurements of the dynamical properties of superconducting arrays of
Josephson and proximity effect junctions. In this context, superconducting
arrays are model systems that display many of the features of granular
superconducting films, with the advantage of accurate characterization at the
microscopic level. The other category of experiments involves measurements of
vortex and flux pinning effects in two-dimensional In/InOx films and three-
dimensional samples of high Tc superconductors.
