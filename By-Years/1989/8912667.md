This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will
establish a differential equations and applied mathematics group to develop
multidimensional approximations and attractor dimension calculations including
the study off low stability and equations of water waves. The project will
emphasize studies on nonlinear differential equations and applications and fluid
dynamics and water waves. Some effort will focus on improving and expanding
computer facilities to strengthen graphics capabilities. This powerful tool will
allow detailed examination of the behavior of a solution near a critical point.
Graphical solutions of problems would permit investigators to formulate
appropriate conjectures that can be proven by employing other methods. This
comprehensive approach to merge numerical computations and graphics display will
significantly increase the research capability of a predominantly minority
institution. The principal investigator and senior staff are well-trained and
have published widely in refereed journals. Faculty and students involved with
this project will have their knowledge of numerical calculations increased
significantly.
