9604225 McCammon The assembly of a functional mitochondrion requires coordinated
input from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Of these systems, the
nuclear genome controls mitochondrial structure and replication, and it
contributes over ninety percent of the organellar proteins. It is therefore
essential to understand the processes whereby nuclear-encoded proteins are
synthesized in the cytosol, targeted to mitochondria, translocated across the
membranes, and assembled into functional oligomeric complexes. These processes
are best understood in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the model of
choice for the study of mitochondrial biogenesis. This project focuses on the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase
(NAD-IDH). NAD-IDH has several special features that reveal unique functions for
this protein beyond its catalytic role in the TCA cycle. First, NAD - IDH binds
to mitochondrially-encoded mRNAs in vitro and appears to regulate mitochondrial
protein translation. Second, the loss of NAD-IDH can be partially overcome by
genetic defects in TCA cycle and other oxidative functions. Finally, distinct
alterations in TCA cycle proteins are observed in mutants lacking NAD-IDH,
suggesting a role for this enzyme in regulating TCA cycle function or
organization. This project will test the hypothesis that NAD-IDH plays a unique
role in regulating TCA cycle function and assembly and that NAD-IDH exerts these
extra-catalytic functions through physical interactions with other components of
the TCA cycle metabolic complex. The experimental system will utilize yeast
strains with defined alterations in TCA cycle genes to study the extra-catalytic
functions of NAD-IDH. Modulation of NAD-IDH function, assembly and localization
will be used to assay several critical features of TCA cycle function, such as
gene expression, protein stability, and organization within the mitochondrion.
One of the main functions of mitochondria is to provide chemical energ y for the
rest of the cell. The TCA cycle, which is a complex of eight interdependent
enzymes, plays an essential role in this process. It is therefore important to
understand how the TCA cycle functions and how it is regulated. Because of
insights gained through yeast genetic manipulations, it has been proposed that
one of these enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase, plays a unique role in
regulating the function, assembly and organization of the TCA cycle. This
project will utilize several approaches to define these new roles for isocitrate
dehydrogenase within mitochondria. These studies will yield new insight into how
enzyme complexes are organized and how they function in living cells.
