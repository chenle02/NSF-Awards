A Research Initiation Award will support a study of the electrochemical
synthesis of metal-matrix composites. Emphasis will be on room temperature
process conditions which result in fully dense, near-net and complex-shaped
monolithic and fiber reinforced composites. An analytical model will be
developed and validated by experimental observation of structure-property-
processing interrelationships.
