Regulation of flower maturation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is to study
mechanisms by which flowers mature in the model plant Arabidopsis. Mutant plants
deficient in two transcriptional regulators called ARF6 and ARF8 have flowers
that arrest their growth at an immature stage, and these flowers therefore
remain as closed buds that are infertile. Low light conditions also cause arrest
at a similar stage, suggesting that light might regulate flower maturation
through ARF6 and ARF8. To explore in mechanistic detail how flower maturation is
regulated, Dr. Reed will first establish precise light conditions that allow us
to control flower maturation. He will then examine how these light conditions
affect abundance of ARF6 and ARF8 proteins, and expression of the genes encoding
them. Finally, he will examine the role of a naturally occurring small RNA
molecule called miR167 (micro-RNA 167) that is predicted to regulate ARF6 and
ARF8 translation or transcript stability. H e will measure the level of miR167
under various light conditions, examine in which tissues it is active against a
reporter gene construct, and determine the effect on flower maturation of
overproducing miR167 or of rendering ARF6 immune to its activity. Genes closely
related to ARF6, ARF8, and miR167 are present in monocots, so the regulatory
mechanisms revealed in these studies may be common to all flowering plants.
Understanding these mechanisms may allow manipulation or improvement of crops
with edible flower buds such as broccoli or cloves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
