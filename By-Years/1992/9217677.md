These funds support a three year effort to develop low-noise cryogenic
transistor amplifiers for use in millimeter wavelength radio astronomy.
Transistor amplifiers offer a number of significant advantages for radio
astronomical systems, including very low (Tn < 65 K SSB) noise, large (10 - 20
GHz) instantaneous bandwidth, single sideband system operation without input
filters, and good stability. There are additional virtues of particular
importance for focal plane array systems. Such systems are relatively non-
critical in terms of operating temperature and other conditions and they are
well-adapted to reproduction in the quantities required for arrays. No
mechanical adjustments are required for optimum performance. Projections for the
performance of HEMT amplifiers in the 3 mm band are receiver noise temperatures
below 65 K (single sideband), which should yield atmospheric- limited
performance at most frequencies. The large bandwidth will facilitate searches
for multiple spectral lines over a large frequency range as well as for emission
from galaxies having unknown velocities. Presently available devices offer
extremely low noise performance in the 40 - 50 GHz range, which is where initial
efforts will be directed. Within two years, devices with comparable performance
in the 3 mm wavelength range should be obtainable.
