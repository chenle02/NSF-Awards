Abstract ATM-9410491 Liu, Kam-biu Louisiana State University-Baton Rouge Title:
Long-term Dynamics of the SW Indian Monsoon: New High- resolution Paleoclimatic
Data from Tibet This award supports a U.S.-China collaborative project to
produce several new high-resolution paleoclimatic records from the Tibetan
Plateau for the last 20,000 years. These records are vital to an understanding
of the long-term dynamics of the SW Indian monsoon, which is an important
component of the global climate system. This effort will reconstruct the
climatic and vegetational history of the Tibetan Plateau by means of pollen,
isotopic, and paleolimnological studies and AMS-dating of sediment cores to be
retrieved from small lakes in the southeastern part of Tibet, a region of steep
climatic and vegetation gradients. These high- resolution paleoclimatic records
will be used to clear up disagreements between the few existing Tibetan Plateau
records, and to test a number of hypotheses.
