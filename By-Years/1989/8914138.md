It is known that orography exerts an important influence on atmospheric
motions. It is considered to be crucial that the effects of mountains be
properly included in numerical prediction models whether they focus on climate,
synoptic, regional or local weather. In previous research the Principal
Investigator has been instrumental in advancing fundamental knowledge of flow
around mountains. The Principal Investigator will continue this line of research
using theoretical, numerical modelling and observational studies. A major focus
will be to construct a "regime" diagram which will relate flow characteristics
around mountains to the physical characteristics of the mountain and the
environmental flow.
