9612365 Mistree This award provides funding for the research on and
implementation of a method for determining initial, top-level specifications of
designed-to-order and made-to-order systems such as aircraft, ships, and
aircraft engines. The approach will focus on the delineation of regions of
design configurations that satisfy design goals but that retain freedom in the
design until sufficient information is obtained to pick a single configuration
for further design definition. The research approach will bring together
existing analysis tools and robust design principles, generally implemented only
in later design stages, and incorporate them in the early stages of a product
realization time line. Effective application of these tools will be achieved
through the integration and implementation of experimental and statistical
techniques (design of experiments, analysis of variance, and response surface
methodology) and robust design techniques. If successful, the results of this
research will enable designers to explore and identify many alternative design
configurations and subsequently focus on a single configuration for further
analysis and delineation. The resulting method should facilitate cost-effective
studies associated with (1) comprehensive design (design from a
multidisciplinary, systems perspective), (2) robust design (designs that are
relatively insensitive to changes along a product realization time line), (3)
flexible design (allow relatively small changes to be examined inexpensively),
(4) modifiable design (allow designs to be adapted to large changes in overall
requirements cost-effectively). The capability to perform such studies in the
early stages of a product realization time line should be of value to both the
commercial and defense sectors of US industry.
