Research on mass media systems in hazard and disaster situations is underway.
The major research objectives of the project include: developing an overall
profile of local mass communication systems before and after disasters, and
undertaking a systematic examination of newspaper, radio, and television outlets
by comparing their normal and emergency time organizational structures,
newsprocessing activities, and productions of content and analyzing short-run
and longer-term effects of the emergency experience. Data collected in the field
will be subjected to quantitative and other types of analyses. A plan to
facilitate the utilization of research results by planners and researchers has
been devised which includes holding a special workshop and preparing a document
aimed at practitioners as well as producing publications for scholarly journals.
