This three-year renewal will continue operation of the T-28 aircraft as a
national facility. The aircraft, maintained in a flight ready condition, will
support NSF-approved atmospheric research projects requiring the capability to
penetrate mature convective storms that may contain hail, lightning, intense
turbulence or heavy icing conditions. The agreement would provide for
management, staffing, operations, maintenance, testing and enhancements of the
T-28, as well as covering both the scientific and technical support for planning
and data reduction phases of field projects. Facility staff will contribute to
the scientific analysis from the data collected in field programs and publish
independent and joint research results.
