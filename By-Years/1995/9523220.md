9523220 Peck This research is to extend current models of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) detection cells to obtain a two order of magnitude improvement
in sensitivity. The current NMR spectroscope has limited application as a
detector for microseparations because of its relatively poor sensitivity. The
new cells will employ specially designed RF microcoils that will be used in
flowing analytical separation while retaining the full NMR capability for
structural determination. This enables the cells to analyze mass-limited and
volume-limited samples of chemical species. The overall goal of this research is
to create a new generation of optimized nanoliter volume NMR detection cells for
commercialization for liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis
microseparation studies.
