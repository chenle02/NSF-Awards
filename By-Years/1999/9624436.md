9624436 Toulouse This project employs Raman optical spectroscopy and neutron
spectroscopy as tools for the study of network topologies in glasses. The
research will study the variation of spectroscopic signatures from high
temperatures to low temperatures. Of particular interest is the onset of low
frequency dynamics at lower temperatures. In addition, tests will be made of the
spectroscopic predictions of several recent theories of the liquid-glass
transition. The glasses to be studied will have different fragility parameters
because of composition or as a result of imposed variations in hydrostatic
pressure. The project should lead to a better understanding of the relationship
between the topology of connected, random networks, and the strength of
individual bonds and vibrational dynamics. The research is fundamental in
character but the results are potentially of great practical interest because of
the many applications of amorphous and glass-like materials. %%% Amorphous
solids or glasses are challenging objects for study because of their complex
network structures. They are of great practical interest because of their many
commercial applications. Glasses have many properties that differ from those of
ordered crystals. This project will use spectroscopic techniques to study the
low frequency vibrational properties of glasses and to relate these measurements
to the structural conformation of the materials. Because the atomic structure of
the glass is formed at high temperatures and because the glass is a frozen
liquid, the transition from the liquid to the glass state will be followed as a
function of temperature - from high temperature to low temperatures. This should
lead to a better understanding of the vibrational dynamics of disordered
networks. The results should have general applicability to other more general
disordered networks such as the brain or as developed in economic models. ***
