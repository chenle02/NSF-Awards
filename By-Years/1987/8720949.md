The PI will provide new constraints on the strength and creep rheology of the
Earth's mantle by carrying out experiments on crystalline and amorphous minerals
at pressure-temperature conditions ranging up to 100 GPa and 5000K. Novel
experimental techniques developed in this laboratory during the past few years
now make such research possible. Results at room temperature already demonstrate
that rheology is significantly affected by pressure and by pressure-induced
transformations, both in crystalline and in metastable liquid (i.e., glassy)
phases. The work would provide the first experimental constraints on global
deformation processes, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of
the thermal, chemical, and geodynamic evolution of the Earth.
