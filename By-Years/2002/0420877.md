With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at James Madison University will acquire a chiro-optical
spectrophotometer. This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:
a) structural characterization of proteins; and b) the synthesis of natural
products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chiro-optical spectrophotometer will enhance
the education of the James Madison University students by increasing the amount
and quality of the research projects that can be offered for undergraduate
students. Additionally, it will allow faculty to introduce a number of advanced
spectroscopic techniques, such as circular dichroism and stopped-flow techniques
to the biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and biotechnology
laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
