OPP-9318533 Walsh The goal of this project is the implementation of a regional
model of the arctic atmosphere-land system for use in the Flux Study of the
ARCSS LAII (Land-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions) program. Specific objectives are
(1) to simulate the land-atmosphere interactions that control the hydrology and
the trace gas fluxes over the northern Alaskan region, and (2) to project
changes in the climate and surface forcing of this region. The atmospheric
simulations utilize the NCAR/Penn State mesocale analyses provide the lateral
forcing. The surface exchanges will draw upon a coupling to soil-vegetation and
hydrological models under development in other Flux Study projects. Mesoscale
topography, vegetation and soil data, also provided by other Flux Study
projects, will be incorporated into the model. The regional model provides
framework for the scaling-up of the Flux Study's plot, tower and aircraft
measurements of the surface fluxes. Finally, output from a global circulation
model will be used to drive the regional model in a series of greenhouse-induced
climate change experiments, thereby providing high-resolution scenarios of
regional climate change for assessments of future trace gas fluxes. ***
