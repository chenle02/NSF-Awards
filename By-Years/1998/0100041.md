0100041&lt;br/&gt;Perk and Au-Yang&lt;br/&gt;This is a research project for the
study of exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics, including the
integrable chiral Potts model and various Ising models. These models will be
studied by exact analytical and approximate numerical methods. Various physical
phenomena will be studied, such as critical phenomena in quasi-periodic or
aperiodic lattices, commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions, and
frustration. The impact of frustration on the wavevector-dependent
susceptibility will be analyzed by studying partially and fully frustrated
triangular or checkerboard Ising models. New algorithms for the susceptibility
series of planar Ising models, whose complexity grow polynomially, will be
developed and the resulting long series expansions will be analyzed to get a
better understanding of corrections to scaling. Many challenging problems
remaining to be solved within the integrable chiral Potts model, such as the
magnetization, spin-spin and energy-energy correlations. By its very nature,
this project also involves several areas of mathematics of current interest.
