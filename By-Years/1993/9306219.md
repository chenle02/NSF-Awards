Theoretical research will be conducted on complex fluids, fluids characterized
by components which tend to self-assemble, and are therefore characterized by
several different lengths. The first of these fluids to be investigated is the
ternary mixture of oil, water and amphiphile which produces a uniform,
structured fluid in which oil and water are solubilized but separated by sheets
of amphiphile; a microemulsion. Among the properties to be studied are the
behavior in a confined geometry, the low interfacial tension brought about
between oil and water, the elastic properties of the amphiphile sheets, and the
evolution of this phase into the sponge phase. The second complex fluid to be
studied consists of polymers. The ability of a block copolymer in a ternary
mixture to act as a compatibilizer of homopolymers will be examined. %%%
Theoretical research will be conducted on two classes of complex fluids. These
are fluids which have a number of interacting components which produce
interesting, and often important, physical properties. Examples of complex
fluids include liquid crystals, microemulsions, biopolymers and polymers.
Besides offering fundamental challenges in condensed matter physics, these
materials all have important practical applications.
