This award supports approximately 20 US-based students to attend the 2012 USENIX
Security Symposium, the premier forum for advanced professionals from academic
and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the newest advances in the
security of computer systems and networks. Participation in Security 12 and
similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school
experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more
senior researchers in the field and exposes students to leading work in the
field. This award will enable students to participate who would otherwise be
unable to attend the conference. Security 12 will be held August 8-10, 2012, in
Bellevue, WA. The conference will consist of a three-day technical program, with
numerous workshops co-located. The goal of the conference is to bring together
researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and
others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and
networks. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for
student participation, and this event has always drawn a large number of student
attendees. Students receiving assistance will be strongly encouraged to present
posters and works in progress as part of the selection process.
