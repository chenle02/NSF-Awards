The nature of the coronal magnetic field is of central importance to the
understanding and prediction of solar flares. The coronal magnetic field,
however, cannot be measured directly. It is proposed to develop and apply a new
method for computing the force-free coronal field from the photospheric magnetic
field, as measured by a vector magnetograph. The coronal field is obtained by
solving the nonlinear force-free equation (with non-constant alpha). The
proposed algorithm employs a novel formulation of the force-free problem in
which the field is evolved from a potential field to a force-free field which
satisfies the observed boundary data. The field is required to satisfy boundary
conditions on the magnetic flux and the normal component of the electric current
density at the boundary. It is planned to study the practical considerations
involved in the application of the method to necessarily imperfect magnetograph
data, using the Stokes Polarimeter and the Imaging Vector Magnetograph at Mees
Solar Observatory, University of Hawaii.
