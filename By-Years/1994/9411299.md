This project - the Informedial Project - establishes a large on- line digital
video library by developing intelligent, automatic mechanisms to populate the
library which allows for full content- and knowledge-based search and retrieval
via desktop computer and metropolitan area networks. The distinguishing feature
of the technical approach is the integrated application of speech, language and
image understanding technologies for efficient creation (acquisition,
recognition, segmentation, and indexing) and exploration (query, search,
retrieval, and display) of the library. Also, a network billing server will be
implemented to study the economics of charging strategies and incorporate
mechanisms to ensure privacy and security.
