Wilson: OPP 9615639 Bell: OPP 9615773 Finn: OPP 9618568 Abstract This award
supports an investigation of the structure of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM)
in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The regional architecture of a key
segment of the TAM - West Antarctic rift system boundary will be mapped to help
resolve outstanding questions about the evolution of the TAM in southern
Victoria Land. This collaborative research program will integrate new
aeromagnetic data, to be acquired by a cooperative U.S.-German field campaign,
with satellite imagery, geological and structural mapping, and existing ground-
based, airborne, and marine geophysical data. This integrated data base will be
used to map large-scale structural elements of the crust of the TAM and adjacent
ice-covered regions. The first large-scale structural framework for the TAM rift
accommodation zone in southern Victoria Land will be generated by this program.
This framework will be used to test hypotheses for the geometry of the TAM rift
flank, the kinematic and dynamic history of the rift boundary, the patterns of
magmatism during Jurassic and Cenozoic rift development, the geometry of the
early Paleozoic convergent Ross orogen margin, and the role of this ancestral
margin in Mesozoic-Cenozoic rift-flank development. Resolution of these issues
will contribute significantly to understanding the tectonic development of the
region.
