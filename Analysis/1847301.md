Fractals and self-similar structures permeate the physical word, from
statistical mechanics to material sciences. This project seeks to analyze how
some fundamental physical objects interact with fractal structures. For
instance, suppose we know that a field associated to a body in space (for
instance its gravitational field) is well-behaved (say, has bounded magnitude),
then what can we infer about the geometry of the body? Does the condition upon
the field preclude the surface of the body from having a fractal type structure?
A second topic considered concerns understanding signals whose frequencies have
a self-similar or fractal behavior. More precisely, one is interested in the
extent to which the signal can be reconstructed uniquely from a "small" set of
values. The principal investigator (PI) will incorporate both graduate and
undergraduate students into the research program, training them for future
careers in STEM fields. The PI will organize annual undergraduate research
symposia that will bring together undergraduate students interested in
mathematical research across southeastern states to present their undergraduate
research, build a network with others interested in pursuing research in the
mathematical sciences, and provide information about research opportunities at
the graduate level.

This project concerns the analysis of operators when the geometry underlying the
problem is rough or fractal in nature. The first question considered is: What
can be deduced about a measure from the knowledge that a Calderon-Zygmund
operator associated to it is bounded? Under these circumstances, can the measure
have a fractal structure, or must its support be contained in (a countable
number of) Lipschitz submanifolds of appropriate dimension? This basic question
in analysis has found applications in the calculus of variations, the study of
free boundaries, and the geometry of harmonic measure. Despite intense study
over the last thirty years, the tools that serve as a bridge from the analytic
condition on the field to the geometric structure of the measure are currently
underdeveloped, something that this proposal aims to rectify. The second
question is: How sparse must the support of the Fourier transform of a function
be to ensure that the function can be uniquely reconstructed by its values on a
"thick" subset? Although this question is a classical form of the uncertainty
principle, it is not yet well understood, especially in several dimensions.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
