With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the
Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), Professor Lisa
Holland of West Virginia University is developing new materials for protein
separations to elucidate the subtle changes in biomolecules for applications
ranging from screening enzyme inhibition to identifying post-translational
protein modifications. To meet this challenge, self-tuning phospholipid
nanophases are adapted to sort, screen, or identify specific properties of
biomolecules. The broader impacts are addressed through the support of the
professional development of chemistry graduate students who participate in
innovative and interdisciplinary research experiences earning PhD degrees and
ultimately entering the workforce with the ability to work across scientific
disciplines. The award also supports an outreach activity to personalize
chemistry experiences and to increase public science literacy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focusses on thermally reversible phospholipid
nanophases that have high utility as a chemical sieving agent and as a viscosity
additive to exploit shape-based differences in frictional drag. Various
additives to tune protein selectivity are examined. The project establishes the
conditions and fundamental properties of the nanophases for protein sieving and
multifunctional separations. An outreach program developed by Professor Holland
at area schools enables teachers to incorporate low-cost microscale experiments
into introductory chemistry education. The products are made accessible to other
teachers by documenting inexpensive device design, engaging educational
suppliers, developing the curriculum, and reporting the educational assessment.
