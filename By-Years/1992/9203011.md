This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program supports research in
chemistry to be conducted by Dr. Willie L. Hinze of Wake Forest University and
Dr. Frank H. Quina of the Universidade de Sao Paulo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The
projected research will provide a better understanding of micelle-like polymeric
systems and could lead to the development of new mobile/stationary phases for
chromatographic separation of optically active compounds. The research will
focus on the preparation and characterization of chiral and non-chiral ionene
surfactants and the evaluation of their ability to function as chromatographic
mobile or stationary phases. The ability of these systems to catalyze important
chromatographic detection reactions, which would permit enhanced detection in
TLC/HPLC, will be evaluated. The project will couple the talents of Dr. Hinze as
an analytical chemist with the physical chemistry expertise of his Brazilian
counterpart. ***//
