This project builds on the previously granted NSF collaborative computer
calculus project. It will further enhance the student experience by: (1) Adding
physics and chemistry projects throughout the calculus sequence, and into
precalculus, and differential equations; (2) Adding computer science projects to
the discrete mathematics and pre-calculus courses; (3) Using the portfolio
product mode in the physics, chemistry and computer science courses. The use of
portfolios as an assessment tool will produce a product of national importance.
The interplay in this project between mathematics and the sciences -- physics,
chemistry, and computer science -- will create an educational environment that
emphasizes the interconnection of scientific knowledge in order to prepare
students more effectively for the future. Students will be introduced to state-
of-the-art technology including CD-ROM, and the creation of three dimensional
animations of functions using MAPLE or similar software. An end product of this
project will be a faculty manual, Portfolios Across Scientific Disciplines.
