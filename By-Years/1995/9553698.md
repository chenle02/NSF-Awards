Regional Technology Strategies, Inc. proposes to design, support and implement,
in partnership with the American Association of Community Colleges, National
Association of Manufacturers, and the Southern Growth Policies Board, two major
symposia, one in the South and the other in the Northeast that will focus on how
two-year educational institutions can better meet the technical skill needs of
modern, high value, high performance manufacturers. The proposed symposia are
intended to inform education and training policy makers about changes and
opportunities in technical occupations in advanced manufacturing, to deepen
their understanding of the emerging industrial modernization system, to identify
obstacles and opportunities to improve performance, and to develop a clear
vision of how to make those improvements. Those invited will include presidents
of member colleges, chancellors of state systems, and directors of state
modernization programs, school-to-work transition programs, and economic
development agencies. Each chancellor will be asked to submit names of others,
e.g., presidents, legislators, board members, to be invited from their
respective states. The host organizations in the South will be the Consortium
for Manufacturing Competitiveness, a group of leading technical colleges started
and incubated by the Governors and legislators of the southern states under the
Southern Growth Policies Board and, in the Northeast, a new alliance of college
systems. The objective of each is to accelerate and support industrial
modernization with improved technical education and services that build demand
for and help small and medium sized manufacturers better utilize technical
skills
