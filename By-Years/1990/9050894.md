Students in college algebra, trigonometry, and calculus are experimenting with a
new computerized learning environment based on a software package called
MATHPERT, which is running on computers using the MS-DOS operating system. The
system guides and helps students produce solutions to problems and decides how
much help is needed based on the student's previous performance. The institution
will contribute an amount equal to the award.//
