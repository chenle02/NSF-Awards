9612352 Rajurkar Sometimes the best or only alternative to processing complex or
intricate shapes in advanced and difficult to machine materials is by electrical
discharge machining (EDM). However, state of the art EDM equipment cannot
economically produce many complex cavities, threaded or twisted surfaces
characteristic of airfoils, and is not designed for integration into new
generations of agile manufacturing systems. This project will develop a new
computer numerical controlled (CNC) six degree of freedom EDM system capable of
producing complex cavities. The six degree of freedom device will use a
specially designed three axis CNC tooling unit mounted on a commercial three
axis CNC-EDM. In addition to the articulation provided by this design, this new
machine's controller will incorporate the investigator's research results for
EDM gap monitoring, six axis CNC interpolation, and motion generation for
conjugate machining and complex shape generation. The prototype machine will be
a major leap forward in the technology of EDM tools; capable of ready
integration into agile manufacturing systems for producing complex shapes in
high performance alloys. This project will advance the science and technology of
EDM process tools, and it will help U.S. producers and users of precision EDM
advance their manufacturing base.
