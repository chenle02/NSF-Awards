This research applies the technique of competitive analysis, originally
developed to study on-line algorithms, to the design of algorithms for
distributed systems with unpredictable failures. Competitive analysis compares
the performance of an algorithm with that of an optimal ``off-line'' algorithm
designer in effect to predict the future. Using it, an algorithm designer can
avoid the perils of designing for the worst case (yielding algorithms too
inefficient under milder conditions to be practical) or for a normal case that
may turn out to have little correspondence with reality. (1) The first task of
the project is to formulate performance measures for distributed algorithms that
are amenable to competitive analysis (the surprising difficulty of this task may
explain why previous applications of competitive analysis to distributed
problems have largely concentrated on the on-line aspects of those problems).
(2) The second is to construct distributed algorithms that perform well by the
competitive measures. By implementing these algorithms it is possible to test
that the measures do in fact predict good real-world performance. This work will
yield both insights into the theory of distributed algorithms and better
practical algorithms for the distributed system builder.
