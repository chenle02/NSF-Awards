The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses
on developing an understanding of the fundamental aspects and capabilities of
the scanning tunneling microscope. The work promises to exploit important new
applications for this powerful instrument capable of obtaining striking images
of individual atoms and molecules. An extremely stable ultra-high vacuum
scanning tunneling microscope operating at 4K, equipped with a wide range of
surface science facilities, will be used to try to study the vibrational spectra
of single molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces using inelastic electron
tunneling spectroscopy. A second instrument, designed to operate over a
temperature range of 4K to 150K, will be used to study site-to-site hopping
rates of thermally activated diffusion of adsorbates. These studies promise to
provide some of the best atomic and molecular pictures available, provide a
unique combination with existing surface science methods, lead to an
understanding of the bonding of molecules at specific surface sites, and enhance
our understanding of surface diffusion.
