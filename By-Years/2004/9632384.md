Illinois University at Carbondale Title: Dual pressure discharge for non-thermal
plasma at atmosperic pressure Abstract In this research a novel discharge for
the production of non-thermal plasmas in air at atmospheric pressures will be
investigated. The design consists of two dielectric barrier discharges separated
by a UV transparent dielectric. The UV photons pre-ionizes the pressure chamber.
The resulting Avalanches in the high pressure region produce a diffused
(Townsend-like) discharge. The UV irradiation is timed and efficiently coupled
to the atmospheric pressure discharge. The eventual application of this research
is in air pollution control. The electrical properties of the discharge (onset
voltage, power, average current, etc.) will be characterized for this goal. The
OH radical production, which is thought to be the most important radical for
oxidation applications, will be investigated using laser induced fluorescence in
an air discharge; and the dual pressure discharge will be investigated for its
potential to remove SO2 by oxidation in a coal combustion flue gas.
