ABSTRACT CTS-9618190 A model of the gas-phase chemistry relevant to silane
(SiH4) combustion is developed. An elementary chemical mechanism describing the
silicon/hydrogen/oxygen system is generated. The model is verified by comparison
with existing experimental data and by an experimental study of silica (SiO2)
formation in a laboratory-scale synthesis flame. Large quantities of silane
fuels are used to provide silica for the fabrication of microchips and fiber
optics. These applications require high-purity, low-defect material; meeting
these requirements demands knowledge of the detailed gas-phase chemistry leading
to formation of silica.
