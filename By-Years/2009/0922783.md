Regret is a decision-related emotion that arises when a chosen outcome is, or is
believed to be, worse than a non-chosen alternative. The experience of regret
has been linked to important real-life decisions such as health behaviors and
financial decisions. The behavioral consequences of regret include both risk
aversion and risk taking, decision avoidance, and non-optimal decision making.
Moreover, enduring negative emotions like regret may have a negative impact on
psychological and physical health. Thus, understanding how and why we experience
regret and how regret influences choices and behaviors are important research
questions. Previous research on regret has, however, to a large extent relied on
younger participants and to date little is known about how and if the experience
and anticipation of regret changes over the adult life-span.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;This project uses both experimental and field studies to address how
regret and the behavioral consequences of regret change with aging. Older adults
are asked to make an increasing number of decisions and the older population is
rapidly growing. Identifying how older adults? decision making differ from
younger adults may help in designing information and decision aids tailored to
older adults? abilities.
