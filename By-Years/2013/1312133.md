This 3 year project was initially submitted to the ITEST program, but was deemed
more appropriate to the DRK-12 assessment strand. The project seeks to develop
diagnostic assessments to identify specific statistical misconceptions (datasets
as entities, comparing datasets, and overreliance on the mean procedure),
teacher tutorials to bolster and reinforce teachers? understandings of these
concepts and misconceptions, activities to engage students in applications of
statistical reasoning including supplemental activities for individualized
instruction, and an efficacy trial to evaluate the effect of the resources on
students? knowledge and affect in statistics. They will use cognitive labs to
address validity and a randomized control trial to address initial efficacy.
Teacher pre-activity tutorials and student activities will be made freely and
publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
