9457485 Khammash The research plan involves the creation and development of new
analytical and computational tools for the analysis and synthesis of control
systems in the presence of modeling uncertainty. Another goal is to develop new
robustness tools suitable for handling more refined models of uncertainty and
disparate performance objectives. The research will address the robustness
issues specific to particular application areas such as power systems and
compressor control systems. The design of power systems stabilizers, high
voltage direct current modulation, and static VAR compensators will be
investigated. ***
