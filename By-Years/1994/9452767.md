ABSTRACT 9452767 Sadler This proposal is to research, develop, and test six
modules based on engineering projects for middle school students. These
materials aim at inclusion in introductory physical science courses, but may
also be used for general science and after-school or other informal teaching
situations. Topics include mechanics, electricity, and chemistry. A team of
experienced middle school physical science and technology education teachers,
research engineers, and scientists produce effective, up-to-date, activity-
based, middle school physical science materials dealing with "designing to
constraints." The materials are evaluated to determine their effect on students'
involvement and interest in pursuing technical careers as well as changes in
their aonceptual understanding and science process skills. A particular focus of
the evaluation is the impact of the project strategies on urban underrepresented
minorities and girls, many of whom have little experience with, or show fear of,
mechanical devices. Dissemination is through a series of summer institutes,
workshops at teacher conferences, and journal articles. A commercial publisher
is to market the product.
