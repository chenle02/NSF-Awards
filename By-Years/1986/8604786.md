An analytical microdensitometer will be acquired to quantitatively measure a
variety of reaction products visualized in microscopic sections of biological
tissues. The machine is to be applied to a number of projects: 1) Changes in
enzyme levels in ovarian cells as a result of exposure to tetrahydrocannabinol:
2) The process of degeneration in pericytes of diabetics; 3) Transmitter related
enzymes in the central nervous system of monkeys; 4) The relationship of
behavioral change to lesion-induced alterations in transmitter related enzymes
in the central nervous system of monkeys; 5) Changes in the superior cervical
ganglion as a result of exposure to testosterone or estradiol; and 6) Changes in
the motor unit as a result of age or lesion. One of the exciting developments in
instrumentation for biological research is the ability to couple microscopes to
computers to allow easy quantitative analysis of microscopic images. All
projects are critically dependent upon the densitometer as an investigative tool
and will exploit the machine's ability to measure product on sections at various
wavelengths with a great degree of accuracy and reproducibility. The
availability of this instrument will allow several excellent investigators to
greatly strengthen their research programs.
