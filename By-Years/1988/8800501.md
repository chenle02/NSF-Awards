Shear-layer-driven transition in a rectangular cavity serves as a generic
system for unstable shear-driven flow in many engineering systems (e.g. openings
in the fuselages of aircraft, expansion joints in pipelines and dead zones
between chip carriers on printed circuit boards). Flow visualization and
pressure measurements have shown that, between the states of periodic and fully
developed turbulence, at least three different regimes of time-dependent fluid
motion occur. These weakly turbulent regimes and the low, noninteger values of
the correlation dimension seem to indicate that this open system is a low-
dimensional system that has chaotic behavior. To completely understand the
transition process in the cavity, the number and types of bifurcations that
cause the system to evolve from one state to the next must be known. To test the
applicability of treating open systems in transition as low-dimensional
dynamical systems, a model of the cavity should be developed and tested against
the experiments. While at Cornell University, bifurcation theory and dynamical
systems analysis and modeling will be studied and applied to the shear- layer-
driven cavity system. The computing facilities at Cornell will be used to
analyze the large files of data taken at Lehigh and to develop the model.
Teaching at Cornell will be done at the undergraduate and graduate level in two
different engineering departments. Since there are very few women in graduate
programs in mechanical/ aerospace engineering and chemical engineering,
interaction with the undergraduate women engineers will be emphasized and the
opportunities offered to them by attending graduate school will be stressed.
This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide
opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in the
disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue
careers in science and engineering by providing greater visibility for women
scientists and engineers employed in industry, government, and academic
institutions. By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a
valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
