This project is serving as a national model for undergraduate Mathematica
laboratory instruction. A set of Mathematica laboratory notebooks for calculus
and applied mathematics are being developed which will result in a complete set
of laboratories for the Applied Mathematics sequence and the expansion of the
current set of calculus laboratories. Calculus notebooks are focusing on
multivariable calculus and on applications from other disciplines. The expansion
of laboratory use and Mathematica notebooks to the three semester Applied
Mathematics sequence is emphasizing mathematical modeling with differential
equations; systems of differential equations; and advanced topics in mathematics
including partial differential equations, Fourier series, and boundary value
problems.
