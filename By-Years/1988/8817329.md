The theory of cospeciation proposes that when two organisms are intricately
associated as hosts and parasites, events that cause speciation in one member of
the pair (the host) will also cause speciation in the other member (the
parasite). The main purpose of this research is to test the hypothesis of
cospeciation in a group of rodent hosts (pocket gophers) and their ectoparasitic
chewing lice. This will be accomplished by the researchers comparing the amounts
of evolutionary change in hosts and parasites based on amounts of sequence
difference in nucleic acid molecules. To date, the researchers have used genetic
data, gathered independently for pocket gophers and chewing lice, to produce an
evolutionary tree for pocket gophers, and one for their chewing lice. When the
branching structure of the pocket gopher and chewing louse trees was compared by
statistical methods, it was found to be remarkably similar. Although this is
necessary evidence to document cospeciation, it is not sufficient evidence: it
must also be demonstrated that speciation events in these hosts and parasites
occurred at approximately the same time. This can be tested by comparing amounts
of molecular change in coexisting hosts and parasites since hypothesized
cospeciation events. The theory will be falsified if there are unequal amounts
of molecular change. Equal amounts of change will constitute strong evidence in
support of the cospeciation theory for this host-parasite assemblage.
