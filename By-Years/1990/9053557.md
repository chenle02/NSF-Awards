This project of the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) is a
three-year program to enhance the knowledge and skills of teacher educators in
science and technology centers and museums nationally. In turn, these teacher
educators will use what they learn to improve their own teaching of children,
and the inservice and professional development programs which they now offer to
elementary school teachers. The program will work extensively with 90 teacher
educators in teams of two or three over a three year period. Summer institutes
will be taught by some of the country's most outstanding teacher educators and
research scholars in the fields of learning, teacher education, and
multicultural education. Through the networking capabilities of ASTC and regular
yearly meetings, these science educators will support each other as they plan
and engage in local projects designed to improve the teaching of science at the
elementary level. As a result of this program, as many as 9,000 classroom
teachers may have access to high quality professional development opportunities,
which better equip them to implement inquiry-based science instruction. The cost
sharing for the project will be fifty five percent of the NSF portion.
