Certain problems arising in molecular biology, in queueing theory, in quality
control and in other experimental situations as well, involve sequences of
observations and patterns within the sequences and change of pattern within the
sequences. This research defines a rigorous mathematical framework within which
to examine these problems and to bring to bear modern statistical methodologies.
In particular, the research addresses the problem of regression analysis
(traditional, robust and/or semilinear) to handle censored or truncated data and
to detect change-points either sequentially or at a predetermined sample size.
In addition, bootstrap methods for sequential analysis will be developed and
their statistical properties will be investigated.
