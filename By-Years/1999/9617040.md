This project connects Florida Memorial College to the Internet over a T1 (1.544
million bits per second) line. Faculty and students at the school benefit from
access to the resources of the Internet, including libraries and supercomputers.
In addition, they are able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at
other institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects. The award
provides partial support of the project for two years.
