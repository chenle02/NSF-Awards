The problems addressed in this research are in the area of geometric topology,
primarily in low dimensions. Some of the problems concern structures on
manifolds, e.g., what sorts of triangulations can exist, or what types of
metrics, or how can a manifold be expressed as a quotient of some nice domain?
Other questions concern automorphisms of manifolds, e.g., how can they act, and
what is the structure of the full group of automorphisms? This leads to focusing
on the groups themselves, and how they decompose, or how they can act on other
simple spaces, for example, trees. Part of the proposal revolves about an
important class of homeomorphisms called quasiconformal homeomorphisms, and, in
particular, how can certain structure changes of manifolds be achieved by
quasiconformal deformations, and what sort of limiting behavior can one find?
There has been an enormous amount of activity in all of these areas in recent
years, and there is much opportunity for tying a lot of it together.
Opportunities for applications will continue to occur in theoretical physics and
possibly elsewhere.
