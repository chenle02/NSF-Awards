This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
automated speaker verification (ASV). Speaker verification is the process of
determining whether a given voice sample belongs to a particular person. Analog
complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) speech-recognition chips are presently
under development, combining integrated silicon cochleae and neural networks
based on auditory system modeling. ASV will expand on this technology base. ASV
is a computationally intensive task but can be solved efficiently with massively
parallel strategies Phase I will develop an algorithm that uses a developed
front-end cochlear processor in conjunction with a focused gamma neural network
(FGNN) and a novel structure called a local receptive field gamma neural
network. Each gamma filter will be modified to behave as a speaker-matched
filter. Phase II would map an ASV algorithm onto dedicated silicon (analog or
digital) to realize a reliable, compact, low-cost ASV processor. ASV is useful
for low-security access-control systems. A low-cost, compact ASV technology will
find applications in existing consumer electronics as a component of the human-
machine interface. In the home, answering machines, telephone long-distance
access, and other low-security devices will be protected so that only particular
speakers have access; specific cable-TV channels will be safeguarded by parental
control; and speaker-trained toys will be programmed to know their `owner.`
Computers in sleep or screen-saver mode could be activated by an authorized
voice. Many other potential consumer applications are possible.
