This proposal by a group of researchers with a proven record of steady and
continuous progress toward the realization of a retinal prosthesis for the
totally blind will bring about fundamental advances in electronics, telemetry,
bioelectromagnetics, and material processing that will enable the realization of
a device with over 1,000 electrodes.

Intellectual merit: The proposed project will bring about fundamental advances
toward the development of an integrated system compatible with the stringent
design specification required for implantation in the human eye. Research will
consider novel solutions for wireless bi-directional and high frequency
transcutaneous telemetry systems, low power VLSI electronics, stimulating
electrode arrays, heterogeneous computational system modeling for performance
prediction, and system-on-a-chip fabrication.

Broader impacts: The proposed research effort combines several disciplines
toward an effective engineering solution to the problem of blindness. Over
10,000,000 visually impaired worldwide will benefit from this research activity.
Further, the team envisions that the proposed research will significantly
contribute to a wide range of future wireless implantable biomedical devices.
This project will offer a unique research environment with strong
interdisciplinary collaborations that will provide graduate and undergraduate
students a diversified exposure to innovative biomedical technologies for the
21st century.
