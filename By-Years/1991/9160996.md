A Phase I SBIR award will investigate the use of carbon-polysulfone as the bone
plate material for internal fracture fixation and includes analysis, design and
fabrication. A two stage manufacturing procedure was identified: (1) near net
shape fabrication on a bone shaped mandril followed by (2) reshaping in the
operating room for a custom fit to the patient.
