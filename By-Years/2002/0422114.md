This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
robotic scrub technician that anticipates a surgeon's request for an instrument
during surgery using robotics technology. Phase II research will build upon the
success achieved in Phase I work , and will implement cognitive architecture
over the current physical and sensory system of the robot. To validate the
cognitive architecture, the robot will assist surgeons while performing
operations on a physical simulator and in experimental animals. In this way,
errors both robotic and human will come into play. The robot's actions will be
judged using criteria for speed and clinical appropriateness, and the cognitive
architecture will be modified to eliminate undesired behaviors. It is expected
that the robot will perform in a clinically acceptable way.

The commercial impact of this project will be in the area of healthcare. The
proposed work addresses the issue of critical shortage of nurse technicians, and
could reduce personnel costs in hospitals. Furthermore, the use of robots for
this environment may free up human technicians to do more critical tasks.
