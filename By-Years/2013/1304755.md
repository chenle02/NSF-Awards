This project will provide insights into the history of sea-ice cover and related
evolution of deep-sea fauna by using newly discovered, continuous Arctic
microfaunal records characterizing a transition from seasonally ice-free to
perennially ice-covered and glacially-affected oceanic environments in the
western Arctic. The major thrusts of the proposal will focus on &lt;br/&gt;(1)
investigating, in detail, foraminiferal distribution along with ostracodes and
related sedimentary proxies in the Early Pleistocene, the time of mostly
seasonal sea ice and little glacial inputs; &lt;br/&gt;(2) comparing these
records to correlative IODP data from the North Atlantic for a broad geographic
and paleoclimatic context of at least hemispheric scale; and &lt;br/&gt;(3)
analyzing the distribution of foraminifers and ostracodes and, by proxy, sea-ice
cover during the major climatic transitions and warm intervals in the younger
stratigraphy in geographically distributed cores from the western Arctic
Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recently observed and ongoing changes in sea ice
distribution are expected to have significant impact on endemic Arctic species.
The data developed during this project will be useful to modelers trying to
understand past changes in the Arctic system and predict future changes.
