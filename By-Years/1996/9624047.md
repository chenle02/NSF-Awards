Grant will support the study of the magnetic flux lines in high temperature
superconductors. A systematic study is planned of the evolution of the first
order melting transition in very clean YBCO single crystals as a function of
controlled point disorder created by proton irradiation. The dependence on the
critical point, the critical regime, and the scaling exponents on the introduced
disorder will be determined. Insight will be gained into the fundamental nature
of the vortex-defect interactions, a parameter also important for technological
applications. The project is a collaboration between Western Michigan University
and Argonne National Laboratory. %%% This Research Planning Grant will support
the study of the magnetic flux lines in high temperature superconductors (HTS).
A systematic study is planned of the evolution of the flux line motion in very
clean single crystals of the yttrium-barium-copper- oxygen HTS as a function of
controlled disorder created by proton irradiation. Increased current flow in HTS
materials in a magnetic field is important for technological application of
these materials. The research will examine how the magnetic field flux lines can
be controlled in the HTS to reduce dissipation and thus increase current flow.
The project is a collaboration between Western Michigan University and Argonne
National Laboratory. ***
