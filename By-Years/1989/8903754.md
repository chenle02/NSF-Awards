Research is being conducted on the structure and function of photosynthetic
reaction centers in the green sulfur bacteria. The specific objective is to
study the donors and acceptors active in the electron transfer reactions that
lead to charge stabilization in the primary quantum conversion process. Their
identity and kinetic interactions are being analyzed by fast transient
absorption spectroscopy and ESR. The work is facilitated by the use of bacteria
grown in conditions that inhibit the synthesis of antenna pigment. Stable,
purified reaction centers will be used to study the polypeptides and
localization of the acceptors on the various sub-units. The possible involvement
of a quinone as acceptor will be examined by organic solvent extraction and
reconstitution. The primary reactions of light conversion to chemical energy
during photosynthesis take place in pigment-protein complexes called reaction
centers. The reaction centers of some bacteria have been thoroughly studied. The
green bacteria occupy a key position for comparative and evolutionary study but
their reaction centers have not been studied. This project focuses on the green
bacteria reaction center because it appears to be very similar but a simplified
version of the light capturing system of higher plants.
