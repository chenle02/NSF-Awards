This proposal seeks to establish the Califorinia Education and Research
Federation Network (CERFnet), a regional network in California, which will
provide enhanced communication among researchers and the significant resources
made available through NSFNET. CERFnet will provide the needed high-speed access
to the supercomputer resources, national data bases, and specialized software at
the NSF sponsored supercomputer centers and between groups of researchers as
they collaborate. While some of the CERF members currently have medium-speed
(56,000 bits per second) access to the NSFNET Backbone, a substantial increase
in bandwidth (to 1.5 million bits per second) and connectivity is needed to
encourage usage by making access easy, fast, and inexpensive. The research
support to be provided by this federation in the form of training, consulting,
documentation, seminars, and improved communications is an important element in
making supercomputer resources more accessible to academic and industrial
institutions in California and to provide the infrastructure for collaborative
research and education projects.
