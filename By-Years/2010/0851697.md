This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Mathematics and
Statistics at Northern Arizona University will host a summer REU program for
2009-20011. Each summer, six students will be selected nationwide for these
programs, with recruitment efforts targeted at smaller colleges at universities
and towards attracting underrepresented minorities (specifically Native
Americans and Hispanics.) The Department has hosted REU students for the past 14
summers and its faculty have experience both in the selection of quality
students and in the feasibility of 8-week student research projects. The
intellectual merit of the program lies In the fact that it will allow its
student participants to experience the research process by working on a problem
that is both suitable and challenging, carrying out literature searches, giving
an oral presentation of their work and writing up their results in a form
suitable for publication. Publication in a refereed journal is considered a goal
for students in the program.
