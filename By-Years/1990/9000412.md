Professor Assani's research will focus on three problems. They are connected to
operator theory, ergodic theory, and harmonic analysis. I) Is it possible to
extend the recent result of J. Bourgain on the return times of dynamical systems
to an operator theoretic context? II) Can a spectral characterization of the
approximate transitivity property introduced by Connes and Woods be obtained?
III) What kinds of operators have iterates which when acting on a function
converge almost everywhere? This project involves research in ergodic theory.
Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of systems
whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in microscopic
detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory of how
groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In addition ergodic
theory makes contact with operator theory and harmonic analysis when the
dynamics consists of applying a single transformation again and again.
