While much progress has been made in the forecasting of locally heavy
snowfalls, there are still times when our technology is not capable of
adequately anticipating these events. A major focus of the mesoscale
meteorological community is to further our understanding of the processes
responsible for locally heavy snows and, therefore, eventually to improve the
forecasting of these events. Under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions
Program, the Principal Investigator will perform a detailed diagnostic
investigation of a record setting snowstorm that occurred in the upper midwest
of the U.S. While the forecasts of this storm did indicate that a significant
storm would affect the region, the mesoscale (local) features and timing of the
heaviest snow were not forecast. In this research, the Principal Investigator
will use conventional operational information and data from a local surface
network to attempt to test a series of hypotheses that should help clarify the
reasons for the timing and quantity of precipitation from this storm. Two
undergraduate students will participate fully in this research with one being
supported via cost sharing from the Principal Investigator's institution.
