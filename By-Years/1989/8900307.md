Professor Miller is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in
experimental investigations on both the dynamics and spectroscopy of a variety
of neutral binary, tertiary, and higher order molecular complexes. Information
is obtained on the structures of these complexes and on the flow of energy
between various internal and translational (dissociative) degrees of freedom for
vibrationally-excited complexes. Opto-thermal detection techniques are used to
measure photofragment angular distributions and obtain state-to-state
photodissociation cross sections following vibrational excitation of one
molecule in a complex. Results are yielding insight into rotational state
correlations between two departing photofragment molecules and also give
accurate values for the complex dissociation energies. Extensions are planned
that will allow probing of higher vibrational states of both these complexes and
stable molecules through a two laser IR-IR double resonance experiment. For the
complexes, the double resonance technique will also allow measurements of
predissociation lifetimes in real time.
