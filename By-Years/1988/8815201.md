The concept of a patch is widely used in ecology, but patches are often viewed
in a simplistic way. The internal structure of patches and the mosaic
surrounding patches are influenced by patchiness at smaller and larger scales.
Thus, environments may be viewed more realistically as mosaics formed by a
nested hierarchy of patches. This hierarchical concept of patchiness may be
examined by studying nectarivorous birds, because nectar resources are often
distributed in a hierarchical fashion. How both patch structure and context in
natural and experimental hierarchies of patches influence the foraging behavior
of broad-tailed hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) will be investigated. The
hierarchical structure of patchiness in the natural distribution of nectar
resources will be measured. The experimental hierarchy consists of three levels
of heterogeneity: (1) within inflorescences (2) within patches, and (3) between
patches. The influence of hierarchical resource- mosaics on foraging behavior
could influence population-level processes such as pollination and territorial
behavior. Thus, the proposed study will increase the understanding of the
ecological consequences of landscape heterogeneity.
