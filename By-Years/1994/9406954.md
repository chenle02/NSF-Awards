9406954 Tewfik Technical Narrative: This is a cooperative research project
between the University of Minnesota and Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
The investigators are electrical engineers who propose to address the signal
processing issues that arise in the design of an Audio-Visual Information
Management System (AVIMS). Specifically, the project will advance the technology
so that users in the United States will have interactive access to the database
of the Topkapi Palace Museum, one of the finest archaeological museums in the
world. The database of this museum contains images of Ottoman calligraphic
documents and illuminated manuscripts, images of objects, speech signals, and
some video signals. A major challenge in building an AVIMS for such a collection
of data is to provide users with the capability of querying documents based on a
keyword, audio or visual feature or subject. To render the database more
accessible to a wider audience in static and mobile settings, the investigators
(Drs. A. Tewfik from the University of Minnesota and E. Cetin from Bilkent
University) will provide tools to deliver Ottoman manuscripts in a spoken
format. Ottoman documents will be recorded in spoken form by experts familiar
with the archaic Ottoman script. Users will be provided with the capability of
playing the recorded and compressed signals at various speeds with minimal
distortion. Time-scale modification will also be used to mask most of the random
delays that occur during the transmission of audio data over computer networks.
Project funding will enable the two teams to work together in both Minneapolis
and Ankara. ***
