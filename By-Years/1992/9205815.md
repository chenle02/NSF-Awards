The reconstruction of Precambrian cratons and supercontinents and their breakup
relies on well-constrained paleomagnetic data. Africa has an extensive and
complex Precambrian shield, and considerable data exists. This project will
obtain a number of key paleomagnetic poles from the Tanzanian Craton of east
Africa that will allow testing of several conflicting hypotheses regarding
tectonic processes during the Proterozoic, including the make up and timing of
assembly of a Proterozoic supercontinent and whether the mobile belts
surrounding cratons originated by ensialic or ensimatic sources. Results should
provide comparative data useful in other Precambrian shields.
