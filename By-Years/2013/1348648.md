EHR Core Research&lt;br/&gt;Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project focuses on workplace expectations for STEM related competencies and the
subsequent design of educational curricula in postsecondary institutions and
STEM education interventions. It responds to the need to produce empirical
evidence regarding employer expectations in STEM related fields that would
enable the integration of these expectations into educational practice. Thus,
the project goals are to (1) identify employer expectations for the types of
skills, knowledge, and competencies required for success; (2) ascertain the
degree to which these expectations are integrated into the design of educational
curricula and STEM education interventions; and (3) explore the implications of
employer desires for hard and soft skills for the postsecondary curriculum.
These issues will be examined in regard to the advanced manufacturing and
biotechnology industries within the State of Wisconsin. It expands a small-scale
study on these topics that was launched in 2012 by the University of Wisconsin-
Madison Center for Education and Work. That study draws on a sociotechnical
theory of organizations by focusing on the ways in which successful employees
are able to bring a variety of skills and competencies obtained through their
education to navigate workplace complexities and maximize their performance. The
PIs will use a comparative qualitative case study design where in-depth
interviews
