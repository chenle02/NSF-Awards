This project investigates educators' understanding of concepts involved in
applying telecommunications networks to educational purposes. The investigators
will develop a prototype series of videotaped information on the NSFNET,
Internet and NREN. Telecommunications is a dynamic and procedural subject. To
understand the networks, educators need to see demonstrations of network
applications and animated sequences that illustrate data/message exchange and
transmission across systems. The content will include basic concepts of
networking, how networks are used in education, characteristics of
NSFNET/Internet, and how to use the NSFNET. An experimental feature of the video
series will be a scenario-based viewers assessment. Viewers will be asked to
assess their level of understanding after viewing the video; sequences. This
information will be used to identify requirements for more extensive educational
materials on this subject for educators.
