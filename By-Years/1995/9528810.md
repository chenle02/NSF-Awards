9528810 Messina We propose to hold a ten-day summer workshop to explore the
applications and algorithms requirements for PetaFLOPS-scale computing. The
workshop will take place at Bodega Bay, Sonoma County, California, on August
14-23, 1995. The focus will be on innovative applications and algorithms for
PetaFLOPS systems. The goal of the summer workshop is to develop detailed case
studies (complete with performance models, software and hardware requirement s,
and descriptions of open problems) for a number of applications areas, including
nontraditional applications that may be enabled by PetaFLOPS systems.
