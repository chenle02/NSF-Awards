The goals of this project are to understand the effects of space charge on the
resolution of photoelectron microscopes operating at high current densities, to
improve their resolution, and to exploit the space charge nonlinearity for pulse
measurements and other applications. The photoelectron microscope is an
instrument in which light induces electron emission from a sample and the
electrons are focussed to form a highly magnified image of the sample surface.
Its uses are in crystal growth, biology, catalysis, and microelectronics.
Earlier theoretical and experimental studies of space charge limited resolution
are in poor agreement. Illuminators now used are almost entirely incoherent
sources rather than lasers because of performance difficulties encountered with
the latter. In this project a spherical-potential electron optical system will
be used with various types of laser illumination to evaluate resolution as a
function of emission current density. The theory of space charge aberrations
will be extended to this case and compared with experimental results. Space
charge effects provide an adjustable, very fast nonlinearity which may be used
for pulse duration measurements and other signal processing applications.
