This project studies data analysis and modeling of binary neutron stars and/or
black holes, which will be an important source of gravitational waves for the
LIGO project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory). The data
analysis work will include the development, testing, and use of algorithms and
software to perform searches on LIGO data. It will also include mathematical
work on extraction of information from detected signals. The modeling of binary
dynamics is closely related: Good data analysis requires good predictions of the
signals. This project will focus on binaries composed of spinning objects. For
these systems the signals are much more complicated than those usually
considered. This makes searches more difficult, but can provide much more
information once a signal is detected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
emphasizes graduate student participation. Students are encouraged to work on
data analysis problems as well as the traditional gravity and astrophysics
involved in source modeling. This provides students with broader than usual
training for careers in and out of academia, solving practical as well as
theoretical problems. Students will present their work at scientific meetings.
Software and data analysis techniques developed under this grant will be
publicly available and used by the international LIGO Science Collaboration. The
work on binary dynamics may have implications of interest to the astrophysical
community as well.
