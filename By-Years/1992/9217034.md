Past studies indicate that tropical paleoclimatology is influenced by the
seasonality of solar insolation due to the precession of the equinox and by
extratropical boundary conditions. However, the mechanisms by which tropical
climate is influenced are not well understood. This award supports a study with
three main objectives: 1. to understand, using ocean models, the Sensitivity of
the Upper Ocean to changes in boundary conditions (insolation and winds, and
extratropical conditions); 2. to predict past wind fields from Observations of
Past Upper Ocean Changes, such as thermocline structure changes; and 3. to
Compare Observations with Realistic Model Runs of past times in order to
understand the physical link between changes in tropical winds and observed
upper ocean circulation. Comparisons between the response of the two oceans to
the same external forcing will be used to further elucidate mechanisms of
tropical climate change.
