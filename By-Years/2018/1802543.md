Local governments of cities distribute public goods in theory to improve the
well-being of their residents. This project compares the trajectories of two
mega-cities that in began in the 1980s and early 1990s from roughly equivalent
situations, including a relatively high level of local governance and commitment
to delivery of urban public goods such as housing, sanitation, and public
transportation. Yet despite similar goals and strategies, while state
interventions have reduced urban inequalities in one of these cities, they have
reproduced these inequalities in the other one. This project promises to
generate new insights into the relationship between states, democracy, and urban
inequalities. Findings will be useful for urban policymaking in the midst of
social change. They will inform understanding of how cities can coordinate
politics and institutional change to deliver public goods.

This project will use multiple methods to compare public goods provision in SÃ£o
Paulo, Brazil and Johannesburg, South Africa. The methods are: a) field-based
participant observation and interviews with key public and private actors; b)
archival research of legislation, newspapers, trade publications, and internal
government and NGO documents; and c) spatial analysis of 25 years of
quantitative data on housing, sanitation and transportation. The research design
and comparative-historical methods of analysis make it possible to disaggregate
changes in interactions between social coalitions and state institutions over
time, and to specify the mechanisms of these changes. The theoretical basis for
this work draws on two literatures in sociology: urban sociology, which focuses
on the neighborhood or city scale, and the sociology of development, which
focuses on the national scale.
