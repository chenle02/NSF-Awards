This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
problem of integrating information about named entities, such as people,
companies, and products, from numerous data sources. Integrating information
about entities from multiple sources can be difficult because sources may use
different formats and terminology to describe the same entity, a problem
referred to as "entity resolution". Most existing commercial enterprise systems
rely on rule-based matching techniques for entity resolution. This project
investigates statistical learning techniques that allow a system to estimate the
probability of a match, rather than computing a score based on ad-hoc rules or
weights. Because the approach is based on sound statistical principles and uses
evidence compiled from large datasets, it can produce more accurate results than
existing methods. Moreover, these advantages are amplified when handling data
that that has highly variable, missing or noisy attributes, such as data
extracted from Web sites.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in enabling
enterprises to perform more accurate and reliable data integration. The are many
potential target markets that need better technology for integrating information
about businesses, products, people, locations, and other entities. This
capability is critical for some of the nation's largest companies and
institutions, from search engines, to the U.S. Intelligence and law enforcement
community, to financial institutions. In particular, large enterprises often
have difficulty utilizing data extracted from news, foreign language data
sources, and social media, because the extracted data is noisy and not-well
structured. The technology developed in this project will help enterprises make
use of the growing amount of information on the Web, so that they can take
advantage of the network of relationships that link people, companies, and other
entities to serve their customers better.
