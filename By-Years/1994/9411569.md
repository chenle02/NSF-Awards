ABSTRACT CTS-9411569 University of Houston P.I.: F. Hussain This equipment will
support the purchase of a modern data acquisition and control system for the
Aerodynamics and Turbulence Laboratory. This unit will be used for real-time
experiment control, multi-channel data acquisition, and data analysis for
turbulence research. Since both dynamical and structrual approaches will be
used, acquisition and analysis of large amount of low-noise, high-resolution
multi-channel data are necessary. Research in the upgrade laboratory will likely
make a significant contribution to the field of turbulence.
