This award provides funds for purchase of a portable photosynthesis system to be
used by faculty at this and other, nearby undergraduate institutions for field-
based educational and research activities dealing with the photosynthetic
physiology of plants. The instrument will be used for physiological
characterization of invasive exotic species as part of efforts to understand
characteristics that allow them to be successful invaders. Species to be studied
include those that have successfully invaded at least one of a variety of
ecosystems, including the forest understory in the southern Appalachians, the
rangelands of the semi-arid West, and the riparian zones of the Southwest.
Researchers at Appalachian State University and Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, will use the instrument to assess the effects of ozone exposure on
stomatal control of leaf gas exchange. In addition to its research applications,
the instrument will be used in teaching and training activities in six classes
taught at the grantee institution and, in addition, will be used in
undergraduate research training. Educational use is expected to benefit up to
100 students a year.
