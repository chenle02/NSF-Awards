This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses the
development of Innovative Ultra-Broadband Ferrite Circulators/Isolators
providing a transmission bandwidth broader than a 10:1 frequency ratio. A
traditional circulator junction utilizing a single ferrite material results in a
3:1 bandwidth. A non-traditional stripline junction circulator for which the
transmission band extends from 1.6 to 16 GHz has been designed and fabricated.
This circulator design involves 3 different kinds of ferrite materials to be
packed as tiles to form a composite junction. Even broader bandwidth has also
been theoretically predicted, if more ferrite materials are used to compose the
junction, rendering a bandwidth covering from 1 to 20 GHz. Researches on
broadband transformer circuits are thus proposed, allowing for 50 S impedance to
be realized with the input/output ports accompanying the operation of the
broadband circulator/isolator junctions.

The proposed innovative circulators/isolators can be used as universal
instruments under broadband considerations. For example, it can be used in
measurements requiring interband operation, such as encountered in a Network
Analyzer performing scattering parameter measurements. In radiometry
applications it allows for narrow-width electromagnetic pulses to be used with
monostatic radars. Multiple radars operating at distinctive frequency bands can
be combined to share a common antenna aperture so as to reduce overall radar
cross section.
