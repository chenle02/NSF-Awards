ABSTRACT

0824489 PI: Hammergren

This award supports the Adler Public Education fellowship program. The
Fellowship provides young researchers with the opportunity to build high-quality
public education and outreach skills, while continuing to perform cutting-edge
research leading towards their graduate degrees. Each year, a Fellow is selected
from a competitive pool of promising physical science or engineering graduate
students. The Fellow is responsible for planning, developing, managing and
teaching a prestigious summer program for Chicago area gifted high school
students. The AstroScience Workshop (ASW) is a themed program that combines
classroom lectures, hands-on lab activities, guest lectures by leading
astronomers and planetary scientists, and student-directed investigations in
astronomy, atmospheric and planetary sciences. The Fellow has the full support
of the Adler, working most closely with the Astronomy and Education departments.
The Fellow spends the academic year developing the curriculum and technology for
the ASW, inviting speakers, and organizing the program. Because the Fellowship
is intended to promote the development of true scientist-educators, the Fellow
is fully expected to continue a vigorous program of research at their home
institution. After the ASW is completed the Fellow presents the lessons learned,
the effectiveness of various techniques tried and the success of different
curricular units at a national conference. This award is supported through the
Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
Directorate.
