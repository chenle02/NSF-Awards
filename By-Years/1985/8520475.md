The research will explore the mechanics of robotic manipulation operations. The
short-range goal is to demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, an
autonomous robot that is competent in simple manipulation domains. The long-
range goal is to build a systematic foundation for autonomous robotic
manipulation. The proposed work falls into two areas: (1) the mechanics of
simple manipulator operations. In this area the operations of grasping, pushing
and squeezing, and striking will be addressed; and (2) exploration of simple
manipulation task domains. The task domains will involve several different
operations within the task domain; however, the domain will initially be simple
and proceed to greater complexity as the work progresses.
