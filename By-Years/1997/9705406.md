9705406 Plummer This FRG proposal addresses, experimentally and theoretically,
basic materials science issues in a collaborative program involving researchers
at four universities and ORNL, combining expertise and facilities to explore a
new concept in epitaxy, an "electronic growth" mechanism. Within this mechanism
the critical thickness for the formation of an atomically flat film corresponds
to the thickness where the two-dimensional electronic system can be confined in
a potential well between the vacuum and the substrate. This magic film thickness
depends on the nature of quantum well states, that is, the overall arrangement
of atoms is dictated by the preference of electrons to occupy certain quantum-
mechanical states. Special resources made available jointly for this project
include high resolution photo-emission, surface x-ray scattering, scanning probe
microscopy, high resolution inelastic electron scattering, and super computing
equipment. The proposed research emphasizes understanding of fundamental
mechanisms and processes through a combination of theoretical and experimental
studies. %%% The project addresses forefront materials science research issues
in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The
research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental
level to important aspects of metal-semiconductor interfaces critical to
electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general. Additionally,
the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected
to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by
providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing
improved materials and structures for the quantum mechanical devices of the
future. The research program may lead to a new paradigm for metal heteroepitaxy,
which is of significance in the fabrication of electronic devices and
microelectronics circuitry. ***
