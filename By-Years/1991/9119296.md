Many plants are known to increase the intracellular levels of phenolic compounds
when they are challenged by a wide variety of stressful conditions including
predation. Many phenolic compounds are toxic to a wide variety of biotic agents.
In order for plants to use this defense mechanism, the species must be able to
tolerate the increased level of the phenolic. Plants reduce the autotoxicity of
phenolics by conjugating them to other cellular constituents. It has been
recently noted that plants may conjugate some phenolics to glutathione through
the action of a glutathione S-transferase. Preliminary evidence indicates that
the activity of the enzyme may be regulated by phenolic levels. The objectives
of this project are to: 1) characterize the glutathione S- transferase enzyme;
2) determine if plants synthesize glutathione conjugates of phenolics in vivo;
and 3) determine if there is a correlation between stress and glutathione
S-transferase activity. An understanding of the role of glutathione in phenolic
conjugation will aid in the understanding of how plants utilize phenolics during
times of stress and may provide insight into the endogenous function of plants
GST enzymes.
