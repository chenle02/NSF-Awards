1714088&lt;br/&gt;Leoni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The central theme of this project
is the application of modern applied mathematics to engineering, materials
science, and mechanics. One of the main scientific goals is to address
mathematically many of the issues encountered in the charge-discharge dynamics
of Lithium-Ion batteries. The understanding of the these phenomena is paramount
to overcome the shortcomings of rechargeable Lithium-Ion batteries and to
develop novel materials. Other thematic areas of focus are phase transitions in
solids and fluids and defects in materials. The investigator continues the
training of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows through
several activities that integrate research and education, including topics
courses, summer schools, working groups, course design workshops, and career-
building workshops. Graduate and undergraduate students participate in the work
of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The main scientific thrusts of the project
are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Variational Models for Lithium-Ion Batteries. High performance
cathode and anode materials undergo phase transformations upon lithiation and
delithiation. The goal here is to focus on variational models that are
sufficiently rich to capture many of the issues encountered in the charge-
discharge dynamics of Lithium-Ion batteries.&lt;br/&gt;2) Slow motion of
interfaces. Sharp energy estimates obtained by the investigator and his
collaborators have recently been used to give the first slow motion estimates of
the interface of solutions of the mass-preserving Allen-Cahn equations and of
the Cahn-Hilliard equations in higher dimensions and without structural
assumptions on the initial data and on the form of the domain. The goal is to
extend these results to local minimizers and to other functionals.&lt;br/&gt;3)
Free boundary problems. The goal here is to focus on variational models for free
boundary problems whose solutions exhibit singularities.&lt;br/&gt;Graduate and
undergraduate students participate in the work of the project.
