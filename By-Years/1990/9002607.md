The CEDAR ( Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) program
is very much concerned with both the development of modern state of the art
optical instruments and detectors and the quality and analysis of the
atmospheric data that they produce. This project will employ a newly developed
Fabry-Perot interferometer which uses a bare-CCD detector to study the
temperature and winds of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This in
turn will be used to validate current global circulation models. This is a
continuation of a program initiated in 1989 and promises to effectively
contribute to our understanding of this atmospheric region and the modern
techniques for studying this region.***
