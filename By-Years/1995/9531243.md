This work, by Assistant Professor Li Sun of the University of Minnesota-Twin
Cities, focuses on single nanopores in metal membranes and is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. The nanopores are ion-conducting and
contain a surface modifier which binds to an analyte ion selectively. The
capture of an ion transiting the pore modulates the pore ionic conductivity
which is the signal of interest. This approach has the advantage that analyte
crossing the pore need not be capable of producing redox or spectrometric
signals. Pore fabrication will be investigated using both electrochemical and
self-assembled monolayer technology to control the pore structure. The nature of
molecular transport through a pore will be studied using surface analytical
techniques including surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical
methods. Knowledge gained from these fundamental studies will be used to develop
new detectors for chemical analysis, particularly of biochemicals. A major
objective of this work is to fabricate structured pores of approximately small
molecule dimensions in metal membranes for the purpose of studying the transport
of molecules across such a pore. Fundamental study of the chemistry of ion
binding to selective sites within the pore is useful because ion channels are an
important and not yet fully understood mechanism for control of information flow
across biological membranes. A second major goal of the project is to develop
new types of detectors for chemical analysis which also utilize the ability of
the active sites in the pore to selectively interact with ions of interest in
the pore solution.
