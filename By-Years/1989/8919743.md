The retina at the back of the eyeball is the tissue containing the
photoreceptors and sensory nerve cells that allow vision. The molecules that
absorb light energy and initiate vision are photopigments; they are made from
proteins combined with compounds called retinoids, which have molecular
structures related to vitamin A. The immediate environment of the photoreceptor
cells is the interphotoreceptor matrix, which has a complex structure in the
vertebrates, and is a region important for retinal physiology, including
exchange processes with circulatory fluids. One group of invertebrate animals,
the cephalopods, includes squid and octopus with eyes strikingly similar to
those in the vertebrates, but with some aspects such as the vitamin-A cycle that
seem simpler. We have some knowledge for the vertebrates on how the retinoids
are transported in the blood to the retina, and how they are taken up by the
photoreceptors to form photopigments. But we know little about whether or not
these results are generalizable to the wide diversity of visual systems in other
animal classes. This study will utilize biochemistry and electron microscopy on
octopus retina to identify the presence and location of cellular receptor sites
on the photoreceptors for binding retinoids. The substructure of the
interphotoreceptor matrix also will be studied by staining techniques. These
data will provide the first data on these important features of invertebrate
eyes, and will be important to compare to the known features of the vertebrate
eye. The inclusion of undergraduates including minorities in this technically
modern and productive laboratory will have a very high impact on the recruitment
and retention of young scientists in this field.
