95-26305 Grossman As part of NSF-funded follow-up studies of the Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter in July 1994, Dr. Grossman and his co-
principal investigator, Dr. John Wang, will complete the reduction and analysis
of unique radio interferometer observational data sets, which were taken to
determine the effects the event had on the Jovian troposphere and magnetosphere
during and after the impact. The data sets were obtained at the Very Large Array
and the Australia Telescope. In particular, the investigators expect to get
information on atmospheric structure and the abundances of the trace
constituents ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water; the presence or lack of
discernible features associated with the impacts; and the penetration depths of
the individual fragments. Furthermore, this research is expected to improve our
understanding of the response of the Jovian magnetosphere to dust loading and
shocking, and the time-scales for transport of injected material and relaxation
of the various physical perturbations. **
