This project will bring six undergraduate students to the Minnesota
Supercomputer Institute in each of the summers of 1993, 1994 , and 1995. The
students will work on ongoing, and new research in biophysical computing and
computational dynamics, and in new software development efforts for scientific
computing and graphics support for such research.
