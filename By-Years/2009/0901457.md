Abstract Junge

The aim of this proposal is to apply methods from the operator of algebras to
problems in noncommutative analysis. This includes developing a theory of
singular integrals and Fourier multipliers for noncommutative function spaces.
The new insights gained from this work should also reflect back on the
noncommutative spaces and their differential geometric properties. Another field
of applications of tools from the theory of operator spaces lies in quantum
information theory. Here violation of Bell inequalities and quantum error
correction seems to relate well to the theory of cb-maps from operator space
theory.

In real life the order in which certain operations are executed can make a big
difference. For example first boiling water and the adding oil is very different
from first boiling oil and then adding water. The mathematical community has now
fully accepted that one should allow the main object of interest to be performed
in a certain order. Noncommutative analysis is about functions and their
properties in the realm of non-commuting variables. The most important example
here are matrix-valued functions. The theory of classical analysis, such as
Fourier analysis or harmonic analysis has a lot to say about functions, and as
this proposal intends to show, also about matrix-valued functions. Another
natural application of this circle of ideas (the mathematical theory called
functional analysis) lies in quantum information theory and the theoretical
analysis of channels. Channels are the operation performed signals used to
transport data in quantum information theory.
