The principal investigator will do research on dynamical phenomena of electron
systems at surfaces including vibrational line shapes, non-adiabatic charge
transfer, atom-surface scattering, and sticking. Also, the behavior of electron
gas correlation functions and their implications for non-uniform systems. The
principal investigator plans to develop theories of what the various
experimental problems of particle motions actually measure and to discover
fundamental principles concerning their motion.
