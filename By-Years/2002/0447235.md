0447235&lt;br/&gt;Anandakrishnan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports an
upgrade to a current Sun Solaris OS-based computational facility shared by
Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Richard Alley, Peter Flemings and their students in the
Department of Geosciences at Penn Sate University. Specific equipment to be
purchased includes 10 Dell workstations with dual 2.8 GHz CPUs, 3 Gb RAM and
running Linux OS. Four of these workstations will be equipped with dual monitors
for visualization. The workstations will replace existing Sun Ultra 5 and Ultra
10 workstations with CPU clock speeds at 300 to 440 MHz. The new workstation
seats will still take advantge an existing back office consisting of a Sun File
server, multi-CPU application and compute servers and plotting equipment. In
addition, the existing network switch at 100Mbit will be replaced with a fast
Gbit switch. The upgraded computational facilities will be engaged in a variety
of numerically intensive research efforts ranging from dynamical and seismic
investigations of Antarctic continental glaciers to seismic investigations of
the Antarctic crustal and upper mantle structure to studies of fluid flow and
pressures within passive continental margin sedimentary basins.
