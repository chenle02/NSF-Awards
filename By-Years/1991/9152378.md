This project establishs a very-high-speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) testing
laboratory for undergraduate electrical engineering students at the FAMU/FSU
College of Engineering. This laboratory provides practical testing methodologies
of VHSIC for senior-level students through a series of experiments which cover
the fundamentals of functional and parametric testing. The laboratory
supplements the undergraduate Microelectronics Program which includes courses in
solid-state devices, digital and analog IC design, and the computer aided-
design (CAD) of very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits. With the new
equipment, the students study the switching characteristics of high-speed
microelectronic devices belonging to logic families such as emitter-coupled
logic (ECL), high- speed complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (HCMOS), and
gallium arsenide (GaAs) metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFET).
Electrical engineering majors completing the sequence of laboratory experiments
gain a comprehensive knowledge of high-speed IC
