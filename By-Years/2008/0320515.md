This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
mobility based label free detection of receptor / ligand binding in lipid
bilayer membranes. This label - free detection will be incorporated into the
MembraneChip technology for array sensors to replace costly fluorescent labeling
methods. The cell membrane is the richest source of targets with high
therapeutic values. Recent advances in automated membrane deposition techniques,
combined with the discovery of membrane-compatible surfaces and membrane
diffusion barrier materials, allow for the creation of discrete, spatially-
addressable membrane array elements which retain their biological functionality
and natural fluid character. These characteristics make this technology an
attractive format for displaying native or reconstituted membrane targets in an
industrialized drug discovery assay platform. In order to fully exploit this
platform's potential, a lipid mobility based detection scheme which is
effectively label free in that it does not require any label on the ligand or
the target, has been discovered. Small quantities of fluorescent lipid doped
into the membrane bilayer exhibit changes in lateral diffusion coefficient upon
binding without being directly involved in the interaction. This project will
explore the feasibility of extending this label free detection discovery to
study universal membrane receptor-ligand binding interactions by characterizing
the technique with respect to detection sensitivity, quantitation and binding
interactions. The commercial application of this project is in drug discovery
research. Fluid membrane microarray technology is applicable to both native and
reconstituted membrane proteins, and should therefore provide a well-controlled
and systematic drug discovery platform for membrane-mediated cell signaling
events.
