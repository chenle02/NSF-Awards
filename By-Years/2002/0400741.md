This grant will work on a number of problems connected with multivariable
operator theory, that part of operator theory that examines finite collections
of commuting operators and the ways in which they are related and interact. The
techniques are both algebraic and analytic, with the main tools from analysis
being the use of analytic functions of several variables while the algebraic
tools are from matrix algebra. In addition the PI will engage in several
synergistic activities with undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of
this proposal is a finite collection of operators on a Hilbert space of infinite
dimension. This work makes connections with other areas of mathematical analysis
and has a rich history of excitement. In addition the PI will engage in several
synergistic activities with undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;
