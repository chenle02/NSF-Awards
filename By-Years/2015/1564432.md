The "STEM Scholars" program at Johnson County Community College (JCCC) will
provide 30 scholarships to students enrolling in the Associate Degree of Science
at JCCC who have demonstrated financial need and an aptitude and interest in
studying in a STEM field. This project will develop a support network of student
services and cohort-building activities necessary for students through an
unprecedented program that brings together departments and offices across
campus. The project team will lead a coordinated effort encompassing the JCCC
offices of Institutional Research, Financial Aid, Admissions and Counseling,
Student Services and regional STEM education organizations. The project will
focus on the impact that individual faculty have on helping community college
students successfully transfer to universities.

The project will study the increase on recruitment, retention, graduation, and
transfer rates for scholarship students, particularly women and underrepresented
minority students in STEM majors. The project will contribute to the literature
on STEM education by studying what works in helping STEM students persist to
university graduation in a STEM major. The project team will evaluate the effect
that STEM-focused counselors, research opportunities for community college STEM
students, and collaboration among community college and university STEM faculty
can have on retaining students in STEM majors and aiding them in successfully
continuing on for a four-year STEM degree. This project will establish a
replicable model for other community colleges so that they can achieve similar
results.
