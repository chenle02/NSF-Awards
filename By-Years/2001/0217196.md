&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Kentucky will to establish a
demonstration project called the Girls&lt;br/&gt;in Science Program (GIS), to
encourage young women from rural southeastern Appalachian&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky to
pursue careers in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET). This
three-&lt;br/&gt;year project, to begin in September 2002, targets 120 girls
entering the seventh-grade &lt;br/&gt;from 21 rural Kentucky Appalachian
counties, parents of these girls, and a minimum of &lt;br/&gt;30 rural Kentucky
Appalachian middle school teachers from these 21 county school
&lt;br/&gt;districts. This project targets a select group of middle school girls
with a program that &lt;br/&gt;involves: 1) Weeklong Summer Institutes for each
girl at the University of Kentucky campus&lt;br/&gt;for two years, 2)
Saturday/After-school sessions throughout two academic school
years,&lt;br/&gt;and 3) Mentoring relationships with University scientists and
community mentors. The &lt;br/&gt;project also the project targets middle school
math and science teachers through &lt;br/&gt;professional development courses
focused on engaging each girl in science and math for &lt;br/&gt;two years. This
project will include parental involvement with a series of
workshops.&lt;br/&gt;The project team will also develop and disseminate a model
middle school curriculum &lt;br/&gt;manual focused on institutionalizing the
program in rural Appalachian Kentucky. Girls and&lt;br/&gt;teachers who enroll
in the program will be the primary beneficiaries; however, the program
&lt;br/&gt;is designed to have a broad-based impact on other students, teachers,
relatives, and &lt;br/&gt;ultimately rural Kentucky and Appalachia.
