This grant supports the purchase of 19 Pentium class, IBM compatible computers
with interface boards and associated network hardware and software to improve
laboratory instruction for students in general chemistry, analytical chemistry,
and physical chemistry courses. This equipment permits the establishment of
laboratory information management systems (LIMS) in the general chemistry
laboratory and in the physical/analytical chemistry laboratory. Computer-
assisted experiments enable students in the general chemistry laboratory to
realize the full potential of discovery-based experiments. Computers so greatly
facilitate the collection and exchange of data between students that they are
able to use laboratory time to manipulate and analyze this data. The ease with
which data and graphs can be manipulated permits students to make further
explorations, stimulate critical thinking, and lead them to new discoveries.
Students in advanced chemistry courses, in addition to using computers for rapid
data acquisition and analysis, employ these computers in more sophisticated
applications, such as designing their own laboratory information management
systems.
