9505149 Fornaess The proposed research lies in the area of several complex
variables. Complex dynamical systems in several variables - this is a new area
of research founded by the proposer and his coworkers - will be pursued:
iteration of holomorphic maps, holomorphic flows, and holomorphic hulls are
among the topics of study in this area. The Cauchy-Riemann operator in singular
spaces and the boundary regularity of holomorphic mappings will also be
investigated. Complex dynamical systems generalize real dynamical systems
arising from autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations. Real
dynamical systems are widely used to model natural phenomena including fluid
flow, planetary motion, and ecological systems. Complex dynamical systems, which
are relatively recent constructs, have already found applications in fractal
geometry.
