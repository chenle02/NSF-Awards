9315779 Kieffer The investigation of visco-elastic relaxations in fragile glass
forming liquids, using a combination of Brillouin light scattering, molecular
dynamic computer simulations and impedance spectroscopy is proposed. The
objective of the research is to provide improved understanding with respect to
the factors that determine the glass formation ability and the temperature
dependence of the viscosity in novel glassy materials, e.g. tellurites, heavy
metal fluorides and phosphates. The principal aspects of this study will be to
explore: (1) The role of different network cations. (2) The stabilizing effect
of counter cations. (3) The effect of mixed anion compositions on the network
structure and the associated degree of decoupling between mobile cations and the
network. (4) The influence of impurities and the possible characterization of
defects. ***
