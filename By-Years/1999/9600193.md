A program of both research and teaching in physics will be carried out. The
research, theoretical in nature, will pursue in a variety of ways the
possibility that the dark matter in the universe-matter which is known to exist
because of its gravitational effects but which does not emit any light that
would make it visible - is composed of elementary particles different from those
already discovered in the laboratory. Extensions of existing theory that may
point to such new particles will be pursued. Methods for detecting the new
particles will be explored. Models of the universe which contain the new
particles and/or other novel features will be studied. The teaching will entail
a number of innovations. These include allowing students in an introductory
physics course to hone their problem-solving skills by applying concepts they
learn in class to mechanical systems which they analyze, design, and build. Also
included is the creation of videotaped lectures for distribution to universities
in third-world countries. The question of the nature of the dark matter is one
of the central issues in astrophysics, so the research addressing this question
will be very important. Creative innovations in the teaching of science to
university students, both here and abroad are of great importance to the healthy
future of science and society.
