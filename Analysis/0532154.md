ABSTRACT

The minimum energy (or "ground state") configurations for N particles
interacting via a pairwise repulsive interaction V and confined to a fixed
manifold A is of great mathematical and physical interest and has been the
subject of much effort over the years from a variety of workers. In particular,
such configurations are useful for purposes of sampling data, computer graphics,
best-packing and understanding the physics of self-assembling materials. The
grant will enable the researchers to investigate:(i) how relationships between
geometrical, topological, and combinatorial properties of a manifold are
reflected in the asymptotics of minimal energy problems; (ii) whether there are
properties of minimal energy configurations that are universal in the sense
thatthey are insensitive to the choice of underlying potential function; and
(iii) how the theory can be applied in the development of efficientalgorithms
for generating large numbers of points on a surface that are uniformly
distributed or have some non-uniform prescribed distribution.

We expect the results of this research to help elucidate the ordering of matter
on curved surfaces. Furthermore, the infrastructure for research and education
will be enhanced by the participation of graduate students and post-doctoral
researchers who will broaden their education through interactions with condensed
matter physicists as well as participate in collaborations and international
exchanges with members of the Australian Centre of Excellence in Mathematics and
Statistics of Complex Systems' research team at the University of New South
Wales (Sydney, Australia).
