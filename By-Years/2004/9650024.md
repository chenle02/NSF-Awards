Charge coupled devices (CCDs) are two-dimensional optical detectors that are
revolutionizing modern instrumentation. These computer-intensive detectors have
excellent sensitivity and can collect an entire image within a fraction of a
second. The images provide immediate information that can be stored as computer
files to allow subsequent analysis of a series of images. Image analysis
procedures vary, but basic detector usage is the same when used for medical
instruments or on-line monitoring of product quality control. This wide
diversity in application means that the ability to understand and use data from
instruments using CCDs is rapidly becoming an essential skill for all science
students. Unfortunately, teaching lab experiments using CCDs are nearly non-
existent. This project uses a junior-senior level optics and new projects lab to
develop a series of CCD experiments. Optical two-dimensional diffraction
patterns are providing suitable standards to test the performance of CCDs and
non-trivial, interesting experiments.
