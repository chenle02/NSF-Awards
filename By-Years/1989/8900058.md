Three techniques have been used for measurements of hydroxyl radical (OH)
concentrations: laser induced fluorescence (LIF), the direct, long path
absorption (LPA) method, and the 14C tracer method. To be usefully applied to
atmospheric measurements, detection systems must be sensitive enough to measure
low OH concentrations, must gave reasonable signal-to-noise ratios, and have the
capacity to discriminate against chemical and physical interferences. They must
be absolute or susceptible to calibration. Attainment of these goals must be
feasible under a variety of environmental conditions. This research project will
evaluate the potential to measure local diurnal OH concentration cycles to a
precision of 20 percent using integration times of 100 seconds. Calibration of
the method is not required. 14C method, in collaboration with other groups
measuring significant trace gas concentrations in the atmosphere, to make
careful checks on the validity of current models of tropospheric photochemistry.
Some intercomparisons of OH measurements with those of other techniques, using
scientifically defensible protocols, and the collection of preliminary
statistics on temporal and spatial variability of OH near ground level will also
be carried out.
