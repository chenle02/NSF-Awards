Funds will be provided to the PI to support the MARGINS office at Washington
University where it is moving from the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.
The office and the PI will conduct many essential activities, including
coordination of the MARGINS program and its four initiatives, chairing and
organization of steering committee meetings, assistance to the MARGINS
community, fostering of MARGINS-related workshops and theoretical/experimental
institutes, international collaborations, and communication in support of
ongoing MARGINS projects. The latter will be through newsletters and the MARGINS
website. It will also foster educational and outreach activities for the broader
science community.
