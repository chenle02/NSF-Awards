9316232 Kohl This interagency transfer to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
provides cost sharing for the fourth in a series of joint oceanographic
expeditions under the U.S.-Russia Environmental Agreement. The 1993 expedition
will involve U.S. scientists from several institutions and scientists from
Russia's Institute of Global Climate and Ecology in Moscow. The expedition will
focus on the biogeochemical cycles of contaminants, related oceanographic
processes, food-web interactions in North Pacific waters flowing through the
area, and behavior of organic pollutants at the water/sediment interface.
Geographic areas of study will range from the continental shelves of the Bering
and Chukchi Seas to the deep Bering Sea. Intensive biological sampling locations
will include several long-term monitoring sites (polygons) that have been
visited four times since 1977. The Russian-American research is comprehensive
and highly integrated and the data will be of interest to the Divisions of Ocean
Sciences and Polar Programs. ***
