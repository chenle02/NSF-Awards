The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information
Science and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering (CISE) is committed to broadening the
participation of underrepresented populations in&lt;br/&gt;computing and
closely-related disciplines. Indeed, CISE strongly encourages meaningful actions
that&lt;br/&gt;address the longstanding underrepresentation of various
populations including women, minorities&lt;br/&gt;(African Americans/Blacks,
Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native
Hawaiians,&lt;br/&gt;Native Pacific Islanders, and persons from economically
disadvantaged backgrounds), and persons with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities, in the
computing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, only a few (or no)
historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) have participated in
proposal submission/awardees to broadening participation in computing since
2012. Even though there are newer NSF programs, such as Computing Education for
21st Century (CE21) along with Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics-
Computing (STEM-C) Partnerships, there are still few proposals submitted by and
awarded to HBCUs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable HBCU computer
science/computing faculty to collaborate and address the needs associated with
broadening participation and create cross-institutional strategies to increase
research outcomes. Workshop participants will engage in post-workshop meetings
at CS conferences and virtually to increase the level of accountability
associated with NSF grantsmanship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
