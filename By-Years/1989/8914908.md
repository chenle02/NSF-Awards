This award will continue the development of a large charge-coupled device (CCD)
imager optimized for astronomical observing. The end result should be a low-
read-noise, thinned, buttable, ultra-violet (UV) and infrared (IR) sensitive CCD
having 2400 X 800 pixels each 13.5 microns square. The surface will be flat and
treated with oxide and platinum flash-gate plus anti-reflection coatings to
provide the maximum possible sensitivity to light in the wavelength range 300 nm
to 1 micron. This CCD will be similar to, but a significant improvement on, a
commercially-available Reticon CCD developed under a previous NSF grant. Costs
of the continued development program will be shared by EG&G Reticon and by the
University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/LO).
