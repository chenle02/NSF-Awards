In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,
Professor Lee H. Spangler of Montana State University will study the effect of
the electronic state of a molecule on interactions between its non-rigid parts.
Specifically, methyl and amine interactions will be examined as a function of
distance in molecules with pi-electron systems using various spectroscopic
techniques applied to samples prepared in a supersonic jet expansion. An
understanding of the influence of electronic state on conformational changes is
expected to result. %%% The large amplitude, low frequency motions of molecules
affect the conformational preferences and reaction specificity of those
molecules. For example, knowledge of the conformation of a reagent molecule
obtained from the fundamental study of the structure of a much smaller related
species allowed one researcher to devise a synthetic route for a large class of
polyether antibiotics. A detailed understanding of what determines
conformational preferences as a function of molecular environment and electronic
state is also key to understanding biological activity. The current project aims
at gathering conformational information in several types of molecular systems.
