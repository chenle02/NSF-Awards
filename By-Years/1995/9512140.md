9512140 Penumadu This Academic Research Infrastructure (Acquisition) Award is
made to partially fund the purchase of a combined axial force-torsion closed
loop loading frame with appropriate electronic control interfaces. This testing
apparatus will produce biaxial states of stress and will be used in four ongoing
research projects involving clay soils, polycrystalline metals, electrical
conduction in reinforced cement composites and cold region research. Graduate
and undergraduate research students will be able to tremendously improve their
research training with this equipment. ***
