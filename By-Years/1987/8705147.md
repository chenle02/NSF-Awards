The development of a low heat rejection diesel or combination diesel and gas
turbine engine requires lubricants and machine surfaces capable of operation at
temperatures of 500 degrees C and above. If solid lubricants are used, it is
dificult to replenish them. One method of replacement is the generation of
lubricant carbon by catalytic dissociation or reduction of combustion gases on
the wear surfaces themselves. A study of such a process has been underway using
an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system to obtain well-defined surfaces and conditions.
This system was designed to allow in-place analysis of friction, wear, surface
probile (by optical profilometry), environmental and desorbed gases (by mass
spectrometry), and surface adsorbates (by emission infrared Fourier spectroscopy
FTIR, through windows). For the exact definition of the wear surface, Auger
electron spectroscopy (AES) with a dedicated instrument is essential. For
surface kinetic measurements the FTIR needs upgrading. When ethylene was used as
a test gas the friction coefficient for nickel-containing alloys or ceramics
provided with a transfer film of nickel-containing alloy was reproducibly
reduced by factors of six or more.
