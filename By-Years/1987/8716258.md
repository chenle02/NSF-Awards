The James Ross Basin contains the only exposed sequence of Upper Cretaceous to
Lower Tertiary marine strata in Antarctica. This sequence was deposited in an
back-arc basin related to the development of the mid-Mesozoic to mid-Tertiary
"Andean" active plate margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. Seymour Island has
strata of Campanian to Oligocene age. These poorly consolidated sedimentary
rocks contain a diverse invertebrate fauna that for the most part shows
exceptional preservation. Plant microfossils are also common, and the vertebrate
faunas include the first fossil marsupial from Antarctica. The Campanian to
Paleocene sequence also spans the K/T boundary. This sequence provides the
opportunity to investigate the tectonic evolution of the Antarctic Peninsula
cordillera through study of the depositional settings of the strata,
paleocurrent data, provenance of the detrital sediment, and petrology of the
contemporaneous volcanic material. Results of these field and laboratory studies
will be combined with information on the magmatic history of the cordillera to
model the tectonic evolution of the source terrain which occupied the region of
the northern Antarctic Peninsula.
