This project involves the study of a sample of children in Dominica. The
project builds on long-term research on variations in corticosteroid stress
response and socio-cultural variables. Using randomized scan sampling techniques
as well as standard participant observation and interviews with family members,
the project will assess the behavioral correlates to biochemical variation in
hormonal assays related to stress in a sample of 126 children. This sort of
research is important because the many studies of the causes of children's
stress have not examined biochemical variables as they vary with micro-level
differences in family composition and interaction styles. This project will
generate data that will be useful in advancing our understanding of the causes
of childhood stress.
