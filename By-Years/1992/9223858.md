In April 1991, the University of Southern California developed, organized and
managed the subsequent conference, COSU-II, held in Long Beach, California with
the same sponsors as the COSU-I. The experience with the COSU- II conference was
much the same as COSU-I: 150 delegates from 14 foreign countries and the U.S.
attended the meeting for three days of discussions about new directions in
technology and policies for managing ocean coasts. In all, more than 30 papers
were presented at the conference and those papers have been organized into a
proceedings. The COSU-II conference is now successfully completed and the USC
Sea Grant Program is now preparing the conference proceedings. With a generous
grant from the Max and Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, we have been able to have
all of the papers entered into a single computer file in preparation for editing
and publication. This action provides funds to complete publication of the
proceedings.
