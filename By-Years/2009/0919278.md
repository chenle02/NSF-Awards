This proposal, from the University of Minnesota, requests funds for the design
of a Facility for the Assay and Acquisition of Radio pure Materials (or FAARM),
which is to include a dedicated, water-shielded room located at the 4850 ft.
level, housed in a standard lab module (20m by 20m by 50 to
75m).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award, through a Cooperative Agreement, will fund
the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities and collaborators to produce a
Preliminary Design for such a facility to be constructed at DUSEL for
experiments requiring extremely low backgrounds. Assay and acquisition of radio
pure materials is essential to the success of a wide range of experiments at
DUSEL, which therefore must include a low background counting facility. This
work is inherently broad in impact, in that it creates screening infrastructure
for use by both the rare event search community, as well as other scientific
fields - many of general interest, such as national security, archaeology,
public health, and environmental monitoring. Also, it will provide training of
scientists in radiation-detection technologies and low-background techniques,
which supplement the country's technical intelligence base, both inside and
outside physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
