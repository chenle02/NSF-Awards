9553134 Rockmore The investigator uses this Presidential Faculty Fellowship to
pursue an interdisciplinary course of research and educational innovation,
unified by the themes of group theory and computation. The primary research
activity centers upon the continued theoretical and practical development of
generalized fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Among the generalizations pursued
are the efficient computation of Fourier transforms on finite and compact Lie
groups and efficient polynomial transforms. Current approaches to these sorts of
problems draw on the areas of group representation theory, the theory of
operator algebras and sampling theory. Practical considerations and goals demand
that implementational aspects such as numerical stability and computational
overhead be addressed as well, and in so doing require the tools and techniques
of numerical analysis, as well as some knowledge of the targeted applications
areas. This sort of interdisciplinary paradigm also informs the educational
approach. Under development are several interdisciplinary courses, intended to
increase mathematics interest and awareness among undergraduates by highlighting
the connections of mathematics to other disciplines. Arguably, the ``classical''
FFT is one of the most important computational techniques ever developed. It is
the fundamental tool behind most of digital signal processing and as such
impacts society in all aspects, playing a key role in areas such as medical
imaging, defense, telecommunications, high performance computing, and
entertainment. The utility of the classical FFT indicates that perhaps similar
success may be obtained from applying these newly developed generalized FFTs,
and a large part of this proposal is directed towards this end. To date,
applications of these new computational methods have been identified in areas
such as climate modeling, image processing, medical imaging, astronomy and
statistics. These are being pursued actively. The connection that this work
evinces between pure research and ``real-world'' application is tremendously
useful as an educational model. By focusing on this type of theme, the
investigator works towards enhancing the current mathematics curriculum with the
goal of increasing mathematics enrollments and awareness and in so doing working
towards rebuilding the national scientific infrastructure.
