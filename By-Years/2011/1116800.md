This project provides communication security in a new way, based on channel
noise rather than standard cryptographic constructs and algorithms. The idea is
old, from work in the 1970s in the information-theory and coding field, but this
classical work used weak security metrics and even then was not able to provide
any explicit and practical designs. This research bridges the gap between this
classical work and modern cryptography. First, it provides a sound theoretical
basis in the form of security metrics that are adapted from modern cryptography
and demand much stronger security than the classical metrics. Second, it
provides explicit, efficient and optimal methods to achieve security under these
metrics based only on the assumption that the channel from sender to adversary
is noisier than the channel from sender to receiver. Unlike standard
cryptography, this approach is not vulnerable to advances in algorithms and
adversary computing power and thus provides a new option to secure highly
sensitive information.
