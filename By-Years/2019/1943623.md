It is becoming increasingly important to automate low-level aspects of
programming to help developers increase productivity and avoid mistakes. Program
synthesis is an emerging technology for automatically generating programs from
high-level descriptions of the task they must perform. Making program synthesis
practical requires addressing two major challenges:(1) how should the programmer
communicate their intent to the synthesizer? and (2) how does one efficiently
search the space of all programs the synthesizer needs to
consider?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Type-Driven Synthesis project (TyDriS)
tackles both of these challenges using a novel type-based approach, which
leverages decades of work on type systems from the Programming Languages
community for the benefit of program synthesis. Towards the challenge of
specification, TyDriS contributes powerful languages that allow the programmer
to communicate a lot of information very concisely, and get relevant results
even in the presence of ambiguity. Towards the challenge of scale, TyDriS
contributes new search algorithms that allow synthesis to leverage large code
libraries and integrate synthesized code with programmer-written code. These
innovations enable three novel applications: a library-based synthesizer for
Haskell, a privacy-aware web framework, and a synthesis-aided programming
tutor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
