The three-week course enhances the knowledge and instructional skills of faculty
members in the field of manufacturing engineering. This course is intended to
help alleviate the shortage of qualified instructors in manufacturing
engineering by upgrading existing faculty. The course comprises three sessions:
Session I: Clinic and Instruction in Manufacturing Engineering; Session II:
Productivity- Related Projects; Session III: Product Quality-Related Factors.
The participants and their institutions provide support for this project that
are about 70% of the NSF award.
