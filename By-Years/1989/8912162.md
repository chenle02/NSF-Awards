Description: This project supports paricipation by ten U.S. scientists in the
1989 International Conference on Plasma Physics to be held November 22-28, 1989
in New Delhi, India. The conference attempts to bring together physicists whose
research covers the entire area of plasma physics dealing with fusion, space,
laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. In addition to the conference itself,
numerous satellite meetings and workshops will provide occasions to bring
scientists together in different centers of plasma physics research in India.
The co-organizer is Professor A. Sen of the Institute for Plasma Research in
Bhat, Gandhinagar, India. Scope: This conference being held in New Delhi
represents a combination of the 8th Kiev Internation Conference on Plasma Theory
and the 8th International Congress on Waves and Instabilities in Plasmas which
were held separately in the past. This combination provides for interaction
between important subfields of plasma physics. The meeting will also help
highlight the results of the growing efforts of the last several years in plasma
physics research in India, and bring to focus the potential benefits of
collaboration and exchange of information between U.S. and Indian scientists in
the fields of fusion and space physics.
