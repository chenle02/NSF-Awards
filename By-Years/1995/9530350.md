This award will support purchase and modification of instruments to permit more
effective analyses of trace metals and nutrients, concentrating on Cd and P. An
atomic absorption spectrophotometer will be purchased and modified to be able to
analyze trace elements in-line from water samples. An ion chromotograph and
flourescence detector will be added to an existing nutrient analyzer.
