Colonies of most termite species are founded by a single male and female
monogamous pair. In a few species, however, colonies can be established by up to
90 functional kings and queens. A series of experiments using the Neotropical
termite Nasutitermes corniger will test if groups of multiple kings and queens
are more successful in establishing new colonies than monogamous pairs when
faced with disease producing microorganisms such as nematodes, fungi and
bacteria. The number of infected kings and queens will be manipulated and their
survival and success in establishing colonies will be compared to that of
monogamous pairs. This research will provide an understanding of the evolution
of breeding strategies in social insects and their mechanisms to cope with
disease while living in large and complex societies.

This research has implications for the development of new and effective
biological control methods against social insect pests, which may help reduce
the need for toxic pesticides in the environment. Studying the interactions
between pathogens or parasites and social animals increases the understanding of
the effect that social behavior has on the transmission and infection rates of
important emerging diseases such as SARS, Ebola and West Nile virus.
