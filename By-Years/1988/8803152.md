Future technological needs for ceramics will be great. A great deal of research
in advanced ceramics is necessary now so that its potential for unique
structural, electronic, and optical properties will be available to develop the
crucial new industrial processes and products necessary for continued industrial
growth. Industry has recognized this need and appears to be willing to support
an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Micro-Engineered
Ceramics. This project is funding the initiation of an Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Micro- Engineered Ceramics at the University of
New Mexico in collaboration with New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology
and in association with Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The
research program is addressing: 1. Novel powder processing schemes for
controlled morphology powder compacts; 2. Coatings and porous films; and 3.
Heavy particle modification of ceramics and effects on thermal and electronic
properties. Industry funding will exceed $300,000 per year. In addition to the
National Science Foundation, the two National Laboratories are committing
$500,000 per year to the Center. In addition to a complete return of overhead on
industrial funds to the Center, the University of New Mexico has committed
$800,000 in start-up funding for new personnel and other long-term investments
for the infrastructure of the Center. New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology is contributing two graduate students to the Center. The Principal
Investigator and his university and National Laboratory research colleagues in
the Center are nationally recognized experts in their fields. They represent a
very strong research team that has the capability and industrial contacts to
establish and run an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center. The
Program Manager recommends that a cooperative agreement be made with the
University of New Mexico in collaboration with New Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology. Total funding for the cooperative agreement is not to exceed
$750,000 over five years.
