9320651 Butler This award funds two Iris Indigo workstations to gather network
performance measurements for traffic between the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications and the three other NSF-funded supercomputer centers.
The centers have joined together to form a national Metacenter, to be linked by
a high-speed network called the National Computational Environment. The
dedicated probe platform supported by this award provides a mechanism for
testing, measuring and improving network performance over the existing and
future communication links. Duration of the award is one year. ***
