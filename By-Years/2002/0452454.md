This grant is to help defray the costs of ten students and/or postdoctoral
researchers in attending the workshop: "Bacterial spores: Challenges for
Biodefense" will be held November 14-16, 2004 at Argonne National Laboratories
in Argonne, IL. The purpose of the meeting is to address cutting edge topics in
bacterial spore biological research, to build contacts between academic
scientists and government researchers, and to sharpen the focus of these two
complementary components of the research community with regard to biodefense.
Participation by academics will allow their knowledge of the basic biology of
spores to enhance ongoing biodefense efforts and provide insights into
directions for future research. Because of the unusual mix of academics and
government scientists, this meeting will provide a unique opportunity for
researchers from a wide variety of institutions to meet, exchange ideas,
identify colleagues with specialized knowledge and initiate novel
collaborations. Specific efforts have been made in recruiting women and
minorities to attend the workshop. This event will also serve to introduce young
scientists to the biodefense community, to help ensure that integration between
academia and government laboratories continues in the long term.
