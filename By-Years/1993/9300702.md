The patterns and causes of arctic decade- to century-scale climate variability
are poorly understood, most significantly because annually-dated records of past
environmental change from this region are sparse. This award supports the
retrieval of a Baffin Island network of climate records spanning the last 500 to
2000 years. Cores will be collected from three lakes. The varve chronologies
will be tested rigorously using 210-Pb and bomb radionuclides. Annually-dated
time series of fossil pollen, varve thickness, and Ge/Si ratios will be
generated. This effort will yield the first network of annually-dated
paleoclimate and paleoecological time series from arctic lake sediments. This
project will be the first PALE (Paleoclimates for Arctic Lakes and Estuaries)
effort to map out the patterns of decade-to century- scale change of the past
1000 years.
