ABSTRACT

Proposal #: 0329106 Title: Micromanipulation of Flexible and Rigid Objects PI:
Ron Lumia University of New Mexico

The goal of this work is to develop a better theoretical and practical
understanding of how to grasp rigid and flexible objects that range in size
between 1-100 microns. We will develop a model for the ionic polymer metal
composite (IPMC) material that will be used to implement a microgripper. This
electroactive material exhibits large deflection from only a few volts of
actuation. Technically, there are two fundamental areas we will explore. The
first relates to how small the IPMC material can be cut and still function as a
microgripper. We will develop a new model for the microscale properties of this
material. Using this model we will predict microgripper performance, e.g.,
strength, and test the model by building a variety of microgrippers. The second
issue relates to releasing objects. Since gravity for small objects is several
orders of magnitude smaller than other adhesive forces, a new approach to
release objects will be explored. We propose to inject a short voltage pulse
into a microgripper finger just at the moment it tries to release an object.
This will change the polarity of the electrostatic charge stored at the finger,
thus driving the object from the finger. The impact of this work can be
significant because the microgripper is an enabling technology for a variety of
applications. Microgrippers will be needed to grasp, manipulate, and place small
components to create products. For flexible objects, microgrippers can
manipulate cells for applications such as rapid and inexpensive DNA processing.
