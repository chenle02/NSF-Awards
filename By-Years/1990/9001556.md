This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Paul Fons of the
University of Illinois to conduct collaborative research for 12 months with Dr.
Teruaki Motooka of the University of Tsukuba, Japan. They will investigate the
basic mechanisms of solid-phase epitaxy of amorphous silicon on crystalline
silicon and the physics of silica/silicon interfaces. Semiconductor processing
technologies are becoming increasing dependent on a detailed understanding of
non-equilibrium solid- phase interfaces and growth mechanisms. This study will
attempt to characterize interfacial properties using Raman spectroscopy, time-
resolved ellipsometry, and electrical measurements. Interfacial structure will
be modeled using both Molecular-Orbital and Molecular Dynamics calculations. Dr.
Motooka's extensive experience with the theoretical analysis of interface
structure and proficiency in the interpretation of related experimental data
should complement and focus Dr. Fon's broad background in metallurgy, solid-
state physics, solid-state devices, and computer simulations.
