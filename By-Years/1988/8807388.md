This grant in the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program will support a
series of three annual "Workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products
Chemistry." These workshops have the dual purposes of (1) providing an effective
forum for informal discussion among young scientists of current research in
topical areas of organic synthesis and natural products, and (2) assisting the
Program staff in identifying areas and the researchers which will aid in the
Program's long-range planning. The specific goals of this workshop include: 1.
The dynamic exchange of ideas in organic synthesis and natural products
chemistry among a small group (about 20) of active young research workers in
these fields. 2. Encouragement of an attitude of cooperation among individuals
working in related areas, and, by the same token, avoidance of duplicative
efforts. 3. Stimulation of participants to study new problems and methods in
synthetic and natural products chemistry. 4. Creation of an atmosphere in which
the scientific and social interaction among participants will be both fruitful
and pleasant.
