CAREER: Origin and evolution of volatiles in submarine and subglacial alkalic
magmas Jacqueline Eaby Dixon, Principal Investigator, University of Miami The PI
proposes to investigate the origin and evolution of volatiles in alkalic magmas
from submarine and subglacial volcanoes. The goal is to better understand
variations in mantle volatile contents and the role of volatiles in controlling
eruption dynamics of mafic melts. Sample suites include tholeiitic and alkalic
glasses from Hawaii, the Southern Australs, and subglacial volcanoes in British
Columbia. Concentrations and isotopic analyses of the major volatile species
(H2O and CO2) will be measured using infrared spectroscopy, manometry/mass-
spectrometry, and quantitative image analysis. The education component includes
introducing interdisciplinary freshman seminars to enhance the undergraduate
experience; for example, combining volcanology and archeology to study the
impact of volcanism on human evolution. The seminars will be linked to field
trips to key locales around the Caribbean and Mexico (Miami's "back door"). Also
the PI will collaborate with Dr. James Hay at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
(LDEO) in a program to increase use of the "web" in earth science teaching.
