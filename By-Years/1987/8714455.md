This award supports collaborative research on the physics of random-disordered
media. Various theoretical methods will be used to develop more exact solutions
for electron transport in disordered media under the influence of random
impurity distributions, electron-photon interactions, and electron-electron
interactions than were previously possible. Greater exactness is expected
through use of a non-perturbational approach. Improved understanding of the
physics of disordered media should contribute to the potential for expanded
application of disordered material in important areas of materials science such
as further development of submicron devices, solar cells, and planar displays.
This collaborative research between Dr. Joseph Birman, City College, CUNY, and
Professor Su Zhaobin, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), is jointly supported by NSF and CAS under the US/PRC Protocol on
Cooperation in Basic Sciences.
