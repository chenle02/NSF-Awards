The P.I. will attempt to apply current methodology from nonlinear programming to
the solution of unconstrained optimization problems arising in applications of
neural nets. The four main areas of investigation are: solving large problems
using recent developments in conjugate gradient and Newton methods; development
of methods for obtaining global as opposed to strictly local solutions;
application of sensitivity theory to provide post-optimality analysis; use of
factorable function theory to develop varieties of functional forms describing
the input-output relations.
