#ATM-9508621 Dixon This project is a continuation of an REU (Research
Experiences for Undergraduates) program at NMIMT. It will involve eight faculty
members in the fields of atmospheric chemistry and physics and provide eight
students per year with an opportunity to participate in research over a period
of eight weeks. The program will start with overview seminars and conclude with
presentations by the students on their work. A special effort is made to recruit
women and minority students from nearby small colleges and universities that
have limited research resources. Opportunities for recreational activities will
add to the attraction of the program. The following research topics will be
available to the participants: Cloud physics: Students will be able to
participate in field measurements using aircraft to study the formation of large
drops and processes leading to precipitation; Cloud chemistry: Students will
participate in the collection of aerosol particles and the measurement of trace
species in the samples as well as analysis and interpretation with regard to SO2
oxidation in clouds Radiative processes: Students will use radiative transfer
models to study the influence of clouds and greenhouse gases on climate, and
analyze satellite data to determine the radiative forcing due to greenhouse
gases; Atmospheric chemistry: Students will conduct laboratory studies on the
effect of acid deposition on zooplankton, measure the direct emission of
aldehydes and carboxylic acids from plants, and perform laboratory studies on
the effects of electrical discharge on the chemical composition of the local
atmosphere; Atmospheric radioactivity: Students will participate in outdoor
measurements of natural Radon isotopes and analyze samples; Atmospheric
electricity: Students will study artificially formed fulgurites (tubes of earth
fused by the heat of lightning currents); the effectiveness of different
lightning rod designs, and participate in aircraft and balloon measurements of
electric field and precipitation particles in thunderclouds.
