9400945 Lewis Lewis will investigate a number of problems related to embeddings
of continua in manifolds and other spaces with a uniform structure. Techniques
involving inverse limits, accessibility, and prime end structure will be
studied. He is seeking characterizations of when various inverse limits can be
embedded in the plane and when homeomorphisms of continua can be extended to
homeomorphisms of the plane. He is also investigating continua with the property
that all of their nondegenerate proper subcontinua are equivalently embedded, or
which admit rigid embeddings in the plane, and various homogeneous embeddings in
real 3-space. Determining the existence of an indecomposable continuum which is
almost homogeneously embedded in the plane will be important in the study of
dynamics. Questions relating embeddings and extensions of maps to computation of
Hausdorff dimension and to attractors and cofrontiers are among dynamic topics
related to this project. Lewis hopes to narrow the currently large gap between
known theorems and existing examples in the theory of continua by broadening the
base of the theory and looking for generic classes of examples and construction
techniques. Recent work in discrete dynamics indicates that considerations of
embeddings and extensions of maps are crucial in identifying which sets can be
attractors or closures of orbits, how sensitive dynamic properties are to
perturbation, and what type dynamics is possible or even generic. These
investigations should yield more information about the continua themselves and
new ways of approaching problems which until now have proven slow to yield to
attacks. Possibilities for new approaches lie in the areas of decompositions,
homogeneity, characterizations of spaces, and investigations of subcontinua. ***
