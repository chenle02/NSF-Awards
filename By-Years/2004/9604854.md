9604854 Andres This U.S.-Mexico award will provide support for Dr. Robert J.
Andres, University of Alaska, to travel to Mexico to plan a research
collaboration with Drs. Hugo Delgado Granados and Ignacio Galindo at the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and Universidad de Colima respectively,
on the improvement of volcanic emissions measurement. During this visit, Dr.
Andrade will update his Mexican colleagues on final results of lab experiments,
work to enhance Mexico's on-going correlation spectrometer monitoring efforts,
and conclude planning on a collaborative research proposal. In order for this
project to proceed, Dr. Andrade needs to meet face-to-face with his colleagues
and to visit the volcanoes being considered for study. There are two active
volcanoes in Mexico, Popocatepetl and Colima. In addition, this visit is being
scheduled to coincide with the PIs attendance at the International Association
of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior. It is hoped that during
this meeting the PIs will be able to identify others who can be added to this
collaboration, who have similar or supportive interests. ***
