This award is providing a series of hands-on professional and curriculum
development workshops and follow-up activities for HS and TYC physics teachers
who serve students involved in technology-based or technician careers. The
workshops are focussed toward the effective integration and implementation of
technology and the use of active learning strategies in areas such as
microcomputer-based laboratories, digital video, computer simulations,
conceptual tasks and tools, web and Internet activities, group work, assessment
of learning, and physics-related technician education. Activities are linking
participants to previous ATE projects and
industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of the workshops include:&lt;br/&gt;- an
enhanced understanding and appreciation of the needs of the technician
workforce;&lt;br/&gt;- educational programs that deal with technician, workforce
issues;&lt;br/&gt;- the opportunity to identify and evaluate the appropriateness
of the workshop ideas toward meeting the needs of these students and technician
programs;&lt;br/&gt;- knowledge of and experience with recent advances and
applications of computer technology, ATE supported centers and projects,
assessment in student learning, and relevant curriculum materials and
activities;&lt;br/&gt;- the background and incentive to develop, adapt, adopt,
and implement workshop activities and materials into additional courses and
programs; and&lt;br/&gt;- a method to build bridges and to develop working
relationships between TYC and HS physics and technology programs, and local or
regional businesses and industries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&
