9424452 Bertsch We propose to organize an annual summer school in nuclear
physics research, continuing the National Summer School in Nuclear Physics held
annually since 1988. The school would bring together leading researchers to
lecture on their specialties to advanced graduate students in experimental and
theoretical nuclear physics. The overall goal of the schools is to provide
students with a reference frame for defining critical problems of nuclear
physics and the most useful methods of analysis of the problems. This addresses
one weakness in the current nuclear research environment, which is the relative
isolation of university- based nuclear research groups. We also expect that the
close contact with leading researchers will be beneficial in increasing the
number of students going on to productive research careers. ***
