Description: This project will support up to nine U.S. scientists to
participate in a U.S.-Pakistan workshop to discusss research needs both in
biotechology and in conventional areas to enhance the productivity and quality
of oilseed crops. The U.S. team leader is Dr. Milton Gordon, Department of
Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, and the Pakistani team leader
is Dr. S. Riazuddin, Director, Center for Advanced Molecular Biology, University
of Punjab, Lahore. The meeting is supported by the Pakistan Agricultural
Research Center (ARC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). The areas to
be represented by the participants include biochemistry, plant physiology,
molecular biology, plant breeding, agronomy and agricultural planning. The
problems to be tackled include tolerance to harsh soil/water/weather conditions,
susceptability to various diseases, resistance to insects, and the value of the
product for various uses. A national meeting of Pakistani experts will generate
a report on the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of these problems . This
report will be made available to the workshop participants well in advance of
their meeting. The workshop papers and recommendations for research projects
will be published in a proceedings. Scope: The U.S. participants are well known
experts in their research fields and have considerable experience in
developmental work for improving agricultural products. The Pakistani coperating
scientist is one of that country's leading biologist, with considerable
experience in molecular biology and in coordinating activities similar to this
project. The support of the Pakistan ARC is very important because of the
significat scientific resources it has, and to give the results of this project
the weight necessary for future action by the Pakistani side on joint projects.
