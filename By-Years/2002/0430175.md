The objective of this proposal is a means of updating the functionality and
security policies of high-confidence computer systems in a way that is both
dynamic (can be accomplished while the system runs) and safe (does not
compromise the trustworthiness of the system).

This proposal investigates the use of aspect-oriented techniques in the dynamic
configuration of high-confidence software systems. The specification and
implementation and verification of secured components will be studied in an
aspect-oriented style. The addition of new software components, both for
additional functionality and for security, will be modeled as dynamic aspects,
which can modify software during its execution.

Dynamic aspects may allow for flexibility in the dynamic configuration of
software, but they also introduce the possibility for subtle bugs to be
introduced in the interaction between conflicting aspects. A similar problem
(known as the Feature Interaction Problem) has been studied in the
telecommunications field. The experience and techniques from that area will be
brought to bear on security features modeled as aspects.

A class-based, object-oriented language with dynamic advice loading will be
defined. Temporal logic will be used to specify both security properties and the
conditions under which cutpoints apply. Static and dynamic analysis methods will
be developed to identify interactions between aspects. Finally, tools will be
developed to support these methods, and they will be applied in case studies.
