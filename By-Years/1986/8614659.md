An important production line configuration used in flexible manufacturing
systems consists of several assembly stations in series. Usually, each product
type flows through these stations in the same order. Each type, however, may
have different processing times. Some advanced lines have the ability to skip
stations when the jobs require no processing at them. Also, a job can be kept
from being processed on a machine if the preceding job is still being worked
upon. This is commonly known as "blocking" and is a subject of prime interest
for contemporary, just-in-time manufacturing strategies. If too much time is
spent in blocking, total line throughput will be severely degraded. The old
approach to ease blocking has been to place buffers between assembly stations to
absorb differences in processing times. However, modern manufacturing methods
place high priority on reducing work-in process inventory. Thus, finding an
optimal order in which to process the different product types becomes critical
for maximizing line throughput.
