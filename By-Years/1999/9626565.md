9626565 Wolf The proposed research lies in the area of variational calculus and
minimal surfaces. Specifically, two topics are proposed: Teichmuller theoretic
methods for finding minimal surfaces in Euclidean 3-space, and the geometry of a
hyperbolic three-manifold via families of harmonic maps of surfaces thereto.
Minimal surfaces first arose in a series of soap film experiments done by the
Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau in the 19th century. These surfaces have an
area-minimizing property: given a closed contour in space, the minimal surface
spanning it has the smallest surface area amongst all surfaces bounding the same
contour. Because of this and other extremal properties minimal surfaces find
many applications in physics, chemistry and materials research. The proposed
research has to do with constructing families of such minimal surfaces using
complex analysis methods and a study of negatively curved 3-spaces using minimal
surface techniques.
