In the aftermath of the Cold War, politicians and citizens call for more direct
and immediate public benefits from public investments in research. A case in
point is the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), with its mandate to
`combine and interpret data from various sources to produce information readily
usable by policy makers attempting to formulate effective strategies for
preventing, mitigating, and adapting to the effects of global climate change.`
This project is a response to current difficulties in accessing the relevant
literatures and communicating across specializations. The project will identify,
develop, and integrate the accumulated concepts, theories and methods of the
policy sciences and the broader policy movement in ways that will allow
researchers, staff and administrators involved in global change research to use
them to produce accessible information for practical policy purposes. Over the
last half century, the policy sciences have contributed toward integrating
ethics, science and policy. While policy specialists have not achieved
concensus, the intellectual tools have survived decades of practice and peer
review and converged on a common outlook that is contextual, problem-oriented,
and multi-method. Its methods involve translation among functional equivalents
in the specialized vocabularies of the disciplines; historical, case, and
comparative methods; and the methods of applied ethics. Using these concepts and
methods, the principal investigator will develop a book and presentations and
articles that will assist a wide variety of specialists and lay persons with
research and policy mandates concerning global change to address practical
policy issues.
