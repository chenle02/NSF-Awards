9409592 NAGIN This project aims to advance developmental theories of crime and
deviance by examining the life course of different groups of offenders. The
theories offer different explanations of the evolution of antisocial behaviors
from childhood through adulthood. One purpose of this project is to test the
proposition that some individuals are at greatly elevated risk of continuing
antisocial behavior. The research will identify the distinguishing
characteristics of such individuals and measure the impact of events later in
life that appear to cause decreases in criminal behavior for some individuals
and increases for others. This analysis will allow the principal investigator to
determine which theoretical explanation best fits these findings. The analysis
will be conducted on three important data sets: (1) the classic matched sample
of delinquent boys assembled by the Gluecks (Boston area, subjects born in the
1920's), (2) the National Youth Survey (U.S. probability sample of 11 to 17
year- olds in 1976), and (3) the Dunedin, New Zealand survey of a 1972- 73 birth
cohort. The use of these three widely differing data sets will allow the
principal investigator to determine the generality of the findings, thereby
enhancing the theoretical significance of this research. ***
