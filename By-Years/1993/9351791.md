Fuzzy logic is a very rapidly growing technical domain. In an effort to keep our
undergraduate students current in this application field, Milwaukee School of
Engineering is developing a laboratory for the study of fuzzy logic and its
applications. This laboratory will be used primarily for the course Fuzzy Sets
and Applications and in senior projects for electrical, computer, and biomedical
engineering. To a lesser extent this laboratory will also support courses in
virtually every other major at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. The
equipment and software required should be capable of supporting a broad range of
fuzzy logic applications such as control, information retrieval, semantic
analysis, robotics, decision systems, and image recognition. The major equipment
requested consists of a graphical shell for fuzzy computations, expert systems
shell, computation acceleration boards, and developmental cross-compilers as
well as the platform on which to run the applications. Through appropriate use
of these tools students should be capable of studying the semantic nature of
fuzzy sets, the use of expert and decision-making systems, the development of
control systems using common sense knowledge, and the application of fuzzy logic
to image recognition, robotics, and information retrieval. Significant impact
from this laboratory is expected curriculum-wide as fuzzy logic and its
applications continue to pervade industry.
