An REU Site will be formed to bring ten to twelve undergraduate students per
year from across the nation to spend ten weeks during the summer at the J.R.
MacDonald Laboratory at Kansas State University to engage in research in
experimental and theoretical atomic physics. Many exciting and challenging
experiments in atomic collisions are being carried out at the JRM Laboratory
which is equipped with a variety of accelerators and a new EBIS source for
producing multiply charged ions. These undergraduate students will share the
excitement of research and gain experience in using these unique facilities
through their participation in carrying out research with the large body of
faculty and graduate students in the JRM Laboratory. This experience will help
students in making decisions toward a career in scientific research.
