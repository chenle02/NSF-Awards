Engineering NEC (59) This project is developing four learning modules to improve
instruction, student learning of statistical quality control (SQC), and to apply
SQC tools in practice. The learning modules being developed enable a student to
develop the higher-order thinking skills needed to examine and modify a virtual
plant through a web interface to (1) benchmark the quality of a process using
production and quality metrics, (2) apply the Magnificent 7 (common SQC
improvement tools) to identify opportunities for improvement, (3) design and
implement control charts for variables and (4) conduct a process capability
analysis. The modules provide the framework for students to analyze the current
operating condition of a plant, select the most appropriate portion of the plant
to apply SQC tools, design and implement the SQC tool and evaluate the
effectiveness of the quality improvement project. Objectives are being developed
for each module, incorporated into assessing student learning and used as a
feedback mechanism to improve student learning. Hispanic undergraduate and
graduate students are participating in research and two of the three test sites
are Hispanic-serving institutions. Results are being broadly disseminated
through a project website, interactions with three test sites, presentations to
local professional societies and publication of research results.
