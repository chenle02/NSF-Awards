9724941 Lowenthal In this project, a novel measurement approach will be
developed with the goal of relating CCN (cloud condensation nuclei) activity,
particle size distribution, and chemical composition. The objective is to
determine those physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles that
determine their ability to act as CCN. CCN measurements will be carried out on
particles which have been dried and size segregated by two methods: (1) with a
MOUDI cascade impactor, and (2) electrostatic classification with a DMA
(differential mobility analyzer). The CCN spectra of the non-size segregated
aerosol will be measured as well. Detailed chemical composition as a function of
particle size will be determined from MOUDI cascade impactor samples. The
detailed ionic, organic, and mineral composition of particles coupled with their
critical supersaturation spectra will constrain the chemical mixing state of the
CCN. Field sampling will be conducted at a coastal site (Point Reyes, CA), where
the aerosol is mainly marine, and at an inland location (near Reno, NV) which is
exposed to both clean- and polluted-continental conditions, and where the
aerosol composition is expected to be more complex, dominated by nitrates,
sulfates, organic and elemental carbon, and mineral dust.
