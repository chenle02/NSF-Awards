9352946 Hooper The University of Minnesota seeks to initiate a six-week,
commuter, Young Scholars program in Life Sciences for 42 students entering
grades 11 and 12. The program offers students an experience in research that is
unavailable to them in regular high school science classes. Students will
participate in a Research Introductory Program (RIP) and engage in laboratory
research activities under the guidance of faculty mentors and post-doctoral
students at the University of Minnesota.
