The project will develop a variety of video and text-based cybersecurity
educational materials for anyone who is interested or involved in public policy,
and who would benefit from a greater familiarity with the constraints under
which cybersecurity policy making occurs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cybersecurity
education has usually focused on individuals who must take action to improve
their own capabilities to resist cybersecurity threats. But cybersecurity is
also a major public policy issue today - and policy makers need to know about
cybersecurity to make informed decisions. However, policy makers who need to
learn about cybersecurity generally lack the time to learn it deeply - "just-in-
time" learning is a much better way to characterize their approach. Under these
circumstances, their learning framework deviates from that of traditional
students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops cybersecurity education
materials specifically targeted toward individuals who may not have subject
matter expertise about cybersecurity, nor the time to be able to undertake in-
depth, semester(s)-long coursework.
