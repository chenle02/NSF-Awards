9613647 Rose This Americas Program award will support a collaborative research
project between Drs.William Rose, and James Vallance, Michigan Technological
University, and Eric Casamiquela, Comision Ejecutiva del Rio Lempa (CEL), El
Salvador. Scientists from other U.S. Universities and from the U.S. Geological
Survey, as well as the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), and Universidad de El
Salvador (UES), will also collaborate in the project. The award includes support
for several U.S. graduate students and a post- doctoral researcher. The study
will focus on the active volcanoes of El Salvador. The chief goals are to
achieve an understanding of significant volcanic hazards through standard field
methods, and to build an infrastructure for responding to, and mitigating,
volcanic hazards in the region. The proposal is aimed at El Salvador because of
the abundance of excellent research problems there, and because the geological
record indicates that volcanism of types and on scales unprecedented during
historic time may recur in the region. Thus, an understanding of the possible
nature of such events will be necessary in order to mitigate potential future
hazards successfully. ***
