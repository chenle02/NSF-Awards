INT 0122251 Kasal

This U.S.-Czech project between Bohumil Kasal of North Carolina State University
and Milos Drdacky of the Czech Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics
features research, field studies, and development of new methodologies for
evaluating historic timber structures. The techniques used will combine
classical nondestructive methods, semi-destructive methods, statistical data
analysis and simulation, and laboratory verification. The planned semi-
destructive methods measure mechanical and physical properties and involve
removing micro- wood specimens using a core drill and evaluating compression
strength to measure the modulus of elasticity. The nondestructive methods employ
stress wave timing, resistance drilling and digital radioscopy. The team's
overall goal is to systematically derive a comprehensive assessment technology
for historic buildings that can contribute to our knowledge of asset management
for wooden structures.

This engineering project concerning infrastructural materials and structural
mechanics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual
interest and competence.
