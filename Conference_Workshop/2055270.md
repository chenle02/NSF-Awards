The funds will provide travel support for up to twenty junior US based
scientists in operator theory, electrical engineering and physics to attend the
International Workshop on Operator Theory and Applications (IWOTA), which will
be held at Chapman University, Orange, CA during August 9 - 13, 2021. An
important goal is the active participation of young mathematicians, such as
graduate students, post-docs, and other junior level positions. This goal will
be achieved by encouraging every junior participant to give a contributed talk
and by providing space for informal discussions and avenues for future
collaborations. All invited speakers will be asked to ensure that part of their
talks be accessible to young researchers. Due to its yearly international
presence, IWOTA facilitates the enlargement of mathematics networks from all
around the world.

Operator Theory lies at the intersection of several fields such as analysis,
quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, probability, stochastic processes,
signal processing, machine learning, and many others. As quantum physics can be
described via applied operator theory the two special sessions on quantum
physics and on super-oscillations are at the forefront of one of the biggest
challenges of the 21st century: quantum computing. The theory of stochastic
processes and operator theory have numerous intersections, which require deep
tools of operator theory to explore. Stochastic processes and their derivatives
(usually generalized stochastic processes) may be studied using the theory of
Gelfand triples, obtained by applying the Bochner-Minlos theorem to a positive
definite function on a Frechet nuclear space. Replacing the Fock space by the
free Fock space, one arrives at the non-commutative setting. In a similar vein,
replacing the complex numbers by the Grassmann algebra or by a ternary algebra
one gets new connections with super mathematics and manifolds. Four of the
special sessions focus on this circle of ideas. Recent research in bicomplex,
ternary, and quaternionic analysis use operator theory techniques to relate the
intrinsic analytic structure and the many types of operators that arise and
obtain realization formulas in each case. Applicability of some techniques in a
more general hypercomplex setting provides even more applications to physics and
digital signal processing. Ternary algebras are known to be a promising
candidate for the algebraic confinement model for the problem of observability
of three quarks/anti-quarks in Quantum Field Theory.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
