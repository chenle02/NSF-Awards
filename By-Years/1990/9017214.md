This research explores the strengthening and toughening of intermetallic alloys
by introduction of dispersed phases. These materials are technologically
important because of their potential as advanced high temperature materials; the
key is to improve their low temperature ductility and toughness. This study
focusses on transformation toughening in two-phase gamma titanium aluminide with
approximately 10 volume percent beta phase. The goal is to determine
compositions which provide crack tip toughening due to martensite phase
transformation induced by the deformation at the crack front. Experiments are
planned involving the measurement of compressive flow stress, indentation
hardness, and fracture toughness. Microstructural and fractographic analysis
complete the characterization of the specimens.
