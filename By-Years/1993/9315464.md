9315464 Sahney This project is focused on the development and testing of new
decision-design technologies to support the continuous improvement of clinical
processes in the health care delivery environment. It is hypothesized that the
quality and cost-effectiveness of medical care can be improved significantly
through the use of quality improvement teams comprised of physicians and non-
physicians, armed with (1) a limited amount of training in continuous quality
improvement (CQI) and clinical policy analytic concepts and methods, (2) the
support of a physician and/or non-physician with additional training and
dedicated time to devote to team- related work, and (3) access to a specific set
of microcomputer-based decision-support tools. The final product of the project
would be a decision-design technology that could be used by quality improvement
teams in clinical process improvement projects. ***
