With this grant Drs. McAlister and Hartkopf at Georgia State University will
continue a program of high angular resolution observations of binary star
systems. Binary stars are the only source for the fundamental determination of
stellar masses, and they can provide direct determinations of stellar distances,
radii, luminosities, and temperatures. The Georgia State University (GSU)
program of binary star of binary star speckle interferometry is the only such
effort in the world routinely applying modern methods of high resolution imaging
speckle techniques to these fundamental astrophysical problems. The GSU speckle
group operates state-of- the-art data acquisition and analysis facilities and is
routinely granted time on large telescopes at the U.S. national observatories
and elsewhere. Speckle observations are being used to greatly improve the
orbital elements of known binaries and to calculate the orbits of resolved
spectroscopic systems and other newly discovered binaries. Techniques are also
being developed and applied that enable the recovery of intensity and color
information for the individual components of binary stars in a regime of angular
separation heretofore inaccessible to existing methods.
