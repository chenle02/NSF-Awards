Lalley Research will be conducted in two distinct areas: (1) stochastic
processes, especially stochastic growth models, on graphs with 'hyperbolic'
geometries; and (2) filtering and inference for time series produced by chaotic
dynamical systems. In the first area, the primary objective is an understanding
of how 'hyperbolicity' influences the behavior of certain fundamental stochastic
processes, including random walks, branching random walks, contact processes,
and percolation, and to elucidate the nature of the different phase transitions
that occur in such processes. In the second area, the goal is to develop
statistical procedures for analyzing time series data produced by systems
governed by 'chaotic' dynamics. In particular, situations where data from
deterministic, but chaotic, systems is corrupted by external 'noise' will be
studied. The goals of the research will be (a) to determine when, and how,
chaotic 'signals' can be extracted from noisy time series; and (b) to develop
procedures for inference about the governing dynamical laws based on raw time
series data. Stochastic growth processes are crude mathematical models for the
growth and spread of populations in time and space. Understanding of the
mathematical laws governing the evolution of such processes may also contribute
to our understanding of how epidemics develop, how favorable genes are
disseminated in large populations, and how information makes its way through
large communications networks. The notion of a 'phase transition', a drastic
change in the qualitative behavior of a system precipitated by a small change in
the parameters governing it, is especially important, because understanding the
nature of such transitions may have ramifications for the development of
intervention strategies.
