Field and archival data on indigenous Micronesian farming systems and several
physical environmental factors will be brought to bear on three anthropological
issues: 1) the extent to which these farming systems are optimal adaptive
solutions to the problem of land-based subsistence, given the tropical island
environments in which they occur, 2) the extent to which the present Micronesian
high island landscapes, and past landscape changes through time, can be
attributed to prehistoric farming, and 3) the extent to which farming systems
research in Micronesia can contribute to a practical understanding of the
reasons for successes and failures in agricultural technology transfers from
first to third world cultural systems. Dr. Hunter-Anderson will offer an upper
division course in Pacific archaeology and a seminar on appropriate field work
strategies. Additionally, she will organize a cross-country teleconference
featuring women anthropologists, active and retired, from a variety of
occupations. The teleconference will enable these successful women scientists to
share their experiences and perspectives. Dr. Hunter-Anderson will also give
guest lectures at other UC campuses and in the local community. This project
furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide opportunities for women
to advance their careers in engineering and in the disciplines of science
supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and
engineering by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers
employed in industry, government, and academic institutions. By encouraging the
participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the Nation's
future scientific vitality.
