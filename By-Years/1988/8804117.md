This grant will allow the PI's to continue their research into the behavior of
particle-laden convective plumes from volcanoes, with additional fluid dynamic
experiments and new studies of the Tambora 1815 eruption deposits. New fluid
dynamic experiments will be conducted to look at 1) coignimbrite-type plumes
generated off of sediment gravity flows, 2) the factors which control the style
and transitions of two-phase plume collapse, and 3) the role of entrainment in
affecting particle fallout and the generation of dilute gravity flows at plume
edges. New field studies will be carried out on the distal Tambora 1815 tephra
fall to examine the grain size, component abundances and distribution. The data
will be used in conjunction with crystal/glass fractionation studies of proximal
pyroclastic flows to characterize the generation and dispersal of the large co-
ignimbrite ash component of this eruption.
