This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
innovative fault-tree-based methodology for dependability analysis of complex
computer-based systems. The innovativeness of this approach stems from
consideration of multiple failure modes, incorporation of human and
environmental influences, adaptation of new techniques from circuit analysis,
and using divide and conquer techniques for evaluation of large models. The
Phase I objective is to develop an enhanced methodology for dependability
analysis of complex computer-based systems. The Phase II objectives are to fully
develop and implement a commercializable dependability analysis tool that
incorporates the techniques and methods devised in Phase I. The anticipated
result of the Phase I effort is the feasibility demonstration indicating that
the new methodology will significantly enhance dependability analysis of complex
computer-based systems. The benefits include increased effectiveness in this
analysis and the potential for more dependable, reliable, and safe systems.
