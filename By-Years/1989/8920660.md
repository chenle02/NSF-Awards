This research will involve the formulation, analysis and computational solution
of several fundamental mathematical models of production and inventory systems.
Two critical managerial issues will be addressed: (1) Inventory control in a
fluctuating environment. This topic includes inventory management for products
subject to technological obsolescence and for new products, accounting for
supply uncertainties, and coping with fluctuating interest rates. New models and
new methods will be developed to handle these pervasive phenomena. (2)
Coordination of procurement and production activities. Here focus is on the
problems arising from the need to manage many different products in concert and
from two additional sources of complexity, uncertain demands and capacity
limits. Specifically, methods will be developed for managing the joint
procurement of multiple products under uncertain demand, and for production
scheduling when several products share a group of machines.
