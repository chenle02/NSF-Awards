The ability of molecular cations to migrate and undergo chemical reactions will
be determined in a variety of different environments including low viscosity
liquids at room temperature, glasses at 77 K, and highly viscous oligomers and
polymers. Polymers to be investigated range from chloropolymers such as
polyvinylchloride to polystyrene and polyethylene. The cationic species will be
generated by exposure of polycyclic hydrocarbons such as anthracene,
naphthalene, and pyrene to high-energy radiation produced from a Fabretron. The
resulting cationic species will be detected by transient spectroscopy on a
picosecond time scale. In addition to the kinetic analysis of the cation
migration rate, an investigation of the rate of fluorescence quenching of both
absorbed and surface bound pyrene at solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces of
silicon oxide will be conducted. The effect of the surface on the generation of
charged species from exciplexes will also be determined by diffuse reflectance
transient absorption spectroscopy. The results of these investigations will lead
to a better understanding of the reactions of cationic species at surfaces and
the factors governing efficient quenching processes. %%% This grant from the
Organic Dynamics Program supports the continuing work of Professor J. Kerry
Thomas at the University of Notre Dame. The studies will be directed toward
understanding the effect of surfaces on the reactivity of chemical substances
and will provide critical data which will allow the development of more
efficient chemical systems. The investigation will utilize equipment capable of
detecting events on the order of less than a billionth of a second. Thus it will
be possible to measure the rapid hopping of charged species in a variety of
media. The use of target molecules which undergo rapid fluorescence decay
processes provides a means of monitoring chemical processes on a time scale
which would otherwise be inaccessible.
