9402533 SOLBERG This award supports Purdue University's ERC on the
"Collaborative Manufacturing" system. The activities include 1.) integrated
product and process development with customer's supplier chain, 2.) flexible
manufacturing distributed over networks of cooperating facilities, 3.) teamwork
among geographically and organizationally distributed organizational units,
which may be highly diverse in size, capabilities, and culture, and 4.) use of
high-technology support for collaboration, including high-speed information
networks and integration methodology. The central focus of the proposed research
is the investigation of fundamental engineering principles that are critical to
the success of collaborative manufacturing or test the limits of the concept in
case of the most demanding requirements. The ultimate goal is to create the
enabling tools and help manufacturing companies and students learn how to make
effective use of the new opportunities. There are three major thrusts for the
new proposal: 1.) Coherent Product Realization which deals with the issues
related to bringing new products into production, supported by the previously-
developed technologies in distributed concurrent engineering, performance
evaluation design, and product and process simulation; 2.) Coherent Process
Integration which relates to analysis and synthesis tools required for
integrating all of the activities associated with production; and 3.) Coherent
Production System Tools which targets the issues at a system level such as
modelling of collaborative production system, decision support structures, and
distributed implementation. This award provides support for the ERC for 5 years.
In addition, a supplementary award with funds provided by the Army Redstone
Missile Command to fund a research project to adapt, extend, and apply research
in rapid product manufacturing techniques demonstrated by the Purdue Engineering
Research Center (ERC's) Qui ck Turnaround Cell (QTC) system and to support a
testbed installation at the Army Redstone Missile Command Production Engineering
Division for the purpose of validation and technology transfer. The major thrust
for this project is to implement the developed research tools for designing and
planning of cylindrical parts. The newly developed design tools will be
installed and tested at Army Redstone Missile Command. This system contains new
features developed to represent cylindrical and hybrid parts for turning and
milling operations. In addition, the interface module will be installed and
implemented to validate the simulation results. ***
