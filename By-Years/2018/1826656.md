This project investigates how European colonization in the Americas shaped the
genetic diversity and shifting demographic and social practices within settler
populations. Although numerous studies have explored the effects of European
colonialism on indigenous populations, less is known about the effects of
colonization on the settlers themselves. This study combines archaeological,
ethnohistorical, and genetic analyses to document changes in population
structure and genetic demography in a population of colonial settlers and their
modern-day descendants. The project will advance our understanding of how
biological and social identities emerged in the colonial Americas, and also will
expand the currently very limited colonial-era genomic data from the Americas.
This project provides training in archaeological and anthropological genetic
methods and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and
supports community and public science outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
uses next-generation sequencing techniques, target capture, and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to assess genome-wide diversity and genetic
ancestry in individuals excavated from the St. George's Caye cemetery and from
contemporary Belizeans who trace at least one genealogical lineage back to 18th
century British Honduras. The genetic data generated will be used to answer
questions about the genetic ancestry of the populations, the degree of
population continuity and change, and whether or not genetic inferences of
identity reflect archaeological and self-reported understandings of identity in
colonial and contemporary contexts. The project merges diverse research
methodologies to shed light on the processes of identity formation and
ethnogenesis in colonial contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
