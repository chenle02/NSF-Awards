In recent years, the need for developing techniques and methodologies for the
design, representation and manipulation of transactions or behaviors has become
clear. This research focuses on the study and development of theoretical
foundations for object-based database manipulation languages. Several
fundamental problems concerning dynamic constraints and update transactions in
the context of semantic and object-based models are investigated. One aspect is
the formal analysis of object behaviors under a behavior modeling construct used
to compose andstructure transactions in projects TAXIS, INSYDE, DAIDA, etc. The
initial study is based on a simple object-oriented data model including class
hierarchies, attributes ranging over printable values, and methods. Another
topic is the study of behavior modeling primitives as new kinds of dynamic
constraint and also compare them with other kinds of dynamic constraint. More
general database models (e.g., to allow attributes ranging over classes) are
also considered. The investigations into these problems yield a better
understanding of these modeling constructs and insights into the impact of
Object Identifiers on database manipulation languages.
