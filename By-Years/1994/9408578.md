9408578 Gustafsson The structure of clean and adsorbate covered surfaces using
medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and scanning tunneling microscopic (STM)
will be determined. The surface vibrational amplitudes of well ordered metal
surfaces of silver and copper will be measured in the anharmonic regime and
correlated with structural changes. Further studies will focus on systems that
undergo displacive surface phase transitions and metal overlayers on oxides. An
atomistic understanding of these effects can have a beneficial impact on a large
number of areas of applied nature, such as magnetic films, chemically passive
coating, tribology, and bimetallic catalysts. % % % % The goal of these studies
is to determine the geometric and vibrational structure of clean and adsorbate
covered surfaces. Our main experimental technique is medium energy ion
scattering, a very powerful, but not widely available, quantitative method for
the determination of surface structure. The specific systems to be studied
include low index surfaces of silver and copper, as well as metal overlayers on
oxide surfaces. The experiments will contribute towards an understanding of
emerging technologies, like bimetallic catalysts, optical and magnetic films,
chemically passive coatings and tribology. ***
