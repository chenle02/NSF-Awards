9503621 Li This Research Planning Grant is made in order to develop a quasi-
nondestructive method for residual stress evaluation. The technique is based on
measuring changes in the separation distances between three closely placed
microindentations on the surface of an object. This method can be used in
hostile environments and at elevated temperatures. ***
