Chemically mediated interactions among marine animals are thought to regulate
many important ecological processes. The nature of chemical signals, their
interaction with the aqueous medium, and the mechanisms of reception by tuned
receivers are unknown for virtually all marine animals. Mate recognition is a
major regulatory point in marine invertebrate reproductive cycles because it is
when males and females make evolutionarily significant choices about investing
their gametes. The overall goal of this project is to investigate how male and
female zooplankton communicate and the ecological and evolutionary consequences
of this interaction. The research will attempt to describe the biochemical
features of a sex pheromone shown to be responsible for mate recognition in
rotifers. The research will investigate the biochemical basis for its species-
specificity and how variable the pheromone is within and between populations.
Ultimately, the research will provide insight to how changes in this molecule
promote reproductive isolation among populations and determine the direction of
evolution. A system similar to the contact chemoreception mate recognition
system of rotifers has ben described in copepods. The role of surface
glycoproteins in copepod chemoreception will be explored using the same lectin
probes that have proven useful in rotifers. By comparing rotifer and copepod
mate recognition systems, we may begin to understand the generality of contact
chemoreception in zooplankton mating.
