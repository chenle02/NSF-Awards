DEB-0120635&lt;br/&gt;Clifford Cunningham, Joel Martin, Jermoe Regier, Jeffrey
Schultz &amp; Jeffrey Thorne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to an
interdisciplinary team of researchers from Duke University, University of
Maryland, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, North Carolina State
University, and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This grant
will support the largest effort to date to solve the major questions in the
evolution of the arthropods. The arthropods -- which include insects, shrimp,
centipedes, horshoe crabs, spiders and ticks -- represent more species than the
rest of the animals combined. Despite more than a decade of molecular work, the
relationships of these major groups of arthropods are not known. This grant will
use information from the three completely sequenced animal genomes (human, worm,
and fly) to help us obtain a giant dataset of nuclear protein coding sequences
from 85 representative arthropod species. This dataset will include
approximately 50,000 base pairs of DNA sequences per species, which is more than
10 times larger than the largest existing dataset.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
project will not only decide the relationships of the major groups of
arthropods, but will tell us which group of marine crustaceans (shrimps ,
lobsters and crabs) are the closest relatives to the insects, which represent
the most successful invasion of land by any animal group. This grant will also
support development of new statistical methods to estimate the dates of the
major events in arthropod evolution, and, includes an innovative plan to develop
teaching modules to expose underprivileged K-12 students in the Los Angeles
region, and elsewhere in the country, to the evolution of the charismatic
Arthropoda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
