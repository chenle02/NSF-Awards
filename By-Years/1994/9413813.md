ABSTRACT AST-9413813 Levison, Hal The PIs will acquire 6 state-of-the-art
workstations that will be linked together using a high-speed network to form a
single, powerful, parallel-architecture computer, to be called "Solar System
Orbit Numerical Integrating Cluster' or 'SSONIC'.SSONIC will be dedicated to
solving some of the leading questions about the origin and evolution of the
Earth and other bodies in the solar system. It has become increasingly apparent
in the past 15 years that small bodies such as comets and steroids played,
through accretionary processes, a fundamental role in the formation and
evolution of the Earth and planets. After the planets formed, asteroidal and
cometary impacts profoundly influenced the evolution of Earth's climate by i)
providing volatiles and organic materials and ii) causing long-term climatic
catastrophes. Understanding the dynamical evolution of these bodies is required
in order to fully understand their effects on the Earth and other planets. Until
very recently, direct numerical simulations of the dynamics of solar system
objects over the timescales necessary to study the formation process and long-
term evolution have been beyond normal computational reach. However, due to
recent advancements in computer hardware and software, it is now possible to
attack problems in solar system dynamics which were intractable only two or
three years ago. The SSONIC computing system will allow the PIs make significant
inroads in understanding the origin and evolution of bodies in the Solar System
like the Earth and other planets. ***
