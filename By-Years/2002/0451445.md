Fritz Schaefer of the University of Georgia is supported by the Theoretical and
Computational Chemistry program to continue his research into the development of
quantum chemical techniques and their application to a variety of projects. In
the first part of this project, Schaefer is developing a multi-reference
coupled-cluster (MR-CC) method for use in understanding chemical reactions,
transition metals, excited states and other difficult systems. In the second and
third parts, application projects involving the design of GaN nanostructures and
the development of parameters for amino acids are being pursued. This work is
having a broader impact both in terms of the training of graduate students and
in terms of the theoretical investigation of systems that have immediate
relevance to emerging technologies, particularly nanotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;
