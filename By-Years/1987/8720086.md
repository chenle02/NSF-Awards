This work seeks to extend the applicability of design automation (DA) to the
microelectronic system level. Existing DA tools are limited to the chip level,
where they are essential to efficient design. But they cannot be simply scaled
up to the next level of packaging, i.e., boards that interconnect a number of
chips, so new concepts need to be invented and evaluated. This need is widely
recognized and its satisfaction will have significant impact on the quality and
performance of information processing systems.
