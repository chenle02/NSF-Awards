EIA-9973470&lt;br/&gt;Crisman, Jill&lt;br/&gt;Northeastern
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; CISE POWRE: Visual Behaviors for Robotic Motion
Control &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The long term objective of the proposed research
is to use visual behaviors to control personal robots. The POWRE funding will
help the PI to restart her research program, after she has had to take an
extended leave due to medical conditions of her children. The proposed work will
specifically study visual behaviors for gaze control of a robot head, navigation
control of a mobile base, reaching control of a manipulator, and grasping
control of a robot hand. The objectives are to: (i) determine if real-world,
general purpose robotics problems can be solved using visual behaviors, (ii)
discover the features of target objects that can be reliably tracked and used
for visual behaviors, and (iii) discover a fundamental set of visual behaviors
necessary to perform general purpose object retrieval and delivery. To meet
these objectives, a general purpose mobile robot will be developed and used in
daily navigation task. The robot will interact with person who will select
visual behaviors and target objects from video images. A manipulator and robot
hand will be used to perform experiments in visual behaviors for reaching and
picking up objects. Better generic target tracking algorithms will also be
developed. Finally, the idea of tracking multiple targets through image
sequences will be investigated and integrated with visual behaviors. &lt;br/&gt;
