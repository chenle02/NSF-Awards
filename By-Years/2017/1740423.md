This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US
students attending BIRTE 2017, the 11th International Workshop on Real-Time
Business Intelligence and Analytics. The student fellowships helps cover the
travel costs and registration fees for US students, enabling them to present
their work and receive constructive feedback and mentoring from established
researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BIRTE workshop provides a forum to bring
together researchers and practitioners interested in the different facets of
real-time operation and business intelligence, from data acquisition, to
processing, to transformation and analysis, to data visualization. The research
paper presentations, keynote addresses, panel and other sessions provide
opportunities for students to meet academic and industrial researchers as well
as industrial practitioners, and be inspired by them to follow careers in this
area.
