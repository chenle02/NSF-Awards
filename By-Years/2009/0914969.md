This project studies several classes of counting problems in computational
complexity theory. These counting problems are naturally defined and include
such counting problems as vertex covers, graph colorings, graph matchings etc.
This framework for counting problems is called Holant Problems. Graph
homomorphism is a special case and they are closely related to Constrained
Satisfaction Problems. One major new technique this project will bring to bear
on these problems is holographic reductions and holographic algorithms.

This theory will be developed in terms of what function sets (signatures) are
tractable and what lead to #P-hardness. The theory of Holant Problems will aim
to prove complexity dichotomy theorems. These theorems assert for every problem
in a class of problems expressible in the framework, depending on the exact
signature set, either the problem is tractable in P, or the problem is #P-hard.

The goal of computational complexity theory is to gain a fundamental
understanding of the nature of efficient computation. This study will sharpen
the boundary of what is and what is not efficiently computable. Holographic
reductions offer a novel technique. The proof techniques developed may also be
broadly applicable in related areas of complexity theory.

There has been strong interest with the concept of holographic algorithms and
holographic reductions (see "American Scientist" magazine, Jan-Feb 2008). A
sharper delineation between what is efficiently computable and what is not may
also have broader implications. The new holographic reductions together with
interpolations are likely to bring new perspectives to computational complexity.
