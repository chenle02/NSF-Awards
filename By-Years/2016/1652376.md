Consistent with NSF's mission to advance research and education, Research and
Education (R&amp;E) partnerships between the U.S. and China have contributed to
the global exchange of knowledge in the advanced research/higher education
enterprise for over 30 years. Since 1999, the Chinese American Networking
Symposium (CANS) has played an integral part in these developments through
annual meetings that are held in the U.S. and China in alternate years. The 2016
CANS workshop takes place in Houston, Texas and engages selected participants
from both countries to discuss topics of mutual interest that revolve around
R&amp;E networks, their engineering, and ways in which network utilization can
enhance science and education. In the tradition of prior workshops over the last
nearly two decades, CANS 2016 fosters scientific communication between the U.S.
and China, and brings together researchers from multiple scientific disciplines
with network engineers and campus leaders in Information Technology to explore
the most effective mechanisms to foster increased research collaborations. The
project has the potential to broaden the dialogue between research and education
communities as well as impact the next generation of researchers and network
engineers by providing a better understanding of shared science goals, and
engaging campus leadership on how best to support those science goals through
high performance networking.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical areas of
exploration include native IPv6 deployment and support end-to-end for driving
science applications, as well as performance measurement based on active
performance testing with Perfsonar.
