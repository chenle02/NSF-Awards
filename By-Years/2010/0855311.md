This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This engineering education
research award to Drexel University in collaboration with Purdue University,
Texas Engineering Experiment Station, and Northeastern University will employ
researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of using a fully instrumented real
functioning bridge called the "Learning Bridge" to provide a comprehensive
laboratory experience for civil engineering students. The project will add
sensing, monitoring, and data transmission capability to the bridge for use by
academic institutions and develop internet portals to the learning modules which
will use this data. This research would both create a unique and much needed
infrastructure resource for civil engineering laboratory development and also
advance understanding of how civil engineers learn about multi-domain systems.
Most of the sub-disciplines of civil engineering will be integrated by exposing
students to a complex infrastructure system linking social and technical
concepts from the beginning of the undergraduate program. This work will
contribute to better preparation of engineers to fill engineering jobs.
