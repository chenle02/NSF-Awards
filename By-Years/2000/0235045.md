Noncoding RNA's play critical, though poorly understood, roles in epigenetic
mechanisms of gene regulation. The epigenetic control of gene regulation by
dosage compensation is required to equalize sex chromosome expression between
two sexes with differing numbers of sex chromosomes. Strikingly, both mammals
and Drosophila require the action of noncoding RNA's in order to distinguish the
X chromosomes from autosomes and correctly implement dosage compensation,
although the mechanisms of dosage compensation evolved independently in these
organisms. In C. elegans, the mechanism by which the dosage compensation complex
recognizes the X chromosome remains unknown. The focus of this research is a C.
elegans X-linked noncoding RNA identified in the laboratory through
bioinformatics. This noncoding RNA is restricted to the nuclei of virtually all
somatic cells. It localizes specifically to a number of small subnuclear regions
corresponding to the number of X chromosomes present. This research tests the
hypothesis that this noncoding RNA functions as a component of an X chromosome
recognition mechanism in C. elegans. The localization of the noncoding RNA to
the X chromosome will be assessed, and the effects of a deletion mutant of this
gene on hermaphrodite and male viability will be determined. Specifically, this
study will lead to insight regarding the mechanism of X chromosome recognition
in C. elegans. More broadly, this work will generate a more thorough
understanding of the chromosome-wide regulation of transcription by epigenetic
modifications involving noncoding RNA's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The manner in
which groups of genes on chromosomes are coordinately activated or repressed is
a basic problem in biology. Recently, researchers have discovered that diverse
long-term and long-range effects on coordinated gene regulation require the
action of certain gene products that function as RNA, not protein. The roles and
requirements for these RNA's in long-range gene regulation are poorly
understood. In this research program, the genetic, microscopic, and transgenic
tools available for C. elegans research will facilitate investigation into the
requirement for a candidate noncoding RNA.&lt;br/&gt;
