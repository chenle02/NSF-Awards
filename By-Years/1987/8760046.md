Cold weather protective clothing of today consists primarily of many thin layers
of insulating material. It would be far more desirable if cold weather
protective clothing could release useful amounts of heat for periods of time
during which the wearer's body was unable to provide sufficient heat to maintain
body temperature. This approach is similar in concept to the use of phase change
materials to store solar energy. The research explores the feasibility of
producing fabrics which can store thermal energy through phase changes. If
successful, this research would identify a new type of fabric for cold weather
garments. These garments would be thinner than conventional garments, thereby
allowing the wearer to work comfortably under cold weather conditions. Markets
for this fabric include outdoor winter sportswear and winter emergency shelters
and blankets.
