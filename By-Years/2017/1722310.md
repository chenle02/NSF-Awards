The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical
deployment of a computer-vision based yield estimation system in fruit orchards.
This will provide fruit farmers with a useful tool in planning their harvest and
sales, as well as in managing the long-term health of their plants. This will
potentially reduce the inherent risk in fruit growing, thereby improving the
affordability and availability of fresh fruit in the US. Better certainty may
particularly help small growers, because they have less existing capability to
manage risk. Furthermore, by allowing adoption of precision agriculture
techniques techniques to high value crops, this project may help save water and
contribute to reduction of runoff pollution from fertilizer and
chemicals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Phase I project addresses the problem of vision-based fruit detection and
mapping of fruit, for purposes of yield mapping. The research objectives are to
improve the commercial usability and robustness of existing yield-mapping
approaches, so that they can be applied in production fruit orchards. The
anticipated technical results of this project include demonstration of useful
yield mapping of apples, in a variety of real world production orchard
environments, in a variety of weather and lighting conditions.
