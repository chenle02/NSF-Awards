CREST Center for Emerging Technologies for Advanced Information Processing and
High-Confidence Systems

Florida International University

PI: Yi Deng

Florida International University (FIU) will establish the CREST Center for
Emerging Technologies for Advanced Information Processing and High-Confidence
Systems. This multidisciplinary research and educational center will serve as a
resource center for the education of underrepresented minority students as well
as a driving force to increase diversity in graduate education, especially at
the Ph.D. level in computer science and engineering.

In addition to the educational component, the Center will pursue four major
research subprojects. (1) High-Confidence Reactive Software Systems will build
high confidence reactive software systems by developing efficient and scalable
methods for modeling, specifying, analyzing, and implementing such systems. (2)
Multidimensional-Multimodal Data Modeling and Query Research focuses on the
intelligent use of databases for data mining, modeling, and analysis through
effective queries. The querying support process will yield efficient access over
multidimensional multimedia data sets and effectively address the issues of
interpretation and visualization of such complex data sets. (3) Assistive
Technology Research is based on the design and development of real-time
assistive systems that focus on Visual Impairments and Blindness, and Motor
Disability, which are achieved through integration of highly dependable and
sophisticated real-time software and databases to hardware designs. (4) Advanced
Information Processing with Neuroscience Applications will focus on signal and
imaging techniques that have significant real-world applications, while the
Neuroscience research aims to meet the impending needs for new developments in
bio-signal processing and neurorehabilitation as the functional mapping of the
brain and the causality of key brain dysfunctions are elicited.
