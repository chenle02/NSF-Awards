This award will support a conference entitled Nonlinear Analysis and Partial
Differential Equations. The conference will be held during the period May 14-18
at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. The purpose of this conference is to
stimulate the interaction between various fields involving nonlinear problems.
The main topics of the conference are abstract nonlinear functional analysis,
nonlinear elliptic equations and systems, periodic solutions of Hamiltonian
systems, and nonlinear equations in fluid mechanics. The speakers include
Ambrosetti, Berestycki, K.C. Chang, Crandall, DeFigueiredo, Douglas, Fefferman,
Friedman, Hildebrandt, Hofer, Hormander, Kato, Kenig, Kinderlehrer,
Krasnoselskii, Lax, J.L. Lions, P.L. Lions, Matano, Mawnin, Nussbaum, Struwe,
Temam, and Visik.
