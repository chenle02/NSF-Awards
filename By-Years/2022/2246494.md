Many large, complex systems arising in mathematics, physics, and elsewhere
undergo phase transitions, where varying a parameter (e.g. the temperature or
pressure) that describes the system at a small scale by a small amount through
some special value causes an abrupt, qualitative change in the behaviour of the
system on a large scale. Beyond the familiar examples of water freezing and
boiling, phase transitions also occur in many other systems including
ferromagnets, superconductors, superfluids, epidemics, and traffic. In each
case, understanding when, how, and why the system undergoes a phase transition
is of central importance in both theory and practice. Moreover, the basic
mathematical principles underlying the occurrence of such phase transitions have
much in common across these diverse situations, and the study of phase
transitions has come to be recognised as a rich source of deep and beautiful
pure mathematics that is of interest beyond and complementary to its practical
origins. This project aims to develop our fundamental understanding of phase
transitions and critical phenomena (the special properties exhibited by systems
at the point of phase transition) through the study of probabilistic models. The
project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on various probabilistic lattice
models of statistical mechanics, including percolation, random walks, the Ising
model, and the uniform spanning tree. In particular, the project aims to
understand how the geometry of the underlying graph (e.g. the dimension of the
lattice) influences the critical behaviour of the model, with focuses on
quantitative aspects of critical phenomena and the comparison between short-
range, long-range, and hierarchical models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
