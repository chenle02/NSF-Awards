This REU site award provides support for eight undergraduate researchers in
mathematics. The research at this site will be on topics in matrix analysis and
operator theory. The program will run for eight weeks. During the course of the
program there will be seminars on mathematical topics, and field trips are
planned for the students to visit nearby installations which employ
mathematicians.
