A computer laboratory is being used for the instruction of biomathematics and
biological statistics. This laboratory setting serves the following major
purposes: 1) Makes mathematical concepts and tools more understandable, more
enjoyable and more useful for biological sciences majors. 2) Makes advanced
mathematical modelling more accessible to undergraduates. 3) Allows the use of
real and realistic case studies in our entire set of undergraduate course
offerings. 4) Enables advanced undergraduate majors in Statistics and Biometry
to participate more fully in the research program of the Unit. 5) Promotes
mathematical literacy rather than easily forgotten technical skills. 6) Exposes
undergraduate majors who are participating in the Teacher Education in Science
and Mathematics program to the use of mathematics and mathematical computing in
biology.
