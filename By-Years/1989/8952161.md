This grant supports the acquisition of sensors and measurement equipment for
monitoring and control of manufacturing processes. The equipment is used to link
the existing numerically controlled machine tools, real time computing facility,
acoustic and vibration measurement equipment and the computer aided design
computing facility. This project supports two new engineering courses: Computer
Integrated Manufacturing Systems and Acoustics and Vibrations. Implementation of
this project corrects the lack of instructional laboratory in the program and
provides students with "hands-on" experience in a realistic manufacturing
environment. The institution is providing matching funds in an amount equal to
or greater than the funds provided by the Foundation.
