INT 9601389 Parr This U.S.-Hungary project between Dr. Robert Parr of the
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Dr. Agnes Nagy of Lajos Kossuth
University, Debrecen, will address density functional theory. The researchers
intend to extend current understanding of kinetic, exchange, and correlation
density functionals as well as explore the use, within the theory, of the
concept of local temperature. To do so, the researchers will focus their
collaborative work on defining the following: 1) new exact relations for
electron density and energy density functionals that provide criteria to be
fulfilled by approximate methods; 2) methods to determine exchange, correlation
and Pauli potentials in electron density; 3) extensions of density functional
theory to excited states; and 4) thermodynamic interpretations of the theory.
Results are expected to be useful in basic research related to molecular
electronic structure. This project in theoretical and computational chemistry
fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary
talents and pool research resources in areas of mutual interest and competence.
