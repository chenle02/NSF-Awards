This grant is for partial support for travel to the Eighth International
Conference on Fracture, ICF8, to be held in Kiev, Ukraine, 8-14 June 1993 by a
group of seventeen U.S. engineers and scientists who will participate in the
Conference as plenary and keynote speakers. The Conference will provide a forum
for the presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the area of
fracture to an audience of leading workers. It is the eight in a series of such
Conferences that started in 1965. They are held once every four years at
different locations in the world, and are attended by eminent researchers. The
gathering of these individuals at the Conference will allow for personal
interactions that will provide exchange of information and ideas, and the
possible formation of new research groups. Proceedings of the Conference will be
published and will thus be available as an important archival resource for
future use by the engineering, science and technology communities.
