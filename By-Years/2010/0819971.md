The Principal Investigator (PI) will integrate current space-based and ground-
based observing capabilities with new data analysis techniques, in order to
develop scalar and vector tomography tools for reconstructing the Sun's 3D
coronal magnetic field configuration. The PI will utilize ground-based
measurements of coronal magnetic fields through near-IR spectropolarimetric
observations, stereoscopic coronal imaging from NASA's STEREO (Solar TErrestrial
RElations Observatory) mission, and coronal vector tomography techniques to
develop these new space weather tools. He will then use the resulting 3D coronal
reconstructions to test theoretical coronal magnetic field models, as well as to
study coronal magnetic field configuration variations of active regions, before
and after the occurrence of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's goal to directly infer the 3D structure of
coronal magnetic fields from observations is of fundamental importance to solar
physics. This project will increase our understanding of the physical mechanisms
responsible for the heating of the solar corona, the generation of solar EUV
radiation, and the origin of fast and slow solar winds. The proposed research
will lead to a better understanding of the energetic solar events that drive
space weather, and thus enhance our predictive capabilities for such events.
