The principal investigator's research is focused on the study of alternatives to
the tensor product for constructing multi-dimensional wavelet functions from
one-dimensional wavelet functions. These alternative methods may overcome some
limitations of the tensor product approach while also complementing the tensor
product formulation. The tensor product concept is also prevalent in many other
application areas, and thus new developments have the potential for broader
impact. From the mathematical perspective, the research includes extending
current efforts in developing the coset sum methodology, searching for
alternative mechanisms to construct wavelet bases while assessing their
distinguishing properties for certain applications, and studying systematic ways
to construct multi-dimensional wavelet systems where the tensor product does not
work.

Wavelets have been used in a wide range of applications including Image
Compression. Examples where wavelets are a key tool include the JPEG 2000
digital image standard and fingerprint compression for data storage. This work
concerns improvements in the construction of multi-dimensional wavelet systems
focused toward specific application areas, and provides an opportunity for
mathematics graduate students to study mathematics from an application
perspective.
