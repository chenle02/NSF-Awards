This project explores the politics of collective memory or commemoration in
science by comparing the earliest anniversary celebrations of American, British
and French molecular biologists. Commemorative events are viewed as rites of
succession, in which the passing generation gives place to the upcoming elite.
Also of concern is the way that scientists' individual, private and even
inconsequential memories are transformed into collective, public and
politically-useful commemorations. Considerable attention will be given to the
characteristics of those persons and events that have been excluded from
commemoration. To accomplish these ends I will examine published and unpublished
documents, including correspondence of key figures, and will conduct oral
histories and ethnographic field studies of recent commemorative events.
