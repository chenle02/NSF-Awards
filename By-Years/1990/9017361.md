Equilibrium phases of strongly interacting Fermi systems will be investigated
by developing series expansions for static and dynamic properties of model
Hamiltonians. These will include zero temperature expansions around simple
exactly soluble Hamiltonians, as well as high temperature expansions. The
thermodynamic functions studied will include the free energy, the relevant order
parameters and their susceptibilities, and some characteristic Fermi liquid
quantities such as the momentum distribution function. In addition, the
frequency moments of experimentally observable dynamical quantities such as
spin-lattice relaxation rates, the light scattering spectra and the optical
conductivity will also be calculated. The results of this work should provide us
with novel insight into several condensed matter phenomena including the
existence and interplay of magnetic and superconducting order, metal insulator
transitions, and the validity of the Fermi liquid description for the low energy
excitations in strongly correlated systems.
