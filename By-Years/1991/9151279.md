This project is the development of an introductory solid state physics course
centered about a semiconductor devices laboratory. The objectives of the course
are to involve industry as an informal active partner in the educational
process, and to introduce the student to simultaneous learn-as- you-do directed
group experiences.The activities of the course are designed to allow the student
to undergo a project development-type experience involving team and individual
effort and the parallel opportunity to observe, with some participation, the
same activities in an active industry environment. It is also organized to allow
the student to interact with the instructor in an educational environment in
regular laboratory sessions, and in addition to interact through sessions at the
cooperating industry site with scientists and engineers in the industrial
setting.The course is initially aimed at physics majors and minors, and
engineering technology majors, with plans to modify it slightly for teacher
training and field teachers.
