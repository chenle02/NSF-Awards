This research project investigates the transition from hadronic degrees of
freedom to quark-gluon degrees of freedom in several systems, both nucleons and
light nuclei. This will be done by investigating short-range structure in light
nuclei on the one hand, and quark-hadron duality on the other hand. Both parts
of the research program are immediately relevant to the experimental program at
Jefferson Lab. This project will contribute to current research at a national
facility, and provide training for students at The Ohio State University.

Coincidence electron scattering from nuclei is the canonical tool for
investigating short-range structures. Many properties of nuclei can be described
in a picture containing only nucleons, deltas, and the lightest mesons. However,
it is clear that when one proceeds to smaller distances, or higher energies and
momenta used to explore the nuclei, one will find a situation where the relevant
degrees of freedom are no longer the hadrons, but quarks and gluons. Appropriate
theoretical tools for disentangling the nuclear ground state information from
the data will be developed and tested, and suitable observables will be
identified. I will also perform conventional nuclear physics baseline
calculations for processes in which one expects to observe the onset of color
transparency.

Quark-hadron duality states that in certain kinematical regions, the proper
average of hadronic observables is described by a perturbative QCD result. While
this phenomenon is well established experimentally, a satisfying theoretical
explanation of duality is still lacking. Modeling duality and studying how it
arises in simple models is the most promising road to understanding duality.
This project will continue this approach. I will focus on providing the
necessary theoretical understanding for the highly promising applications of
duality, which will allow for the extraction of deep inelastic information from
resonance data.
