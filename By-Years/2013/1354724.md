Aquatic and terrestrial habitats often have major ecological effects on each
other. This important aspect of landscape ecology has mostly been investigated
in space, between adjacent habitats that are permanently aquatic or terrestrial.
This project will investigate the interaction between aquatic and terrestrial
habitats in time, in a type of habitat that cycles seasonally between an aquatic
and a terrestrial state. Using remnants of the once extensive system of vernal
pools in the Central Valley of California, experiments will test how length of
flooding and accumulation of nutrients during the aquatic period in winter
influence the diversity of plants found in the terrestrial period in summer, and
how the thatch these plants leave affects the diversity of aquatic plants and
invertebrates in winter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this
project include training of undergraduate students, outreach to K-12 education,
collaboration between institutions, and applications to conservation of
biodiversity and endemic species. The project is based at a primarily
undergraduate institution that serves underrepresented groups and it will
provide research experiences for individual students and material for
undergraduate courses. Vernal pools in California are of high conservation
priority, and the project will disseminate results to the state and Federal
agencies that manage these natural habitats.
