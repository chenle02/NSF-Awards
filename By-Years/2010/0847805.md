This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

An award has been made to the herbaria (museum plant collections) of Arizona
State University (ASU) and the Desert Botanical Garden (DES), under the
direction of Drs. Leslie R. Landrum and Andrew M. Salywon respectively, to
expand the Southwest Environmental Information Network (SEINet) in various ways.
First, staff at ASU will facilitate the posting of existing data for hundreds of
thousands of specimens from other institutions on SEINet. Second, staff at ASU
and DES will photograph, database, and georeference ca. 94,000 plant specimens,
mainly from the Southwest and Latin America. Third, they will improve a computer
program (SALIX) that semi-automatically extracts information from labels and
transfers it to a database and make that program generally available. All
photographs and information will be posted on the web at
http://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/index.php. Fourth, ASU and DES will present
workshops for secondary school teachers (especially from inner city and remote
rural schools) on integrating plant studies and SEINet into their teaching and
will continue to work with them and their students through an email network.
Various university student workers will gain training in herbarium management,
databasing, digital photography and computer programming during the course of
this project.

This project will provide convenient and informative access to information
contained in ca. 1,400,000 museum specimens to scientists, students at all
levels, land managers, conservationists, geographers, amateur botanists, and the
public in general. It makes museum specimens, previously available to only a few
people, virtually available to anyone with web access.
