It is proposed to continue the study of the statistical properties of
multivariate normal models determined by lattice conditional independence (LCI)
assumptions and/or group symmetry assumptions on the covariance matrix,
augmented by compatible linear restrictions on the mean. LCI models have been
shown to be applicable to the analysis of multivariate normal data sets with
nonnested missing data patterns. A new application of LCI models will be
emphasized here: their application to the analysis of a collection of nonnested
dependent linear regression models, known in econometrics as a seemingly
unrelated regression (SUR) model. A SUR model may be thought of as a finite
nonnested collection of linear regression subspaces with correlated errors
across regressions. For a given SUR model, the least restrictive LCI covariance
model compatible with the mean structure can be determined, leading to explicit
maximum likelihood estimates for the SUR model. To date, LCI models have been
studied only for multivariate normal distributions. Another new aspect of this
proposal is the application of LCI models to categorical data in multiway
contingency tables. As in the case of normal data, such LCI models should allow
explicit maximum likelihood estimates for contingency tables with nonnested
missing categories. Many familiar statistical models occurring in classical
multivariate analysis (the study of correlated data) can be viewed as special
cases of models defined in terms of natural algebraic conditions on the means
and/or covariances. This viewpoint will (a) lead to a unified and explicit (non-
iterative) analysis of these models, and (b) expand the scope of multivariate
analysis by allowing the application of classical methods to many new models, as
well as allowing the possibilities of missing data occurring in nonnested
patterns and of nonnested regression subspaces.
