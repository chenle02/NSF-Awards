9306667 Farrell A phylogenetic study of the 32 subfamilies of the phytophagous
beetle superfamily Chrysomeloidea (Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, Bruchidae) based
on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences will be done. Preliminary sequence
data have confirmed the utility of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit
I gene (COI) and the nuclear small ribosomal subunit gene (18s) for
accomplishing this goal. Phylogenetic analyses will be carried out to determine
the relationships among the monophyletic subfamilies within each beetle family
and the monophyly of the families themselves. The primary goal is to provide a
basis for a stable classification that reflects phylogeny. This will be achieved
by combining analyses of the proposed molecular data set with available evidence
from morphology. Secondary goals include evaluation of several extant hypotheses
concerning the ostensibly relictual affiliation of the most "primitive"
subfamilies with certain hostplants and eventual tests of the potential
influences of shifts in resource use among these beetle lineages on rates of
diversification. %%% This project will use both morphological information and
new data to be obtained by the Principal Investigator from DNA sequencing of
both a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene to determine relationships and establish
a sound modern classification for this large group of beetles which includes 32
families in 3 families. This group or superfamily includes over 72,000 species
and many of them are important pests of timber, agricultural crops and stored
grains. The project will also test current ideas on the role of shifts in
hostplant affiliations on rates of beetle div ersification. ***
