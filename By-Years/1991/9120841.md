This is a three year cooperative research project proposed by Dr. Julius Chang,
SUNY at Albany, New York, and Professor Fu-Tien Jeng, National Taiwan
University, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science
Program. This study plans to develop a regional model of atmospheric chemistry.
This project is the product of the bilateral meeting on long-term air quality
changes and their climatic impact supported by the US-Taiwan Program. The topic
is of special interest to the U.S. and can have significant effects on
understanding air pollution problems in Taiwan. The major funding resources for
this project are the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency, the Taiwan National
Science Council has provided the computer time for model simulation. This
cooperation is expected to improve expertise in atmospheric chemistry in Taiwan,
while providing important data to the U.S. from a region with little existing
information.
