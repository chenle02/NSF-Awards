9406790 Manghnani The PIs will perform an experimental investigation of the
elastic and anelastic properties of molten and partially molten Fe-Ni-S and Fe-
Ni-Si alloys that are relevant to the Earth's outer core. From the values of VP
and QP in these systems, bulk modulus and viscosity will be calculated. The
results should provide useful criteria with which to interpret existing data on
shocked melts of pure Fe and Fe alloys, as well as seismological data on the
outer core. ****
