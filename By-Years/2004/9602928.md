9602928 Oseroff This U.S.-Brazil award will support collaborative research
between Dr. Saul Oseroff of San Diego State University and Dr. Carlos Rettori of
Universidade Estadual de Campinas - UNICAMP in the study of heavy fermion
systems, intermediate valence compounds and materials showing an unusually large
magnetoresistance. The experiments planned will address specific questions
essential to the understanding of the physics of strongly correlated systems.
Electron spin resonance, magnetization and Raman techniques will be used to
study high quality single crystals of those systems. In addition to shedding
light on the issue of the microscopic description of heavy fermion physics,
successful results of these experiments will lead to the ability to manipulate
strong correlation effects for useful means especially in the areas of
electronic and thermal devices. ***
