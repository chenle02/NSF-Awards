Many of the more oxidized compounds found in the atmosphere, in gas and aerosol
phases, represent a challenge for chemists to identify and measure due to their
high reactivity, and propensity to breakdown or combine with other chemical
species and surfaces. They may have the same molecular mass and formula.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CalTech atmospheric chemists will adapt a gas
chromatography mass spectrometer (GC/MS) with a highly sensitive detection
scheme for multifunctional organic compounds using a chemical-ionization
clustering method developed at Caltech. The project builds off an existing
testbed where researchers have demonstrated high transmission of otherwise
labile (fragile) organic peroxides, hydroxynitrates, and hydroxyl-ketones
through a standard chromatographic column, which separates them prior to their
measurement by a mass spec. &lt;br/&gt;The development of this methodology
involves collaboration of a team of scientists, instrument builders, machinists,
and software engineers to create a new instrument. It is important to maintain
the capability to build such instruments in an academic institution. This
project involves the training of a graduate student in instrumentation science,
providing a platform for training the next generation of analytical chemists.
