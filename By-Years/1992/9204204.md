In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project funded by the Division of
Chemistry, Prof. Coe (Ohio State University) will build a novel apparatus in
which a molecular beam of positively charged, solvated ions is gently merged
with a similar beam of negatively charged ions. Recombination will be monitored
by detecting fast moving neutral products. This will permit production of
solvent-separated ion pair clusters, and will lead to elucidation of step-wise
solvation energies of strong electrolytes.%%% Reactions of charged species in
solution lie at the heart of many chemical reactions, but very little hard
information has been available about the detailed role of intervening solvent in
influencing the course of the reaction. Prof. Coe (Ohio State University) will
address this question by building an apparatus which will make it possible for
the first time to determine how many solvent molecules there must be around the
reacting species in order to keep positively charged materials from reacting
immediately with negatively charged species. This will help to answer the more
general question of how many molecules are needed to define what chemists mean
by a solution of one substance in another.
