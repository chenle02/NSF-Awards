Polar ice cores provide critical insights to societally relevant issues and ice
core results underpin much of global change research. The Ice Core Working Group
(which, under the coordination of the National Ice Core Laboratory Science
Management Office, provides guidance to the National Science Foundation and the
United States Geological Survey on issues pertaining to ice cores) has
recommended a community-wide ice-coring program in West Antarctica at a location
referred to as the Inland Site. A deep ice core from there will enable studies
of climate and sea-level change and life in extreme environments, and will help
educate many new Earth-system scientists. This project is for the design,
construction and testing of a deep-ice-coring drill, and for other preparations
required to recover a deep ice core from the Inland Site.
