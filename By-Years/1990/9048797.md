This supplementary award funds Georgia Institute of Technology's
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Material Handling to perform
a collaborative research project with Rutgers University's Industry/University
Cooperative Research Center for Plastics Recycling. This two-year project,
"Optimization Study for Materials Recovery Facility Location and Collection
Routes for Recyclables", has been approved and recommended for cost sharing by
both Center's Industry Advisory Board. The research will address materials
recovery facility siting and collection route optimization. The evaluator for
the Center will continue to develop the Center's case history, survey the
Center's participants, attend the required meetings and perform company exit
interviews. The Program Manager recommends Rutgers University be awarded $50,000
for two (2) years for the joint "TIE" project and an additional $24,000 for
three (3) years for the evaluator.
