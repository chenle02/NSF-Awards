Logic is the mathematics of choice for describing and reasoning about digital
systems. The mechanized application of logic to artifacts of practical
importance is still in its infancy and will ultimately represent a major
development in the history of applied mathematics and computer science. This
research aims to (a) increase the automation and scalability of a particular
mechanical theorem-proving system (ACL2), (b) demonstrate how such a system
allows an untrusted contractor to deliver a trusted artifact, and (c) produce a
trustworthy, industrial-strength certification tool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
work will enable untrusted contractors to deliver relatively isolated but still-
critical software packages. As more infrastructure is codified, larger
hierarchical trusted systems can be built with this paradigm. The work further
automates the validation process and will lower the effort required to attain
high assurance that a delivered system meets specified requirements.
Undergraduate and graduate teaching of this technology continues to enlarge the
formal methods workforce. ACL2 is freely distributed at the source-code level,
with extensive documentation, and annual workshops are held to distribute the
community's acquired knowledge.
