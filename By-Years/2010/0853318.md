The objective of this activity is to provide partial travel support for ten
students from U.S. universities to attend the 2009 IEEE International Symposium
on Antennas and Propagation (AP-S) and to provide awards for the top three
selections of the student paper competition. The conference will be held in
Charleston, SC on June 1-5, 2009.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The
IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation is the premier
international annual conference devoted to theoretical and experimental advances
in antennas and electromagnetic wave propagation. The students will have
opportunity to participate in a high quality, peer-reviewed forum. Participation
at the conference and in the student paper competition will help in developing
the students' communication and presentation skills and foster interaction with
experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Student participation
at the AP-S and in the student paper competition not only promotes education but
also helps to attract new talent into the fields of antennas and
electromagnetics. Support for the student paper activity will help in attracting
a wide range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.
