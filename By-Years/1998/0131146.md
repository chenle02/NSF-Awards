With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York
in Stony Brook will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the development of synthetic
processes based on organometallic catalysts and the development of synthetic
methods for natural products and their congeners (Ojima); b) synthesis of
biologically active natural products and designed molecular probes (Parker); c)
synthesis of analogues of Coenzyme A and development of computer-designed
receptors and sensors for biological molecules (Drueckhammer); d) investigations
on the role of disintegrins in mammalian fertilization and on understanding
enzyme motion (Sampson); e) the structure and reactivity of all-carbon molecules
(Goroff); and f) the preparation of designed supramolecular structures (Fowler).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
including biochemistry, biological sensor development, and materials
chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;
