Interpreting Stratification in the Sedimentary Record from Experiments on
Combined Flow Bed Configurations in a Large Laboratory Flow Duct Ancient
sediments originally deposited in shallow marine waters show distinctive styles
of stratification that are thought to be caused from oscillating storm-induced
flows. Interpretation of these deposits and their stratification is
controversial. The PI proposes to build a combined flow duct to simulate various
flow environments, and to study the resulting bedform configurations and
stratifications over a wide range of oscillation periods, oscillation
velocities, and super-imposed currents. These will then advance the knowledge of
ancient deposits and the flow regimes responsible for them. After the bulk of
experimental runs are completed, an advisory body of twelve experts on
oscillatory flow have agreed to meet at MIT for a week to examine and discuss
the results, and remake key flow duct runs. They will also discuss implications
for interpretation, and plan further work.
