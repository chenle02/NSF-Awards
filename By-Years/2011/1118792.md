Throughout their history, both humans and nonhuman animals experienced dark
nights. This started to change ~120 years ago with the development of electrical
lighting which illuminates our nights and most recently has led to urban and
suburban light pollution. Normal physiology and behavior display a circadian
organization that depends on clear light and dark signals, but the presence of
light at night potentially disrupts temporal organization. Because of the
convenience of electric lights, little thought has been given to their
biological effects. This project will examine the effects of dim light at night
on immune function in hamsters. By using established physiological, molecular,
and genetic tests of immune function, the effects of night-time light on the
immune system will be established. The project will train high school,
undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees of both sexes from diverse
cultural and historically-underrepresented backgrounds during the conduct of
this project. All experimental results will be made easily accessible to the
general public through publications, websites, popular press, and presentations
at professional societies, community forums, colleges, and universities. An
interactive website where scientists and lay people can upload light-at-night
illumination levels to get a finer-grain appreciation of light pollution than
typically provided by satellite maps will be established and maintained. The
results will provide insight into how vertebrates may respond to global change
in the near future, how emergent diseases may arise as immune regulation
changes, as well as provide unique insights as to how environmental control
mechanisms evolved and how they are potentially disrupted by unintended light
pollution.
