Objective: We propose an innovative approach to develop high-power single-mode
yellow-orange laser. Our objective is to develop a compact low-cost sodium
guidestar laser at 589.159 nm (Sodium D2 line) with over 10 W power and narrow
linewidth (10-100 MHz) using intra-cavity frequency-doubling of high power
vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL). By intra-cavity
wavelength tuning, we will demonstrate multi-Watt single-frequency lasers in the
570-590 nm, desirable for numerous
applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This is the first attempt
to tens of Watts of frequency-doubled single-longitudinal-mode visible VECSEL.
To achieve our goal we propose to; (1) combine the area power scaling in multi-
chip 1170-1180 nm VECSEL configuration; (2) with efficient intra-cavity
frequency doubling for yellow generation, and (3) longitudinal mode selection
and stabilization, by an intracavity Lyot filter, cavity length control and
self-injection locking. The VECSEL design optimization, power scaling, and
nonlinear effects of self-injection locking will be investigated.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this proposal is
significant. First, it will greatly impact the field of high-power single-mode
semiconductor lasers. It will provide a novel approach for the development of
high-power lasers in hard-reaching wavelength bands. The laser will provide a
key tool for a range of applications in various fields. Second, this research
covers multiple disciplines in science and engineering including materials,
nonlinear optics, semiconductor physics and photonics, providing a unique
training opportunity for our graduate and undergraduate students. Finally, the
results of the proposed research will be shared with researcher, engineers and
educators through technical publications and presentations.&lt;br/&gt;
