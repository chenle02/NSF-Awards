This three-year award supports the Eastern Illinois Integrated Conference in
Geometry, Dynamics, and Topology. The three-day conference will be held annually
in April at Eastern Illinois University, with the 2017 event scheduled for the
weekend of April 7 through 9. This discipline-specific conference is intended to
draw participants at every stage of their mathematical careers, with particular
focus on both early-career graduate students and undergraduates. A meeting of
this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-
established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at
undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more
meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is
intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote
inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates
can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.

Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the
organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their
respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to
complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds.
Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will
be issued annually. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific
committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate
students and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as
talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the
conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social
events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating
undergraduates into professional life will include panel discussions from funded
graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-
discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career
in mathematics.
