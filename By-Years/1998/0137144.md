0137144&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combining their expertise in calcification,
satellite algorithms, sediment trap interpretation, water column chemistry,
sediment geochemistry and global modeling, five principal investigators propose
a multidisciplinary approach aimed at improving the uncertainties in the rates
of CaCO3 cycling in the ocean. To achieve this goal, the PIs plan to address the
following four objectives on both a regional and a global scale: (1) improve
estimates of the standing stock and calcification rates of surface ocean
particulate inorganic carbon; (2) improve estimates of surface CaCO3 export; (3)
improve estimates of shallow (100-1000m) dissolution rates; and (4) improve
estimates of deep (&gt;1000m) dissolution rates. Results from this study will be
basin-scale and global carbonate budgets to improve our understanding of
carbonate production, export and shallow/deep water dissolution in the marine
environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
