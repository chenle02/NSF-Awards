9418834 Dokka The Mojave block previously considered to be a relatively intact
terrane has been shown to be the product of Sevier-aged thrusting followed by
Cenozoic extensions and strike-slip faulting. Most of the major tectonic
elements responsible for late Mesozoic and Cenozoic activity have been
identified, however critical unstudied processes involved in the evolution of
the Trans Mojave- Sierran shear zone and the Eastern California shear zone
remain. The project will define the limits of these features to understand the
geometry, kinematics and timing of the associated strain. Results will allow
construction of a model to palinspastically restore the Mojave Desert region,
accounting for all mountain range scale translations and vertical axis
rotations. The model will be useful in reconciling the response of the Southern
California borderland to the plate motions between the Pacific and North
American plates.
