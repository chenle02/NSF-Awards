This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
sol-gel based process for fabrication of large homogeneous patterned transparent
conductive coatings. These coatings exhibit high transmittance in the visible
spectrum, high reflectance in the IR region, and nearly metallic conductivity.
These coatings include non-stoichiometric and doped oxide films of tin, indium,
cadmium, zinc, and their various alloys. Uses of transparent conductors span
electronic, electro-optical, and mechanical applications. Phase I will integrate
research in chemical synthesis, materials processing, and materials engineering
to fabricate high quality, patterned transparent conductive coatings. Further
research will develop a proper deposition technique with chemicals and materials
processing. Potential commercial applications of transparent conductors are
expected in electronic, electro-optical, and mechanical components, including
transparent heating elements for electrodes for flat panel displays, windows,
antistatic coatings, heat-reflecting mirrors, antireflection coatings,
electrochromic display devices and solar cells, and touch screen sensors.
