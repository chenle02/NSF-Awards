Research conducted at Massachusetts Technological Laboratory (MTL) has
demonstrated significant gains in execution speed in phased array algorithms for
null-steering and adaptive nulling by implementation in the fine-grained ("data
level") parallel computational architecture of the Connection machine. Such work
suggests that significant gains in phased array performance may be obtained by
the development of a "smart" phased array, where computational elements are
dispersed among the phased array elements and an appropriate network of
interconnections for transfer of information between processors is provided.
Such a "smart" phased array has the potential for substantially reduced high
data-rates, large bandwidth communication with a central computer, and rapid
(microsecond time scale) nulling. Additional capabilities for the real-time
monitoring of array performance and limited automatic failure compensation
("self-healing") also appear promising. The Connection Machine is highly
suitable for the development of algorithmic tools and simulations for the study
of "smart" phased arrays. A program of research to demonstrate the feasibility
of "smart" phased arrays by simulations on the Connection Machine and for the
study of their properties is outlined.
