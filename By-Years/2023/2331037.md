This research project focuses on two fundamental notions of probability theory:
random matrices (rectangular arrays of random data) and random walks on graphs.
Random matrices naturally appear in problems within computer science,
statistics, and mathematical physics. Studying random matrices enables one to
develop better tools to analyze data, to understand properties of complex
quantum systems, and to estimate performance of algorithms. The Principal
Investigator (PI) will consider various models of random matrices with the goal
of obtaining results that hold with very high probability. Graphs (collections
of points connected by edges) have been extensively used as models of
communication networks and of data organization. For example, social networks
and the World Wide Web can be efficiently modeled as random graphs.
Understanding characteristics of random walks on graphs helps to evaluate the
speed of information exchange in networks. Moreover, random walks on certain
graphs have been used for sampling, that is, constructing typical instances of
complex objects. The PI will study properties of random walks on graphs by
employing tools of functional analysis. The project provides research training
opportunities for graduate students.

The two main parts of this research are analysis of singular spectrum and
eigenvalues of certain models of square random matrices, and functional
inequalities on graphs. The PI will focus on studying the singularity
probability of random square matrices, which is of interest in numerical
analysis and combinatorics. Further, the PI will consider limiting laws for the
spectrum of random matrices for previously unexplored models. The tools
developed as part of this research should find applications in other problems
within combinatorial and non-asymptotic random matrix theory. Secondly, the PI
will apply functional analytic tools to study concentration and mixing on
various graphs, including spaces of regular graphs, and Catalan structures. The
goal of this part of the project is to obtain sharp estimates for mixing and
relaxation times for random walks on those graphs.
