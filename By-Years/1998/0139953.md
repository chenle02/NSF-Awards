Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with the
production of the so-called "Higgs particle", and the W and Z particles, at
high-energy colliders. Precise calculations of the rates for production of these
particles and their decay patterns will be performed. The existence of the Higgs
particle is predicted by the current theory of the weak nuclear force.

The W and Z particles are the carriers of the weak nuclear force, and the
calculations to be carried out are important to the testing of our understanding
of this force and of the origin of mass.
