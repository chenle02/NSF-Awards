Research is being performed on a three-dimensional (3-D) graphics workstation
based on the CUBE architecture, which is centered around a cubic frame-buffer of
voxels with three processors accessing the cubic memory to input geometric and
scanned data, to manipulate, to project, and to render the 3-D images. An
inherent 3-D user interface employing a true 3-D input device and the
complementing 3-D screen environment is being developed. Skewed memory
organizations of the cubic frame buffer that provide conflict-free access to
beams in arbitrary directions are being simulated. Finally, a viewing
architecture that allows direct and faster arbitrary parallel and perspective
projections is being simulated. The architecture designed is a versatile 3-D
workbench for medical, engineering, biological, geological, and other 3-D
visualization applications. The principal investigator's prior work on the CUBE
architecture (supported by NSF) is well-recognized and well-respected. His idea
of voxel memory is an innovative and sound engineering approach. The approach
using VLSI is in the right direction and avoids the conventional bus delays.
This proposal represents one of a few serious academic efforts in developing
substantial computer graphics hardware ideas. The work proposed will likely lead
to tools that help scientists to visualize three-dimensional images. Support is
strongly recommended.
