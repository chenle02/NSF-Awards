It is proposed to design, purchase, and install a Data Acquisition Monitoring
and Analysis System on the Maine Maritime tug boat, Pentagoet. This floating
laboratory is equipped with two propulsion diesel engines. The object of this
project is the development of a teaching tool which will assist in the
monitoring and thermodynamic analysis of the performance of these engines. While
the system will most heavily impact two lab courses, it will be used in a total
of 10 couses in both demonstration and practice modes.
