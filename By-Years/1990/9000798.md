The Department of Physics at Oklahoma State University will provide Research
Experiences for Undergraduates in the area of optical materials and lasers. At
the present time an insufficient number of scientists are in this field to meet
staffing needs of industry, universities and national laboratories. Because of
this we are at risk of losing our leadership in this economically important
area. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program addresses this
problem by introducing outstanding young scientists to this field at a formative
stage in their careers. The materials investigated include laser-host electro-
optic, photorefractive and colloidal materials with present or potential
applications in optical systems.
