Northwestern China is considered to be an important area through history,
becoming a gateway through which trade was conducted between most of Eurasia and
the rest of China. Even during the Neolithic period (8500-1500 BC), many
cultures seem to have participated in exchange of goods, such as the Majiayao
cultural complex (3100-2700 BC). Archaeologists are now able to use geological
chemical signatures to identify the origins of objects, such as ceramics. Using
a specific type of analysis, X-Ray Fluorescence, painted pottery from various
archaeological sites of the Majiayao will be examined in order to identify if
painted pottery found can be assigned to either local production or trade,
placing these objects in time and space. This research will be conducted at
Peking University in Beijing under the supervision of Dr. Jianfeng Cui. Dr. Cui
has worked with chemical analysis of material culture previously, and many of
the anticipated ceramics to be examined are already at his lab.

This project will specifically examine chemical patterns to determine the
provenience of the ceramics, paying close attention to trace elements which can
give clues to the relationship between sherds, and where those samples may have
come from. An XRF analyzer will be used, followed by analysis and discussion of
results. The results will be compared with prior geological knowledge in order
to determine local production or importation of these ceramics. From this,
potential trade systems can be established to observe which sites might be
importing or exporting goods, and if materials are coming from even further
away, potential contact and trade with outside groups. This will improve our
knowledge of trade in the Neolithic period, and how this might affect
interaction and trade in later periods as well.

This award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports
summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and
China's Ministry of Science and Technology.
