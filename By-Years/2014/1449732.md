Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that interrupts a person?s breathing
during sleep and may contribute to other medical issues such as cardiovascular
disease, memory problems, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle crashes.
Currently, to diagnose this disorder an individual must sleep like a marionette
in foreign surroundings. Patients attempt to replicate their sleep patterns in a
clinical setting; which includes sleeping in a clinic on a hospital bed while
attached to machinery by many wires in order to detect vital signs. This is an
uncomfortable situation for the patient and the tests results are not gained in
the patient's usual sleep environment. In addition to the uncomfortable
experience, long-term vital signs monitoring is expensive. In addition to sleep
apnea, another problem this team wants to solve is the sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS) that is the third leading cause of infant
mortality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team has developed the iMotion
radar technology that provides a non-contact and cost-effective way to monitor
human vital signs, identify gestures, monitor structural health, and sense the
surroundings of automobiles. Based on novel sensing hardware and algorithms
devised in existing NSF project, the team will develop a portable biomedical
radar sensor to interface with smart phones, so that the public can easily use
this noninvasive technology to monitor sleep. This may result in tremendous
commercial impacts on radar-based health monitoring in both developing and
developed countries.
