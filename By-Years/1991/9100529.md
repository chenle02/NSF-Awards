An eight-week program of Research Experience for Undergraduates will be
supported by this award. Ten students will work on a combination of individual
projects. There will be enough faculty participating so that each student may be
paired with an individual advisor. There will also be ample opportunity for
interaction and discussion among the students themselves. The principal
investigators are also planning a cooperative effort with Oak Ridge National
Laboratory which will give students the opportunity to work at the laboratory on
problems of interest to mathematicians. This will place extensive computer
facilities at the disposal of the students at no extra cost. There are a large
number of sample projects scheduled for the program. The students will work on
numerical algorithms which involve parallel processing, modeling of heat and
mass transfer processes, and factorization properties of integral domains. They
will also study maximum principles for elliptic systems and the classification
of knots. The number of topics should help the students appreciate the variety
of problems which are of interest to mathematical scientists.
