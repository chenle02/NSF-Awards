9353273 Krebs The proposed research will investigate the processing of lanthanum
aluminate films on a silicon substrate by generating an aerosol of lanthanum and
aluminate nitrate. The proposed research will investigate an alternative ceramic
process for the preparation of epitaxial ceramic films, which are now usually
prepared by using elaborate and expensive techniques such as chemical vapor
deposition and plasma, sputtered vapor deposition. The aerosol technique
involves the formation of micron or submicron precursors from aqueous solutions
of lanthanum and aluminum nitrate. The aerosol is injected into a tube furnace,
which is heated to temperatures greater than 900oC, to remove the solvent and
form submicron to micron spherical oxide particles. The particles are deposited
on crystalline silicon wafers and then the coated silicon substrates are
annealed to form a polycrystalline film. The proposed research will investigate
the optimization of the aerosol to form a ceramic coating and develop an
epitaxial thin film. The principal investigator will study fundamentally the
effects of the lanthanum/aluminum solution and the annealing step to prepare
ceramic thin films on silicon substrates. ***
