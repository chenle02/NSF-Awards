There is increasing evidence that heterogeneous processes involving cloud
droplets, ice particles, and aerosols play an important role in global
tropspheric chemistry. As a contribution to unraveling the many complex
phenomena involved, the PI proposes to undertake investigations of a wide range
of reactions pertaining to the chemistry of nitrogen containing species of
atmospheric importance. The details of the molecular processes will be
investigated through three major activities. The first will involve contribution
to unraveling the complex chemistry associated with oxides of nitrogen, nitric
acid and nitrosyl sulfuric acid, and ammonia in the troposphere. The second
phase of the work will encompass thermochemical measurements which will provide
information on the energetics of the reactions, and particularly on the
stability of complexes which are likely to be important in the condensation of
nitrogen containing species and in their gas-to-particle conversion. The third
area of study will comprise investigations of the structure, growth and
nucleation of aqueous phase clusters and ice-like crystals. The overall aim of
the work is to provide complementary data which will serve to elucidate a number
of the physical and chemical phenomena at the molecular level, through an
investigation of reactions which have been proposed to be of particular
importance on the basis of modeling calculations, atmospheric measurements, and
other laboratory studies. The approach is to study clusters of ever increasing
degrees of hydration that serve to bridge the regime from the small cluster
domain to the macroscopic particle state. Recent advances in out laboratory
enable us to investigate transformations over this entire range of particle
size.
