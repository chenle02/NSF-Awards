This project will carry out research to test the hypothesis that when high
school physics teachers learn a guided, hands-on inquiry approach to teaching
physics and apply this to their students, the student will develop a better
understanding of physics and become more interested in science. Furthermore this
will result in students continuing to take science in their later educational
activities and perhaps embarking upon science careers. The research will involve
a double strand study comparing students whose teachers have taken teacher
enhancement projects emphasizing special techniques with those whose teachers
who have not. The research will isolate and quantify indicators which determine
the extent to which students have been influenced by teachers using techniques
developed in teacher enhancement workshops. The results will help guide the
development of teacher enhancement programs. The institution is providing a 30%
match to the NSF grant.
