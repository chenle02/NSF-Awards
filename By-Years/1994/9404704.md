9404704 Meier The focus of this research is the preparation and characterization
of reduced fullerenes, particularly those formed from the Birch reduction of
C60. The chemical reactivity of these compopunds will be compared to that of the
parent system. Substitution wih hydrogen atoms, alkyl groups, electron donating
functional groups and electron withdrawing groups will all be used to modify the
properties of the fullerenes. %%% With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program
supports the research of Dr. Mark S. Meier of the Department of Chemistry of the
University of Kentucky. Professor Meier will focus his work on the investigation
of the chemical behavior of the class of compounds known as reduced fullerenes.
These compounds have potential as materials having tailored electronic and
optical properties.
