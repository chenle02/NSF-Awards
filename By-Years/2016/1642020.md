This award will provide a modest amount of funding to help offset the
registration fee for junior participants, about 12 graduate students or
postdocs, at the COSMO-16 conference. COSMO is the premier international series
of cosmology conferences. It started with a meeting in Ambleside, Lake District,
UK in 1997. It is in its 20th edition this year when it is hosted by the
Department of Physics at the University of Michigan. The organizers expect ~250
participants from around the world. The program will be headlined by a number of
distinguished plenary speakers, and will include dark matter, dark energy,
inflation, and gravitational waves, among other topics. The organizers will pay
particular attention to ensuring that the plenary and parallel-session speakers
come from a sufficiently diverse pool.
