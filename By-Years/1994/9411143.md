9411143 Veas Coastal Carolina University The photochromism of
1,3,5-triphenylformazan (TPF) (or a-Phenylazo-a-phenylhydrazonotoluene) and its
derivatives will be studied in solution and the feasibility of the use of this
compound to determine structural characteristics of polymers will be explored.
UV/Visible and infrared spectra of TPF will be complemented with calculations to
understand the photochromism process. Synthetic methods to incorporate
photochromic TPF derivatives into polymers will be explored as well. This grant
from the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Nina Veas at
Coastal Carolina University in the form of a Research Planning Grant. A
molecules that changes color upon irradiation with ultraviolet light will be
studied to determine the mechanism of this process, which is called
photochromism. Computational methods will be employed as an aid in the
determination of the mechanism of photochromism. This molecule and its
derivatives will also be used to determine the structure of polymers by means of
photochromism.
