Virtually all mid-ocean ridge basalt magmas lose gas as they rise through the
ocean crust because they are saturated or oversaturated with carbon dioxide. An
unknown amount of the CO2 that is lost is vented through hydrothermal systems
and used by organisms inhabiting them via biochemical reactions. This research
measures noble gas (Argon and Helium) and CO2 concentrations trapped in bubbles
of basaltic lavas erupted from 1991-1992 and 2005-2006 at the RIDGE 2000
Integrated Study Site on the East Pacific Rise. The concentration and isotopic
composition of these gases provide fundamental information that can be used to
determine the amount of lava degassing on mid-ocean ridges and provide insights
into the evolution of magmas in the ocean crust. Analyses of samples along the
length of individual lava flows offer an unprecedented opportunity to study
magma recharge at a mid-ocean ridge, quantify the amount of pre-eruptive and
syn-eruptive degassing that has occurred, and evaluate the extent to which
carbon from Earth's interior is incorporated into hydrothermal fluids and
ultimately into seafloor ecosystems. Broader impacts of the work include support
of a new noble gas facility at Oregon State University and trains students.
