Pawlik 9314145 Sponges are important components of benthic marine communities,
particularly on coral reefs. Organic extracts of their tissues have yielded a
wealth of unusual chemical compounds that are not known to be involved in
primary metabolism. These secondary metabolites have a diversity of
pharmacological effects in laboratory assays, but it is unclear why sponges
produce them. The most commonly held theory is that these compounds are
distasteful to potential predators. The proposed research will provide an
assessment of the chemical defenses of Caribbean demo sponges, a group whose
taxonomy and chemistry is fairly well described. The investigation will proceed
within a theoretical framework established by previous research on the chemical
ecology of terrestrial plants and marine algae. Overall, this research project
represents the first systematic investigation of the chemical defenses of
tropical marine sponges. The results will be useful in judging the general
applicability of optimal defense theories based on studies of terrestrial
ecosystems. ***
