This project will provide new insights into the long-standing problem of
understanding future tropical cyclone (TC) activity. The results will provide
valuable information for future planning of resource management in water
sensitive regions of the African Sahel and infrastructure of coastal communities
affected by Atlantic TCs.

The primary goal of this project is to explore how the dynamics of African
Easterly Waves (AEW) respond to a climate forcing of doubled atmospheric CO2 and
determine the implications for future Atlantic TC activity. This will be
achieved through a suite of simulations with a coupled and super-parameterized
global climate model that uses embedded cloud resolving models to reproduce a
realistic interaction between convection and large-scale processes. Additional
sensitivity experiments will be conducted to isolate the slow and fast responses
of the climate system, and examine how they affect AEWs. The analysis will also
identify how future AEWs will affect Atlantic TC activity through consideration
of the marsupial paradigm and remote influences on the Atlantic TC genesis
potential.
