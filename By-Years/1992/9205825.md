The Cheyenne belt of southeastern Wyoming separates the Archean Wyoming
Province from accreted island-arc rocks of the Proterozoic Colorado Province.
Along the suture, several parallel mylonite zones separate high grade,
reactivated Archean crust north of the main fault zone. This project will focus
on the development of this reactivated crust and will involve mapping, age
dating and geochemical analysis. Results will help understand the details of the
collision zone between the Archean Wyoming Province and the Proterozoic Colorado
Province and may also provide insight into the deep-seated structural character
of the root zone of a basement uplift in the external zone of a major
collisional belt.
