9451521 Tenney The project will use computers to support and enhance the
laboratory component of general chemistry to make the subject more relevant and
current. The equipment needed for this proposal consists of eight data
acquisition and processing workstations. The data acquisition and processing
workstations will be used in experiments involving real time measurements of
thermochemistry, phase transitions, electrochemistry, pH and potentiometric
titrations, chemical kinetics, and oscillating reactions. Using graphical
analyses of those data, the student can infer functional relationships among the
measured quantities without the tedium of repetitive measurements. Focus will be
placed on interpreting and analyzing results. Students will be expected as the
course progresses to write their own programs to acquire and analyze their data.
The proposed hardware and software has been used in the physical chemistry and
the instrumental laboratories for three years. Fully using computer technology
in the general chemistry should not only increase the number of students who
succeed but also produce students with improved critical reasoning, graphical
analysis, and problem solving skills.
