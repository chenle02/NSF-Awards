Project Overview

This project is a collaborative, multi-sited ethnographic study that will
examine how the rhetoric used by scientists serves to influence scientific
contributions to policy.

Intellectual Merit

The researchers will examine how scientists engage and argue with one another
about policy. Specifically, they will collect and analyze the rhetoric used by
scientists who are engaged in the development of two types of low carbon energy
technologies, wind power and nuclear power, in order to understand how the
composition of their reasoning influences energy policy, and how their rhetoric
could serve as a productive starting point for integrating scientific knowledge
into policy decisions.

Broader Impacts

The project has societal relevance in terms of training a diverse set of
students in social science methodologies and of making the participating
scientists aware of the results so as to improve the integration of science in
policymaking with respect to the crucial issues of climate change mitigation and
energy security.
