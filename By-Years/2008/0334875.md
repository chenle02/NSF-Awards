This project communicates to public audiences a body of research using state-of-
the-art acoustic technology to monitor the long-term movement patterns of
juvenile sharks in a coastal nursery. Aquarium visitors will experience an
interactive live shark exhibit designed to mimic shark monitoring. Interactive
animations of shark movements from the research study are integrated into the
exhibit and will be explained on video monitors while a shark swimming in an
exhibit tank activates detectors showing its location and movement. Designed for
visitors of all ages, the exhibit demonstrates how the research project works
and explains how sharks use coastal bays as nursery areas and how these areas
are critical to the survival of young sharks. Dissemination is through the Mote
Marine Aquarium that receives over 400,000 visitors annually, and through web
cast and distance-learning elements. &lt;br/&gt;
