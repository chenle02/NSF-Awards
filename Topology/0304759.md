The proposal has two parts. The main message of the first part is that for those
Gorenstein singularities whose link is a rational homology sphere the work of
Artin and Laufer on rational, respectively on minimally elliptic singularities
can be continued. The optimism is partly based on the author's work on
Gorenstein elliptic singularities. For hypersurface singularities with rational
homology sphere links the proposal addresses an even stronger conjecture: the
link determines the embedded topological type (in particular, all homological
package derived from the Milnor fibration), all the equivariant Hodge numbers
(in particular, the geometric genus), and the multiplicity (in particular, it
predicts an even sharper property than Zariski's Conjecture). The second part is
concentrated on a recent conjecture of L.I. Nicolaescu and the author which
states that a certain Seiberg-Witten invariant of a rational homology sphere
link can serve as an ``optimal topological upper bound'' for the geometric
genus; and in the Q-Gorenstein case, it determines it. In fact, for a smoothing
of a Gorenstein singularity it predicts that the signature of the Milnor fiber
equals $-8$ times this Seiberg-Witten invariant. This conjecture generalizes an
earlier conjecture of Neumann and Wahl which connects, in the presence of a
smoothing, the Casson invariant of the link and the signature of the Milnor
fiber, provided that the link is an integer homology sphere.

One of the goals of the (analytic) singularity theory is to generalize the
topological and analytical invariants of smooth analytic manifolds. A local
singularity, in fact, is the zero set of some analytic functions From
topological point of view, a local surface singularity is described by its link
which is a 3--manifold (i.e. it is a cone over its link). On the other hand, it
has many analytic invariants codifying interesting properties of the defining
functions. The aim of the proposal is to connect these invariants. The final
goal is a ``lifting property'' which guarantees that many analytic invariants
can be read already at the topological level. The main topological ingredient is
the recent Seiberg-Witten invariant. The proposal combines techniques of
algebraic geometry with topology and sophisticated combinatorial properties of
some graphs.
