0305660&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Holway/Suarez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
U.S.-Argentina award will support Drs. David A. Holway, University of
California, San Diego and Andrew Suarez, University of Illinois, Urbana-
Champaign, who will work in collaboration with Dr. Patricia J. Folgarait at
Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The researchers are
working on factors promoting coexistence between sympatric, native populations
of Argentina ants and fire ants across an extensive region of native-range
sympatry. This work represents a novel contribution in that it examines the
nature and importance of competitive interactions between widespread and
important invaders in areas where these taxa evolved and coexist together. Most
research on invasive species focuses on introduced populations, rather than
starting to study them at the beginning in their native regions. This project
will therefore provide the basic understanding on why these species become
successful invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. Pis have expertise on the
causes and consequences of Argentine ant invasions. Dr. Folgarait brings her
expertise in fire ants and their phorids to this project as well as a
comprehensive understanding of the ant communities of Argentina. Students from
both sides will be involved in this international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
