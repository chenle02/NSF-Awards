This workshop is on evaluating priorities for academic electronic design
automation (EDA) research, with the intention that the results of the meeting
aid in refocusing the field on its roots. Both future priorities for research
and education, as well as areas that are already well-served by the EDA industry
and are unlikely to require major new methodological or technological
breakthroughs are considered. The workshop report includes: (1) a statement of
the most pressing problems to solve within the next decade, (2) recommendations
regarding the style and kind of research to be conducted and suggestions to the
community as to how to implement these suggestions, and (3) viewpoints on
increasing the impact of the EDA field on education in electrical and computer
engineering.
