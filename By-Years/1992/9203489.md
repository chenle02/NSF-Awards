Hawkins, Petersen, and Wierdl will continue to investigate subtle phenomena in
the area of almost everywhere convergence in ergodic theory which involve
coalescing uncountably many exceptional sets of measure zero into a single bad
set of measure zero, namely random sampling of continuous-parameter stationary
processes and ergodic theorems for randomly applied commuting maps. A
characterization of situations in which the random ergodic averages always
converge almost everywhere would provide a powerful extension of the Random
Ergodic Theorem and would also generalize the return times theorem of Bourgain,
Furstenberg, Katznelson, and Ornstein. This project involves research in ergodic
theory. Ergodic theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics can be placed the modern theory
of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. In this way
ergodic theory makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on
homogeneous spaces.
