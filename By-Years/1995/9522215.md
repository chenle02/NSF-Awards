This award supports a rare opportunity to search for manifestations of decadal
climate change in the Dry Valleys, a remote and eqsentially un-instrumented
region of the world, and to examine the long-term dynamics of active polygonal
patterned ground. The opportunity hinges on extensive arrays of soil
displacement markers installed over 30 years ago by Robert F. Black; whether
these marker arrays have considerable scientific promise depends on their
current state, and on the ability to find them. Assessing their scientific merit
is particularly timely in view of the current intensification of research
activity in Antarctica combined with the increasing concern for minimizing
environmental impacts on research activities, past and present. In this context,
it is natural to question the merit of maintaining monitoring sites established
long ago, and to remove traces of past activities, including soil displacement
markers provided they are no longer useful. ***
