9410396 France A significant reason for the rare use of formal specification
techniques (FSTs) in the software development industry is a lack of
understanding of how FSTs can be incorporated into current industrial-strength
software development processes. Current industrial software development
environments tend to favor the use of informal Structured Specification
Methods(SSMs) and Object- Oriented Methods(OOMs) because of their use of
relatively simple, intuitive notations and concepts. Lack of understanding of
how FSTs can be effectively applied in the context of practical development
processes based on SSMs and OOMs often leads to the perception that the use of
one precludes the other. This research is concerned with bridging the gap
between FSTs and the less formal SSMs and OOMs. The research program has three
components: the technical component is concerned with how integration of formal
and informal techniques is accomplished, the organizational component is
concerned with when, how, and under what circumstances integrated specification
techniques can be applied, and the experimental component is concerned with
evaluating the techniques, supporting tools and processes through experimental
application. ***
