This project will support a three workshop series (in 2016, 2017, and 2018) on
the Physics and Mathematics of F-theory that will rotate between Virginia Tech,
Harvard University and Florida State University. The first workshop will be held
in September 2016 at Virginia Tech. The workshop series will promote and
facilitate interdisciplinary research in mathematics and physics. These
workshops will bring together researchers from a diverse range of institutions
and backgrounds to address pressing problems at the interface of
algebraic/differential geometry and string theory. The meetings will include
junior participants and members of under-represented groups in the
sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory provides an arena in which many
significant and challenging questions in modern mathematics can be linked, often
in surprising and fundamental ways. In this workshop series, this formalism will
be utilized to study the geometry of elliptically fibered manifolds in singular
limits, with the goal of bringing together diverse mathematical structures.
These structures range from the moduli spaces of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau
4-manifolds to those of singular Hitchin systems; from birational geometry to
representation theory; and from limiting mixed Hodge structures to the study of
invariants of singular varieties. The programs will involve several areas of
investigation: (1) Resolution graphs relating the structure of singular fibers
to representation-theoreticinvariants, and computing topological invariants of
fibrations with possibly singular base; (2) Establishing isomorphisms between
the Hitchin integrable system and that of the Calabi-Yau integrable system in
the case of singular geometry; and (3) Geometries of (1,0) Conformal Field
Theories. The broader impacts of this workshop series will include the training
of graduate students and the interdisciplinary results of the workshops which
will be widely disseminated in the form of monographs/proceedings. The workshop
