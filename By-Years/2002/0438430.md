The proposal extends previous work in combining dynamic workflows for
interoperations with computational chemistry software by providing additional
resources and evolving a dynamically configurable user interface. The resulting
coupled capability for interactively steered and adaptive resource connection
enables real-time construction of creative workflow strategies. The resulting
computational chemistry and prototyping environment (CCPE) encompasses
interactive application space, dynamic binding to services and new applications,
workflow exploration and publication, and accommodation to a variety of compute
options. The overall objective of this proposal is the development of an
innovative grid architecture integrating real-time applications, data and
intervention, and provisions for post-computing analysis and modeling of data
and image repositories. The proposed information technology (IT) research is
expected &lt;br/&gt;to have broad impact on the computational
(bio)chemistry/biophysics research communities and knowledge base in terms of
methods usage and development for practical problems.
