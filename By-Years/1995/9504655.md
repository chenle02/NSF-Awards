Dr. Matthew P. Augustine has been awarded an NSF Postdoctoral Research
Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Augustine received his doctoral degree from Yale
University under the supervision of Professor Kurt Zilm. Dr. Augustine will
continue research at the University of California at Berkeley under the
sponsorship of Professor Alexander Pines. His postdoctoral research will target
understanding chemical reactions of adsorbates within zeolite catalysts.
Combination of separated local field and chemical exchange NMR experiments will
be used to correlate dipolar interactions with isotropic chemical shifts in
order to obtain detailed structural information about the adsorbate molecule.
The research pursues novel applications of solids NMR techniques to structural
questions in both materials, as well as biological science. The Postdoctoral
Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important
infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new
Ph. D.s and attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical
research and teaching.
