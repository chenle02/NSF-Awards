9505394 Bonasera The International Junior Investigator and Postdoctoral Fellows
Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four
months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
experimental conditions abroad. This award will provide partial support for a
postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Thomas A. Bonasera to work with Professor
Bengt Roland Langstrom of Uppsala University PET Centre in Sweden. The initial
ten months of research will be supported by a Fulbright grant. This award will
allow Dr. Bonasera to do a full year of research. The purpose of this research
project is to study the radiochemical synthesis of carbon-11 labeled steroidal
androgen receptor ligands as potential imaging agents for positron emission
tomographic (PET) assessment of the androgen receptor protein in men with
prostate cancer. Several androgen receptor ligands (steroids with high affinity
for the androgen receptor protein) will be synthesized in the carbon-11 labeled
form. Some of them will be labeled at two different positions with carbon-11.
The main objective is to develop efficient reaction conditions for the carbon-11
radiolabeling of these steroids, to optimize the reaction yields in each step of
the synthesis, and to select one or more of the ligands for further future study
as a PET imaging agent. ***
