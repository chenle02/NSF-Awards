Doppler radar has proven to be an invaluable tool for the study of many
meteorological phenomena. The Principal Investigator will use a combination of
Doppler radar data, theoretical studies and numerical modelling to attack a
broad range of meteorological research problems including: (1) Simple numerical
models and previously collected Doppler radar data from two NSF sponsored field
projects will be used to study the role of drop breakup in the intensification
and formation of severe downdrafts (microbursts); (2) New techniques for
determining Doppler radar derived turbulent kinetic energy and momentum fluxes
in the boundary layer will be verified with high resolution aircraft data; (3)
Theoretical studies and actual data will be used to develop and test new
estimators of the width of Doppler velocity spectrum. This last goal will
utilize data collected with a unique, state-of-the-art processor which has only
recently been installed on the CHILL National Radar Facility
