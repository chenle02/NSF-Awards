The fellowship program for PhD-level candidates supports dissertation work on
natural, technological and human-made hazards, risk and disasters in any
relevant field of the natural and physical sciences, social and behavioral
sciences, specialties in engineering, and interdisciplinary programs such as
environmental studies. Today there is a need to encourage PhD candidate students
in many different disciplines to conduct interdisciplinary scholarly work in the
hazards field. No other financial resource exists where doctoral students can
obtain money for dissertation field research for a wide range of disciplines
across all aspects of hazards. The grants are flexible and can be used for data
collection, travel for field work or for presentation of findings at meetings,
purchase of software, etc. (but not for stipends or tuition).

The fellowship program provides the financial support that facilitates the
conduct of dissertations in the disciplines that support hazard research and
advances pertinent scientific discovery. The program fosters the development of
scholars who have the career-long commitment to research on hazards, risk, and
disasters that comes with doing dissertation research and, consequently,
contributes to the nation?s future research capacity and infrastructure on these
scientific topics and social problems. The program requirement to translate
dissertation research results into short, non-technical reports for use by
policymakers, governmental officials, and other non-scientific audiences helps
transform public understanding of hazards, risk, and disasters. The fellowship
program is administered by two nonprofit, hazard and risk focused organizations
whose principal missions are to disseminate hazard, risk and disaster
information, training and educational material. Their nonprofit stature and low
overhead creates a highly efficient benefit ratio.
