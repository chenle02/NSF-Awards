This project develops a laboratory to support a "computer literacy" course based
on the problem solving techniques used by computer scientists. This course
addresses some of the deficiencies in problem solving skills observed in the
general student body. Computer scientists want their courses to reflect the
skills which computer scientists practice. On the other hand, computer literacy
courses must also serve the needs as perceived by other departments. Therefore,
the course employs common forms of applications software as tools. Students
develop sufficient skills in those tools while concentrating on the problem
solving aspects of the course. The course is aimed primarily to those students
who do not intend to pursue the field of computer science further, in particular
education majors. The new service course addresses serious problem solving or
reasoning issues - in the context of computer applications. Formal problem
solving techniques are presented in a manner understandable by non-technical
students. These are the same techniques used by computer scientists, and other
members of the scientific and mathematical communities in many aspects of their
work. Students also acquire a knowledge of spreadsheets and data bases in a
manner analogous to the way chemistry students learn about balances and Bunsen
burners: both are tools used while addressing serious intellectual problems.
