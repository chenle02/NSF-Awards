The relationship between species diversity (i.e., the number of species) of an
ecological community and its productivity (e.g., the amount of biomass produced
in a year) has been studied intensively in ecology, both from a theoretical
point of view, and through some of the largest experiments ever conducted in the
field. Understanding how biodiversity and productivity are related is essential
for applications, such as the development of biofuels, as well as to predict the
effects of species loss. The project aims to leverage the large amount of
experimental data available to develop new statistical, mathematical and
computational tools that can be used to predict the productivity of untested
ecological communities, and to determine the contribution of shared evolutionary
history to the functioning of ecosystems. Importantly, the same mathematical
machinery developed for the study of ecological communities can be used to
answer distant questions, such as the effect of combinations of antibiotics on
the growth of bacteria. The work is complemented by the publication of software
packages, lecture notes and teaching material, to facilitate community adoption
and extension of the newly developed tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project
aims to develop a statistical framework to fit data stemming from Biodiversity-
Ecosystem Functioning experiments that is consistent with the Generalized Lotka-
Volterra model, one of the best-studied models for population dynamics. To keep
the number of free parameters sufficiently small, interactions between any two
species are modeled as a function of their shared evolutionary history. In turn,
this makes it possible to test the effects of phylogeny on productivity, by
including the whole structure of the evolutionary tree connecting all members of
an ecological community, rather than summary statistics as in current practice.
By moving beyond the linear regression approaches traditionally used to model
these data, the project will bridge the gap between theory of population
dynamics and experimental approaches. To further connect population dynamics
with phylogenetic information, the project will develop models with explicit
accounting for phylogeny, allowing research to investigate the effects of shared
evolutionary history on the coexistence and stability of ecological
communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
