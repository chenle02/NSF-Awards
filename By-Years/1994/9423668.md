9423668 Dutta This research is a comprehensive investigation of creep mechanisms
in unidirectionally reinforced, continuous fiber, metal-matrix composites
(MMCs), combining both analytical and experimental approaches. The work is
unique in three respects: (1) it seeks to develop a model, which explicitly
accounts for strain history, interfacial sliding, and time-dependent changes in
matrix creep; (2) it seeks mechanistic insight, rather than predictive ability,
by proposing experimental quantification of the roles of the matrix, interface
and fiber on the overall creep response; (3) it constitutes the only attempt to
date at summarizing the stress-temperature-time dependence of creep mechanisms
in continuous fiber MMCs in the form of transient deformation mechanism maps,
which are valuable in predicting the strain response and dominant deformation
mechanisms in composites over a wide range of stress and temperature conditions.
The experimental program includes a novel approach to monitor damage mechanisms
in real time during creep testing of composites. The creep response of
continuous fiber composites is complex because of progressive transfer of load
from the matrix to the fibers, resulting in transient behavior which makes
mechanistic studies difficult. This is complicated by fiber-matrix interfacial
sliding, interaction of internal residual stresses with the applied stresses,
and changes in the matrix deformation mechanism with evolving stress conditions.
Accordingly, a clear phenomenological picture of creep in continuous fiber
reinforced metal-matrix composites (MMC) has not emerged. %%% This project is
expected to yield substantial fundamental insight on creep mechanisms in
continuous fiber MMCs, particularly with respect to the roles of matrix and
interface deformation.
