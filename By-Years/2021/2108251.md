Principal Investigators (PIs) Angus and Curtis are studying cool dwarf stars,
the most common and most poorly understood stars in the Galaxy. They will
measure the rotation periods for approximately 100,000 stars using data from the
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to understand the rotation history and evolution
of the stars. There is a mysterious gap in the rotation period distribution of M
dwarf stars and they hope to shed light on its origin. It could be caused by a
change in the stellar structure or magnetism or due to the local star formation
history. They will create and distribute a stellar rotation catalog which will
provide data suitable for calibrating the stellar age-rotation relation. This
lays the groundwork for future surveys using data from the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory which has the potential to determine the ages of billions of stars.
The PIs will collaborate with six astronomers and six artists to develop science
stories about the ZTF and the Rubin Observatory. The stories will be available
online as part of the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s SciCafe Public
Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will analyze data for 1 million stars
observed by the ZTF and they will publish a catalog of the rotation periods for
approximately 100,000 FGKM dwarfs out to distances of 3 kpc. This catalog will
increase the number of field M dwarf rotation periods by two orders of
magnitude. The PIs will provide open-source software for light curve creation,
multi-band rotation period detection, and validation tools applicable to data
from both the ZTF and the Rubin Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
