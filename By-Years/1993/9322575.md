Proposal #: 93-22575 This award provides funding for acquisition of shipboard
instrumentation in support of NSF-funded research. The instruments will be used
aboard the R/V ISELIN, a 170 foot vessel, or the R/V CALANUS, a 64 foot vessel.
Both vessels are owned and operated by the University of Miami as research
vessels in support of oceanographic research. Instrumentation requested includes
computer hardware for the ISELIN, upgrades to meteorological sensors, a high
speed modem for data communications, a 3-D GPS system, a fluorometer, a clean
water system for the CALANUS, and a depth sounder. The instrumentation requested
is required for support of NSF-funded cruises aboard the ISELIN and the CALANUS
during 1994 and will enhance the scientific capability of the vessels in the
future.
