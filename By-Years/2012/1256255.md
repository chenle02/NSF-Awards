This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will deliver a
system that can continuously process advanced refractory metal alloys from
elemental, scrap or preprocessed feed stock into powder or small castings. The
advanced hybrid plasma arc induction furnace uses the latest in clean melting
techniques maintaining the full theoretical properties of these promising
materials. This is a direct processing route for near net shape products.
Advanced titanium alloys, for example, require special processes to maintain
their material properties. This process will allow the development of specialist
alloys without the cost and complexity of large and expensive foundry processes
and rolling mills. The process developed takes pure elemental material and
produces castings or powder in one direct cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be the creation of new
methods for development of specialist and advanced reactive and refractory
alloys. Currently there is no economically viable route for these alloys to move
from small, lab-scale experiments to use in large-scale commercial applications.
This new process will speed the process of transitioning these materials into
emerging applications. The overall objective of this project is to create a
pilot-scale plant to produce castings and powder of these specialist materials.
Some selected material systems where this new process will have a potential
impact include advance titanium-based shape memory alloys and intermetallics
such as niobium?]silicide based compounds. These new materials will create value
for customers and users in the medical and aerospace industries, among others.
The new process will be commercialized via the sale of a toll production service
for castings and powder, and also via direct sales of the resulting equipment.
Finally, the ability to easily produce pilot-scale quantities of novel alloys
more cost-effectively will enhance the scientific understanding and application
of these materials.
