The objective of this research is for the PI to strengthen skills related to
proposal preparation for NSF. A preliminary investigation of multi-layered
pulsed photocathodes will be the scientific thrust of the proposals written
during the planning grant period. Laser driven photoelectron sources can be
pulsed at very high rates and are capable of simultaneously achieving high
brightness, long lifetime, and resistance to poor vacuum conditions. Lanthanum
Hexaboride is a low work function material that can be used to make efficient
photoemitters. At present, most of the work on these photoemitters has been
centered on the large area, bulk, surface photoemission properties. The details
of the photoemission process for multi-layered, transmission mode Lanthanum
Hexaboride photocathodes and photo-assisted microelectronic field emission
cathodes will be investigated as a long term goal. The long term activities of
proposed investigation involves fabricating and measuring the electrical and
material properties of a variety of vertical and lateral cathode structures.
