The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. Howard Fairbrother of Johns Hopkins
University. Prof. Fairbrother and his research group will study the surface
interactions that regulate the behavior of nanoparticles in aqueous environments
by measuring particle-surface interactions of carbon nanotubes and gold
nanoparticles in model environmental systems. The study will make use of state
of the art instrumentation to study these interactions including atomic force
microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-VIS absorption
spectroscopy. Surface properties will be assayed using zeta potential
measurements, potentiometric titrations and chemical derivatization techniques
in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study will lead to a significantly improved fundamental understanding of
nanoparticle behavior in aquatic environments, which will enable the rational
synthesis of safe-by-design nanoparticles. The development of safe materials,
including nanoparticles is a priority area for NSF and the nation. The study
will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate
students in an area of research of great societal importance.
