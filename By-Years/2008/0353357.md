This five-year research study will focus on the impact of different teacher
preparation and induction models, as well as on the quality and persistence of
secondary science teachers. Combining the strengths of case-based research with
a quasi-experimental design this study will follow 120 secondary science
teachers for three years from four different and well characterized preservice -
induction programs. Many of the "newly" inducted teachers will be assigned in
multicultural, diverse or urban settings and the broader impact will include not
only the teachers in the study but the potential impact on their students. The
rationale for this project is well developed from the literature on the STEM
teaching workforce as well as reports from the National Commission on Teaching
and America's Future. The rationale for the induction program approaches are
also well supported in the literature and is extended through the literature on
early STEM teacher development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
