This joint award from the NSF Division of Chemistry and Division of Materials
Research supports the Gordon Research Conference and Graduate Research Seminar
on the timely and important topic of solar fuels. Participants from diverse
disciplines including chemistry, materials research, biology and physics will
discuss the conversion and storage of energy from
sunlight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GRC program features a diverse and
international group of invited speakers and discussion leaders. Two GRC poster
presentations will emphasize the participation of junior scientists, and one
session has been reserved to be an open session in which attendees with timely
new results will be able to present a synposis of their recent work to the
conference attendees. The GRS program will feature oral and poster presentations
by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, accompanied by informal and
formal discussion with junior and senior faculty GRS attendees.
