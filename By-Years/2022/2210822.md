The 2022 UArctic Assembly in Portland, Maine, offers the opportunity for
Indigenous youth from New England and the Arctic to learn about sustainability
science and build networks for future collaboration. This conference award
supports participation of youth in activities focused on best practices for
research partnerships, and sustainable development and climate adaptation
strategies in Indigenous communities. Participants will have the opportunity to
engage with UArctic leadership, Congressional representatives, and diplomats
from Arctic nations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized by the Wabanaki Youth in
Science Program, the youth gathering engages Indigenous youth in learning,
leadership, and collaborative activities related to sustainability science and
the development of global partnerships. Participants will develop plans for a
future youth sustainability conference and work on communication strategies to
promote engagement. They will return to their home communities with
international collaborative experience, a foundation in the principles of
sustainability, and an expanded network of future Indigenous
leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
