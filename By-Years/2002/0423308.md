This research provides a comprehensive, integrated theoretical framework to
examine the relationship between information technology substitutes and
complements and work group performance. The methodological approach uses an
organizational learning curve framework in which to examine the effects of
incremental investments in information technology (IT) on work group
productivity, mediated by the effects of IT investment upon the learning curves
experienced by the work groups. The research uses a rigorous mathematical model
that is grounded in practice and theory, and complementary to existing
organizational behavior and organizational learning theories. It is hypothesized
that IT that substitutes for human resources results in lower organizational
learning and higher knowledge depreciation, while IT that complements human
resources results in higher organizational learning and lower knowledge
depreciation. The model instantiates a multi-dimensional view of group
performance by incorporating in the learning curve dependent variable not only
productivity measures, as in traditional learning curve models, but also
measures of cost and quality. The investigation will test the integrated model
empirically in the work setting of a major financial institution. This research
potentially has very broad implications for the consequences of different IT
investments on organizations -- public, private, and government -- their
productivity, quality, and costs.
