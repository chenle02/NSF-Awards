Joyce 9215342 An observational program of moored acoustic Doppler current
profilers and current meters will be conducted under the RIDGE program to
examine the spatial and temporal variability of a buoyant hydrothermal plume on
the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The objectives are to determine if
the observed features of velocity and vorticity fields are consistent with the
theory that suggest that hydrothermal venting can generate unsteady mesoscale
vortices and whether they are correlated with anomalous temperature and
particulate signatures associated with the venting.
