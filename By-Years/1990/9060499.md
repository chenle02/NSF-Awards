Several types of photo-responsive polymers have been developed over the past 10
years. However, current limitations (such as irreversibility, inadequate
physical changes, and high expense) have prevented their widespread use. Bend
Research proposes to pursue a new class of photo-responsive polymers for use in
a variety of applications (e.g., optical memory devices, absorbants, switches in
robotic systems, and coatings for pharmaceuticals and other active ingredients).
Given Phase I limitations, we will focus this work on controlled-release
applications. Our goal is to have these polymers provide 1) reversible (on/off)
release of the active ingredient; 2) pulsatile or sustained delivery; 3)
controllable release kinetics, independent of the triggering mechanism; and 4)
efficient use of many different active ingredients at high concentrations. The
proposed technology uses azobenzene compounds as a "switch" to cause reversible
photo-induced changes in the polymer. When exposed to ultraviolet light,
functional groups on an azobenzene compound and an agent compound cause changes
in the physical properties of the polymer. The polymer properties return to
their original values when not exposed to ultraviolet light. The proposed use of
azobenzene differs from previous development efforts in that it does not rely
solely on the isomerization of the azobenzene compounds as the conformational
changes in the polymer.
