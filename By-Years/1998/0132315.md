The aim of this project is to investigate the thinking processes of young
children and to find out how these processes affect children's ability to learn
science in elementary school. The main focus of the research will be on how
children learn to design simple experiments and how they understand experimental
outcomes so that they can reach conclusions based on hard evidence. Throughout
the project, there will be two intertwined strands of effort, lab-based studies
and classroom-based studies. The expectation is that results from the lab
studies will form the basis for the design of improved curriculum units that are
grounded in cognitive theory and that can be implemented within the constraints
of real classroom situations. Conversely, the expectation is that the classroom
observations and assessments will raise questions that will be studied in the
lab. The research will involve several interrelated studies. One will determine
whether or not teaching children the basics of experimental design will enable
them to understand better the results of others' scientific investigations, for
example, other children's science fair posters, or claims they hear about what
"scientists have discovered." Another study will investigate children's
understanding of various types of error that can occur during the design, setup,
execution, and analysis of experiments. The goal is to find out how children
react when they see that things don't always turn out exactly the same way when
they run the "same" experiment repeatedly. In addition, part of the research
will explore the effect of presenting science instruction via a computer
interface rather than with a live teacher. One of the studies will examine pre-
school children's ability to generate notations for simple procedures that
involve sequences of actions. Such an ability is an important precursor to using
notation in the science lab.
