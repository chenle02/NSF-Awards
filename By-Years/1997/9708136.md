ABSTRACT 97-08136 Ward Ecology of hot spring microbial mat communities: Causes
and importance of biodiversity. The objective of this research is to determine
whether the same forces that caused the evolution of plant and animal species
also caused the evolution of microbial species. We use molecular methods to
detect heretofore unrecognized microorganisms in natural geothermal
environments, which serve as model systems for understanding the biodiversity,
ecology and evolution of microbial species. We will study whether the bacteria
we have detected in Yellowstone National Park hot springs evolved-like Galapagos
finches-by adapting to specific environmental features (e.g., temperature,
light, pH, sulfide), and whether bacteria in geographically separated hot
springs constitute different species (like flightless birds on different
continents). These findings will help us define what bacterial species are, and
gain a predictive knowledge of their ecological importance and of their recovery
for potential biotechnological use. Despite out extensive use of microbial
products such as antibiotics, fewer than 1% of the species of microorganisms are
known to science.
