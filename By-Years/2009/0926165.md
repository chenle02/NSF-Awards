This award provides NSF support to sponsor students and faculty mentors from US
institutions to participate in a doctoral symposium held during the First
Workshop on Privacy and Security in Pervasive e-Health and Assistive
Environments (PSPAE?09 http://www.petrae.org/docs/PSPAE_ann_f.pdf ) in Corfu,
Greece, June 9-13, 2009. This workshop is in conjunction with the Second
International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive
Environments (PETRA?09 http://www.petrae.org).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The doctoral
symposium shares the aims of the PSPAE workshop, seeking new directions in
security and privacy research and education. The focus of the PSPAE workshop is
a multidisciplinary discussion aimed towards developing new insights into
privacy and security issues for pervasive technologies that will be deployed for
the benefit of society. The scientific community is expected to benefit from
discussions on the crossover between security and privacy and on the issues
arising in complex application areas such as healthcare. The doctoral consortium
seeks to open new horizons for graduate students who may pursue privacy and
security research in healthcare and other pervasive assistive environments.
Another objective is to create an international forum that can expose graduate
students to the differences in privacy policies around the world, especially
regarding health privacy and security.&lt;br/&gt;
