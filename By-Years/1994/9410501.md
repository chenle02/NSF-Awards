9410501 Stahl This research will develop an alternative theory of strategic
thinking that would allow for a population of players with a variety of thought
processes, would be empirically testable, and would yield more accurate
predictions of human behavior. The analysis of the experimental data is expected
to answer the following questions, among others: - How well does the model
predict relative to alternative theories? - How robust is the determination of
the type of a specific player from that player's choices? Is the tpye of
identification invariant over a variety and number of games, and is it valid for
predicting out-of-sample behavior? - Can extra-ordinary subjects be detected? -
Assuming that players are given complete information about the past choices of
the population, is it reasonable to assume that the various types would
incorporate that information? The study is significant because it provides
results that would enrich our understanding of individual decision making in
strategic settings.
