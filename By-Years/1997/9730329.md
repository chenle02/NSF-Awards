9730329 Katz The Mathematical Association of America is developing twelve
instructional modules based on the history of mathematics to be used in high
school classrooms. Each module will contain: 1) a teacher's guide to the lesson;
2) the historical and cultural background for and current applications of the
topic; 3) biographical information about the mathematicians (where possible) who
contributed to the topic; 4) detailed lesson plans; 5) copy masters; 6)
exercises for students; 7) suggestions for student projects; 8) a bibliography;
and 9) questions to be answered by students as part of a written journal. The
modules contain mathematics topics already present in the high school curriculum
and are intended to be replacement or supplementary units. Mathematical and
historical content enhancement is provided the teacher-writers and field test
teachers through a Faculty Enhancement grant, DUE 9752755.
