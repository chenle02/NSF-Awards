With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Purchase College, State University of New York will
acquire a gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric (GC/MS) detection. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) cuticular
hydrocarbons of Hawaiian Drosophila: Drosophila heteroneura and Drosophila
silvestris; b) cuticular hydrocarbons and pheromones of the Drosophila
paulistorum semispecies; c) organoselenium chemoprevention in promotion phase of
rat mammary cancer; d) investigation of the effects of propylene glycol on the
biodiversity and chemical balance of Blind Brook; e) synthesis of
aryltrimethylsilanes via the Diels-Alder reaction; and f) biological degradation
of methyl tert-butyl ether in aqueous systems and soil microcosms.

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) is an extremely
powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.
These studies will have significant impact in a variety of areas, including
chemistry, biology and environmental sciences.
