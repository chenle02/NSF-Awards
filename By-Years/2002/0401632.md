This project will develop a first principle method for describing the effects of
complex geometry and morphology on the adhesion of micron-scale colloids to
substrates. This is of importance in the U.S. semiconductor manufacturing
industry. Traditional approaches to describing particle adhesion rely on
Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory or on approaches using the work
of adhesion in conjunction with the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT), Johnson-
Kendall-Roberts (JKR), or Maugis-Dugdale (MD) models for colloid deformation.
These approaches are only applicable for idealized systems.

The proposed approach will modify traditional van der Waals (vdW) force
expressions to describe the adhesion in aqueous solution. It will account for
complex geometry and morphology of the substrates and colloids and also will
include the deformation and roughness of the colloids and substrates.
Descriptions of geometrically and morphologically-complex colloid-substrate
systems of interest to the semiconductor community will be included. Measurement
of the contact adhesion force will be performed with an atomic force microscope
(AFM). The colloids are either good model materials or common contaminants in
integrated circuit processing (SiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 ). The substrates are
important substrates for integrated circuit processing.

In the semiconductor industry, the proposed approach could find immediate
application in wafer cleaning protocols during post-etch processing and post-
chemical-mechanical-polishing processing. In the biomedical industry, it could
be used to improve implant sterilization processes.
