Much recent research has focused on the role of place in social organization
and activity. An active debate has ensued regarding the relative importance of
the residential community versus the workplace as sites for the establishment of
class identity and the creation of conditions that encourage workers to organize
labor unions. This doctoral dissertation research project will attempt to assess
the role of work- and home-based activities in the success of the International
Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in
New York City in the years before World War II. Through examination of archives
containing papers from both unions and labor leaders, through analyses of other
printed materials, and through interviews with labor and community leaders, the
investigator will demonstrate how community-related programs played a crucial
role in the unions' success and how abandonment of those programs contributed to
the unions' decline after World War II. This research will provide detailed
insights based on primary materials to clarify the nature of residential locales
in the social process of union organization and activity. Although focusing on a
case study, the analysis will provide a basis for comparison with studies of
other organizations in other locales, thereby expanding general understandings
of these important processes. This project also will provide an excellent
opportunity for a promising graduate student to expand and refine her basic
research skills.
