The purpose of this project is to improve the training of undergraduates on
methods of ethnoscience as practiced by archaeologists. Equipment is
specifically being used in the study of Late Prehistoric (A.D. 400-1500)
subsistence change in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Students learn to identify
types of carbonized plant remains recovered from archaeological sites and to
interpret the significance of assemblages changing through time during the
transition from a foraging to an agricultural lifeway. Undergraduates also apply
the latest analytical procedures to archaeobotanical remains from several
important sites.
