This research explores extreme events in three nonlinear fluid flows:
Turbulence, the pinch-off of pendant drops, and braking surface waves. Precision
experiments examine each of these nonlinear systems to characterize and predict
the occurrence of locally intense events which focus vorticity, dissipation, or
energy in each system. The goal of this project is to characterize the causal
mechanisms for these events and to use that knowledge to benchmark simulations
and stimulate applied mathematical advances. The fundamental research should
impact our ability to predict and numerically simulate strongly nonlinear fluid
flow. In addition, the work has technical applications in the fields of
mechanical engineering, geophysics, and applied mathematics. The mentoring and
training of young scientists plays an important role in the research. Graduate
and undergraduate students are involved in every aspect of this exciting
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores unusually strong
disturbances that occur in fluid flows: Examples include turbulence and braking
waves. Precision measurements will be used to predict the occurrence of locally
intense events in such as rapid fluid rotation, or vortex formation, and large
local occurrences of heating or energy dissipation. The goal is to build
predictive models for these events and to use that knowledge to test computer
simulations and to promote mathematical advances in these difficult problems.
This research can be applied to the fields of mechanical engineering,
geophysics, and applied mathematics. The mentoring and training of young
scientists plays an important role in the proposed research. Graduate and
undergraduate students will be involved in every aspect of this exciting
research, which prepares them for careers in industry, government, or
academia.&lt;br/&gt;
