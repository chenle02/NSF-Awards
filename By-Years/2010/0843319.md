The field of neural engineering aims to develop technologies that discover,
rehabilitate or alter brain function while at the same time deriving inspiration
from neurobiology to build artificial systems with adaptive capabilities similar
to biological systems. The ultimate goal is to enhance quality of life both for
disabled and healthy individuals. Neural engineering solutions will reduce the
economic burden on families and communities and bestow a greater degree of
freedom and confidence.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is an opportune time to unite
the efforts of academia and industry in the Pacific Northwest region and create
a Center for Neural Engineering. As a first step, we propose to run a workshop
in which local researchers can learn about each other and the plan for the
center, listen to international experts in the field, and exchange ideas through
brainstorming sessions. We have invited keynote speakers who are recognized
experts and from outside the Pacific Northwest and others who may serve as
future advisory board members for the center. Our aims include using the
workshop as a launching pad for the center and leveraging the visibility gained
to initiate the resource gathering process both regionally and
nationally.&lt;br/&gt;
