The broader goal of this research is to understand how crowding and the weak
association of proteins in the live cell is used by cells to control its
proteins. This project makes connection with many areas in physics, chemistry
and cell biology. Thus, the undergraduate and graduate students supported by
this research project come from many scientific backgrounds, and will acquire
the knowledge and hands-on skills to advance US chemical technology and teaching
in the area of molecular and cellular biophysics. Special efforts will also be
made to disseminate the instrumentation technology resulting from this project,
and create strong ties to researchers in the US and abroad. Thus the project
will have impacts in biotechnology and instrumentation industry.

The objective of this research project is to look inside single cells to see how
their crowded environment affects the proteins and nucleic acids that keep the
cell alive. Specific tasks are to find out how protein folding and movement
inside cells interact, how the cell cycle controls protein folding, and how
components of the spliceosome form inside cells from proteins and nucleic acids.
The spliceosome cuts and rejoins our DNA so messenger RNA can be manufactured
for making proteins. Humans could not live without it, yet we know virtually
nothing about the biophysics of how its many protein and RNA pieces are
assembled to do the job. As a final important task, the PI will look at an
important industrial method that borrows the crowding idea from cells. So-called
"PEGylation" enhances protein longevity by decorating proteins with stabilizing
polymers, but the biophysical mechanism of stabilization remains unknown.
