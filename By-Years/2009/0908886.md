Dr. Alexei Filippenko and his students will undertake an extensive, multifaceted
investigation to discover and characterize large numbers of supernovae, which
are the explosive deaths of certain types of stars. Supernovae synthesize and
expel heavy elements, thereby dictating much of the chemical evolution of
galaxies. The ejecta of supernovae blast through the interstellar medium,
heating it and giving rise to phenomena such as galactic fountains. Shock waves
from supernovae may also trigger vigorous bursts of star formation through
compression of dense molecular clouds. Supernovae are probably responsible for
the production of some of the most energetic cosmic rays in the Universe.
Certain types of supernovae are exceedingly useful for measuring distances of
galaxies billions of light years away, and are playing a crucial role in
determinations of the age, global structure, and evolution of the Universe.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will continue the efforts of Dr. Filippenko's
group to improve the understanding of the progenitor stars, explosion
mechanisms, nucleosynthetic products, and cosmological utility of different
types of supernovae. The adopted approach is largely observational, coupled with
theoretical modeling through several informal collaborations. A new major goal
is to discover supernovae very shortly after the explosion. Current and new data
will be assembled for the purpose of improving the use of supernovae for
cosmology and for obtaining clues to the physical nature of supernova
progenitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this study will have broad
implications for topics as diverse as the chemical evolution of galaxies, the
masses of black holes, the nature of gamma-ray bursts, and the expansion of the
Universe. Results will be disseminated to a broad audience, both to students and
to the general public. Planned activities include student trips to Lick
Observatory, and the production of a 12-episode video course on black holes.
