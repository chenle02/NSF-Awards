The long term objective is to understand the molecular mechanism of imprinting,
the marking of chromosomes as being of maternal or paternal origin. The study of
imprinting should help answer basic questions about inheritance and gene
regulation during development. I propose to examine the feasibility of using
embryonic stem (ES) cells undergoing X chromosome inactivation as a model system
for imprinting. ES cells, derived from mouse embryos, can grow in tissue
culture, and by simple changes in growth conditions, the cells can also be
induced to undergo differentiation in vitro. ES cells are known to form two
layers as they differentiate into embryoid bodies, an endoderm-like outer layer,
and an ectoderm-like inner layer. I propose to use ES lines which are
heterozygous for a number of X-linked genes, and an allele-specific assay for
specific RNAs to characterize X-inactivation in these cells. I propose 1) to
characterize X-inactivation in the inner ectoderm layer and the endoderm layer,
2) to investigate large scale methods of separating the two layers for
biochemical analysis, and 3) to analyze whether DNA methylation patterns found
in mouse embryos are preserved in ES cells. In addition, I propose to study the
distribution of a transcript, termed Xist, recently discovered to be synthesized
only from the inactive X chromosome. I propose to use in situ hybridization and
PCR-based assays to learn more about the role of Xist in cases where the
paternal X chromosome is preferentially inactivated. %%% The mystery of how a
chromosome is marked as being either from the mother or the father should begin
to be solved by the development of this system and the results of these
experiments.
