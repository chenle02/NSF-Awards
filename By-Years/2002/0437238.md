This proposal consists of two tasks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decision making under
the suspicion of deception&lt;br/&gt;Decision making under social and
hierarchical pressure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As stated in the proposal, cognitive
scientists and social psychologists have studied decision making under
uncertainty a great deal. However there are few studies analyzing faulty
information. The project will attempt to study such situations by creating
potential deceptions and studying how humans react and make decisions.
