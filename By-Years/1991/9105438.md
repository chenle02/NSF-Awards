The Acadian tectonic belt of New England records several pulses of compression
from the Ordovician to the carboniferous before the onset of extension in the
Triassic. The evolution of the Bronson Hill anticlinorium and the Merrimack
synclinorium of central Massachusetts has received much work and has been the
cornerstone of understanding the paleozoic compressional orogenies of New
England. Recent advances in single-crystal age determinations and petrographic
microbeam techniques have provided an opportunity to rigorously test previous
conclusions and have already provided suggestions of considerable revisions to
the tectonic history of this classic area. This project will combine the wealth
of prior work with the results of new age determinations and quantitative
petrology to address several key problems and to integrate the results into a
new synthesis of the evolution of the northern Appalachians.
