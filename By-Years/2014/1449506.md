Energy transportation, distribution, and use are major problems for military
forces. To simplify logistics, the US military has chosen JP-8 as the sole
battlefield fuel. While JP-8 is useful in combustion-based generators, the
absence of low molecular weight hydrocarbons and the high concentration of
sulfur-containing molecules preclude the use of commercial gas appliances and
energy-dense portable fuel cells. Several commercially available fuel converters
can reform JP-8 into syngas or hydrogen; but process complexity and sulfur
intolerance hinder their widespread adoption. Therefore, the current proposal
explores a new fuel reformation method that has been developed at the University
of South Carolina.

The fuel converter accepts a variety of transportation fuels, including JP-8,
and produces a mixture of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. In contrast to
hydrogen, the products from the process are easy to compress and store and are
more versatile for use in solid oxide fuel cells, commercial gas appliances, and
combustion generators. The zeolite-based catalyst is the core of the fuel
conversion technology; it is resistant to coking, sulfur-poisoning, and active
at low conversion temperatures. Two of the strongest attributes of the catalytic
process is its sulfur tolerance and low-sulfur product concentration; in other
words, the process is a fuel reformer and desulfurizer. The team will research
scale-up of the catalyst production in anticipation for customer demand. The
scientific knowledge that is gained during scale up through catalyst
characterization will facilitate commercialization of the fuel conversion
technology and can be translated to other zeolite scale-up processes.
