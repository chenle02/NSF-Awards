Pi: Sun DMS-9501401 This proposal deals with inverse boundary value problems
for linear and quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations and systems.
Research will be focused on uniqueness questions for inverse boundary value
problems for elliptic equations of second order, the quasilinear anisotropic
conductivity equation, the 2x2 first order elliptic systems and the elasticity
system. The proposed research represents an effort in exploring new technologies
of deducing as much information as possible about the electromagnetic, elastic
or thermal properties of a body from measurements made at the boundary of the
body. Results of this study would be particularly useful in designing diagnostic
tools for medical and biological sciences, in detecting land mines and other
underground metal objects and in testing nondestructively materials with
possible cracks.
