This award from the Academic Research Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist
the Department of Chemistry at Wellesley College acquire a 360 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
including the following: (1) metabolic studies of a nitrogen storage polymer in
cyanobacteria, and (2) synthesis and 13C and 1H NMR characterization of
alkanethiolate-gold cluster monolayers. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation
of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances,
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as
polymers, catalysis, and in biology.
