This proposal addresses the need for improved methods to routinely monitor key
variables within soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) parameterizations
nested within climate and numerical weather forecasting models. To this end, a
two year research plan is described to refine and validate a simple model to
parameterize land surface processes in SVAT models using remotely sensed data
sources. Key variables within this framework are surface temperature, vegetation
type and amount, and surface moisture status. The proposed methodology builds
off previous research and model development related to relationships among
surface energy balance, vegetation cover, and surface temperature using data
from FIFE. This work will continue to focus on analysis and modeling of these
relationships in semi-arid regions. The research will refine a modeling strategy
that is based on principles of land surface energy balance and which includes
treatment of soil-vegetation micrometeorology, but which at the same time is
simple enough to be implemented operationally using satellite data in
association with minimal in-situ ground measurements. Specific tasks to be
performed as part of this research are (1) the integration and validation of a
soil heat and temperature model with a two-layer land surface energy balance
model; and (2) development and testing of inversion modeling strategies to
estimate land surface properties and energy balance components from satellite
data. The proposed research has the potential to provide a simple, operational,
yet accurate method to initialize, updata and validate land surface
parameterizations within hydrologic and atmospheric circulation models. As such
it is highly relevant to ongoing global change research programs including the
GEWEX continental Scale International Project (GCIP) and the Earth Observing
Systems (EOS).
