9317612 Wu Measurements of Photoabsorption Cross Sections of Solar System and
Cosmic Gases Under In-Situ Conditions. Dr. Wu and his collaborators have
successfully performed laboratory measurements of high resolution, low- and
room-temperatuare photoabsorption cross sections of several molecules present in
Solar System and cosmic gases. They will contine this research by applying it to
the measurement of the cross sections of the 4PG system, Cameron bands, the
underlying forbidden transitions and the pseudo-continuum of CO and to the cross
sections of ammonia and several important hydrocarbons including Allene, Methyl
Acetylene, Methyl Ethylene, Cyclopropane, Diacetylene, and Triacetylene, from
their respective absorption thresholds to 1060 Angstroms. The pressure effects
of perturbers such as molecular hydrogen and nitrogen on the aborbers of
interest will be studied under conditions similar to those found in realistic
planetary atmospheres.
