The proposed research involves research in Theoretical Physics but primarily in
String Theory. We plan to explore the dynamics of the gauge/string dualities. We
are planning to investigate a new formulation of spinning strings, which uses a
W-algebra. We are also going to investigate whether the cosmological constant
can be understood by dynamical screening due to infrared effects. We are
planning to work on relations between string theory and gauge theory. We will
study the interaction of strings via the light cone string field theory. We are
interested in constructing a string bit theory, which interpolates between gauge
theory and string theory. We will study warped compactifications of string
theory with internal fluxes in order to understand field theories with
Supersymmetry breaking. We will study non-commutativity in string theory and its
connection with non-commutative geometry. Special interest will be paid to how
these theories will affect the cosmic microwave background. We will also study
the quantum physics of black holes. We will focus our attention on three
dimensional gauge theories especially with an interest of understanding strong-
weak coupling dualities. We also will study large-N membrane theories.
