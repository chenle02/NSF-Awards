This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program (IGERT)
renewal award establishes a training program focused on the science and
engineering of stem cells. New cross-cutting thrusts for Ph.D. research,
together with a new multidisciplinary graduate curriculum, will integrate stem
cell biology with research in biomaterials, process engineering, and
computational modeling. Trainees will participate in an IGERT Research
Interchange Forum to develop their abilities to communicate across disparate
disciplines. Professional development activities encompassing teaching,
mentoring, and outreach will enable IGERT trainees to better realize the impact
of their technological know-how. Each IGERT trainee will be guided by an
advisory constellation of scholars drawn from over 30 faculty members from
Engineering, Molecular Biosciences, Physical Sciences, Business, Public Policy,
and Management. The IGERT program will leverage Rutgers' active "diversity
infrastructure" to help broaden the participation of underrepresented minority
students. In addition to providing research opportunities for visiting
underrepresented undergraduates, the IGERT will offer two new initiatives: a
teacher-student summer institute at Rutgers, and, a bridge-to-IGERT program. New
outreach programs at the intersection of stem cell science and engineering with
public policy and business include: (1) an initiative with the School of
Management and Labor Relations to "bundle" IGERT research and curriculum into
portable modules for scientific workforce training; (2) Rutgers Business School-
mediated interactions with pharmaceutical management students and industry; (3)
public policy workshops with policy makers, facilitated by the Eagleton
Institute of Politics. IGERT trainees will acquire global perspectives through
internships and workshops with leading stem cell researchers at over 15 sites in
Europe and Asia. IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of
educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary
background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical,
professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.
The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by
establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a
fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional
disciplinary boundaries.
