Although the theoretical benefits of kin recognition are clear, experimental
and observational studies are necessary to determine the functional significance
of kin recognition. By examining mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, the extent to
which individuals in wild populations are genetically related can be determined.
Using this technique, several studies will be undertaken to determine how
animals make use of their kin recognition abilities. Experimental studies of the
function of kin recognition thus will be conducted during both phases of
amphibian life cycle. The social structure of natural schools will be examined
by means of DNA analyses to determine whether siblings sort out and associate
with each other. Laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine whether
those sibling groups that survive and grow best in mixed groups also show the
strongest tendencies to school with siblings. By integrating considerations of
the mechanisms underlying kin recognition with the functional consequences of
kin discrimination, these studies should lead to a greater understanding of how
natural selection acts on behavioral mechanisms. The research has broader
possible implications, however, because in accomplishing these goals, DNA
analyses will be used for the first time to study the social behavior of
individuals in natural populations. These methods promise to offer more power
for resolving genetic relationships than previous techniques, and in the future
may be applied to a variety of ecological problems, including the management of
endangered species, studies of migration and dispersal, and determination of
optimal sizes of breeding habitats. Only by conducting thorough analyses of
population structure, can the appropriateness of the use of molecular markers
for population ecology studies be evaluated.
