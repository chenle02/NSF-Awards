The ability to visually recognize complex objects is dependent upon structures
within the central nervous system which are responsible for perceiving the
objects and for processing the information received. One important type of
visual recognition which is critical for any species is the ability of
individuals of that species to distinguish members of different species from
those of their own species, or conspecifics; this type of discrimination is
important to recognize potential predators as well as potential mates. In this
award to Dr. Toru Shimizu, visual recognition will be studied in two avian
species. Anatomical connections between various parts of the higher visual areas
of the central nervous system will be studied using tracer techniques.
Discrimination based on differentiating between members of the same or different
species, and between the two genders will be studied with the use of video
images. The importance of different regions of the higher visual areas of the
brain will be determined by studying the effects of selective ablation on
performance in the discrimination paradigm. This research contributes knowledge
about how the brain recognizes complex visual objects and how this visual
information is processed to obtain meaningful responses.
