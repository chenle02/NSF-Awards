Award Abstract Fellow: Manuel B. Sainz Proposal number: DBI 9707853 This action
funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for 1997. This fellowship
supports research and training in the area of integrative plant biology and
genetic mechanisms. The title of the research and training plan is
"Identification and characterization of genes required for plant disease
resistance." The signal transduction pathway for plant disease resistance links
pathogen recognition to increased expression of defense genes. The goal of this
research is to isolate components linking the events of disease resistance in
Arabidopsis thaliana resistant to Pseudomonas syringae mediated by the pathogen
avrRpt2. The disease resistance response is being characterized in isolated
mutants and the novel genes involved are being cloned.
