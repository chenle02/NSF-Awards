Castelaz 9500756 This award is made under the auspices of the NSF Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) program. As a CAREER awardee the investigator is
expected to pursue an active education plan in addition to his scientific
research project. This research project will establish a program of frequent
spectroscopic and photometric observations of long-period, Mira-type variables.
The observations will provide substantial data needed to understand the
relationship between their spectra and light curves. It will search for Mira
variables with companions, important for estimating the absolute magnitudes of
the variable stars. The education component covered by this award includes
incorporation of more research methodology into the undergraduate introductory
astronomy class, development of an observational astronomy laboratory-type class
and a physics senior major project related to the research project on Mira
variables.
