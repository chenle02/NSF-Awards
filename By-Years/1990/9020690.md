The goal of this project is to design effective algebraic and numerical
algorithms for matrix and polynomial computations. The specific problem domains
to be investigated include the following: practical acceleration of matrix
multiplication; computations with sparse matrices; computations with dense
structured matrices, such as Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, and Hilbert
matrices; compact multigrid schemes; polynomial computations and their relation
with structured matrix computations.
