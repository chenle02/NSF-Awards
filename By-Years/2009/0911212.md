Given the wide range of reactions that ruthenium complexes can catalyze, this
proposal focuses on the development of "one-pot" multi-step processes effected
by known and new ruthenium complexes. The overall outcome of the proposed
research will be more efficient tandem protocols for converting simple olefin
containing starting materials into much more complex and valuable targets.
Specifically, the powerful olefin metathesis reaction will be coupled with other
complexity-building transformations, such as cyclopropanations, metal mediated
couplings, oxidations, cycloadditions, isomerizations and radical atom transfer
reactions to yield highly unique and valuable, ruthenium-catalyzed, tandem
transformations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and
Macromolecular Chemistry Program at the NSF is supporting the research of
Professor Snapper of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College. Professor
Marc Snapper's research involves the development of more efficient and effective
bond-forming strategies. The ability to effect multiple complex functional group
and bond changes in a single operation can represent a considerable improvement
in efficiency for accessing useful organic compounds. Moreover, minimizing the
time, labor, solvents, reagents, energy, waste streams, and material losses by
eliminating the isolation of intermediates will significantly reduce the cost
and environmental impact of preparing desired targets. In general, this research
will lead to new, more powerful reactions and molecule building strategies that
will lower the cost and environmental impact of preparing current and future
molecules of importance. &lt;br/&gt;
