A major challenge in exploring the coupling between the mesosphere and
thermosphere is to obtain appropriate data. Part of the reason so little is
known about this altitude region is the difficulty in making adequate
measurements. For example, the ability to use incoherent scatter radar to
examine the high-latitude thermosphere and mesosphere and to investigate the
coupling between these regions requires sophisticated radar techniques. These
techniques include Barker coded pulses, multiple pulses, coded long pulses,
high- resolution intermediate pulse lengths, and pulse-to-pulse sampling.
Because of system hardware limitations, only primative versions of these
techniques have been implemented at the Sondrestrom Radar Facility. This
situation is changing: the entire receiver and data-taking systems are currently
being upgraded. The upgraded system will create the opportunity for a large
number of long-awaited new observations in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere
region at very high latitudes. This award will provide for the necessary
software development and data analysis to permit these observations and use them
to attack the mesosphere/lower thermosphere coupling problem.
