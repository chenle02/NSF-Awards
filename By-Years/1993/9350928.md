The undergraduate curriculum in bioprocess technology (sequential courses in
Recombinant DNA Biochemistry, Fermentation Biology, Protein Purification and
Downstream Processing, and Scale-Up of Fermentation and Downstream Processing
followed by a senior research project) is integrated about a single model system
(E. coli >-galactosidase production). The iterative interdisciplinary nature of
recombinant product development is emphasized.
