This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of liquid chromatography. Professor Guiochon is an experienced
investigator who is highly regarded for his contributions in this area. Liquid
chromatography is a highly sensitive analytical technique that is frequently
used to separate and quantify complex mixtures. Professor Guiochon and his co-
workers will investigate ways to dramatically improve the separation of
concentrated solutions of various materials, including species of biochemical
and biotechnological importance. These fundamental studies will result in a
contribution to basic science and will also suggest strategies for large scale
separations of materials that are important to chemical and health science
related industries.
