Why taxpayers do or do not comply with tax laws is emerging as a focal point of
scholarly research. The patterns of noncompliance are influenced by incentives
and opportunities. To a considerable extent the anatomy of noncompliance can be
uncovered by empirical inquiry into line-by-line statements on tax returns which
are influenced by enforcement efforts and the quality of opportunities to
conceal income or exaggerate deductions. Paid third parties prepare nearly half
of all tax returns and these returns account for about 75 percent of the tax
deficiencies identified in all returns submitted to the Internal Revenue
Service. Concentrating on the factors that affect compliance behavior for those
individuals who voluntarily file a tax return and who also account for the large
majority of estimated noncompliance and utilizing information from a variety of
sources importantly including Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program audit
data; Drs. Nagin and Klepper develop, formalize, and test the limits of the
perspective that incentives and opportunity play an important role in compliance
behavior, and they examine the role of tax practitioners as an information
conduit by which threats of audit and fine are channeled into changes in
reported income and deductions. Since, for the sake of simplicity, modelling in
the area of tax compliance has generally been based on an idealized tax code, an
important scientific contribution that the research of Drs. Nagin and Klepper
makes is in linking the wide variation in opportunities available for
noncompliance to the detailed structure of the actual tax code.
