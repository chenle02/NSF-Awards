Cosmologists have determined that 95% of the mass and energy in the Universe is
"dark," meaning that it neither absorbs nor emits its own light. But the gravity
of "dark matter" does bend light, so it is possible to map the dark matter by
careful study of the distortions of sky images. Led by the Dark Energy Survey
(DES), three large-scale experiments are now measuring distortions using the
images of over 100 million galaxies to measure the dark-matter structure of the
nearby universe, to see if its growth over time matches the predictions of
current theories of gravity, dark matter, and dark energy. To help complete the
DES analysis, these researchers will develop new methods for measuring both the
distortion of the galaxies and their distances from Earth. The grant also will
fund participation of first-generation/low-income undergraduates and the sharing
of dark-universe results with the Philadelphia community by travelling exhibits
and presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the current methods for testing
cosmology with imaging surveys like DES and the Rubin Observatoryâ€™s Legacy
Survey of Space and Time (LSST) are based on ad hoc assumptions and statistics
that require complex testing for accuracy and may lose valuable information.
This research will replace many of these with methods based on principled
statistical representations of the data, rendering the results more
understandable, precise, and closer to optimal in extracting information. The PI
will also transfer techniques developed for DES calibration to LSST, which will
benefit a broad swath of astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
