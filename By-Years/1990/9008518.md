Inflatable dams are essentially cylindrical membrane structures which are
attached to a rigid horizontal base along two of their generators. They may be
inflated by water, air, or a combination of water and air. Two-dimensional
vibrations of long cylindrical membranes were investigated under the previous
grant. This continuation will examine motions which vary along the dam. In
addition, conditions of overflow will be analyzed, which are applicable when the
dam is used to control water flow. Conditions which may lead to instability will
be investigated theoretically and experimentally. The results of this study will
improve our understanding of the dynamic behavior of inflatable dams, and will
be useful in the prevention of future failures and in the wider application of
this economical type of structure.//
