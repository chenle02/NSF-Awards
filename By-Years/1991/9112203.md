This is a grant for partial support of a 1991 Gordon Research Conference on
Reverse Osmosis, Ultra-filtration, and Gas Separation. The Conference will be
held at Plymouth State College, New Hampshire from July 28 to August 2, 1991.
The most recent research progress in synthetic membrane science and technology
will be discussed. There will be lectures and poster sessions by leading
researchers and graduate students. The grant covers about 26% of the total
conference costs and covers partial support for eight graduate students to
describe their current research. Membranes are key components of several current
and future industrial separation methods for gaseous and liquid components.
