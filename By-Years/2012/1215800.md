Small amounts of melting in the silicate part of the Earth's deep interior exert
a disproportionate influence on the physical and chemical properties of rocks.
Melt is often distributed in tubes, disks, or pockets, whose dimensions are as
small as the fraction of the width of a human hair. Relative abundance of these
different shapes of melt units depend on both the dynamic environment of melting
and chemical composition of the melts. The signature of melt geometry, an
averaged description of melt distribution in these various units, is sampled by
earthquake waves passing through these regions. Deciphering the signals of these
earthquake waves, one can find out about the processes associated with melting
in the deep Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we continue to develop
a new theoretical toolbox, `microgeodynamics', to address the issues of
detection of partial melting in the Earth?s interior and dynamics of melt
storage and segregation. We will study the influence of melt volume fraction,
wetting behavior, and deformation on the physical properties such as elastic
moduli and melt mobility using a SemiAnalytical Model (SAM) and a Boundary
Elements Model (BEM). The output of these models, dynamic melt geometry, will be
processed to explain observed anomalies in various physical properties in the
Earth's deep interior.
