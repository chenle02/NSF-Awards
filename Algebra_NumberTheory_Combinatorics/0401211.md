Richard Stanley is one of the major figures in combinatorics. His work has been
of fundamental importance in many areas of combinatorics (especially in the
areas of enumeration, lattices and partially ordered sets, matroids, and
hyperplane arrangements) and in connections between combinatorics and other
fields such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory of
symmetric and classical groups and Lie algebras, and topology. In addition, his
two-volume textbook "Enumerative Combinatorics," and his advising of numerous
students, have been enormously influential in the development of the field.

This conference will put into perspective some of the important advances that
have come from Stanley's work, and bring together researchers in the different
areas of combinatorics in which he has worked. The conference will enable
researchers in these fields to learn from each other, and will promote further
development of the connections between different areas of combinatorics and
between combinatorics and other areas of mathematics. Support from the NSF will
be used to fund travel expenses of participants, especially those who would not
otherwise be able to attend. Funding of travel expenses for researchers in early
stages of the their careers will be a priority.
