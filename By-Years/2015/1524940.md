Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) operate nearly all of society's critical
infrastructures (e.g., energy, transportation and medicine). In performing
mission critical functions, CPSs exhibit hybrid (both discrete and continuous)
behavior as they use digital technology to control and monitor physical
processes. CPS security analysis is particularly challenging because an attacker
can make use of a wide variety of vulnerabilities in the digital elements of the
system (e.g., the network), the physical elements of the system, or some
combination. This project is developing a mathematical and computational
framework for modeling and analyzing large, complex CPSs to capture their
vulnerabilities and the resulting attack paths (steps an attacker might use to
disrupt the system).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing hybrid
attack graphs (HAGs) as a mathematical formalism for representing security
properties and compound exposures in CPSs. HAGs reflect a functional view of
exposures, capturing state transitions over CPSs due to the execution of
exploits in either the cyber or physical domains. As such, they offer the
potential to comprehensively document a CPS attack surface. The researchers are
designing HAG generation algorithms that apply intelligent search and
parallelization strategies and creating a suite of web-based tools to cope with
the computational burdens of large-scale CPS attack surface modeling. The
project is developing an array of analytical methods, refined based on Markov
Processes, classic reachability, and other techniques. To provide an
experimentation platform for evaluating the project's tools and techniques, the
researchers are building a CPS test bed comprised of network-controlled robotic
vehicles. The testbed will also provide a competitive learning environment in
which to teach students about CPS security principles in a fun and engaging
manner.
