The goal of this five-year qualitative R&amp;D project is to accelerate the
progress of early career and pre-service science teachers from novice to expert-
like pedagogical reasoning and practice by developing and studying a three-tool,
web-based system. The tool system consists of (a) learning progressions for
teachers specifying how they can support students' content-rich, inquiry
learning activities; (b) classroom discourse to scaffold complex classroom
inquiry conversations; and (c) systematic analysis of students' work. The tools
are aimed at developing teachers' capabilities in (a) shaping instruction around
the most fundamental science ideas; (b) scaffolding student thinking in deep
understanding of content and evidence-based causal explanations, testing, and
revision and application of scientific models; and (c) adapting instruction to
diverse student populations by collecting and analyzing student data on their
thinking levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research questions include the following:
(1) Does the use of this tool system influence the development of pedagogical
expertise in early career teachers? If so, under what conditions?; (2) How do
novice teachers use pedagogical tools in coordination with one another to
maximize the effectiveness of their instruction?; (3) How can this tool system
support early career teachers' ability to recognize the learning needs of
underachieving students, and adapt instruction to accommodate for the support of
their learning?; and (4) Does the use of the tool system influence the ability
of students to engage in evidence-based explanations over time?
