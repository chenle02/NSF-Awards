Professor Shaowei Chen is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
CAREER program to study electron transfer through ordered films of monolayer
protected nanoclusters. Exchange reactions will be used to insert alkanethiols
into the organic protective layers supported on gold particles. Electrochemical
studies of the electron transfer kinetics will be carried out, as well as
spectroscopic studies. The discrete electron-charging properties of monolayer
protected nanoclusters will be studied, providing insight that might lead to
applications as building blocks for single-electron transistors in
nanocircuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of this award
involves integrating nanoscale research into the undergraduate curriculum and
undergraduate research programs.
