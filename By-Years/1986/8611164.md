Czochralski crystal growth technique is used in the growth of large, single
crystals of pure silicon for semiconductor applications. As the size of the
crystal grown increases (> 5 in) the turbulence aspects assume importance.
Industry has problems growing large single crystals of pure silicon partially
because of this. The PI is a very competent researcher in the area of fluid
mechanics in general and turbulence in particular. AT and T Laboratories has a
fully instrumented czochralski crystal growth apparatus and has expressed strong
interest to interact with the PI. The project with this combination is truly
interdisciplinary. It has the potential to address more of the problems
associated with the growth of large crytals of pure materials of interest to
industry. A grant for three years is recommended.
