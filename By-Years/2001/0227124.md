The El Paso Math and Science Partnership (El Paso MSP) includes the three urban
school districts that encompass El Paso, nine rural school districts in El Paso
and Hudspeth counties, the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), El Paso
Community College, the Region 19 Education Service Center, and El Paso area
civic, business and community organizations and leaders.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The El Paso MSP is aimed at improving student achievement
in mathematics and science among all students, at all preK-12 levels, and at
reducing the achievement gap among groups of students. The goals of the
partnership include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fully engaging university and
community college leadership and mathematics, science, engineering and education
faculty in working toward significantly improved K-12 math/science student
achievement;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ensuring the number, quality and diversity of
K-12 teachers of mathematics and science across partner schools, particularly
schools with the greatest needs;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;building the capacity of
area districts and schools to provide the highest quality curriculum,
instruction and assessment, and to ensure the highest level achievement in
mathematics and science for every student;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ensuring the
K-16 alignment of mathematics and science curriculum, instruction and
assessment, to ensure that students graduating from area high schools are
prepared to enroll and be successful in mathematics, science and engineering
courses at UTEP and El Paso Community College;
and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;prioritizing research on educational reform and preK-16
partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;
