This Presidential Young Investigator will continue his research into
Associative Memory Networks (AMNs). A wide variety of AMN designs have been
proposed, based on different fundamental algorithms. This project will begin
with variants of Binary AMNs, and investigate their performance in terms of
learning rate, flexibility, and storage capacity. Formal mathematical analysis,
using probabilistic concepts, will be stressed. Computer simulations will be
used extensively to verify the theory and guide the analysis. Selected AMN
designs will then be tested on applications in communications and computer
vision, by simulating the designs in computer software. If successful, the
designs will then be implemented in special-purpose integrated circuits.
