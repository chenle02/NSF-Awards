A new state-of-the-art, electrical discharge machine (EDM) will be purchased to
test recently published theoretical results via computer simulation for matching
advanced materials such as ceramics. A recent scientific breakthrough with our
plasma spark model explains for the first time how EDM machines actually erode
the cathode and anode surfaces - release of the high plasma pressure causes the
superheated cathode and anode melt cavities to explode into the cold, liquid
dielectric. The requested desk-top EDM is the first designed specifically for
research experiments. Its small dielectric bath (4 liters) allows testing of
numerous new liquids - water or a hydrocarbon oil is normally used but the spark
model predicts that higher density dielectrics will provide faster machining.
The gap sensor and generator respond in 10 nanoseconds (10- 8 seconds) to input
and process conditions, allowing precise tests of the effects of electrical
pulses of various shapes - e.g., rectangular, triangular, sinusoidal.
