Toxic Alexandrium spp. dinoflagellates cause paralytic shellfish poison (PSP)
outbreaks in the Gulf of Maine each year, posing a public health threat and
resulting in economic loss. The population dynamics of Alexandrium spp. are at
present poorly understood; in order to understand and model these dynamics basic
information on the mechanisms that allow blooms to form must be obtained. This
study will determine the role of grazing by the dominant zooplankton (copepods)
in the population dynamics of toxic Alexandrium spp. The study will conduct
laboratory experiments to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for specific
grazing behavior of dominant zooplankton species. Coordinated in situ field
studies focusing on the spring period of bloom initiation will also be
conducted, at sites where high PSP levels occur early and regularly.
