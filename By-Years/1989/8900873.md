The properties of surface molecules of bulk crystals, fractional monolayers,
monolayers and bilayers of molecules deposited on heterogeneous substrates such
as graphite, and small two- and three-dimensional molecular clusters will be
calculated using multi-dimensional optimization techniques, Monte-Carlo, lattice
dynamics, Green's function, and mean field approximations. These techniques will
be applied to a variety of molecular systems. Among the properties to be
calculated are the surface structures and orientations, magnetic order, surface
specific heats, r.m.s. translational and orientational fluctuations of surface
and adlayer molecules about equilibrium, surface phonon, libron, magnon and
vibron modes, entropies, structural, orientational, magnetic, and melting phase
transitions, wetting and non-wetting phenomena, and surface binding and
adsorption energies. The relationship between these properties and their bulk
analogues will be elucidated.
