This project will test new methods for estimating the effects of natural land
covers, terrain, rivers, highways, natural corridors, and human land uses on the
movement of animals across a landscape. The project will examine the
correlations between landscape features and genetic patterns, which reflect the
movements needed for animals to recolonize areas where they have become extinct,
shift their ranges in response to climate change, maintain genetic diversity,
and prevent isolation of populations. The study will use new statistical
procedures, circuit theory models, and an extensive set of genetic data from 550
grizzly bears detected at 2,000 locations in a 12,000-square-mile landscape in
Montana to develop measures of landscape resistance to gene flow. The project
also will use this information to design sampling schemes that will enable
future studies of landscape genetics to gather the best information at the
lowest cost. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The results of this study have potential
societal benefits through helping land and wildlife managers design better land
management schemes, reduce the cost of designing land management that
contributes to wildlife conservation, and understand the impact of uncertainty
on these designs. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the
research and receive cross-disciplinary and quantitative training, new
analytical tools will be made available, and information will be widely
disseminated to the general public. &lt;br/&gt;
