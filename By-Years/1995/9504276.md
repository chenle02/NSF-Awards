9504276 Ravizza Ravizza plans to collect hydrothermal water and chimney samples
for analysis for the platinum group elements, rhenium and osmium isotopes. We
have little understanding of the global cycling of these elements and there
appears to be more of these metals being inputted by rivers than is being
deposited into sediments. The osmium isotope ratio in sea water has changed
dramatically in the past 60 million years which some scientists have attributed
to an increase in continental weathering. Understanding the sources and sinks of
Os will be important for evaluating this process, and hydrothermal vents and
deposits may be a major sink for Os. ***
