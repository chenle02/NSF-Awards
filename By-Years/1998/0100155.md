ABSTRACT CMS0100155 "Hurricane Andrew 10 Years Later: Implications for Disaster
Mitigation"

Due to the extensive losses, Hurricane Andrew is widely recognized as a
watershed event, placing disaster resistance and mitigation visibly on the
political agenda. The ultimate goal of this project is to inform national
mitigation efforts through an assessment of the extent to which vulnerabilities
evident prior to or emerging after this major disaster remain nearly 10 years
later.

This project focuses on several dimensions of community and household status as
they relate to disaster vulnerability and resilience. At the community level,
this project will: 1) Document changes in demographics, economic and business
base, and political structure looking at those areas directly impacted and the
rest of Miami-Dade County; 2) Determine the extent to which the policies and
practices instituted during reconstruction resulted in increased disaster
resilience of the community; 3) Analyze whether there have been any lasting
improvements in the political power of previously marginalized groups; 4)
Compare the recovery levels of various sections within the impacted region and
explore possible explanations for any found differences. On the household level,
the focus will be twofold: 1) to assess the vulnerability-related status of the
"Families of Andrew"; and 2) to assess the current disaster resistance of
households county-wide. A primary focus will be decisions regarding housing,
shutters, insurance, and risk planning and preparation in general.

The findings from this milestone project will make a major contribution to the
field and to a safer nation. A clearer understanding of community and household
issues associated with long-term recovery from a major disaster in a diverse
metropolitan area will result in more effective models of disaster mitigation
and response.
