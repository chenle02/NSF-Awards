This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program supports
research in materials science to be conducted by Dr. Diana Farkas of Virginia
Polytechnic Institute in collaboration with Dr. E.J. Savino and Dr. R. Pasianot
of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) of Argentina. The goal of the
project is to carry out computer simulation of defect structure in intermetallic
alloys. The project continues an active collaboration in the area of theoretical
models for radiation - enhanced diffusion. The project focuses on the
development of empirical potentials of many body type suitable for computer
simulation of extended defects in ordered alloys. These interatomic potentials
will be applied to the simulation of point defects in pure metals and alloys and
extended defects (grain boundaries and dislocations) in pure metals and in
alloys and the interaction of these two types of defects. ***//
