The proposed research builds on an ongoing collaborative effort between Case
Western Reserve (experiment) and Iowa State University (theory). Their
collaboration has recently established that an anisotropic superconductor
experiences an intrinsic torque when placed in a magnetic field. This new
phenomenon arises from a transverse vortex lattice magnetization and is a direct
result of superconducting anisotropy. The immediate technical objectives of the
work are: 1) To refine and extend the existing phenomenological theory so as to
deepen their understanding of both its range of validity and its applicability
to the actual torque experiments. 2) To refine their torque experiments and then
extend them across the whole family of high- Tc materials, so as to obtain
detailed and systematic information on the variation of superconducting
anisotropy. The overall goal of their effort is to provide some useful guidance
for the development of microscopic high-Tc theory, in the form of reliable
superconducting anisotropy values across the whole family of materials.
