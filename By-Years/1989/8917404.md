Many planktonic animals use setulose appendages to capture food or molecules,
and to swim or propel water. Continued investigations into the physical
mechanisms by which such appendages move water and separate particles from it
will provide understanding of ecological and evolutionary meaning of shape and
mechanical function of the appendages. The food- capturing second maxillae
(M2's) of calanoid copepods are of primary importance because of the ecological
importance of copepod feeding, and because of the diversity of morphologies and
behaviors of M2's operatiang at a range of velocities where transitions in
function are expected to occur. Dynamically- scaled physical models, based on
data gathered from SEM and high-speed microcinematography of a variety of
copepods, will be used: 1) to test predictions of mathematical models of the
hydrodynamics of these appendages, and 2) to investigate the performance
consequences of morphological features and behaviors too complicated to address
mathematically. The investigation will show how defined aspects of body shape,
appendage morphology, flapping kinematics, and motions of neighboring appendages
affect the leakiness, capture range, particle-selectivity, drag, and power
requirements of second maxillae.
