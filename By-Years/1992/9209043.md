The object of this study is to reevaluate the dating of the Manson Impact
Structure, which has been suggested to be one of the sites where a large
asteroid or comet struck the earth some 65 million years ago, causing one of the
larger mass extinctions experienced on this planet. It is important to determine
with the best possible resolution if the Manson structure is the same age as
other impact sites nominated to be responsible for events at the
Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary, and if Manson and the other impact sites are
the same age as the paleontologically defined boundary seen in the rock record.
Up to this point, the only date on the Manson structure has come from innovative
application of the 40Ar/39Ar dating method to samples of partially reset
feldspars which were taken from the basement rock shocked and heated by the
impact itself. New dating of melt glasses recovered by the current drilling
program at the Manson site may provide an additional age estimate, but further
analysis of shocked feldspars offers at least as promising a means of improving
the precision and accuracy of the age of the Manson of feldspar analysis and
interpretation, it should be possible to bring the precision and accuracy of the
age of the Manson structure. Currently, this age estimate is 65.7+1 Ma. With the
application of current techniques of feldspar analysis and interpretation, it
should be possible to bring the precision to ~0.2 Ma or better; preliminary
"thermochronological" analysis of previously published data also suggests that
the most likely age may actually be at least 0.7 m.y. lower, putting the age of
the Manson impactor much closer to estimates of the K/T boundary and the
Caribbean impactor of some 64.7 Ma. Additional benefits from careful
thermochronological analysis of Manson-site feldspars will include an
understanding of how robust age estimates from these feldspars actually are, and
also, a constraint on the post- impact thermal history of the impact site.
