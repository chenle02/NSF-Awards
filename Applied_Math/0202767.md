Title: Topics in Mathematical Fluid Dynamics

This project uses a variety of techniques in nonlinear partial differential
equations to study several different open questions connected with the equations
that describe the motion of a fluid, namely the Euler and the Navier-Stokes
equations. Stability of a fluid flow is one of the most basic problems in fluid
dynamics: stable flows are robust under the inevitable disturbances in the
environment, while unstable flows may break up, sometimes rapidly. The
investigator will continue to explore the relations between different types of
instability with the goal of defining scales or degrees of instability.
Sufficient conditions are sought to demonstrate nonlinear instability for
classes of inviscid fluids. Another topic studied in the project is the equation
for a viscous fluid when there is a nonlinear relation between the stress and
strain tensors (a so-called non-Newtonian fluid ). A fundamental mathematical
question asked for any of the fluid equations is the possibility of the
development of singularities in finite time. Motivated by results from a dyadic
model for the non-Newtonian equations, the investigator and collaborators use
techniques of wavelets and Littlewood -Paley theory to give an upper bound on
the dimension of the singular set in the case of the Navier Stokes equations
with nonlinear viscosity.

The greater portion of our world is composed of fluids: e.g., the atmosphere,
the oceans, even our own bodies. However fluids behave in very complex ways that
are presently understood only to a very minor degree. This project uses rigorous
mathematics to examine several questions that are fundamantal to the nature of
fluid motion. These include the stability or instability of a fluid
configuration. In the view of many scientists, waves and instabilities lie at
the heart of long term weather prediction with all its practical implications
for global change and the world economy. Another topic under investigation
concerns fluids with a nonlinear viscous force relation. This happens, for
example, in models for turbulent eddies and also in fluids with a special
molecular structure such a blood or some polymers. The investigator seeks to
bound the development of singularities (e.g. infinite energy spikes) in the
motion of such fluids.
