9633681 McWilliams In this project, the PI will lead a small research team to
investigate broadly the processes that cause large-scale, low- frequency
transient variability in the oceanic general circulation. A hierarchy of
modeling tools will be employed, ranging from idealized models of the wind- and
buoyancy-driven circulations, to complete, global General Circulation Models,
both with specified surface forcing and in coupled configurations with
atmospheric models. Further, the interpretations thus developed from the model
solutions would be tested by comparison with historical data sets, and those
from WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) that contain the most information
about the transient general circulation. Extensive collaborations with other
universities and laboratories will be maintained and expanded.
