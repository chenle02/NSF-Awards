Funds support a paleomagnetic study of Holocene sediments from the northern
North Atlantic, which will involve synthesis of existing data and radiocarbon
dates. The study involves three objectives: (1) to use high sedimentation rate
cores from the Iceland-Greenland area to refine and extend an ongoing Holocene
geomagnetic reconstruction of the northern North Atlantic, (2) to use the
reconstructed Holocene geomagnetic record as an accurate geomagnetic input to
compare with paleomagnetic output from a series of well-dated cores, and (3) to
develop an environmental magnetic synthesis of the region to further constrain
sediment dynamics associated with glacial retreat and ocean circulation. Results
will enhance understanding of the geodynamo and the relative effects of solar vs
geomagnetic control on the cosmogenic ray load at the earth?s surface. The award
will support a post-doctoral researcher, and will involved graduate and
undergraduate students.
