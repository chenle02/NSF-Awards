9632905 Hackert University of Texas Austin This award from the Chemistry
Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program and the Academic Research
Infrastructure (ARI) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry &amp;
Biochemistry at the University of Texas Austin acquire a Mass Spectrometer. This
equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
(1) photo induced electron transfer in unusual environments (2) RNA structure
and the structural basis of RNA-protein interactions (3) molecular weight and
structural information of pi-beams, large synthetic molcules with noncovalent
higher order structures (4) mass measurements of expanded porphyrins and
synthetic carriers for antiviral agents with molecular weights of several
thousand Da. (5) hydrogen-bond-driven molecular recognition between small
molecules, and (6) nascent peptides. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used
to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of
a vast array of organic,bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition
of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic
acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray
ionization in combination with high resolution provides the latest techniques
available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist one of the most powerful
tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this
capability in mass spectrometry is essential for the prosecution of frontier
research in many fields of chemistry.
