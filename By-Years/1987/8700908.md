Work will be done on the solvability and estimates for the tangential Cauchy-
Riemann operators. The global problem is an extension of earlier work on square-
integrable existence and estimates for the boundary d- bar operator on weakly
pseudo-convex boundaries. Efforts to obtain optimal Holder and power integral
estimates, as well as the nonisotropic properties of the solutions will be done.
The method proposed is to construct the integral kernels for the operator by
fusing the boundary invariants and finite type conditions into the construction.
Local solvability under condition Y(q) will also be studied using kernel
methods. To obtain estimates for the local solution, work is planned on the
analysis of singular integrals with singularities supported on a large set.
Applications to problems of prescribing zeros of functions in the Nevanlinna
class will be pursued. The generalized Blaschke condition must be satisfied on
strongly pseudoconvex domains. The solution to this follows lines similar to the
planned research on weakly pseudo-convex domains. Some related condition may
provide the desired classification.
