The conference "Representations, Geometry, and Quantization" will take place May
28 - June 1, 2018, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since the
introduction of quantum mechanics a hundred years ago, a fundamental problem has
been to understand the relationship between classical physics, which is
extraordinarily accurate and complete as a description of the world at large
scales and low energies, and quantum physics, which offers an apparently
different description of the world, including small scales and high energies.
This relationship has many parallels in mathematics, and understanding those
parallels is a source of inspiration in both mathematics and physics. The
conference will bring together world leaders in this subject to present their
research.

Some particular recent developments to be discussed include: an algorithm to
identify unitary representations of real reductive Lie groups; improved
understanding of character theory for tilting modules; geometric quantization
for noncompact manifolds; and mirror symmetry for Grassmannians. The conference
