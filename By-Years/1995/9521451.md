*** Woodworth 9521451 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
will develop a Digital Closed-Loop Servo-valve actuator that uses a hydraulic
motor and pump assembly, a digital valve, a manifold, and a hydraulic sub plate.
During the Phase II project, a control algorithm will be developed to precisely
control the position, velocity and acceleration of "loads". Phase I demonstrated
that a high performance, all digital approach to fluid control was possible by
developing an innovative new Digital Open-Loop Servo-valve using a high speed
digital fluid switch. Initial prototype units consisting of a valve element
coupled to an electronic valve driver and control element were constructed and
tested for fast switching speeds with large quantities of fluid. Testing was
conducted to determine the valves' directional control, fluid leakage, energy
consumption, switching times, noise immunity, failure modes, pulse monitoring,
and reliability and response characteristics. Results demonstrated system use in
a wide variety of applications requiring stable, responsive, repeatable and/or
remote control of fluid power. The unique servo-valve developed during Phase II
will have wide application in such industries as construction, machine tooling,
aerospace, aircraft component systems, and any other areas where fluid power for
improved control and repeatability is a performance factor. ***
