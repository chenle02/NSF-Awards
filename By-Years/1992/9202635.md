This award is made by the Office of Special Projects in the Chemistry Division
under the Materials Synthesis and Processing Initiative. Molecule-sized
photovoltaic devices will be designed and synthesized using the principles of
natural photosynthesis. These devices will be incorporated into Langmuir-
Blodgett films and self-assembled monolayers on metal surfaces, and studied
using time-resolved optical techniques. Producing such organized assemblies will
overcome low current yields due to inefficient separation of electrical charge
and injection of charge across interfaces. A scanning photoelectrochemical
microscopy probe will be developed, capable of measuring the photoelectrical
response of small regions of the films, or even of individual molecules. %%%
Materials based on monolayer films hold substantial promise for the fabrication
of electronic devices in general and photovoltaics in particular.
