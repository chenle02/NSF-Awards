This research will develop a high pressure diffusion cloud chamber for
measurement of nucleation rates at modest supersaturation. The chamber will be
designed to operate at pressures up to 10,000 K Pa and temperatures up to 600 K
greatly expanding the range heretofore available. Thus nucleation kinetics will
be measurable for some substances near their critical points. The theory of
operation will be expanded to account for non-idealities, vapor depletion, and
latent heat release. Nucleation kinetics will be measured for ethanol and nonane
as functions of temperature and pressure. Nucleation is an important phenomena
in the environment and in engineering applications. The kinetics are extremely
sensitive to temperature, supersaturation, and material properties. The expected
data should help in the selection of improved theories for nucleation.
