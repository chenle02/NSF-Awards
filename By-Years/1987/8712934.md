Dartmouth College is being supported to establish a Research Experiences for
Undergraduates (REU) SITE. The purpose of this SITE is to provide meaningful
hands-on research opportunities in contemporary chemistry for outstanding
undergraduate students under supervision of experienced research chemists. The
program will support 9 students for the summer of 1987, of which almost half
will come from other institutions. The Research activities will include: o Laser
Assisted Chemical Reactions o Anticancer Alkaloid Synthesis o Acid Rain Studies
o Photofragment Interactions in Matrix Isolation
