&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AST-0306969&lt;br/&gt;Hamuy&lt;br/&gt;This work will
improve the calibration of distant supernova light curves, in order to provide
greater accuracy in distance determinations leading to deviations from the
Hubble relation. Such deviations have profound cosmological implications, but
remain uncertain because of possible reddening by dust, and evolutionary
effects. This project will involve large amounts of telescope time (roughly 300
nights per year) to observe supernovae at redshifts z &lt; 0.07. Observing such
nearby events will allow estimation of systematic effects, which may influence
measurements of more distant, cosmologically relevant, supernovae. The end
result will be important to firm up the evidence for dark energy in the
universe, and will help lay the groundwork for determining its equation of
state. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
