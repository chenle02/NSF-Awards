This project investigates new source coding techniques with specific
applications to high-quality digital image compression. Vector Quantization
based methods for low-complexity, near-optimal encoding will be studied and
developed for such applications as universal adaptive quantization, progressive
transmission, color image compression, and multi-level facsimile and graphics
compression. Special emphasis will be placed on image transmission algorithms
for packet network and multiprocessor environments. Parallel processing and
neural network techniques will be studied for time-efficient and cost effective
solutions to the high complexity problem of vector quantization.
