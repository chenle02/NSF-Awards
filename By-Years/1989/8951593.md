In order to be prepared for their future careers, today's chemistry student
needs experience with modern, computer controlled instrumentation. This project
uses a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) to upgrade and expand the
program in infrared spectroscopy at James Madison University and provides
students with experience using modern computer operated instrumentation. This
instrument substantially improves the Inorganic/Organic Laboratory, Organic
Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, and Polymer Chemistry and provides infrared
spectroscopic support for the undergraduate program. The hands- on experience
gained by students from using this instrument better prepare them for continued
study in graduate school and/or for careers in industry. The institution is
matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
