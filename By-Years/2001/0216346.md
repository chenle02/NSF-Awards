0216346&lt;br/&gt;Verosub&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers at UC-Davis have
recently developed a technique that uses partial hysteresis curves to determine
the distribution of magnetic properties within a material. The method probes the
microscopic mechanisms of magnetic behavior in greater detail than is possible
with major hysteresis loops or with conventional magnetometry. This Major
Research Instrumentation grant will provide funding for a combined Alternating
Field Gradient and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer with high magnetic field and
low temperature capabilities. The instrument will allow researchers to look at a
much wider variety of materials under a much broader range of conditions than
can be done presently. These enhanced experimental capabilities will lead to new
advances in paleomagnetism, rock and mineral magnetism and environmental
magnetism as well as new insights into condensed matter physics, particularly
synthetic magnetic materials and magnetic
nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
