This action funds Marissa Jablonski of the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee
to conduct a research project, entitled "Modeling industrial scale removal of
dyes from textile industry wastewater using readily available chemicals in
containers made of garbage," during the Summer of 2012 at Beijing Normal
University in Beijing. The host scientist is Dr. Chenghong Feng.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project lies in the size, breadth, and
sustainability of the study. Modeling kinetics of photo-Fenton oxidation in
10-liter mobile units and detailing optimal chemical concentrations allows the
process to be augmented ultimately to be implemented into larger scale dye
houses throughout the global dyeing industry. The proposed research uses
alternate chemicals in the form of animal blood and reactors made of recycled
plastic and scrap that lower the cost and make the process accessible to
communities at very low cost and in any locale. Once optimized, the process can
work to clean dye wastewater from textile industries everywhere. Many dye houses
throughout the developing world dispose untreated dye wastewater directly onto
lawns surrounding dye stations, leaving it to penetrate groundwater and
contaminate drinking water with toxic chemicals and dyes. Photo-Fenton oxidation
offers a sludge-free treatment process to benefit those who currently use no
treatment, cannot afford to use costly reverse osmosis systems, and are left to
deal with hazardous sludge from biodegradation.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
