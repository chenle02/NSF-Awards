This individual award supports a planning visit by Dr. Judith Z. Drexler to
visit Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, of the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation
(MSSRF), Madras, India. Dr. Drexler will carry out pilot restoration projects on
the hydrological management of an estuarine, backwater system and a lagoon
system as part of the Mangrove Conservation and Management Project. Indian
mangrove systems protect the coastal wetlands from the effects of severe weather
systems, contain a high degree of biological diversity, and serve as a resource
for food and shelter items for local communities. These mangrove systems have
been seriously degraded by agricultural and rural development, and the MSSRP
project is exploring ways in which they can be restored and maintained. The
initial results of the pilot projects will form the basis of a research project
Dr. Drexler will submit to the National Science Foundation's International
Research Fellowship Program.
