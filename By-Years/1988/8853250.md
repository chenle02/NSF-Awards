This award will provide funds for the introduction of a modern digital image
processing and display system into the undergraduate Remote Sensing Program at
Northern Arizona University. The new equipment will consist of a MicroVAX II
computer system interfaced with an IVAS processor and display device. A
comprehensive image processing software package for the rectification,
enhancement, classification, and merging of digital image data sets, including
future upgrades, will be provided by the U.S. Geological Survey. Improvement of
course instruction and "hands-on" laboratory experience with image processing
algorithms is the primary objective of the effort. The addition of this system
to the Remote Sensing Program will enable students from a variety of disciplines
to develop a practical working knowledge of digital image processing and
associative analytical procedures. This experience, in turn, will better prepare
the students for graduate studies and professional careers when a knowledgeable
perspective on digital image processing is required. The grantee institution is
matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.
