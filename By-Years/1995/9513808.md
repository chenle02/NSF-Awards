*** 9513808 Dean Magnaporthe grisea causes rice blast, a devastating disease of
rice. Dr. Dean is interested in a specialized developmental process required by
this fungus for successful infection of its host. Infection is initiated by the
formation of a specialized infection cell, the appressorium. The induction of
this uniquely organized cell is dependent on specific environmental cues. The
goal of Dr. Dean's research is to understand how the fungus recognizes these
cues, relays the information within the cell to initiate appressorium formation
as well as the biochemical machinery that is associated with appressorium
development and function. Results from these investigations will not only
provide fundamental information but will have practical relevance. Dissection of
the genetic and biochemical pathways central to infection related morphogenesis
will identify new targets for intervention and may lead to the development of
rational mechanism based control measures for M. grisea and potentially other
fungal pathogens. Previous research identified a number of interesting
developmental mutants and showed that a cAMP mediated signal transduction
pathway is essential for appressorium formation and pathogenicity. Transformants
lacking the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (cpkA), the
principle source of intracellular cAMP, are unable to form appressorium on rice
and are nonpathogenic. To further advance our knowledge of intracellular
communication and identify other key elements regulating the induction and
development of appressorium formation the following experimental objectives are
proposed: 1) Isolation and characterization of genes required for appressorium
formation, including DNA complementation of mutant loci and identification of
transcriptionally regulated genes, 2) Identification and characterization of
cellular signaling components mediating the induction of appressorium formation,
including G-proteins and other proteins specifically phosphorylated during
infection related morphogenesis. ***
