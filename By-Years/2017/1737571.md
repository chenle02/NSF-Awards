The proposal brings together a group of US atmospheric chemistry researchers
from universities, government laboratories, and private research institutes, to
promote discussion of information and ideas on topics of contemporary interest
in atmospheric science through the internationally respected Gordon Research
Conference. The theme of this year's conference is "Addressing the Complexity of
Our Atmosphere Through Integration Across Scales." The meeting will be held July
30 to August 3 in Newry, Maine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the
symposium derive from the exchange of ideas that help to focus the research
community on the most pressing questions, as well as provide an opportunity for
young scientists to meet, network, and exchange ideas with leaders in the
atmospheric chemistry and related sciences. Presentations will address the
state-of-the-science of indoor air chemistry, remote atmospheric chemistry,
connections across scales from molecular-level detail to global effects, model-
measurement integration, measurement challenges associated with short-lived
trace species, and fundamental chemistry in the gas-phase, in the condensed
phase, and at interfaces between phases throughout the atmosphere.
