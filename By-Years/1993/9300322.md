The profound significance regarding the disciplines of hydrology and
hydrogeology, as well as the associated need for well trained professionals, is
quite evident. This significance is accentuated in drought prone areas like the
semi-arid western portion of the United States. The Hydrology/Hydrogeology (H/H)
Program at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) is nationally recognized for
excellence, with 24 faculty members and over 70 graduate students. The UNR
summer program was extremely successful, especially since this was our first
effort. We are requesting funding to continue the UNR summer REU program in
hydrology and hydrogeology. We have attempted to build upon our past successes
while addressing the few noted shortcomings. Our faculty are quite excited about
the prospects of once again working with a group of exceptional undergraduate
students.
