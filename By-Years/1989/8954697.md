The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop a series of "experiment benches"
that are to be an unique feature of "labworks," a major new hall of physical
science and technology. The small bench-top laboratory exhibits will allow
visitors to create their own experiments and to become informally but directly
involved in the experimental process. The target audience is junior highschool
students, especially those who come as individuals and who are repeat visitors.
Selected students will be trained as interns and will be paid to act as mentors
for visitors. The project will include a published report, "a recipe book" for
dissemination, and a subsequent conference of exhibit developers from other
science museums.
