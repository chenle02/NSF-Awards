This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding
the physiological and biochemical effects of increased hydrostatic pressure in
seals and sea lions: how can they dive so deep?" The physiological limits to
diving in marine mammals focus on two restrictions: how long can the animal
breath-hold and how deep can it dive? Within these limits, animals hunt by
choosing a foraging strategy that balances the obligate costs with the potential
energetic gains of foraging. In order to incorporate a more complete picture of
the physiological and biochemical limitations to diving into optimal foraging
models for diving mammals, this research is examining red blood cell membrane
changes and non-glycolytic pathway responses to increased hydrostatic pressure.
