The goal of the present proposal is to improve three undergraduate laboratory
courses: Terrestrial Community Ecology, Microbial Ecology and Experimental
Biotechnology, offered by the Department of Biology at the University of Puerto
Rico, Humacao Campus. Central to the proposal is the acquisition of computers to
be used in analyzing data obtained from field studies in the Terrestrial
Community Ecology and Microbial Ecology labs, and from protein and nucleic acid
experimental manipulations in the Experimental Biotechnology course, and thus,
will provide students with a modern experimental approach to the study of three
very fundamental areas in Biology. The University of Puerto Rico is providing an
amount twice as much as the award.
