Positive novolak resists are by far the most important patterning systems of
today's semiconductor technology, yet their functional mechanism is not well
understood. This research deals with a mechanistic model of resist function,
which if validated and completed would provide a rational basis for the further
technical development of these important materials. It was recently shown that
novolak dissolution in aqueous alkali is controlled by the rate of diffusion of
the base into the solid polymer. It is now suggested that diffusion of the
electrolyte into novolak follows a path defined by hydrophilic centers i.e. the
OH-groups of the resin, and avoids the hydrophobic regions of the matrix.
Dissolution inhibitors function by interrupting these hydrophilic diffusion
channels. It is proposed to validate the concept of hydrophilic diffusion
pathways by designing resins with a varying concentration of phenols and in this
way vary the separation of hydrophilic sites and monitor the effect of site
dilution on dissolution rate.
