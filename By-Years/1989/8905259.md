Most organisms show circadian (circa=about; diem=day) rhythms in a multitude of
cellular functions and organismal behaviors. A circadian clock controls the
biological timing mechanism coupling the physiology and biochemistry of the
organism to changes in the daily environmental cycle, particularly light and
temperature. The coordinated action of circadian rhythms is dependent on
communication between cells and the interpretation of signals from the
environment (e.g. light). In contrast to the case in animal systems, little is
known in plants about the mechanism of the conversion of signals from the
environment and adjacent cells into cellular responses. This project will
continue studies on how light reception and the circadian clock are coupled to
responses. This research has implications for understanding of plant responses
to a variety of signals which are highly significant in plant growth and
development including stress, hormones, and gravity as well as light. These
studies involve two plant models. The tropical legume Samanea saman exhibits a
circadian rhythm of leaflet movement while the single- celled, flagellated alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits a circadian rhythm of phototaxis (movement in
response to light). Both rhythms are controlled by a light-responsive circadian
clock. The hypothesis that lipid metabolism is involved in mediating the effects
of light and the coordination of plant responses to the circadian clock will be
tested.
