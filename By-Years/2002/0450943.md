The University of North Texas continues operating a Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site has been in operation since 2002. The
theme of the REU Site is the Study of Materials, with an emphasis on electronic
materials and their characterization. Students participate in research projects
under the mentorship of faculty in the Departments of Physics, Materials
Science, Chemistry and Engineering. Ten undergraduate students are recruited
nationwide every year for a nine-week summer research experience. Recruitment of
members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering is an important
goal of the REU Site. Other student activities include presentation of progress
on individual research projects and visits to industrial laboratories in the
area.
