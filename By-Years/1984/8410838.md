This program of research focuses on two areas which will help the development of
high performance optical fiber communication systems. The first deals with
semiconductor lasers capable of stable, single wavelength operation and the
second is concerned with nonlinear coupling in waveguides. In the laser problem
area, a comparison of the various known schemes for mode stabilization will be
made along with the experimental study of new techniques. The expected
performance of various mode stabilized lasers will be examined and possible ways
to fully utilize their potential will be explored. Research will also be
conducted on coupled waveguides for pulse shaping and for power combining from
two or more lasers. Included in the study are the nonlinear refractive and
absorptive properties of multiple quantum well (MQW) structures and the spectral
behavior of MQW lasers; the former for possible use in guided-wave optics and
the latter for possible use as a tunable source.
