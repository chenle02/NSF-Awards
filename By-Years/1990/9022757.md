Recent large-scale accidents such as the Chernobyl nuclear plant radiation
release and the Valdez oil spill have underscored the importance of studying how
we do and should deal with the prospect of catastrophes in conditions of
scientific uncertainty. In that light, contingency planning and prevention
measures require investigation. This research project focuses on contingency
planning in organizations. It seeks to understand decision making processes of
organizations facing the prospect of technological catastrophes for which there
are no control measures. A guiding insight is that as organizations attempt to
rationalize uncertainties and plan for the unknown, they channel and define
societal values. The investigator will proceed by examining two cases,
contingency plans for major oil spills and evacuation plans for civilian nuclear
power plants, through intensive interviews and archival investigation. Building
upon previous work from several disciplines, the research should shed light on
how some values are promoted and some are suppressed in the decision making, how
expertise is constituted in the process, and consequences for society of
organizational planning. Yielding a fuller understanding of decision procedures
regarding extremely difficult problems, the research should be useful to policy
makers and experts who must plan for low probability, high consequence events in
conditions of great uncertainty. The book and articles to be produced by the
project should interest these audiences, as well as scholars in relevant fields.
The principal investigator is highly qualified; the institutional resources are
very good; the issues are important and timely; results will be appropriately
disseminated. The project is meritorious and recommended for award.
