ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To do a basin-wide test of the fixed hotspot model
requires accurate and precise radiometric ages that only now have become
possible through improvement in Ar40/Ar39 dating of altered submarine basalts.
By re-dating existing samples the investigators will generate a state-of-the-art
Ar40/Ar39 age database. This project will re-date 37 seamounts that fall within
the 30-100 MA age range in the Line Islands and the Louisville seamounts
incremental heating Ar40/Ar39 dating, and measure Hf-Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes and
major/trace element abundances to characterize these basalts in terms of mantle
source and stage of volcanic activity. These data will be used to assess the
fixed and moving hotspot models.&lt;br/&gt;
