9320831 Shiller The purpose of this project is to provide better measures of
major economic risk factors (components of economic or wealth fluctuations that
affect many people) to facilitate the creation of new insurance and hedging
markets for these risks. The biggest economic risks today are not represented in
any liquid financial markets. There are no market for claims on national incomes
or an any other large income aggregates. There is no large liquid market for
real estate. An important reason why there are not liquid markets for such risks
is that there are no agreed-upon objective measures of the shocks that represent
such risks. This research will focus on developing indices of incomes or rents
or prices of claims on them that are specifically designed to be the basis of
cash settlement of innovative risk- management contracts, such as futures
contracts. In addition, data will be collected and assembled on the behavioral
foundations of speculative market behavior: including continuing time-series
data collection on expectations and theories among U.S. and Japanese stock
market participants. ***
