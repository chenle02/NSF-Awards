The problem of the existence of a constant scalar curvature Kahler metric in a
given Kahler class is an important and difficult problem and has provided the
motivation for much current research in Kahler geometry. For the special case of
Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, existence was conjectured by Yau to
be equivalent to the stability of the manifold in the sense of geometric
invariant theory. The principal investigator proposes to study three parabolic
flows of Kahler potentials which arise naturally in this context. The first is
the J-flow, which is the gradient flow of a functional appearing in Chen's
formula for the Mabuchi energy. The study of the J-flow has led to significant
advances in understanding the lower boundedness and asymptotics of the Mabuchi
energy. The second is the Kahler-Ricci flow. Its behavior in the Fano case is
not yet well understood, and it is proposed that the method of multiplier ideal
sheaves may capture the necessary information about its singularities to be able
to provide a link with stability. The third is the Calabi flow. It is a fourth
order parabolic PDE about which little is known in general. The principal
investigator intends to study the problem of long time existence of this flow.

An important problem in geometry and physics is whether a given space has a
special notion of distance. Take, for example, the two dimensional sphere - the
surface of a ball. With our usual sense of distance, this space is curved in the
same way at every point. We say that the sphere admits a 'metric of constant
curvature'. Not all spaces admit such metrics, and it is an interesting and deep
problem to find conditions under which they do. A natural and beautiful approach
to this problem is the parabolic, or 'heat flow' method. The idea is simple. The
distribution of heat in an object (not subject to outside sources) will flow in
time, becoming more even and finally constant - no matter what the initial
distribution looked like. In a similar way, if we start with an arbitrary notion
of distance on a space, then we can apply a natural 'heat flow' and hope to
prove, under the right conditions, that we obtain convergence to a metric of
constant curvature, or some other special metric, as time evolves. If no such
metrics exist, then we expect the flow to go wrong - to develop singularities.
The PI intends to study the question of convergence and singularities of three
such parabolic flows corresponding to different types of special metrics.
