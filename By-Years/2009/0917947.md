University of Washington proposes to support technical services on R/V Thompson,
a 274? general purpose research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal
research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The proposal requests support for basic
services. They will provide two shipboard technicians on each cruise of R/V
Thompson to support seagoing research projects and to maintain, calibrate and
provide for qualified users items from their pool of shared-use research
instrumentation. As part of the basic services, they will maintain and operate
the multibeam sonar systems on R/V Thompson. For R/V Barnes, a technician is
available to sail if desired by the chief scientists, though (s)he will often
not sail due to space limitations; the technician will provide shared-use
instrumentation for use by the scientists, and provide remote support as needed
if a technician does not sail. The budget included with this proposal is for the
first year of a 3-year continuing grant.
