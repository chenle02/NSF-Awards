9521549 Denno Nearly all predator-prey systems involve predator complexes
comprised of multiple predator species. Evidence from several systems
demonstrates that the total impact of a predator complex can not be measured by
summing the impacts of the individual predators. This suggests that many
predators are interacting with each other either synergistically, when predators
facilitate each other's performance, or antagonistically, when predators
interfere with each other's feeding or foraging. The goal of this research is to
quantify and identify the mechanism for the interactions between ground and
foliar aphid predators across a wide range of conditions in an alfalfa
agroecosystem. Preliminary evidence from this agroecosystem suggests that
foliar-foraging predators of aphids interact synergistically with ground-
foraging predators of aphids. Evidence from other preliminary studies suggests
that the mechanism driving this interaction is aphid dropping behavior induced
by foliar predators which makes the aphids more susceptible to ground predators.
The results of this project will have broad implications for basic predator-prey
theory. In addition, they will foster advances in the use of these predators for
the biological control of insect pests.
