This SBIR Phase I project will develop bimetallic platinum copper/carbon
nanofibers in a filter media system to react and remove nitrate from drinking
water. In the same operation the system will perform filtration and thereby
reduce the time for the operation and cost. The bulk of the Phase I proposal
focuses on the synthesis of the nanofibers. The remainder of the project
involves the characterization of the nanomaterials and an analysis of their
ability to remove nitrate from water.

The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be a technology that
could be used to remove nitrate from drinking water. Due to overuse of natural
and synthetic fertilizers, nitrate concentration is at a high risk level at many
water works and in groundwater sources. Nitrate is an important water quality
issue and has significant potential public health impacts.
