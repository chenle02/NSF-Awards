9553368 Vetter This project proposes to acquire a local area asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) network testbed for the purpose of creating a state-of-the-
art co-laboratory where researchers can work on new, high-speed network
approaches to problems in distributed database management, network protocols,
multimedia systems, and remote distance education. Another objective is to
enable and support collaborative research efforts among investigators in North
Dakota's research universities. The proposed computing and network
infrastructure should enable additional research opportunities and increase
external grant competitiveness. Finally, the various research and development
aspects of this project will be integrated into the existing undergraduate and
graduate courses. In particular, improved educational opportunities for students
will result from the virtual laboratory application developed as part of this
effort. Long-term project sustainability will be achieve (l) by future
investigator grants, (2) existing and newly formed industry/university
partnerships, and (3) by a commitment by North Dakota's Information Technology
Services to maintain and service this infrastructure when the grant period
expires. Significance of Activity: The diversity of traffic generated by newly
emerging multimedia applications is currently very difficult to support with
existing communication networks. Existing networks simply do not provide the
transport facilities necessary to efficiently support these increasingly
important user applications. The major outcome of this project will be an
improved basic science and technology networking infrastructure in North Dakota.
