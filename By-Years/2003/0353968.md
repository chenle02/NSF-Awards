EEC-0353968 &lt;br/&gt;Texas Engineering Experiment Station
(TEES)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
program. This award provides support for an REU Site at Texas A&amp;M University
(TAMU). Ten students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a nine-week
summer experience in research related to electrical engineering applications for
homeland security. Students will have an opportunity to do research in topic
areas such as reliable and secure power grids; secure communication network
services; robust sensor network operation; and biological sensors. The program
will provide information to student participants on the benefits of attending
graduate school and the process involved in applying to graduate school. It is
anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to
increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in
research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies, and in
private-sector organizations.
