The mysteries of motion inside living cells must be investigated from both
biochemical and biophysical perspectives. The molecular apparatus of cytoplasmic
motility includes scores of proteins that have evolved for specialized functions
in the complex process of intracellular force generation. Many of these proteins
have now been isolated and characterized both chemically and functionally; but
the interplay among them to create supramolecular structures and to generate
intracellular motive forces is still a matter of more speculation than
understanding. Even the most fundamental issues about macromolecular self-
assembly and supramolecular hydrodynamics remain to be resolved. The broad
objective of Dr. Ware's work in this field is to utilize the techniques of
macromolecular physical chemistry to provide quantitation of mechanistically
significant observables. The primary component of the motile apparatus is actin,
the most abundant and most highly conserved protein in nature. The mechanism of
actin self-assembly and its regulations will be investigated using the
fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique and other methods including
fluorescence spectroscopy, viscosimetry, and light scattering. Specific issues
to be addressed include the role of cations in promoting assembly and the role
of ATP hydrolysis in determining kinetic and thermodynamics parameters.
Particular emphasis will be placed on the determination of filament length and
filament number using multiple physical techniques, including fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching quasi-elastic light scattering and viscosimetry.
Similar experiments will be employed to examine the mechanisms of action of
proteins that have regulatory function on actin assembly and filament length.
The results of these experiments and related physical investigations on model
systems will be interpreted with the goal of providing objective physical tests
for proposed mechanisms of regulated actin assembly, cytoplasmic rheology, and
cytoplasmic motility.
