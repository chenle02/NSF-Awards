&lt;br/&gt;The programmability challenges to general-purpose parallel computing
desperately need computer hardware and software researchers to work together on
the solutions. However, the unacceptably slow speed of current full-system
simulators limits the multiprocessor/multi-core
research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed ProtoFlex project develops an FPGA-
accelerated simulation technology to deliver the necessary simulation
performance to enable full-scale software research on top of simulated
experimental architectures. ProtoFlex simulators are not FPGA prototypes. The
ProtoFlex simulation architecture relies on hardware virtualization to achieve
full-system fidelity and system scalability, while mitigating the complexities
associated with conventional FPGA prototyping. This project will develop a
hybrid simulation with transplanting and with interleaving of multiple processor
contexts, with the goal to decouple the required complexity of the hardware
construction from the complexity of a very large target multiprocessor system.
This project will also investigate in-hardware techniques for real-time, deep
instrumentation and analysis of simulation events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
