Arbor&lt;br/&gt;Lead&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: NSF
Workshop on Unwanted Traffic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of
this workshop is to provide a venue for discussion about the important and
vexing problem of denial of service attacks, as exemplified by the recent
attacks on Estonia and Georgia. Such attacks are all but impossible to mitigate
with existing technology. The participants of this workshop will attempt to
identify new solutions to prevent and/or cope with denial of service attacks,
perhaps involving fundamentally new network security architecture. Industry
involvement in the workshop is vital to its success, as there is a clear need
for network agents, such as ISPs to cooperatively identify unwanted traffic and
to block such traffic, even if some traffic of their clients is erroneously
blocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will produce a detailed report to be
posted on the NSF web site.&lt;br/&gt;
