This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
address the need for large highly efficient gratings as essential components of
astronomical, spectroscopic, and optical telecommunications equipment. The goal
of the proposed research program is to develop a hybrid manufacturing process
combining holography and preferential chemical etching to produce large area
diffraction gratings on both planar and curved surfaces that exhibit higher
efficiency than gratings manufactured with current techniques. These gratings
can be used as dispersing elements and optical filters in astronomical
instruments, as extremely narrow band pass filters in pump lasers for optical
telecommunications, and as multiplexers and de-multiplexers for wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM) equipment. Of particular significance will be the
ability to produce large area efficient gratings on concave surfaces. This will
allow dispersion and focusing functions to combine within the same optical
element on space-based telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diffraction gratings
produced using current generation techniques such as ruling engines, holography,
and E-beam mask writers can be improved upon greatly in terms of efficiency,
cost, and material performance (such as thermal and chemical stability). Highly
efficient, large area, planar or curved, diffractive structures made of non out-
gassing materials are of great interest to institutions and companies in the
fields of astronomy, spectroscopy, laser manufacture, and optical
telecommunications. &lt;br/&gt;
