9318180 Ellisman The increased availability of High Performance Computing and
Communications (HPCC) offers scientists the potential for effective remote
interactive use of centralized, specialized, and expensive instrumentation and
computers. The goal of this national challenge project is to design and
implement a collaborative computational environment, or Collaboratory for
Microscopic Digital Anatomy, providing a researcher at a remote site distributed
interaction with unique instrumentation for the acquistion and manipulation of
images of biological structure. The initial focus will be on the development of
an integrated system for remote interactive acquistition and analysis of 2- and
3- dimensional light and electron microscopic data from digital image acquistion
systems. To accomplish this task, a multidisciplinary team representing several
institutions including the University of California , San Diego, Cornell
University and the Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization,
and the San Diego Supercomputer Center, has been assembled, including computer
scientists specializing in HPCC and volume visualization, and biologists with
expertise in computer-aided light and electron microscopy. This award will
enable these activities. This project is being supported by several programs at
NSF: New Technologies in Computer and Information Science, Cell Biology,
Computational Neuroscience and Computational Biology.
