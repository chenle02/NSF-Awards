This project carried out at the California Institute of Technology seeks to
address the origin of Jupiter Trojans, which are clusters of asteroids in
Jupiterâ€™s orbit. These two clusters sit at gravitationally stable points in the
orbit, one ahead of the planet, and the other behind. The origin of these
asteroids is still unknown. This project is to examine the composition of the
Jupiter Trojans that have recently undergone collisions to obtain insight into
their history. The exposed material will be examined using data from several
ground-based observatories including the Keck Observatory and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The broader impacts of this project
include significant upgrades to a free online class available on Coursera called
The Science of the Solar System. The upgrades are to include the last 5 years of
space exploration and to develop new rich content based on the research into the
early dynamical history of the solar system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
composition of the Jupiter Trojans provides a critical observational clue into
the dynamical history of the solar system, but little is known about the
compositions of these objects, because long term irradiation and continuous
particle bombardment have turned their surfaces into dark refractory deposits
with no identifiable spectral features. This multi-faceted project will study
recent collisional fragments of Jupiter Trojan asteroids. Observing recent
fragments with freshly exposed interior materials will provide insight into
their composition, into their formation history, and the nature of the dynamical
evolution of the early solar system. A systematic study will be carried out of
objects in size from approximately 5 km, where all objects should be
continuously collisionally active, up to approximately 40 km, where only the
occasional object should have experienced a recent collision. Using combinations
of Palomar visible photometry, Keck infrared spectroscopy, and ALMA radiometry,
the albedo, composition, and collisional history of these fragments will be
examined. This study will reveal the origin of these objects, their connection
to the main belt of asteroids or to the Kuiper belt, and, by extension, the
dynamical history of the early solar system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
