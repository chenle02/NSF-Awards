This is a project to determine the feasibility of using a photo-initiated
reaction to convert chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds into less environmentally
hazardous chlorine-free hydrocarbons. The proposal leading to this award
submitted in response to the Small Business Inovation Research Program
Solicitation, NSF 89-30. The project involves an experimental study to construct
the photochemical apparatus, perform the reaction itself on several chloninated
hydrocarbons, determine optimum conditions for the reaction, and determine the
important engineering process design parameters. This project has the potential
for initiating a novel technology for conversion of hazardous chlorocarbons to
usable hydrocarbon fuels at low temperatures. This is expected to circumvent
formation of chemical complexes, reduce soot formation, facilitate control of
the system and significantly reduce the cost of the conversion process.
