9320672 McIntosh The objective of this research is the deployment of an airborne
doppler polarimetric 95 GHz (3.2 mm) radar on the University of Wyoming King Air
for the purpose of depicting the microphysical structure and evolution of water
substance in clouds. During the first year, the radar will participate in the
WISP experiment (Central Colorado) which is designed to explore the distribution
and evolution of ice and supercooled water in stationary (wave) clouds.
Additional field experiments will be identified during the second and third
years. The new measurements should provide new techniques to discriminate
between water and ice, measure the vertical motion of ice crystals in cirrus
clouds and perhaps a means of estimating crystal habitat. ***
