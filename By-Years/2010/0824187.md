Objective:&lt;br/&gt;This research targets a new approach for realizing high-
performance erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers (EDWAs) for wavelength division
multiplexed optical fiber communication networks at a cost suitable for
widespread metropolitan area network deployment.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The merit of this effort
lies in a proposed GaAs-based EDWA which incorporates recent patent-pending
discoveries: a high quality oxidized InAlP erbium host material, and oxidation-
smoothed low-loss high-index-contrast ridge waveguides enabled by a relatively
new nonselective wet thermal oxidation technique, with a novel resonant vertical
intra-cavity pumping (VIP) scheme for the compact, monolithic integration of a
resonant-enhanced excitation source. The phosphate-rich InAlP native oxides
afford very high Er doping concentrations with long fluorescence decay lifetimes
and a very broad amplification band. VIP excitation offers high pumping
efficiency, even pump distribution, multi-stage pumping for noise control,
simplified packaging, and the possibility for increased photonic integration.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of this work flow
from the expected significant reductions in component cost which will benefit
society by making ultra-high-speed multi-wavelength optical communications
viable for the home, schools and medical offices, thus promoting the accelerated
development and adoption of bandwidth-intensive applications such as digital
video, video conferencing, and internet communications across multiple
platforms. The research may also lead to eye-safe high-energy pulsed waveguide
laser sources for range finding and broadband amplified spontaneous emission
sources for chemical sensing. The project promotes teaching, training and
learning through the integration of research activities with teaching of
undergraduate engineering majors, Research Experience for Teachers participants,
and the mentoring of underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;
