Chris Jacobsen ECS-9510499 The capabilities and applications of x-ray focusing
will be developed through development of high resolution diffractive x-ray
optics. This work will be undertaken in an academic-industrial collaboration
with Don Tennant of ATT Bell Laboratories (Holmdel). ATT is now installing a
JEOL JBX-6000FS electron beam lithography system with a field emission gun which
is just the second of its kind to be delivered to the United States. This system
will be used to fabricate 20-30 nanometer resolution soft x-ray zone plates for
microscopy, and diffractive optics for tests of extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
lithography systems for integrated circuit printing. It will also be used to
fabricate zone plates which will be used by Dr. Wen-Bing Yun of Argonne National
Laboratory as x-ray lithography masks for the generation of thick zone plates
for hard x-ray applications, such as fluorescence microprobe studies. The x-ray
experiments will be carried out using high brightness undulators at Brookhaven
National Laboratory and at Argonne National Laboratory.
