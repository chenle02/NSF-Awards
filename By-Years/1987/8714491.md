The Tribology of crystalline semiconductors and ceramics is critical to the
utilization of these materials in high technology applications. For example,
semiconductors used for large-scale integrated circuits are cut by diamond
impregnated wheels and, lapped and polished in fluids that contain abrasive
particles. Ceramics are being used as abrasion resistant coatings in
reciprocating engines and other machines where surfaces are moving at a relative
velocity so that the ceramic coating is abraded due to inadvertent contact of
these surfaces. The contact of an abrasive particle with a crystalline
semiconductor or ceramic damages the surfaces of these materials. This damage is
detrimental because it creates cracks which can lead to catastrophic brittle
failure. There is currently no quantitative model which can predict the mode or
extent of this damage. This project develops a unique model and, simple and
straightforward tribological experiments that can be used to determine and
eventually predict the deformation mechanisms of crystalline semiconductors and
ceramics. The results of this research will be valuable to industry and may be
utilized to optimize cutting, lapping and polishing crystalline semiconductors
and minimize the abrasive wear of ceramic coatings.
