Zanakis 9632962 One of the major technological problems in the use of advanced
limb prosthetics is the inability of the user to control the prosthesis in a
manner which can mimic normal function. When nerves are severed or disrupted,
control over the limb is lost, even though the information for control may still
be present in the portions of the nerves that were spared from damage or
amputation. If that information can be used to operate the prosthesis, then
better control of the artificial limb can be achieved. The proposed research
examines the effectiveness of components designed to interface the peripheral
nervous system with the electronic hardware of the prosthetics. The work will be
performed utilizing a multi-electrode cable (MEC) device which uses muscle cells
grown upon it in order to attract the nerves to regenerate toward the MEC. The
interface will be able to detect signals from the nerves, decode the nerve
impulses, and therefore control a prosthesis. The first part of the study will
test this technology in rodents, to determine if cut nerves can be attracted to
the MEC, and if the MEC can then decode signals from the nerve, particularly for
long periods of time. Certain components of the rodent experiments have already
been performed successfully, and a major goal of this study is to combine the
many techniques and determine if the entire system performs as a unit. The
results of this experiment are crucial to the refinement and increased utility
of human limb prosthetics.
