9321864 Grofman The multi-party negotiation process in South Africa has set a
date of April 27, 1994 for universal suffrage elections to a new constituent
assembly that will serve as an interim legislature and as a constitutional
drafting body for a new constitution. The basic election mechanism will be list
Proportional Representation (PR) with both local constituencies and a national
list. This investigation involves using a combination of hard and soft data to
test a number of specific hypotheses about party strategies and voter choices in
this important election - - hypotheses with general implication for the study of
the influence of electoral systems on racial and ethnic conflict. An
investigator will spend two and one half months in South Africa observing the
campaigning in this critical election and gathering an archive of campaign
material and a data base about candidates. The investigator will remain for
several weeks after the election to conduct additional interviews of
participants (both winners and losers) and of academic and journalistic sources
and to collect a complete data set of election outcomes at the magisterial
district (precinct equivalent) level and data sets from as many public opinion
polls as are available. These data will also be used to generate simulations of
the likely electoral consequences had alternative electoral systems been used.
