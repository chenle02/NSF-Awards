A set of experiments will be performed that use atomic interference for
precision measurements. In atom interferometry, the quantum mechanical wave that
describes an atom is split into two components that are separated in space. When
the two components are later recombined, the result encodes information about
the atom's environment. The project will investigate using interference to
improve measurements of acceleration, rotation, and gravity, with the goal of
improving sensor technology for inertial navigation and underground detection.
The project will also explore the use of interferometry to detect and count
single photons, which could be useful for implementing or attacking various
types of quantum communication schemes.

This work will have broad impact in a variety of areas. Two graduate students
will be supported and the experiments performed will likely form the basis of
their PhD dissertations. These students will receive training in advanced
scientific techniques and will be well-prepared for a productive career in
research. The project could also have significant technological and social
relevance due to the growing importance of inertial sensing and quantum
communication in commercial and national security applications.
