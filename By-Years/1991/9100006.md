Mariculture operations must extend farther out to sea to achieve greater water
circulation volumes to dilute fish farm washes. In realizing such developments,
one faces substantial engineering challenges. Prominent among these challenges
are achieving the seaworthiness of the infrastructure, i.e., the containment
system for the cultivars (pens, cages, and so forth), the improvement of
construction materials in off-shore installations, primarily for the reduction
of fouling; and the adaptation of containment or retention methods to the
biological exigencies of the cultivars. This engineering workshop focuses on the
research needs to solve these problems and will invite internationally-known
engineers and marine scientists from the following countries: Japan, France,
Canada, and Norway. These countries have extensive federal and private sector
off- shore mariculture research and development programs. Exchange of
information on engineering approaches to off- shore mariculture promises a
clearer definition of where engineering problems lie and how research activities
should be formulated and organized to overcome these problems.
