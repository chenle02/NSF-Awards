The goal of this Presidential Young Investigator grant is to determine local
electronic structure of defects in ceramics. The research uses scanning
tunnelling microscopy with simultaneous photoexcitation to increase the free
carrier concentration. Preliminary results have identified the potential to use
this technique to identify structural and chemical defects in these wide band
gap materials. The observed increase and distinct variation in the conductance
is a detector of photoexcitation processes, allowing optical spectroscopy to be
performed with the spatial resolution of scanning tunnelling microscopy. The
research is being done on silicon carbide and zinc oxide. The effects of
valence-to-conduction band excitation and defect-to- conduction band excitation
are being isolated. Reflection, transmission electron microscopy and
spectrophotometry are being used as collaborative techniques.
