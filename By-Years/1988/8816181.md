The Pyrenees resulted from the collision between the Iberian Peninsula and
France. The main phase of the Pyrenean orogeny in northern Spain is
characterized by the successive emplacement of large thrust sheets into the
south Pyrenean foredeep primarily during the early Tertiary. In the zone ahead
of the thrusts,s deformation of existing sediments, deposition of syntectonic
conglomerates and formation of progressive unconformities in proximal sediments
accompany thrust advancement. This project will attempt to date thrust movement
and to determine rates of thrusting by accurately dating these features.
Paleomagnetic stratigraphy techniques will be applied to date the syntectonic
sediments and determine the extent of tectonic rotations that may have occurred.
These results, in combination with structural and biostratigraphic information,
will be used to improve the synthesis of the development of the Pyrenean
orogeny.
