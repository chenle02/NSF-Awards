This proposal is offered by New York University's College of Arts and Science. A
new, integrated series of introductory level science courses will be developed
for 1,600 non-science majors annually. The new curriculum takes into account the
level of preparation and the extent of alienation of students from science and
mathematics. The proposed curriculum aims to teach quantitative reasoning and
emphasize the open-ended questioning aspect of scientific thinking by means of
lectures, inquiry-based laboratory experiences and recitations, and cooperative
study teams. The intention is to develop, pilot, and refine an experimental
version of such a multicourse curriculum in 1993-95, and in 1995 to replace the
existing elective science and mathematics requirements at NYU with this program.
All non-science majors will eventually have equal exposure to a corpus of
interesting material in a Science Core Program. Design features will permit a
certain measure of individualization in learning, as well as encourage the
development of small, cooperative problem-solving study groups, breaking
students out of isolation and replicating the research model of scientific
inquiry.
