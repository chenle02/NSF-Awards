9316183 Sherrell PIs have found iridium (Ir) anomalies in ice cores associated
with the 1908 Tunguska event and the 1783 Laki eruption. In collabooration with
Robert Rocchia (Paris), they will extend these analyses to other ice cores with
the following goals: 1) test and verify findings, 2) make systematic studies on
ice core samples to clarify partitioning of Ir, and 3) investigate temporal
variability of background Ir deposition. Results have implications for debate
over impact vs. volcanic sources for iridium in the stratigraphic record, and
also for linking volcanism and impacts to climatic changes.
