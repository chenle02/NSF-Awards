This project will develop innovative test questions, statewide examinations and
teacher resources to help ensure that specific science learning outcomes are
achieved; this for grades four and eight and for high school earth science and
biology. Science assessment manuals will be developed to assist teachers in
preparing students for more challenging state examinations and to encourage more
thoughtful student evaluation. Wide dissemination of the results of this
activity are planned.
