This award will support the participation of researchers and students in the
first biennial Labrador Research Forum that will occur in Goose Bay, Labrador
15th-18th of February 2017. Designed to promote research sovereignty, the Forum
will bring together Inuit community members and researchers to identify and
establish research priorities in Labrador's Indigenous communities. The Forum is
structured to foster and facilitate maximum engagement between community
members, scholars, and students. The research team and students will participate
in a one-day pre-meeting workshop between members of the Inuit community of
Rigolet, Labrador and an interdisciplinary team of six researchers in the fields
of Indigenous environmental education, psychology, the environmental humanities,
and climate science. The purpose of the workshop is to engage with community
members to elicit their research interests and priorities and to match, if so
invited, community interests with researcher expertise.
