Water quality and fisheries resources are dependent on the dynamics species
interactions within fresh water lakes, yet little is known about how warmer
temperatures (&gt;25 C), in conjunction with food abundance, affect interactions
of aquatic species. This research will explore interactive effects of elevated
water temperature, up to 30 C, and food abundance on species interactions in a
model planktonic food web. This three trophic-level food web includes a primary
producer, 2 crustacean grazers, and one predator, each can be easily cultured or
maintained in the laboratory. Effects of temperature, food abundance, and
interactions of these conditions will be evaluated using a series of single and
two-species experiments performed on members of the first two trophic level.
Populations growth rates of the primary producer, loss rates caused by each
grazer species, and the fecundity and survival of each grazer will be evaluated
in different temperature/food abundance treatments. Results of experiments will
be used to parameterize a simulation model which will project the outcome of
species interactions under a wide variety of environmental conditions,
Subsequent research will test these predictions, extend the model to include 3
trophic levels, and investigate how rapidly cladoceran grazers evolve in
response to thermal selection pressures. Results will 1) aid in biotic
assessments of elevated temperature, 2) establish a model food web for
evaluating environmental effects on species dynamics, and 3) allow evaluation of
the relative magnitude of higher order interactions in communities that are
environmentally stressed.
