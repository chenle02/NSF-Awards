"Large Deviations and Exact Asymptotics: A Constructive Theory"

The research objective of this project is to develop analytical methods for
computing exact asymptotic expressions for the probability of rare events and
for determining how these rare events develop. The probability distribution of
interest is implicitly defined as the stationary distribution of a Markov
process.

Markov processes are frequently used to model complex systems in a wide variety
of areas including reliability and telecommunications. The rare event of
interest might correspond to states in which a highly reliable system has failed
or when a buffer in a telecommunications network is full so that arriving
packets would be lost. In well-designed systems, such events should be rare, but
it can be critical to know how rare. Exact asymptotic expressions accurately
approximate the probability of these rare events. In addition to knowing their
probability, it can be beneficial to know how these rare events develop.
Typically, they are preceded by the same type of behavior. For example, packets
overflowing a particular buffer in a communications network may almost always be
preceded first by a large increase in the number of packets at another node.

If successful, the results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding
of rare events, to exact asymptotic expressions for their probabilities, and to
results describing the system evolution prior to their occurrence. The
analytical expressions will allow accurate assessment of the probability of rare
events in complicated systems. Designers of complex systems will be able to use
these results to determine whether a particular design meets performance
specifications.

In addition, by knowing how the process evolves prior to the occurrence of the
rare event, designers would have a better understanding of where to modify the
system to improve performance.
