This award will support an observational study of binarity in the central stars
of planetary nebulae. This stage of stellar evolution represents the penultimate
phase of evolution for low- and intermediate mass stars, and very little is
known about the evolution of binary stars during this stage. Close binaries are
expected to evolve further into merging or mass-transfer systems, which would
then manifest themselves as cataclysmic variables; they could also be the
precursor systems to Type Ia supernovae. The project will involve a combination
of multi-color photometry and spectroscopy with the aim of discovering new
binary stars in planetary nebulae and characterizing some in
detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the project may have a
significant scientific impact on the areas of supernova research, cataclysmic
variables, and novae. It will also contribute to the development and training of
students at a primarily undergraduate institution.
