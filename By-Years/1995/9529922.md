The objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the ways in
which industries differ in the use and effectiveness of quality practices.
Previous studies have tended to overlook industry differences in the use and
effectiveness of quality-related work and production practices, focusing instead
on overall trends across industries or on single industry case studies. The
study will provide the first empirical analysis of the ways the transformation
to quality practice differs across U.S. manufacturing industries. To examine
this issue, the study will use survey data from a 1994 study of the entire
population of Japanese affiliated manufacturing plants in the United States, and
a 1992 sample of a size-stratified sample of U.S. manufacturing establishments
generally. These samples contain detailed information on the production and work
organization, quality practices, labor force, customer-supplier relations and
performance of plants in a wide variety of manufacturing industries. Analysis of
survey data will permit identification of technological and organizational
factors that are associated with industry differences in the adoption and
implementation of a range of quality practices. The study also will include an
analysis of the performance impacts of quality practices by industry. f8 + _
