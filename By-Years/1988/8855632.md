A leading chemist who is also a writer on science for lay audiences will
collaborate with a talented visual artist to create a series of 25-30 images and
matching one-page essays on the subject of Chemistry Imagined -- the magic of
chemistry, its historical roots, its ways of knowing, and its contemporary
issues and ideas. These images and essays will be made available to the public
in the form of a book to be published by a commercial publisher and also a
travelling exhibition of the original images and essays. The intent of the
project is to communicate to the public the essence of chemistry and its place
in modern culture, to develop public understanding of central ideas of
chemistry, and to demonstrate the close and complementary relationship of
artistic and scientific sensibilities.
