This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating ball milling
technology to produce low-cost, metal-free, carbon-based electrocatalysts as
replacements for expensive platinum catalysts for commercial fuel cells. The
translated catalytic technology has the following unique features: low-cost,
scalable and eco-friendly processing, high catalytic activity, and MeOH-
effect/Co-poisoning free that provides exemplary high performance and
significant cost saving when compared to the leading competing platinum and
related noble metal catalysts in this market space. The project accomplishes its
objectives by developing a scalable ball milling process to produce functional
graphene materials as metal-free catalyst/electrodes for oxygen reduction
reaction in fuel cells, resulting in a fuel cell prototype.

The potential economic impact is expected to be highly-efficient fuel cells for
transportation and stationary applications in the next five years, which will
contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the fuel cell market. The societal
impact, long term, will be the training of the next generation researchers and
engineers, reducing our national reliance on foreign petroleum, and reduction of
greenhouse gas emission and environment pollution.
