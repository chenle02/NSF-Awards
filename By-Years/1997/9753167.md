This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education
(POWRE) program supports the research and educational activities of Professor
Katherine Hunt of Michigan State University. The research pursues new
applications of nonlocal electromagnetic response theory, in order to predict
and interrelate experimental measurements within two research areas: derivation
of interconnections among vibrational force constants, infrared intensities, and
electric field gradients at nuclei, in an experimentally useful form, and
evaluation of a nonlocal, intramolecular dielectric function to characterize the
screening of perturbing potentials. The opportunity afforded through the POWRE
program will enhance Professor Hunt's research and leadership potential and her
educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral women
scientists.
