The electric power grid is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) that forms the
lifeline of modern society. Cybersecurity and resiliency of the power grid is of
paramount importance to national security and economic well-being. CPS security
testbeds are enabling technologies that provide realistic experimental platforms
for the evaluation and validation of security technologies within controlled
environments, and they also enable the exploration of robust security
solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two objectives: (a) to develop
innovative architectures, abstractions, models, and algorithms for large-scale
CPS security testbeds; and (b) to design and implement a high-fidelity,
scalable, open-access CPS security testbed for the smart grid, and to conduct
research experimentation. The testbed integrates appropriate cyber-control-
physical hardware/software components, models, and algorithms in a modular
design that enables federation of smaller testbeds to form a large-scale virtual
experimental environment. The use cases for the testbed include vulnerability
assessment, risk assessment, risk mitigation studies, and attack-defense
exercises. The project also aims to develop standardized datasets, models,
libraries, and use cases, and make the testbed available to a broader research
community through an open-, remote-access model by leveraging collaboration from
academic and industry partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides contributing to
research and technology that will enable a future electric power grid that is
secure and resilient, this project develops and disseminates innovative
curriculum modules including CPS Cyber Defense Competitions (CPS-CDC) for
imparting security knowledge to students via an inquiry-based learning paradigm.
The project also mentors students, including underrepresented minorities, in
thesis work and Capstone projects, and exposes high-school students to
cybersecurity concepts via testbed demonstrations.
