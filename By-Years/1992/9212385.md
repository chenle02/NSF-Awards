At the end of his administration, President Eisenhower, himself having risen to
the highest rank in the US military, a "general of the Armies," warned about the
dangers of the "military-industrial complex." A major portion of this complex is
the government finance of research and development of new weapons of war. Yet
this phenomenon is not new: governments began serious support of the scientific
study of weapons of war in the late 18th century. The "father of the chemical
revolution," Antoine Lavoisier, served France as the administrator of research
on gunpowder. Indeed, France was the locus of the most sustained tradition of
scientific involvement in the development of munitions and explosives up until
the rise of the great superpowers of the 20th century, the US and the USSR. Dr.
Mauskopf is examining the development of scientifically based munitions and
explosives, concentrating on but not limiting himself to work in France. On the
basis of his prior investigations, he has found useful an heuristic patterning
involving a research focus of material (i.e. chemical research) versus a dynamic
focus in physics research. There is also a pattern of research locus of
laboratory versus field studies of the effectiveness of various munitions and
explosives. The material focus has to do with such challenges as the production
and purification of the constituents of the munitions, etc. The dynamic focus
had more to do with physical aspects of explosion and to aspects including such
parameters of explosion as temperature, pressure, rate of burn and work
performed and the relation of the actual physical characteristics of the
munitions to their mode of explosion. Laboratory versus field locus
distinguishes between those investigations conducted in scaled down laboratory
conditions from those carried out under conditions approximating military use.
Dr. Mauskopf hypothesizes that there was a progressive amalgamation of all four
components (chemical vs. physical, lab vs. field research) as research moved to
the 20th century. The history of the scientific study of munitions and
explosives has hardly been studied before. This study will not only rectify this
inattention, but will also address issues pertinent to the historical
relationship between science, technology and industry; the relationship between
scientific research and military considerations; and the relationship of science
to political and commercial incentives and patronage.
