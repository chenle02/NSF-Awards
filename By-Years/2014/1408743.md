Non-technical Description: This project seeks to further the development of a
new class of optical materials by atomic-layer engineering and to understand the
effects and mechanisms of incorporating atomic-layer doping of oxide materials
that are transparent in the visible light. The research is designed to expand
the space of opportunities in materials science by providing a new class of
optical materials that are highly transparent in the visible light, have
unusually strong dielectric responses and opaque in the infrared light, and are
highly anisotropic in optical properties over a broad spectrum. The research
project provides a comprehensive training to young researchers from material
synthesis to analysis and applications, especially when the materials are new
and "beyond" what can be found in nature. It fosters a stronger collaboration
with leading research teams in France and Korea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Description: To accomplish the goal of atomic-layer engineering of the material
structure and composition to acquire previously unavailable properties,
transparent oxide superlattice structures are designed, synthesized by atomic
layer deposition (ALD), and characterized. In superlattices of AlOx/ZnO,
TiOx/ZnO, GaOx/ZnO, and InOx/ZnO, individual dopant atomic-layers are inserted
into a host transparent oxide (e.g. ZnO), either periodically or with a variable
spacing, resulting in an alternating stacking of 2D "doping-layer" and oxide
"spacer-layer." The atomic-layer "doping" approach opens possibilities for
achieving and controllably varying electro-optical properties that were
previously unavailable, and for realizing anisotropic and hyperbolic dispersions
by design. Extraordinary structural/electro-optical properties, such as high
electron densities, high electron conductivities, high transparency in the
visible, and strong plasmonic resonance in the infrared, are expected for these
novel materials.
