8902122 Sacks The subject of inverse scattering includes a number of interesting
and important scientific problems, arising in the areas of geophysics, quantum
mechanics, nondestructive testing, medical imaging and elsewhere. Mathematical
formulation of such problems often require the determination of one or more
coefficient functions in a partial differential equation (or system of
equations), given as data certain limited knowledge about special solutions to
the equation. One finds two substantial sources of difficulty associated with
most problems of this type, in theory and in application, namely nonlinearity
and ill-posedness. There is a need for much more mathematical analysis. The
objective of this project is the investigation of the mathematical structure of
certain model problems arising in several areas of inverse scattering. As a
general rule the approach to a particular nonlinear problem will be via the
study of linearized approximations. Such linearized inverse problems are also of
independent interest. Specific questions under investigation include the
uniqueness of the solution, the continuous dependence of the solution on the
given data, the extent of validity of linearization techniques, and how the
answers to the previous questions can be used in the design of numerical
solution methods.
