The principal investigator will study the chemical compositions of fluid
inclusions using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence techniques. Precise fluid
inclusion analyses will eventually enable well- constrained pressure-volume-
temperature and thermodynamic modeling of rock-fluid systems. Ultimately this
will provide geologists with important tools needed to unravel the geologic
history of rocks.
