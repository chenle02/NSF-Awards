9300805 Rosenthal This project addresses a number of issues in systems theory,
interpolation theory and coding theory, all of which involve algebraic
properties of the class of all autoregressive systems of a bounded degree. The
main objectives of the research are improved methods for the design of
stabilizing dynamic feedback compensators, a better understanding of the
interplay between issues of robustness and topological properties of the space
of transfer functions, and new methods for constructing classes of convolutional
codes with a low complexity and a large free distance. Many real world systems
may be mathematically modeled by so- called linear systems. Two examples of a
linear system are dynamic feedback compensators, which are widely used in the
design of feedback controllers, and convolutional encoders and decoders, which
are implemented in many data transmission schemes. It is the goal of this
project to develop a mathematical theory which will lead to improved design
techniques for feedback controllers of various types as well as more efficient
convolutional encoders and decoders. ***
