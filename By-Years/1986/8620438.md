Bowling Green State University has several researchers who would benefit from
access to supercomputing. They will be connected by a medium speed (56,000 baud
per second) communication line to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center Academic
Affiliates Network (PSCAAnet), which connects to the National Science Foundation
Network (NSFnet). Six federally-funded supercomputing centers can be accessed
through NSFnet.
