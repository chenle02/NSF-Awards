We are living in an increasingly connected world, where the Big Data movement
has resulted in not only more data but, more importantly, more connected data,
such as, social networks, knowledge graphs and deep neural networks. Sub-graph
isomorphism, which finds sub-graphs of interest from an enormous data graph, is
a fundamental tool for an array of critical applications, e.g., cyber-security,
criminal detection and health care. In spite of such a great potential,
identifying all isomorphic sub-graphs is a challenge in the Big Data context due
to high computation complexity and memory consumption. This project addresses
this issue, and will benefit both industrial and academic communities, as well
as train undergraduate, underrepresented and STEM high school students for high-
performance data analytics (HPDA) research
(https://www.uml.edu/research/hpda/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional efforts
split the query graph into two disjoint parts for prune and join, which impairs
the prune strength of the query graph and results in a large volume of
unpromising candidates for the 'join' phase. This project advocates an entire
query graph-based prune approach to resolve the computation and memory
challenge. In particular, this research consists of two parts: 1) algorithms
research -- provenance-aware intersection-based candidate construction -- will
greatly reduce the false positives faced by the conventional approaches; 2)
systems research, i.e., GPU-enabled massively parallel provenance group
intersection, will tackle the bottleneck that is encountered on conventional CPU
platforms, through use of Graph Processing Unit (GPU)
acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
