The focus of this research is the use of the concept of `inverse polarity` for
the synthesis of a number of important C-aryl glycosides. Among the target
compound are C104, deacetylravidomycin and kidamycin, all three of which have
important biological properties. With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program
is supporting the research of Dr. Kathlyn Parker of the Department of Chemistry
at Brown University. Professor Parker will focus her work on the synthesis of
several complex C-aryl glycosides, compounds that have important biological
properties.
