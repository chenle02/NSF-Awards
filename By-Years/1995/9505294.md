*** 9505294 Entine This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
complete the technical development of high performance arrays of sophisticated
optical sensors, capable of' detecting the very fast, very low light level
signals generated by the interaction of high energy particles with fiber optic
detectors. Some of the most ambitious projects in the history of scientific
research are now being undertaken at high luminosity particle accelerator
facilities at various sites around the globe. Central to the success of these
endeavors are the availability of detectors such as those proposed. Presently
the only technology capable of achieving the required optical performance is a
system of detectors which require extremely cumbersome and expensive cryogenic
cooling to liquid helium temperatures. As a result of the Phase I research, a
new technology has been invented which should greatly reduce the expense and
challenge of detecting the faint optical signals central to such scientific
quests. This technology consists of arrays of unique, super high gain avalanche
photodiodes with such low noise that they can operate at temperatures near -50
degrees C, a temperature range which can be economically reached with little
difficulty. In Phase II, research will be conducted to move this device, whose
performance has been characterized and found to exceed initial expectations, to
the point where it will be ready for immediate incorporation at many high energy
facilities. These new optical sensors are so sensitive that they will be useful
for a wide array of optical applications including large high energy physics
systems, satellite aiming and communication and fiber optic data systems. ***
