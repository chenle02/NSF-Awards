This project funds a workshop to explore frontiers in molecular biology, to do
laboratory activities that have high potential for inclusion in regular high
school biology courses, and to discuss applications in biotechnology and their
related science-based societal issues. Thirty-two secondary teachers of biology
or chemistry will attend a five-week summer workshop beginning in July of 1987.
During this segment of the program, participants will attend lectures, do
laboratory work, participate in seminars given by faculty from 12 different
disciplines, hear guest lectures by representatives from pharmaceutical and food
industries, and observe demonstrations by several scientific companies of
equipment suitable for use in high school biology curricula. Time is set aside
each week for teachers to meet as a group to share experiences and to seek ways
to improve course offerings. Each teacher will be expected to do laboratory
experiments that can be used in the classroom. Teachers will be encouraged to
publish suitable experiments.
