The University of Michigan will carry out an experimental four year project,
"Upper Elementary Science Teaching: Integrating the Knowledge Bases." The
project will design and integrate with each other two upper-division physical
science courses for elementary teachers, an educational psychology course, and
science-focused field experiences. Problems in existing programs in which these
components are independent and isolated from each other will be addressed by:
integrating coursework in physical science, science methods, and educational
psychology, b) providing extensive exposure to science methods, c) linking
coursework to focused clinical experiences to provide a context for learning and
practice and d) developing technological support to aid preservice teachers in
integrating and applying these knowledge bases. The goal of the new program is
to enable new elementary teachers to teach science in a manner that will deepen
student understanding of fundamental science concepts. The ultimate aim of the
project is to create a model program for science preparation of elementary
teachers that can be adapted at similar large research universities. To aid in
dissemination of the project, exemplary materials will be developed including
curriculum guides, videotapes, sample student assignments, and case studies of
preservice teachers in the program. The cost sharing will be 130% of NSF's
contribution.
