Anthropology (81) Pedagogical studies consistently show that hands-on data
collection and analysis leads to greater understanding of the methods and logic
of science. At the same time, computer-based data acquisition and analysis
systems have grown more accessible for use in classroom instruction. Following
recommendations for science education in anthropology (Bender and Smith,
"Teaching Archaeology in the 21rst Century," Society for American Archaeology,
2000), and building on similar programs at other institutions, this project
combines these recent trends by integrating morphometric equipment and exercises
into undergraduate instruction. Using these resources, students at all levels of
instruction explore shape variation in anatomy and material culture to identify
patterns related to function, structure and development. Morphometric
workstations consisting of computers and associated measurement equipment allow
students to collect, analyze, and present data, improving their understanding of
the scientific process while developing skills in problem solving and
professional presentation. The success of the program is being measured using a
number of summative, formative, and independent evaluation instruments. Pre- and
post-instruction examinations are used to evaluate student understanding and
retention of basic principles of science and anthropology, and the SALGains
instrument is being used to measure student self-reported learning gains and
satisfaction with the learning environment. The primary goal of this project is
to introduce students to central issues in anthropology through the use of
contemporary methods of data collection, analysis and presentation. The broad
goals are to contribute to a scientifically literate populace and to produce
future generations of competent anthropological professionals.
