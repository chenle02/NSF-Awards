This research is on optimization algorithms for synthesis of multi- level loops,
which occur in time and memory critical parts of scientific computing
applications. The nested loops are modeled as multi-dimensional data-flow Graphs
(MDFG); and algorithms taking advantage of the multi-dimensionality are being
designed. By considering the multi-dimensional iteration space and the iteration
body simultaneously, the transformation and optimization techniques are able to
optimize throughput and memory requirement at the behavior level. Research
topics include: graph transformation and optimization; data scheduling; and co-
design. Polynomial-time algorithms for various graph models are being developed.
This avoids exponential integer linear programming approaches.
