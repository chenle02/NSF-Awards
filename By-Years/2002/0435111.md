Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates distributed algorithms
for organizing, structuring, and deploying sensor networks so that they can
accomplish a variety of high-level global estimation tasks. Special attention is
given to probabilistic methods that can deal with sensor noise, signal
interference, and measurement inaccuracies. The overall goal is to encapsulate a
small number of paradigms for sensor collaboration, information aggregation, and
distributed reasoning that can serve a wide variety of applications and ease the
burden of implementing this type of networked software anew each time.
Communication patterns are explored that combine sensing, information exchange,
and processing actions that jointly perform the required estimation in a
lightweight, robust, and uncertainty-aware manner. The net effect is to augment
the network stack above the data link layer with another layer that is data-
driven and performs collaborative reasoning, exploiting sensed information and
its value to the network task. Such task-driven communication patterns, once
they have been identified and implemented, will facilitate the quick deployment
of sensor networks for new tasks and seed additional applications. The
collaboration and reasoning problems addressed are important as well for other
distributed systems, including distributed data-bases and peer-to-peer
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on this project will combine design,
simulation, theoretical analysis, and the implementation of an experimental
sensor network testbed within a university building for exploring and validating
these ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
