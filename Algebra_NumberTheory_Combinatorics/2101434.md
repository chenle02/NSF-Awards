This research project focuses on questions within arithmetic geometry. As the
name suggests, this research area sits at the interface of two fields:
arithmetic (the study of whole numbers and fractions); and geometry (the study
of curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional shapes). These distinct areas are
brought together through the study of solutions to polynomial equations, that
is, the study of varieties. A guiding philosophy of arithmetic geometry is that
"geometry controls arithmetic," in other words, that the geometric properties of
a variety (those that can be studied in terms of the complex numbers) influence
the arithmetic behavior of the variety. The broad goals of this project are to
better understand the influence of geometry on two arithmetic properties:
rationality over the ground field, and the existence of isolated points. The
research involves several projects for students at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels.

The project concerns a systematic study of an arithmetic measure of the failure
of k-rationality, focusing on geometrically rational threefolds that have a
conic bundle structure or that have a fibration into high degree del Pezzo
surfaces. These two types of varieties together cover a large swath of all
geometrically rational threefolds. In another direction, the project aims to
gather more information on isolated points on curves. The aims in this direction
are twofold: 1) determine whether the Bombieri-Lang conjecture and the torsion
conjecture imply that the number of isolated points on a curve is bounded
depending solely on its genus, and 2) compute all isolated points on a
collection of modular curves.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
