This project examines the allocation of resources to the treatment and
prevention of HIV/AIDS and the role of screening and treatment for depression
among women living with HIV (WLWH). HIV is no longer a death sentence for those
infected, and the disease is becoming like other chronic diseases. As a result,
comorbidities are becoming a greater concern. Of common comorbidities,
depression is arguably the most important, especially for women. Depression
shapes key aspects of HIV care, such as retention in care. This project will
evaluate the impact of screening and treatment of depression among WLWH on the
public and social costs of HIV/AIDS and on the allocation of resources to
treatment and prevention of HIV. In doing so, we consider not just the costs of
treatment but also the productivity costs-the effect on employment, disability,
and other public expenditures. Our research approach involves integration of
simulation modeling with new methodologies in cost effectiveness research,
including a portfolio-based approach.

When completed, this project will answer key questions: (1) What allocation of
HIV/AIDS-related expendi-tures between treatment and prevention produces the
best levels of HIV/AIDS and employment among women in the community? (2) What
portion of a budget should be allocated to identifying and treating depression
among HIV+ women? (3) How would screening for depression among HIV+ women affect
expenditures on HIV treatment and on depression? (4) Do WLWH who are treated for
depression remain in the labor force longer, staying off disability and public
insurance? (5) How does the best mix of expenditures depend on community
characteristics, such as labor market conditions and public insurance, such as
the Medicaid program?
