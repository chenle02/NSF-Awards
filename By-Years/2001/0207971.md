&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norfolk State University will implement "Science and
Technology Academicians on the Road to Success" (STARS), a robust program
encompassing undergraduate recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising,
mentorship, research, and curricula enhancement to address the low graduation
rates of students of historically underrepresented groups. Project activities
are based on the hypothesis that providing students an environment that ties all
the components of student success into a coherent path with a clear purpose will
significantly increase success rates in STEM disciplines.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARS will first provide faculty training on advising,
mentoring and teaching and learning best practices and opportunities to enhance
and/or initiate research endeavors; second, it will merge recruitment, pre-
entrance preparation, advising, and mentorship efforts to create a seamless
environment, and third, it will provide students superior advising,
interdisciplinary research mentoring and exciting ways to learn. STARS will
provide a coherent undergraduate student experience, which will result in a
significant increase of the success rate of STEM
students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAR Objectives:&lt;br/&gt;double STEM graduates
attending graduate school in 5 years;&lt;br/&gt;provide STEM students a seamless
environment of recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising, mentorship, and
research;&lt;br/&gt;provide experiential learning experiences to 90% of the STEM
graduates where students develop independent research
skills.&lt;br/&gt;implement teaching and learning approaches such as: Inquiry
Based Learning, Peer Instruction, and Cooperative Learning to promote student
learning.&lt;br/&gt;
