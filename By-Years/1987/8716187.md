Lake Michigan is being invaded by a predator new to the Nearctic. Bythotrephes
cederstroemii, was first found in the Laurentian Great Lakes in December, 1984.
By August 1986, the species had spread to Southern Lake Michigan, and was
doubling in abundance every 10 days. Bythotrephes is invading aggressively,
particularly in the offshore region, but is so far avoiding habitats occupied by
glaciomarine relict species. As an invading plankton species joining an existing
community, it represents a rare opportunity to study manipulation of a food web
at the middle trophic level. Judging from its persistence and success in deep
European lakes, Bythotrephes will probably become a permanent member of
zooplankton communities in the Nearctic. This proposal seeks to study the
trophic dynamics of this community-level perturbation across the physical and
ecological gradients between inshore and offshore regions.
