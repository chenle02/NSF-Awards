Delaware State University's ADVANCE IT-Start Project targets the following four
goals: (1) Acquire the institution-specific information needed to characterize
and understand the status, challenges, and barriers to participation by women
and underrepresented minorities in STEM, especially among faculty (2) Identify
from other institutions and experts proven best practice strategies for
increasing the participation and advancement of women and URM and implementing
sustainable institutional change. (3) Lay the groundwork for and cultivate
institutional receptivity to institutional transformation that will increase the
participation and advancement of women and URM among DSU's faculty and
leadership. (4) Develop an institutional transformation plan.

Intellectual Merit. The intellectual merit centers on the project's systematic,
multi-dimensional approach of characterizing and understanding the institutional
situation, best practices from other institutions, and the research base, while
in parallel fostering stakeholder buy in to the need and nature of institutional
transformation aimed at dramatically improving the participation and advancement
of women and URM among the STEM faculty. Evaluation is used in a formative
manner to drive project success.

Broader Impacts. This project will set the stage for DSU, a minority-serving
institution (students ~80% black, ~60% female) currently in transition toward
greater research intensity and expanded graduate programs, to design
institutional transformation to improve the participation and advancement of
women and URM STEM faculty. The project also fosters interactions, mentoring,
and networking among women and URM faculty across all STEM disciplines on the
DSU campus and across the broader academic community. Furthermore, the approach
could establish a model for other minority-serving institutions interested in
increasing the presence and advancement of female and URM STEM faculty.
