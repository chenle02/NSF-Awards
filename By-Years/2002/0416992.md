As a Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance Education,
Carnegie Mellon received NSF funding to develop and offer an intensive, month-
long, in-residence summer program to help develop Information Assurance Capacity
Building Program (IACBP) at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The first offerings were highly
successful and made a substantial contribution to the capacity of the partnering
Minority Serving Institutions to educate students in the critical field of IA.
The response from participating MSI faculty members and from their respective
department heads was uniformly and extremely positive, and numerous new IA
courses, modules, and plans for degree programs have been produced. In this
project, Carnegie Mellon builds upon this program and the partnerships developed
through it, and to expand the program to more partnering minority serving
institutions. This project funds the next two offerings (summer of 2004 and
summer of 2005) of the IACBP, with participation by a total of twenty-four
additional faculty members from selected MSIs.
