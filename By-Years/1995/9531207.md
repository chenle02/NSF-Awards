Abstract - Ray - 9531207 More than 70 billion lbs/year of synthetic polymers are
currently produced in the U.S. in a wide variety of polymerization reactors. The
ultimate use of the products from these reactors ranges from synthetic clothing
through automotive structural components and optical disks to latex paints. It
is estimated that the total sales of these materials in the U.S. amount to more
than 100 billion dollars/year. In addition, synthetic polymers provide a
positive export/import balance of more than 6 billion dollars/year. In this
research, the PI plans to make use of detailed models for both homogeneous and
heterogeneous catalytic polymerization reactors to analyze and explain observed
experimental measurements of molecular weight distribution, copolymer
composition, chain branching, tacticity, etc. as well as those results showing
complex dynamic phenomena in continuous reactors. Close comparison of
experimental results and model predictions will be made in order to tune and
validate existing models as well as those now under development. From these
models, the PI expects to predict the range of reactor design parameters for
which undesirable polymer properties and unstable dynamic behavior arise and
experimentally test these predictions in the laboratory. From the results, he
will derive suitable process operating conditions for the desired polymer
properties, high productivity, and safe dynamic operation. After experimentally
testing the new reactor designs which appear to yield acceptable dynamic
behavior and desirable polymer properties, feedback control strategies suitable
for dealing with any remaining dynamic problems will be tested. As part of this
effort, the development and testing of several new on-line polymer
characterization devices is under way. Through these research efforts, the PI
expects to be able to design and control reactors capable of producing a more
uniform and higher quality polymer product.
