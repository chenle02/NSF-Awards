This project bridges three traditionally separated research areas: molecular
spectroscopy, quantum optics and coherent control. The frequency domain quantum
control tool used here differs from the time domain control schemes used in
coherent control. Recently this tool has been used to demonstrate molecular
angular momentum control and to measure with high accuracy the absolute
magnitude of the molecular transition dipole moment matrix element, which plays
a critical role in absorption and emission of light by molecules. The goal of
this project is to develop molecular dynamics applications for the frequency
domain control scheme. In addition to the ongoing research on quantum control,
this project will attempt control of pre-dissociation of molecules, and study
the role of valence electron spin in reactive collisions. This project also
involves research on molecular structure of interest for ultracold molecular
physics. The frequency domain control scheme, combined with a four color
excitation scheme, can be used for state selective transfer of molecular
population to the lowest vibrational levels of the electronic ground state, a
process that is critical for applications involving ultracold molecules in
optical lattices. In addition, the project includes an experimental
determination of the triplet ground state and first excited states potentials of
alkali dimers. These data will be important for research on ultracold molecule
formation.

Broader impacts include the connection with work on ultracold molecules and
providing research opportunities and mentoring for students in molecular quantum
optics. The project will also continue to contribute strongly to broadening the
participation of underrepresented students, both graduate and undergraduate.
