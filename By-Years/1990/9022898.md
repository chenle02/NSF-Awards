Both the theory of environmental regulation and the theory of international
trade generally assume fixed plant locations that are exogenous to policy
changes. The analysis tends to focus on firms' marginal price and output
responses to policy changes, such as emission controls or tariff rates. It is
the nature of these models that responses are small and continuous, implying
that optimal tax or tariff rates can be calculated. However, it is well
understood by policy makers that plants are of discrete size due to scale
economies, and that plant location decisions are endogenous to cost
differentials across regions or countries. Regional and increasingly national
governments are explicitly taking the endogeneity of these location decisions
into account in designing policies which attract firms or which may raise the
costs of local production. To date, economic theory and empirical work has shed
little on these important policy questions. The purpose of this project is to
conduct both a theoretical and empirical analysis of environmental and trade
policies when the location decisions of large manufacturing, utility, or
resource- based plants are endogenous. Attention well be focused on cases where
the firm in question can make choices between politically independent locations,
to allow for the possibility of inefficient political competition between
regions. Non- cooperative outcomes can then serve as a benchmark from which to
evaluate the gains from policy coordination. Models will be constructed to
analyze the effects of trade liberalization between the U.S. and Mexico, and
tougher environmental policies in the U.S. on the North American location of
plants in the auto and chemical industries.
