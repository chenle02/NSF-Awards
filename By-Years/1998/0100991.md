This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The project is focused on
the finite generatedness of algebras-- a fundamental problem of algebra. The
work proposed is to resolve the problem in a certain important class of algebras
(named (FGA)) with the aim to finish the proof of the existence of log flips in
any dimension whenever the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP) and, in particular,
the log terminations hold in the lower dimensions. To apply this inductive step
to the LMMP in dimensions higher than 4 the principal investigator intends to
finish the log termination for 4-folds. This gives the 5-fold log flips, and
establishes the LMMP in dimension 4. A concrete application of this technique
will be done by his student, Jihun Park, in his study of birational geometry of
Del Pezzo fibre spaces, with a view to their existence, uniqueness of their
certain models, and to the birational classification.

This is research in the field of algebra with methods and applications in
algebraic geometry. The finite generatedness corresponds to completeness in
geometry, and effectiveness from the computational point of view. Algebra and
algebraic geometry are very old, traditional areas of modern mathematics, but
which have had a revolutionary flowering in the past century. In its origin,
algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the
simplest equations, namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the
simplest geometric constructions, e. g., conic sections. Algebra is about these
equations. Both fields interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g.,
analysis, topology and mathematical physics, with applications in those fields
as well as in number theory, physics, theoretical computer science, and
robotics.
