This project creates a statewide infrastructure that provides education and
training in network technology for 2-year college and secondary computer
technology faculty that, in turn, enables the implementation of a computer
network management curriculum for 2-year technical students, a related
curriculum for secondary students, and enables the utilization of computer
networks as an instructional tool. Teacher preparation is a significant element
of this program. Many of the students of this program are future K-12 teachers.
They will be well prepared to introduce, teach, and maintain information
technology systems in the K-12 schools. This project will provide the foundation
for a smooth transition from high school to community college in the field of
information technology. The objectives that are designed to accomplish this
purpose are as follows: 1. Establish an approved infrastructure to implement the
training of secondary and post-secondary in local area networks and
telecommunication networks. 2. Educate and train a core of 2-year college
faculty who are qualified to implement an approved networking curriculum for
technical students throughout the state and to utilize computer networks as
instructional tools. 3. Educate and train a core of secondary faculty who are
qualified to teach an networking curriculum for secondary students and to manage
and utilize computer networks for instructional purposes. 4. Provide the
training and resources to use the world wide web as a teaching and learning
resource.
