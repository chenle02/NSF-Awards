9720334 Krishnaprasad The goal of this research project is to investigate time
coding in the central nervous system, specifically the auditory system of the
barn owl, the early development of such codes, the learning of associated maps,
and the exploitation of such sound codes and maps in source localization and
sound separation. The approach consists of electrophysiological and anatomical
study, coupled with mathematical modeling of neural circuitry, the rigorous
investigation of the structure and performance of relevant learning algorithms
and the creation of an experimental robotic testbed. This testbed, a binaural
head, is intended to be capable of orienting itself to sound sources in complex
acoustic environments through pure auditory servoing, by utilizing the
development of control architectures capable of learning maps of the auditory
space of the robot, and drawing upon an evolving understanding of barn owl
auditory system. The results of this research will provide insights into the
design of novel roles for auditory sensing, interpretation and discrimination in
autonomous robotic systems. This research could lead to applications in hands-
free human-machine communications in acoustically cluttered environments and in
monitoring complex environments such as highly automated manufacturing plants.
