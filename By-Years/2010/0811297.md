Proposal CCF-0811297&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Foundations for Control Flow
Analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harry Mairson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A time-bounded
static analyzer can provide information about the runtime behavior of a
computation-intensive program. The proposed research will address new
foundations for control flow analysis of higher-order programs, including the
design and implementation of novel analyzers, and the analysis of known methods
and approximation problems. Using principles of linearity derived from linear
logic, the researchers want to characterize precisely, in computational terms,
the degree to which such static analysis approximates run-time behavior.
Scientific software design ought to be founded on an analytical as well as
practical and pragmatic understanding of the tradeoffs between the running time
of static analyzers, and the accuracy of their computations. The broader impacts
of such a program of research include an increased awareness and understanding
of the feasibility of such compile-time analysis in the work of software
developers. The analytic tools are also amenable to integration in undergraduate
courses on programming language pragmatics and implementation.&lt;br/&gt;
