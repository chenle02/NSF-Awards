The Business Labor Council of Ventura County, an organization formed in 1982
under the authority of the State of California, will work with county schools,
local community colleges, and local businesses to enhance science and
mathematics education programs for non-college-bound students. The county
schools, which have substantial minority enrollments, find these students have
little understanding of how mathematics and science courses will help prepare
them for the job market and avoid these courses even if they do not drop out
before graduation. Local businesses will work with teachers, guidance
counselors, and high school classes in a variety of ways to enhance the
understanding of local job opportunities for non- baccalaureate youth and the
prerequisites for acquiring and succeeding in such jobs. Included in the program
will be joint activities with local community colleges to integrate high school
and community colleges curricula leading to locally needed associate degrees.
Students with aptitude for baccalaureate programs will be encouraged to enter
those, but the primary emphasis will be on routes to good career opportunities
not requiring a baccalaureate degree. Cost sharing by the other partners will
equal 100% of the NSF funding.
