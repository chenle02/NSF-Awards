This project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of NSF Division of
Chemistry, to Professor Vladimir Gevorgyan of the University of Illinois at
Chicago examines the replacement of rare and expensive palladium, rhodium, and
iridium catalysts with abundant and cheap iron and copper complexes (homogeneous
catalysts). The research team develops new methodologies involving nanoporous
metal skeletons (heterogeneous catalysis) and develops highly valuable synthetic
methodologies by taking advantage of low catalyst loadings, low catalyst
leaching, and high catalyst recyclability. The research project includes the
development of iron-catalyzed Heck-type coupling and Wacker oxidation
methodologies, as replacements for classical methods employing expensive and
toxic palladium catalysts. The research also includes examination of oxidative
iron-catalyzed carbon (C)-hydrogen (H)/C-H coupling reactions toward complex
polycyclic molecules. Copper catalysts are studied for diverse C-H
functionalizations as well as the dehydrogenative carboxylations of fused
lactones. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is performed in collaboration with
Professor Yoshinori Yamamoto of the Dalian University of Technology in Dalian,
China and Professor Hans-Joachim Kn√∂lker of the Technical University of Dresden,
in Dresden, Germany. Together, these three groups combine their separate areas
of expertise to provide novel and sustainable catalytic methods for more
straightforward and environmentally-benign pathways toward valuable synthons for
synthetic and medicinal chemistry and material science. The broader impacts of
this work also include leadership training for graduate students and an
international exchange of ideas and expertise.
