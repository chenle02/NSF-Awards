Data from the National Science Foundation-sponsored monitoring sites of
ultraviolet and visible radiation in Antarctica and Barrow, Alaska will be used
to determine the relationship between biologically effective ultraviolet
radiation, ozone abundance and cloud effects. Satellite data on ozone abundance
and cloud properties will be used in a radiative transfer model to compute the
ultraviolet radiation budget at these sites. Comparison with the ground-based
measurements will be made to determine the feasiblity of assessing the
biospheric ultraviolet radiation environment in the polar regions from space.
Climatological estimates of the surface albedo will then be used to assess how
the ultraviolet and visible radiation budget varies with season throughout the
Antarctic and Arctic regions. The relative magnitudes of UVB (280-320 nm), UVA
(320-400 nm), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) will be
assessed as a function of latitude and season and climatological parameters
(turbidity, cloud cover, etc.). Finally, a coupled atmosphere/ocean radiation
model will be used to estimate the amount of ultraviolet and visible radiation
penetrating to various levels in the polar ocean as a function of ocean
productivity.
