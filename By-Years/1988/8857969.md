This action is to recommend a Presidential Young Investigator Award for Dr.
Barbara Smuts. Dr. Smuts has embarked on an outstanding career in which her
research spans at least two major disciplines, anthropology and psychobiology.
Her field research on social relationships in baboons has invigorated and
brought methodological discipline to the study of free-living non-human
primates. This work has been extremely quantitative and sheds light on the study
of human social relationships as well as illuminating evolutionary perspectives
on the functional significance of social interactions. Her current research
investigates the evolutionary relationship between complex social organization
and the intelligence through comparisons of social cognition in chimpanzees and
dolphins. Because humans and apes on the one hand, and the toothed whales on the
other, have evolved large brains and complex societies independently, a
comparative study should provide insights that cannot be obtained by studying
either group on its own. Dr. Smuts is at the forefront of quantitative research
involving social relationships and her work will undoubtedly change the way we
view patterns of friendship, alliance, and cooperation, the existence of long
term affiliations of male and female outside the mating context, and the import
and nature of male-infant relationships.
