9504249 Goodey The proposed research lies in the area of geometric convexity
theory. In particular, the proposer wants to study projection functions for
centrally symmetric convex bodies using the Radon transform techniques. The
projection functions are objects of importance in stereology and tomography. In
particular, they are used in the X-ray problem where the researchers seek to
find efficient algorithms to reconstruct convex bodies from their X-ray images.
