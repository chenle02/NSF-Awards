WV 26506 ILI - Instrumentation Project: Life Sciences Title: A Total Science
Experience Laboratory for Biology Majors The Biology major at West Virginia
University completes a rigorous program of study, including chemistry, physics,
mathematics, statistics, and a linked set of core biology courses followed by at
least five electives. Missing from this curriculum (and most science curricula)
is the opportunity for every undergraduate major to experience the complete
process of being a scientist. This proposal requests equipment to make such
immersion in the process of science possible with the development of a Total
Science Experience laboratory in the final required Biology course for majors;
Ecology and Evolution. The Total Science Experience laboratory is a fifteen week
laboratory unit focused on response of organisms to global and regional
environmental change. In this unit, students: (1) write a pre-proposal and grant
proposal (in response to a Request for Proposals), thereby learning (a) how to
conduct a computer-assisted literature review, (b) how to formulate hypotheses
and objectives, (c) how to design a meaningful experiment to test these
hypotheses, and (d) how to formulate a convincing project plan, (2) write
proposal reviews of other students' proposals and receive mock panel reviews of
grant proposals, with 'funding' of some projects and others being declined (with
invited resubmission), (3) execute their experiments, with full responsibility
for carrying each experiment through to completion, (4) analyze experimental
data, with training on use of advanced s tatistical software, (S) present
results in a special student symposium (posters and oral presentations)
including training on advanced graphics software, and (6) submit a full-length
manuscript to a 'journal,' followed by editorial review and resubmission. A
trial of this laboratory format in Spring semester, 1993 was extremely
encouraging, as students experienced both the excitement and frustrations of
performing original research. Obstacles to implementing this laboratory for the
entire class include insufficient computational power for the statistics and
graphics, and lack of controlled environment conditions to offer students for
their experiments. This project will remove these obstacles and allow full
implementation of the Total Science Experience laboratory.
