This grnat seeks funds to renew support for research and operation of Jicamarca
Radio Observatory (JRO) between January 1 2018 to December 31, 2022. JRO is
situated on the magnetic equator, a prime location for studying the ionosphere
from plasma backscatter. The observatory's main asset is a 50 MHz VHF radar
system with an antenna consisting of 18,432 cross-polarized half-wavelength
dipoles. The antenna system can be subdivided, steered, and attached to up to
four transmitters and sixteen receivers. JRO's exceptional versatility has
defined the facility as a testbed of radio science innovation and
discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The radar measures electron density, electron
and ion temperature, ion composition and vertical and zonal electric fields in
the equatorial ionosphere. JRO also measuring echoes from equatorial
irregularities generated in the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere,
equatorial electrojet, E and F regions. In accordance with guidelines provided
by a number of geospace community documents, the research activities will focus
on topside ionosphere, high-altitude scattering, vertical (perpendicular to B)
measurements, aperature-synthesis imaging, mesosphere-lower thermosphere winds,
and space weather forecasting. JRO will continue its tradition as a center of
training and education for an international community of physics and engineering
students.
