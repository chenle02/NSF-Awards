This preliminary work will test ideas concerning the importance of
recombination signal-sequence directed V(D)J joining of immunoglobulin and
T-cell receptor gene segments in the evolution of immunity and self/non-self
recognition. The immediate goal of the proposal is to develop conditions for
microinjecting artificial recombination signal-sequence directed, DNA
recombination substrates in an in vivo model system, the protochordate,
Botryllus. Botryllus, a colonial tunicate which displays histocompatibility, is
ideally suited for studies of the evolution of major histocompatibility complex
and lymphocyte receptor recognition. Success with this project should have a
major impact. Not only will this study provide information about the evolution
of self/non-self recognition, potentially yielding sequence information for
primordial immunoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor genes, it may also demonstrate
a conserved mechanism, the generation of receptor diversity by gene
rearrangement. Although this project involves a novel approach, the potential
payoff in determining whether the invertebrate to vertebrate transition
involves, or is accompanied by, the acquisition of gene- rearranging machinery
is worth the admittedly high risk.
