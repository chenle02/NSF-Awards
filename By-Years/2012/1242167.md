This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program
entitled, "NUE ASCCEND: Addressing Social Challenges through Creativity,
Engineering, Nanotechnology, and Diversity", at the University of Connecticut
under the direction of Dr. Leslie M. Shor, will create an interdisciplinary
undergraduate engineering concentration in creativity and technical innovation
that is focused on the societal impacts of nanotechnology.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the concentration will be an
interdisciplinary three-course sequence open to all engineers that will be
taught collaboratively by project staff from 5 university programs. These
courses are "Nanoscience and Society", "Managing Creativity and Innovation", and
"Interdisciplinary Senior Design: Nanotechnology". Together the departments of
the project staff represent ~45% of all UConn engineering students including 75%
of female students. ASCCEND will elevate engineering education at UConn and
beyond by placing technology and innovation in a direct social context.
Furthermore, by providing students with specific training in managing creativity
and evaluating technology in interdisciplinary settings, ASCCEND participants
will be more agile and productive members of the evolving global workplace.
