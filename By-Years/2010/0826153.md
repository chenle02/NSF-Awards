Size-dependent ?super-piezoelectricity? in
nanostructures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding for a combined
theoretical and experimental study to understand the emergence of size-dependent
?giant? piezoelectricity in ferroelectric nanostructures. Modeling approaches
ranging from quantum mechanical atomistic calculations to continuum methods will
be employed to understand the basic science underpinning this phenomenon.
Flexure, artificial cracks and indentation based experiments on inhomogeneously
strained nanostructures will be conducted to verify the predictions.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected benefits of the program will be both
educational and societal. Piezoelectricity, the development of electrical
polarization upon mechanical stimulus and thus the conversion of mechanical to
electrical energy, has numerous applications ranging from simple consumer
products such as cell phones to complex technological advancements: atomic force
microscopy, sonars and artificial muscles among many others. Accordingly,
anticipated research outcomes are in next generation sensors and actuators,
energy harvesting, artificial muscles that exhibit simultaneously large motion
and force and an enhanced understanding of how to design multi-functionality.
The educational impact is that both undergraduate and graduate students will be
trained in emerging and interdisciplinary research that falls at the
intersections of materials science, mechanics, and physics. The grant puts
specific emphasis on research experience for high school students and
undergraduate students and in particular female scholars. Research findings will
be incorporated into courses, modules specifically targeted towards grade school
students and broadly disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly
publications, and the PI?s websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
