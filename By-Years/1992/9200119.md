The Palmer Station Antarctic Marine LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) project
provides an excellent opportunity for undergraduate participation in research.
All research within the antarctic marine LTER relates to a central hypothesis:
that interannual variation in the extent of pack ice affects all levels in the
food web, from phytoplankton to apex predators. The LTER and the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates programs have several common objectives which are
achieved by undergraduates participating in research activities. These
objectives include: enhancing undergraduate education, attracting students to
marine science, and training the next generation of scientists. Undergraduates
with an interest in marine sciences will have the opportunity to experience many
aspects of an interdisciplinary project which involves current and evolving
techniques. They will participate both in the field seasons in Antarctica, and
in the laboratory work in universities in the United States. Areas of research
available to REU students who participate in the Palmer antarctic marine LTER
include: remote sensing; hydrographic and optical characteristics of the water
column; phytoplankton physiology and production; distribution and recruitment of
zooplankton and nekton; and analysis of zooplankton and nekton collected by
seabirds. During this experience we expect students to move from a broad
overview and dependent status to narrower focus and independent projects with
their REU advisors.
