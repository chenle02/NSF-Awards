9353467 LaDelle Olion The project includes four historically black public
universities (North Carolina Central University (NCCU), Elizabeth City State
University (ECSU), Fayetteville State University (FSU) and Winston- Salem
University (WSSU), a public university enrolling a substantial number of Native
Americans and blacks (Pembroke State University (PSU), and a public liberal arts
university emphasizing undergraduate research (University of North Carolina at
Asheville (UNCA). These institutions, as members of The University of North
Carolina system have entered into a consortium (North Carolina Consortium for
Undergraduate Research (NCCUR)) to promote the development of institutions-wide
undergraduate research programs, to enhance research activities, and to
implement the Seizing Opportunities for Advancing Research Scholars (SOARS)
Program. The SOARS Program initially will involve twelve (12) undergraduate
students from the six campuses in research projects distributed among six (6)
Undergraduate Research Groups (URGs) directed by faculty researchers selected by
the six Consortium institutions. The research projects available in the 6 URGs
are widely diversified, and all have some form of collaboration with major
research universities in the State of North Carolina.
