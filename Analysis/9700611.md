ABSTRACT DMS-9700611 This project provides partial funding for a US delegation
of 23 mathematicians to participate in the conference entitled "Computational
Methods and Function Theory '97", which will be held in Nicosia, Cyprus during
the period October 13-18, 1997. The general theme of the meeting concerns the
various aspects of interaction between function theory and scientific
computation. The US delegation will consist of senior researchers as well as
junior investigators, chosen so as to achieve a balance between these two areas.
This conference is the third in a series, following CMFT '89 held in Valparaiso,
Chile and CMFT '94 held in Penana, Malaysia. Another common theme of these
meetings is to foster the creation and maintenance of contacts between
scientists from diverse cultures. This is also reflected in the location of the
meeting. Cyprus is an ideal place, traditionally serving as a bridge between
East and West. The US delegation will include 5 new Ph.D.'s who hold great
promise of becoming future leaders in these fields of mathematics.
