Marine acoustic telemetry has advanced our understanding of the behavioral
ecology of marine organisms, but telemetry positional error and limits on the
number of targets that can be tracked simultaneously limit the scale and scope
of research. The PI requests funding to develop a Large-Area High-Resolution
Marine Acoustic Tracking System. This project will develop a prototype of a new
class of marine acoustic telemetry systems (including tags, receivers, and
software) capable of tracking up to 500 targets simultaneously over a large area
(>1km) and with sub-meter accuracy.

Broader Impacts:

The key broader impact is the development of improved telemetry instrumentation
and information for the scientific community. If the system does achieve the
goals of the project it will be a valuable asset to researchers and the
knowledge they generate from its use. This is important because acoustic
telemetry is the future of fish movement studies and its application to
evolutionary and ecology of marine fishes. The second target of broader impact
is graduate and undergraduate training. All of the academic salaries requested
are for a graduate student for 3 years and a shorter period of post-doc support.
This will insure the engagement of a student in the project. Undergrads
attending an associated course at FHL will also have opportunities to be
involved in the project. Outreach is focused on the general public via outreach
infrastructure at Friday Harbor Labs.
