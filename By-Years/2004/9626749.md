Lopez 9626749 The investigator and his colleague study computational aspects of
convex geometry in two directions: (1) Design and implementation of efficient
algorithms for the approximation of convex bodies in multidimensional space by
convex polytopes with a priori specified number of vertices. Specific instances
that arise in various application areas, such as the approximation of polytopes
by smaller polytopes, are given special attention. Extensions, such as
approximation under various metrics, also are considered. (2) Application of
high performance computing to solve or to advance toward the solution of a
number of long-standing problems in convex geometry. An important example is
Mahler's conjecture on the volume-product of a convex body and its polar body.
An instance of this problem with applications to the theory of wavelets is
tackled by reducing the search space to a finite but large set of cases that can
be verified computationally. The investigator and colleague study efficient
computational solutions for the problem of approximating multidimensional convex
bodies by polytopes (solids formed by plane faces) of a prescribed size. Such
approximation is an important tool in many disciplines, including molecular
modeling, optimal control, computer-aided design, pattern recognition, and
computer visualization. Furthermore, due to their simplicity, polytopes are by
far the most widely used form of model representation. Thus, the work is also
important because it facilitates the use of the large body of methods already
available for polytopes, provided that the resulting approximation is good and
can be performed efficiently. Symbolically, long-standing geometric problems are
attacked using the tools of high performance computing. An approach based on
verifying computationally a large but finite number of possible cases promises
to yield an important advance in the field.
