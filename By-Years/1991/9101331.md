Light front meson exchange models for the two-nucleon system which involve
interacting spin operators will be analyzed. The Lee model will be extended to
provide a Poincare' invariant model for the pion-nucleon system and used to
assess the validity of the constituent quark model. A light front reformulation
of a covariant harmonic oscillator will be extended to systems of spin-1/2
particles and used to study the relationships between various relativistic and
non- relativistic hadron quark models. Electromagnetic currents described by
covariant constraint dynamics will be used to calculate form factors and
structure functions for two and three quark systems.
