This research utilized numerical simulations and analytic approximations to
study the physics of gravitational clustering in an effort to understand the
formation of large scale structure in the universe. Topological and percolation
methods will be developed to assist in the application of the ideas developed to
actual observations. Additional studies will investigate whether radiation
pressure could have provided the initial perturbations which led to the
formation of galaxies.
