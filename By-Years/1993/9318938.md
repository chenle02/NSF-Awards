9318938 Engelhardt This award is for support of a one year project to measure,
with high accuracy and wide areal coverage, the velocity field of Rutford Ice
Stream and Pine Island Glacier, using the new technique of satellite radar
interferometry. The Rutford Ice Stream and Pine Island Glacier are both major
outlet glaciers for the West Ant- arctic Ice Sheet. The former flows directly
into the Ronne Ice Shelf while the latter enters the ocean directly. A
comparative study of their behavior will contribute to an understanding of the
mass balance and stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its role in
global climatic change. ***
