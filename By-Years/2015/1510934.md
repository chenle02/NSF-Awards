The principal investigator proposes a new type of material for not only
capturing radiation energy such as that from the Sun but also manipulating the
direction of the energy flow. The research effort combines experiment and
theory, and will test the hypothesis for harvesting energy from mid-infrared
light. The education effort will include (1) K-12 and undergraduate STEM
education, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and (2) Georgia Tech
summer camp activity entitled "Wearing the Sun," where Atlanta area high school
students learn about solar energy harvesting by creating personalized, sunlight-
activated clothing (i.e., T-shirts, etc.), will be enhanced during the proposed
project.

The proposal aims to investigate the mid-infrared localized surface plasmon
resonances (LSPRs) supported in selectively doped Si nanowires by understanding
the structural and synthetic parameters that influence LSPR quality factor and
probing the near-field coupling of neighboring LSPRs. It also seeks to
demonstrate enhanced vibrational mode sensing in thermal radiation hot spots. By
coupling experiment and theory, the PI will test the hypothesis that mid-
infrared light can be confined via doped-Si resonators to the same extent as
visible/near-infrared light in conventional plasmonic materials. The proposed
efforts will develop vapor-liquid-solid nanowire growth to engineer extreme
light localization and transport via precise control of resonator geometry,
carrier density, and spacing, hoping to develop ultra-compact thermal radiation
waveguides, modulators, and detectors.
