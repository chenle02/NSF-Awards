&lt;br/&gt;From Probability to Statistics and Back: &lt;br/&gt;High-Dimensional
Models and Processes Conference &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes
to organize a conference at the interface of &lt;br/&gt;probability, statistics
and biostatistics, and machine learning. The meeting &lt;br/&gt;aims to identify
the new frontiers that can emerge from the interaction of &lt;br/&gt;these
fields. The conference will provide an open forum for discussing
&lt;br/&gt;strategies for creating a workforce for the 21s century that will
continue &lt;br/&gt;to do fundamental research, which is a key element for the
successful &lt;br/&gt;development of the society as a
whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The themes that will be brought together render
uniqueness to this &lt;br/&gt;conference: empirical processes theory, a field of
probability theory; &lt;br/&gt;fundamental areas in statistics and biostatistics
such as the &lt;br/&gt;theory of nonparametric and semiparametric models
&lt;br/&gt;and the theory of shape-constrained estimation; and learning theory.
The &lt;br/&gt;meeting will promote immediate dissemination of the most cutting-
edge &lt;br/&gt;theoretical results in these fields.&lt;br/&gt;
