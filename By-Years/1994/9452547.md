9452547 Plumb This Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement project will equip
a laboratory/classroom and an open laboratory to support curriculum innovation
in Physics courses that focus on Electricity and Magnetism. The curriculum
development activities in Electricity and Magnetism continue the successful
movement toward active student involvement and a heavily observation-based
approach to the teaching of Mechanics. The curriculum development activities
will precede and parallel the offering of a revised Electricity and Magnetism
course in Fall 1994. We will network Macintosh Quadra 660 computers, equipped
with Vernier Universal Lab Interface Boards, to an Apple Workgroup server.
Students will use current and voltage probes, smart pulleys and other
computerized data acquisition devices to construct and/or verify theoretical
models in Electricity and Magnetism.
