The objective of this research is to enable the development of teams of robots,
equipped with vision and other sensors, capable of working alongside humans in
critical missions, such as search and rescue. Key requirements are situational
awareness and coordinated action. The approach is to develop mathematical
frameworks and algorithms to enable such a team of robots to coordinate their
paths, share and analyze their sensor data, maintain communications, and
interact effectively and safely with humans. The project brings together experts
in computer vision, robotics, estimation theory and
controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. Realizing the above goals
will require advances in several inter-related domains. Specifically, the
sensing, estimation, and trajectory control tasks must seamlessly integrate
visual analysis with navigation and control strategies, as well as inputs from
humans. Novel distributed estimation strategies must be developed to accommodate
difficult and dynamic environments. Efficient human-robot coordination
necessitates methodologies for joint exploration and mapping, identifying
important visual information, and robots? operation at different levels of
autonomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The success of this project will
be a major step towards the deployment of teams of robots to assist humans in
dangerous and complex tasks like disaster response. Search-and-rescue experts
will advise the team in developing a prototype system, and evaluating it in
situations that mimic operational conditions. The developed software tools will
be disseminated to other researchers so they can build on the results.
Undergraduates from UCR's highly diverse student population will gain valuable
experience working alongside graduate student researchers.
