This project is studying the feasibility of an Industry/University Cooperative
Center in Monolithic Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits
(MMIC)&gt; It is addressing alternative organizational, policy, and perational
possibilities for such a center. Further, the sutdy will identify research
interests and requirements of potential sponsor companies. It is also
determining if the ultimate goal of becoming self-sufficient with industrial
funding is possible.
