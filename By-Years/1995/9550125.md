9550125 Garrett The Indiana Department of Education's Center for School
Improvement and Performance and the Indianapolis Zoo will collaborate to bring
global change education to Indiana students in grades 4 to 12. The Center and
Zoo will institute a five-phase planning process that will involve scientists,
educators, students, business and community leaders, and the media. Their goal
is to produce an action plan with objectives, recommendations, and strategies to
guide global change education in Indiana. The phases include: 1) forming the
planning team (12 members), 2) holding monthly meetings (Jan. to May) of the
planning team to plan symposium activities, 3) convening the Indiana Global
Change Education Symposium in June (100 participants), 4) drafting the Action
Plan, 5) circulating, revising, and disseminating the Action Plan. Cost sharing
is 55% and consists of in-kind costs made by the Zoo.
