About 1000 students enroll in Introductory Biology Laboratory II every year. For
most of them, this is the last formal scientific instruction they will have and
the last chance scientists have to produce scientifically literate citizens.
This project can improve students' understanding of, and attitude toward,
science by allowing them to do science; specifically, by developing two process-
driven introductory biology laboratory exercises that emphasize experimentation.
The new exercises replace traditional content-driven dissection exercises. The
project also can increase students' appreciation of other organisms, thus
promoting responsible stewardship, by using a variety of live fishes in one
exercise and a variety of bird and frog calls in the other exercise. The two new
laboratories incorporate physics, mathematics, and computer technology into the
course. New computer data acquisition systems detect and measure electrical
emissions of fish with an active electric sense and detect and analyze frog and
bird calls.
