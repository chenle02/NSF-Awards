9352033 Toot An image processing facility is being used in an observatory for
introductory astronomy laboratories. Five telescopes, ranging in diameter from 9
to 32 inches, serve as an excellent base for efforts to expose science students
and non-scientists alike to both the practical side and the beauty of
observational astronomy. However, in a desire to convey the quantitative aspects
of astronomy more fully, as well as to show the current state of the field, more
on electronic image acquisition and analysis is being included. Our experience
with a relatively inexpensive CCD (the ST-6 from Santa Barbara Instruments
Group) convinces us that this goal can be accomplished on a relatively small
budget while maintaining quantitative rigor. A useful and innovative program can
be put in place with a second of these CCD's and the installation of a computer
laboratory so that students can be taught the appropriate software efficiently
and also have access to the computers for data analysis. Using a set of projects
which demonstrate the importance of quantitative measurements, while at the same
time allowing for a wide range of mathematical skills, students can obtain a
valuable exposure to the workings of modern science. ***
