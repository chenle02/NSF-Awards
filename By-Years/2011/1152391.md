This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates a low
cost, high efficiency portable power system called the QM Power ?PoD?? (Power on
Demand). The PoD will power handheld consumer electronic devices (cell phones,
tablets, laptops etc) utilizing a rechargeable battery and an advanced,
mechanical energy generator system. QM Power, in conjunction with development
partner Dell Engineering Services, will complete the design, analysis,
prototyping and system integration of its generator technology into the PoD and
will evaluate various accessories which allow the user to input mechanical
energy via a crank, gravity assist mechanism or other methods. Research results
from the Phase I effort indicate that utilizing QM Power generator technology in
an auxiliary power/recharging system has the potential to reduce human input
requirements by over 30% compared to state-of-the-art product offering now
available. The broader impacts of this research are that the PoD will enable
users to obtain critical power on demand and provide substantial environmental
and public benefits (reducing grid dependence, disposable battery issues and
providing power to emerging markets that lack access). Mobile devices have
become increasingly power hungry while advances in battery energy density have
not kept pace. As a result, the length of use, mobility, and ease use of these
devices have been hampered. The QM Power PoD is designed as a hybrid, auxiliary
power pack solution that combines a longer life rechargeable battery solution
with a supplementary source of renewable, on-demand power that does not require
access to the grid.
