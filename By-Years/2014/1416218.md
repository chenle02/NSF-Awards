Plasma acceleration is a cutting-edge technique for accelerating charged
particles such as electrons using the electric field associated with a plasma
structure, such as an electron plasma wave. The plasma structure is created
using either ultra-short laser pulses or particle beams. This technique offers a
way to build high performance particle accelerators of much smaller size than
conventional accelerator techniques. The goal of this award is visualizing
evolving plasma wakefield accelerator structures generated by intense GeV
electron bunches. The single-shot visualization and control techniques developed
and refined through this research can impact a wide cross section of plasma
science. The visualization of electron beam driven wakes will support
development of "plasma afterburners", an emerging technology for doubling the
energy of conventional linear colliders. These methods will also promote more
reliable tabletop plasma-based accelerators, which are useful as compact
coherent x-ray sources for biological, chemical, and medical research, injectors
for conventional accelerators, and medical accelerators. Finally the proposed
research will train a research associate, a Ph.D. student, and an undergraduate
from UT-San Antonio, which ranks 4th in the nation in number of undergraduate
degrees awarded to Hispanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed award will
provide the first direct laboratory visualization of electron-beam driven plasma
wakes, and will advance new, unique approaches to visualizing rapidly evolving
relativistic electron-beam-plasma interactions that the PI pioneered. They will
complement, benchmark and validate computer simulations in understanding the
physics of electron-beam driven wakes, and in developing strategies to optimize
and scale plasma wakefield accelerators.
