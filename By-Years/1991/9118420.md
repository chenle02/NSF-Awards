This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Dr. Senol Utku, of Duke University,
to Japan to do a survey of recent Japanese developments in adaptive structures.
Dr. Utku will first attend the Second Joint Japan-U.S. Conference on Adaptive
Structures at Nagoya, then spend a week visiting related Japanese industrial and
academic research institutions working on adaptive structures and their control,
and finally attend the International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems,
in Osaka, to discuss the use of adaptive structures as mechan- ical manipulators
in space construction.
