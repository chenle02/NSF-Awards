This grant examines the electronic structure of several binary metallic alloy
systems, concentrating on the Cu-Au, Ag-Mg, and Fe- Ni systems. A combination of
ultra-violet and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies and first principles
electronic structure and photocurrent calculations are employed. Order-disorder
and the relationship between electronic configuration and magnetism are
explored. The selected alloy systems have intermetallic compounds with long-
period superlattice structures. Energy bands are mapped in ordered and
disordered CuAu and AgMg using angle-resolved photoemission measurements. In the
Fe-Ni system large changes in magnetic properties occur with composition and
structure changes. %%% New insights into the electronic structure of metallic
alloys should result from the research. The alloys selected are of interest from
their intermetallic compound formation and/or their magnetic properties.
