The study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos has had significant applications to a
large variety of disciplines in science and engineering. The research component
of this proposal focuses on one problem: nonlinear digital communication with
chaos, which is of fundamental importance in science, and has significant
applications to digital communication that plays an extremely important role in
a modern economy and in national security. Specifically, we plan to investigate
the fundamental theory of utilizing chaos to transmit digital information for
communication and to develop practical algorithms for designing chaotic
information sources. The potential advantages of nonlinear digital communication
devices include greater efficiency, light weight, compactness, greater
information-bearing capacity, greater number of communication channels, low-cost
manufacturing, low probability of interception and detection. The education
component emphasizes on vigorous and innovative methods of undergraduate and
graduate teaching, and solid training of graduate students on research. This NSF
Career Award, which is supported by the Division of Physics and the Experimental
Program to Simulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program in Kansas, will
provide a supporting base for initiating an important new area in frontier
interdisciplinary science. The PI's long-term career goal is to establish a
strong research and education program on nonlinear science at the University of
Kansas.
