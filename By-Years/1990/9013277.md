This research is directed at efficient high speed signal processing algorithms
and architectures and includes theoretical study as well as conceptual design
and simulation. In particular, wavelet transforms and related techniques for
generalized harmonic analysis of data at multiple resolutions are considered.
The relationship between time-frequency representations such as a Wigner-Ville
Distribution and the wavelet time-scale representations are being explored. The
time-scale representations are applied to areas such as parameter estimation,
spectral estimation, signal estimation and enhancement.
