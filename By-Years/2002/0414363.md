SGER: A NEW TEMPORAL-SPATIAL DISLOCATION SOURCE MODEL

ABSTRACT

This study proposes to develop and validate a new concept of temporal-spatial
pulse representation for nine couples for seismic moment tensor, which can be
used to model various dislocation sources such as seismic source rupture and
material crack mechanism. The proposed representation can intrinsically
integrate the spatial and temporal features of the sources, which is sound in
comparison with the traditional approach with the use of two separate factors,
i.e., one from the spatial-based couples and the other from a source time
function that is typically assumed and thus not fully inherent to the temporal
features of the source. Successful accomplishment of the project will not only
improve understanding of temporal-spatial mechanism of the dislocation sources.
It will also have broad impacts such as diagnosing crack damage in structural
health monitoring, simulating earthquake motion for structural design/retrofit,
conducting seismic survey for oil/gas exploration, and assessing influences of
explosions in structures.
