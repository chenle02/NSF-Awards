9600429 Mohapatra The particle theory group of the University of Maryland will
host the Fourth International Conference on Supersymmetry, Supergravity, and
Superstrings, SUSY `96, from May 29, 1996 through June 1, 1996. About six
sessions covering theoretical developments in the areas of the minimal
supersymmetric model and its tests, supersymmetric grand unification and
attempts to understand quark and lepton masses, supersymmetric QCD and duality,
and neutrino masses and cosmology are being planned. An additional two to three
sessions will deal with experimental results from existing searches for
supersymmetry, data on top quarks, searches for neutrino masses and dark matter.
