Biomechanics is a field of applied mechanics which has application to many
areas, including physiology, medicine, surgery, biotechnology, bioprocess
engineering, and virtually all facets of health care technology. As a result,
the various research projects worked on by biomechanicians represent a widely
scattered and diverse set of topics, but ones held together by a certain
universality in the basic principles of mechanics being applied. With this in
mind, the specific aims of this 3rd U.S. China-Japan Conference on Biomechanics
is to provide a forum for the following: l. to review and compare progress in
these three countries in the field of biomechanics; 2. to assess future
directions for biomechanics research in each country; 3. to encourage the
development of collaborative biomechanics research of a binational type; and 4.
to foster relationships between biomechanicians in the three countries so as to
facilitate the above.
