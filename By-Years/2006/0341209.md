This project team is developing a textbook on the radio frequency aspects of
wireless technology and an electronic archive containing photographs, videos,
and simulations related to wireless. The project involves collaboration with the
Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC) and uses their existing modules as a
starting point. The PI is using the textbook material to teach a senior elective
course at his institution, and that group of student is being studied in the
evaluation process. An expert evaluation team at the PI's institution is
designing and conducting the evaluation. Dissemination of the textbook is being
done through the GWEC with its 60 or so institution members.
