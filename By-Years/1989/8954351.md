A seven day workshop is being offered by the physics department faculty for
twenty-five undergraduate physics faculty members selected from postsecondary
institutions in Puerto Rico. The program is enhancing the knowledge and
experience of undergraduate faculty members on computer methods in physics
instruction in order that they may incorporate their increased knowledge and
experience in their undergraduate teaching. The methodology consists of hands-on
computer programming methods and numerical analysis experience, using eleven
representative exercises selected from classical and quantum physics, to
familiarize the physics faculty with different types of numerical and analysis
techniques. The program participants are being supplied with programs, manuals,
instructional materials, and software of all topics covered. The main numerical
methods being employed are Euler's method, the Newton-Raphson technique, and the
Pade approximation procedure. The workshop is stimulating creativity and
innovation in the teaching of physics at the undergraduate level with the result
that talented undergraduate students will have a better understanding of physics
and be attracted to a career in the physical sciences.
