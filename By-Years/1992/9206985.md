The Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania State University will
purchase a computational server to be dedicated to the support of research in
the mathematical sciences. Primary attributes of this server are fast floating
point and integer performance, large main memory and swap space, and high
quality color graphics. Particular research projects which are proposed are four
in numerical solution of partial differential and fluid dynamics-fast solvers
for the water wave equations, numerical study of mixed finite element methods,
computation of free-surface flows, and multigrid and domain decomposition
methods for large scale computations-and one in computational number theory
based on the AXIOM symbolic manipulation package-symbolic manipulation in number
theory and combinatorics.
