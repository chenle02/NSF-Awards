Small-scale, near-equatorial instabilities are not resolved in ocean models, but
their role in developing and maintaining large-scale currents is very important.
This examination of equatorial inertial instability will significantly improve
the understanding of the role that the instability plays in the destabilization
and equilibration of ocean currents in equatorial regions. New theories will
also be developed to help advance our knowledge in inertial instability in the
near-equatorial regions. By studying these instabilities, their effects can be
predicted and, hence, be parameterized in ocean models. Improvement in ocean
modeling can have important impact on climate research because of the essential
role that the equatorial ocean plays in controlling the climate.

A comprehensive study of symmetric instability of parallel shear flows for the
equatorial beta-plane will be conducted by incorporating the full Coriolis force
with a focus on the stratified fluid cases. Results will be contrasted with the
commonly used traditional beta-plane approximation. The potentially extremely
rapid downward mixing resulting from the instability with the 'true' Coriolis
force suggests that the traditional approximation is a very poor one. Under
terrestrian circumstances the horizontal scales are disturbingly small and
therefore never resolved in global ocean circulation models. The correct
redistribution of momentum, downward buoyancy flux and energy dissipation are
thus not accurately accounted for. This research will help in determining the
correct parameterizations of these processes.
