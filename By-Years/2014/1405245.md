A leading theoretic candidate to unify all the forces in nature is string
theory. The string-theoretic model of the universe is ten-dimensional, our usual
four-dimensional space-time together with a very small six-dimensional space
called a Calabi-Yau manifold. Such a small internal space will affect our space-
time through certain mathematical quantities such as Gromov-Witten invariants.
The computation of these invariants has been a central problem in geometry and
physics. The current project envisages development of a theoretical framework as
well as technical tools to compute Gromov-Witten
invariants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past twenty years, there has been a
great deal of interaction between mathematics and physics. Various
correspondences or dualities from physics have had great impact in mathematics.
One of these correspondences is the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence. A
related discovery from physics is that the generating function for Gromov-Witten
invariants should be a quasi-modular form, a number theoretic object. This
project aims to develop a comprehensive program to establish Landau-
Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and modularity of Gromov-Witten theory in
mathematics. One important application is to compute Gromov-Witten invariants of
compact Calabi-Yau manifolds, a central and still difficult problem in geometry
and physics. The project is interdisciplinary in nature; both physical and
mathematical ideas play essential roles. The project also involves training of
postdocs and students.
