The origin of eukaryotes, organisms with distinct subcellular structures
isolated by membranes, is a significant discussion in evolutionary biology. If
Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic domains of life, then a core of eukaryotic
signature proteins, having no detectable homology to known prokaryotic proteins
should exist. Using both sequence-and sequence/structure based methods, this
proposal will examine the phylogenetic origins of eukaryotic proteins. From
initial students a preliminary candidate list of proteins has been assembled.
Confirming or denying the membership of a protein or protein domain in the set
is the goal of this work. Some of the required software, particularly Bayesian
prior-based profiles and domain dissection tools have been begun. These will be
refined for use in remote homology, where sequence similarity has virtually
disappeared. The results of this study, which will be accessible in publication
and web, will provide data to inform and constrain the theories about the
origins of eukaryotes and the mechanisms of expansion of the eukaryotic
proteome.
