9728444 Harrison While atmospheric composition has often been considered to be a
constant, recent studies have demonstrated that atmospheric oxygen and carbon
dioxide concentrations have varied substantially. In particular, geologic
studies have suggested that the giant insects of the late Paleozoic coincided
with atmospheric oxygen levels which exceed today's levels by at least 50%,
leading to the suggestion that giant insects may have been made possible by this
greater availability of oxygen. This leads logically to the proposition that the
body size of today's insects are limited by atmospheric oxygen availability.
This research will test predictions from this hypothesis. Specifically, the
possibility that the safety margin for oxygen delivery decreases with increasing
body size in insects will be tested. The experiments will be conducted using the
American locust as models, because this insect: (1) reaches a large adult size,
(2) varies widely in body size during development, and (3) has a well-studied
respiratory physiology.
