This three-year award supports continuation of a US-France cooperative research
project involving Stephen L. Campbell, North Carolina State University, Francois
Delebecque and Ramine Nikoukhah, at the French National Institute for Research
in Information Science and Applied Mathematics (INRIA), Rocquencourt and Rennes,
France. The objectives of this project are to develop algorithms for implicitly
modeled dynamical systems and a computer environment employing symbolic, graphic
and numerical software for analysis of the algorithms. The current project
extends previous work on stabilization, optimization and trajectory tracking of
constrained mechanical systems. The new research focuses on design, failure
detection, estimation and fault isolation in control systems. These are
important issues for industry. The US investigator brings to this collaboration
expertise in numerical and analytical mathematics. This is complemented by
French expertise in computer design, control and failure detection.
