This research will be directed at finding the theoretical foundation for
transport and recombination of photoexcited charges in disordered systems such
as amorphous and vitreous semiconductors, organic semiconductors and polymers.
Competition between recombination and diffusion of nonequilibrium carriers and
between radiative and nonradiative mechanics of recombination are central
problems to this theory. The temperature dependence of charge transport and
recombination is explored under conditions of low and high electric fields, low
and high frequencies and different excitation intensities. The theoretical work
will be tested against experimental data on amorphous semiconductors. ***
