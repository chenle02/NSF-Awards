This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
explore novel medical diagnostic methods based on the detection of volatile
compounds in expired breath. Non-invasive medical diagnostics are clearly
preferable to invasive testing whenever possible. Breakthroughs in biotechnology
and instrumentation hold the key to a major expansion in non-invasive methods.
Detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath is a non-invasive
testing method that has the potential to allow diagnosis of a broad range of
human and animal health-related issues quickly and inexpensively. Current state-
of-the-art techniques for detecting VOCs in breath are slow, expensive,
laboratory-based, and require extensive operator expertise to collect and
analyze the data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of
employing previously developed proprietary technology to develop a portable,
easy-to- operate, miniature mass spectrometer (MMS) that will provide a real-
time, automated, highly sensitive, low cost, and reliable method for detecting a
broad range of breath VOCs in point-of-care or field settings.

The commercial applications of this project cover a broad range of markets. The
proposed instrument could be used in biochemical and medical research labs, in
clinical labs and hospitals, in workplaces, at contaminated environmental sites,
and at military installations and battlefields.
