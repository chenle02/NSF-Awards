A ground based network of wind measuring interferometers can provide a much
needed temporal monitor of the thermodynamics of the terrestrial mesosphere and
thermosphere that will both complement and supplement similar measurements from
the NASA TIMED spacecraft. Ground studies of the tidal behaviour of the upper
atmosphere provide details of the amplitude and phase of semi-diurnal and
diurnal tides which will complement global satellite observations of the extent
of such tides. Ground studies of the development of geomagnetic storms will
supplement those from space describing the spatial extent of the storms. The
objectives of these ground studies are to provide important new information to
further understand the energetics and dynamics of the MLTI region of the Earth's
atmosphere during the two year mission of TIMED.
