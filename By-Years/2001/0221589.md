This proposal describes an inter-institutional IGERT program in soft materials
to be offered jointly at City College of CUNY and Columbia University, which are
in close proximity. De Gennes defines soft materials as organic media that
organize on supramolecular length scales via weak associative interactions.
Examples include thin polymeric films for sensors, organic blends for electronic
displays, and natural and artificial tissue, spanning the range from complex
fluids to soft solids. They are intrinsically multi-scale, molecular to
macroscopic. A stunning variety of structures and morphologies can emerge,
enabling a wide range of new technologies, and all scales impact processing and
use. The Ph.D. program will be built around joint seminars, an industrial
internship, collaborative thesis research, and a core of joint course offerings,
including two new laboratory courses. The research will be in three
complementary areas: effects of confinement on polymer statics and dynamics,
chemical and physical patterning, and multi-scale phenomena in bio-related
materials. The proposed core curriculum will be taken in addition to the core
disciplinary requirements in the student's major department. Our proposal is
consistent with existing Ph.D. requirements for all five participating
departments, and does not add in any way to the degree requirements or faculty
teaching loads; the soft materials courses will satisfy existing elective
requirements, but will enable the students to focus these electives within a
coordinated program. The proposed collaborative program is unique in two
respects: First, it leverages the intellectual and material resources of two
neighboring, urban, public/private institutions with complementary faculty and
diverse student bodies. Second, it creates a unique, synergistic environment for
research and graduate education in a niche area that is at the heart of numerous
technologies essential to industries based in the greater New York regional
area.

IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S.
Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the
technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and
training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fifth year of the program, awards
are being made to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span
the areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.
