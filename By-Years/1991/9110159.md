The primary goal of this project is to create and expand research on efficient
algorithms, both sequential and parallel, on partial k- trees, a family of
graphs which is the subject of extensive study of late. The project covers
design of new and efficient algorithms for partial k-trees and sequential and
parallel implementations of some of these algorithms. The approach is based on
solid foundations of a linear-time methodology (a systematic design tool) and
not based on the traditional, ad hoc method for designing algorithms. The
project outlined here is significant in the following ways: 1. The project will
address several outstanding issues in the design of combinatorial algorithms for
partial k-trees. 2. This research will act as a catalyst for research in
parallel algorithmic aspects of work being done on graph minors. 3. On the
practical side, this research is expected to shed light on the performance of
mutually competing approaches to solving problems on partial k-trees.*//
