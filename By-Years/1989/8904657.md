This project represents an opportunity for US scientists to again cooperate
with scientists from Australia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, New
Zealand, Norway, Panama, Sweden, Switzerland, Venezuela, and West Germany in the
second epoch measurements in a global satellite tracking network and the first
major GPS network in Central and South American (CASA). Funding for the
measurements will again be from scientific agencies in all 13 countries
including contributions for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, German Geodetic
Research Institute, Munich, the Colombian Geological Survey and Geographic
Institute. Preliminary solutions for the 1988 North Andean data are consistent
and repeatable at the levels predicted from convariance analyses. Sub-centimeter
level precision has been achieved on baselines up to 300 km in length. Results
are expected to be improved further with carrier phase ambiguity resolution and
multi-day orbit determination. The North Andean sites have been surveyed into
existing first-order geodetic networks. Precise satellite orbits will be
calculated at the Center for Space Research in Austin.
