With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at Eastern Illinois University will acquire a 400 MHz
NMR Spectrometer for solutions and solids. This equipment will enable
researchers to carry out research on biological systems, isomerism of
Organometallic complexes, and organic syntheses projects.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic
chemistry and biochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;
