The purpose of this planning grant is to initiate a program of research
examining the influence of situational status-defining roles on cognitive,
affective, and behavioral dynamics of intergroup dyadic interactions.
Specifically, this research explores how situational status impacts dyadic
interactions between members of traditionally stigmatized groups (African
Americans and women in workplace contexts), and members of traditionally
nonstigmatized groups (White Americans and men). Three distinct dyadic types
emerge from combinations of situational and socio-cultural status: status-
congruent, status-reversed, and equal-status. The studies provide an initial
foray into the impact of these three dyadic types on an important dynamic of
intergroup relations: intergroup attitudes. Previous research and theory make
conflicting predictions about how these dyadic types affect the attitudes of
members of dominant groups regarding the stigmatized outgroup. The research
examines whether explicitly endorsed attitudes moderate the effects of dyadic
type, and possibly, therefore, resolve current discrepancies in the literature.
Nonverbal behavioral correlates of the effects of status-congruent, equal-
status, and status-reversed interactions on automatic attitudes are also
investigated. These planning activities are expected to launch a program of
research, investigating the influences of structural factors (such as
interaction roles) and motivational factors (such as interaction goals) on
multiple dynamics of intergroup dyadic interactions. The findings will help our
understanding of intergroup conflict, as well as elucidate pitfalls in current
approaches to prejudice reduction.&lt;br/&gt;
