Downhole measurements and logging have proven to be an essential component of
the scientific operations of the Ocean Drilling Program. One of the most
significant scientific successes of the first two years of ODP has been the
extensive programs of downhole geophysical measurements conducted during Legs
102, 109, and 111 in holes that penetrate deep into the oceanic crust. Data from
these holes has been used to resolve the physical, chemical, and hydrogeological
state of the oceanic crust and allow data on samples from the hole to be
extrapolated to the regional scale. The present award will support Dr. Becker at
the University of Miami to undertake a series of hydrogeology experiments during
the next two years of drilling. The experiments include a drillstring packer
which allows sections of the hole to be isolated and examined for fluid flow; a
large-scale resistivity experiment to examine electrical properties of crustal
rock; and, flowmeter experiments to monitor fluid flow into crustal holes. These
experiments will provide essential data on the basic properties of the crust
(permeability, porosity, and pore pressure) which control the movement of
crustal fluids in the oceanic crust.
