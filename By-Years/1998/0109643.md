The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this awards to
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. With this award, Professors Leonard Interrante
and Thomas Apple will synthesize and study linear and hyper-branched
polycarbosilanes with alternating silicon and carbon atoms in their backbone.
Basic reaction chemistry and characterization of carbosilanes based functional
polymers including worm-like dendrimers, copolymers, block copolymers and ionic
conducting polymers will be carried out with this award. Determination of
structure function relationship by solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,
preparation of thin films and determination of ionic conductivity will be parts
of this award. Pyrolysis of polycarbosilanes and polycarbosilane-boronitrides
will be evaluated to prepare novel ceramics with controlled microstructures.
Graduate and undergraduate students, who will be working on this project, will
get training in synthesis of polymer precursors, synthesis of polymers based on
carbosilanes, functionalization and characterization of these polymers.
