This project is to set up a high resolution computer graphics and image
processing microcomputer laboratory. Using IBM PC/AT's as workstations connected
by a local area network to a Cyber 170 computer, students will be able to apply
various techniques of solid modeling, shading, animation and surface texturing.
A slow-motion video tape recorder will be used to record images a frame at a
time, which, when played back at normal speed will give the sensation of motion.
