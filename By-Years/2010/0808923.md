The Analytical and Surface Chemistry (ASC) program of the Division of Chemistry
will support the research program of Prof. John Conboy of the University of
Utah. Prof. Conboy and his students will study the origin of phospholipid
asymmetry in simple model membrane systems. Compositional asymmetry in the lipid
membrane is thought to play a crucial role in membrane structural stability,
intercellular signaling, and the organization of membrane-associated components.
Prof. Conboy and his students will use sum frequency vibrational spectroscopy
(SFVS) to directly measure the trans bilayer movement of phospholipids and
asymmetry in a variety of membrane models to determine the rate of exchange of
native phospholipids. SFVS will also be used to measure membrane asymmetry,
kinetics of transmembrane migration, and thermodynamic analysis of the
transition state barrier to migration. Success of the proposed studies will have
wide-reaching implications in molecular and cellular biology. The study will
provide excellent educational training opportunities for graduate students and
postdoctoral trainees in a highly multidisciplinary research area involving the
development and application of state of the art no-linear spectroscopic methods
in complex biological systems.
