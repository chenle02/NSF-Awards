This study will focus on the regional metamorphism and deformation of
Precambrian basement rocks in the central Transantarctic Mountains of
Antarctica. These rocks are significant because they comprise some of the only
high-grade basement terrains exposed in the Transantarctic Mountains which
represent a part of the ancient East Antarctic craton. As such, their
petrogenesis and tectonic evolution are important for a better understanding of
how the paleo-Antarctic craton evolved and how the supercontinent Gondwana
formed. The position of these rocks near the edge of cratonal West Antarctica
provides a unique opportunity to study the relation between the tectonic
elements of the Archaen and Proterozoic shield, and younger crustal elements
formed along a convergent Antarctic plate boundary. This integrated study of
deformed Precambrian metamorphic terrains will involve: 1) detailed field
geologic mapping and sampling; 2) structural, microstructural, kinematic and
fabric analysis; 3) metamorphic petrology and quantitative geothermobarometry
involving both major element exchange and oxygen isotope techniques; and 4)
isotopic geochronometry. The duration of the proposed project is three years,
including field seasons during the first two years.
