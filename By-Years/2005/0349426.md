In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division, Prof. L.-S. Wang of Washington State University will conduct
a research program to investigate a variety or atomic clusters, chemisorbed
clusters, and solution- phase species in the gas phase by photoelectron
spectroscopy. Two techniques will be used to prepare these species: 1) Laser
vaporization in a supersonic cluster source that produces atomic- and
chemisorbed clusters; 2) use of an electrospray source that transports solution
phase anions into the gas phase. The investigations will focus on small clusters
of gold and other 4d and 5d transition metal clusters, on CO and O2 chemisorbed
on well characterized gold clusters, on coinage metal cyanide clusters, and on
the electronic structures chains of small clusters of cyanide molecules. In
addition, studies will be undertaken of singly and multiply charged transition
metal cyanide complexes and of multiply charged polynuclear ligated metal
clusters. A search will be undertaken for gaseous zwitterions from amino acid-
halide anion complexes. This research will be conducted with the assistance of
postdoctoral research associates, and graduate and undergraduate students.
