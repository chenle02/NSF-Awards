The interdisciplinary Graphics, Visualization & Usability (GVU) Center engages
in teaching and research programs focusing on making computers accessible and
usable by everyone. This focus is vital to the continuing growth of the
computing industry and hence our national competitiveness, is an essential
requirement for success in several Grand Challenges, an can enhance the
productivity of workers. The Center draws on faculty from the College of
Computing, Psychology, Industrial and Systems, engineering, and several other
academic units. Among these three enumerated units, we offer seventeen courses
in the filed of human interface design. Of the 34 faculty associated with
interface design, collaborative work, interactive tutoring systems, multimedia,
user interface software, information presentation, design of complex user-
computer interfaces, virtual environments and algorithm animation. We believe
our Center is the largest such interdisciplinary group in an academic setting in
the HCI area. Trainees will be enrolled in any of the Ph.D. programs of the
College of computing, ISyE or Psychology, depending on their background and
interest. They will be supported to work with any of the HCI faculty in the
interdisciplinary environment provided by the GVU Center.
