Due to their proven technology, reciprocating-type compressors dominate the
compressed air machinery market. The rotary vane concept offers potential
advantages over the reciprocating type. However, key technology advances are
necessary to make the rotary vane design competitive with the reciprocating
design. Foremost among these is the solution of the vane wear problem. This
project addresses this issue and researches vane material, vane tip lubrication,
and vane tip geometry. These results will be incorporated into a prototype
compressor design which will be tested and compared with analytical models.
Improvements will be made when indicated and a manufacturing prototype will be
developed.
