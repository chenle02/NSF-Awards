Polyethylene glycol/dextran solutions are used to induce formation of two
aqueous phases in the presence of a protein mixture. Preferential partitioning
between the phases results in separation of the protein components. An
electrical field is applied to the solution to accelerate the separation of the
two phases which form and to cause a further separation of proteins within the
same phase. This project combines two of the most promising technologies for
large-scale purification of biological compounds, a step critical to the
commercialization of biotechnology. The combination seems to address a principle
scale-up problem in electrophoresis, namely, the mixing which arises as thermal
convection occurs; the interface between the phases is a barrier to convection,
and the increased viscosity of the phases also dampens natural convection. The
combination also addresses a limitation of aqueous two phase separations, the
slow rate of separation of the phases, which has required the use of expensive
centrifuges in the past.
