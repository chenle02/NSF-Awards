This project involves the acquisition of a Siemens X-Ray Diffractometer system
and associated equipment to complete the development of a state-of-the-art
facility in x-ray diffraction and electron optical methods which are non-
destructive techniques commonly used in the characterization of structure,
physical state, stress, and texture of materials. This project will
significantly enhance the materials analysis capabilities of the undergraduate
laboratory. Experiments have been developed which highlight basic principles
such as phase diagram determination of alloys, phase characterization of
superconducting oxides, texture development, and analysis of cold worked and
annealed metals, phase analysis of corroded materials and corrosion by-products,
amorphous materials, polymers and composites, and laser melted metals. The
equipment will be used by a total of 1,465 students per year. The laboratory
will be the only such facility in the entire campus and will also serve as a
regional center for faculty and students from smaller colleges and junior
colleges.
