This project will support this development of equilibrium electrophoresis
equipment. These devices will test a variety of methods which may be used to
determine concentration distribution. Once developed the methodology and
instrumentation should permit the scientific community to explore the nature,
role, and effect of charges on macromolecules as they effect the Kinetics and
thermodynamics of inorganic, organic, and biochemical systems.
