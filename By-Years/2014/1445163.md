The 72nd Device Research Conference will be held at held at the University of
California, Santa Barbara from held June 22 to 25, 2014, and will address
research areas in the field of semiconductor electronic and optical devices
including novel device concepts. It is one of the few conferences where the
latest results are presented and discussed in a relatively open format. This
conference will foster advances in the leading research on various types of
semiconductors, by gathering a diverse group of experts, researchers and
students. DRC gathers the brightest members of the research community under an
interactive, intellectually stimulating meeting. The program provides the
opportunity for scientific exchanges and discussions. There are approximately 10
