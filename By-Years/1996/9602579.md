9602579 Shore This award will support the travel of the principal investigator,
Professor Richard Shore, Department of Mathematics, Cornell University, and two
junior investigators, Professor Peter Cholak, Department of Mathematics,
University of Notre Dame, and Professor Andre Nies, Department of Mathematics,
University of Chicago, to New Zealand over a three year-period. In New Zealand,
they will work with colleagues in the logic groups at Victoria University,
notably Professor Rodney Downey, and at Auckland University, including Dr.
Bakhadyr M. Khoussainov who recently took up his position after serving as an
Assistant Professor at Cornell University. They will each work on a number of
topics in recursion theory united by a common theme of studying how computation
interacts with various areas of logic, mathematics and computer science. Most of
the work will be done by applying the methods of computability theory such as
the priority method and other tools of logic such as the coding theories to the
study of effectiveness issues in other mathematics settings. This project
combines the strengths of three of the leading U.S. groups in logic with one of
the leading centers of logic research in the Pacific Basin at Victoria
University in Wellington.
