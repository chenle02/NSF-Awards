Funds are provided to sponsor an open workshop to develop a research plan for
integrating studies of the Arctic Ocean shelves with the Central Basin. A goal
of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (OAII)
global change research program is to foster the integration of various
disciplines into cooperative research efforts that are relevant to understanding
the effects of global change. Research has demonstrated the importance of
determining Arctic continental shelf/ocean basin interactions and the cycling of
biogenic materials at the sediment/water interface of Arctic continental shelves
and slopes. The workshop will provide a forum for interested scientists to
discuss and develop a prioritized science plan focusing on a biologically
focused systems approach to shelf/basin exchange in the Arctic.
