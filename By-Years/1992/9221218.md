This project represents a collaborative effort between the University of
Arizona and the A.F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute in Russia. They have had
a long history of interest in the use of cosmogenic isotopes from the natural
archives to obtain information concerning solar-terrestrial interaction and
astrophysical phenomena prior to instrumental observation and measurement. The
focus is primarily on the cosmogenic isotopes 14C and 10Be that are produced in
the Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays. Cosmic rays convey information concerning
astrophysical events such as supernova explosions and are also modulated by the
Earth's dipole magnetic field and the magnetic fields associated with the solar
wind that varies with other aspects of solar activity. the products are
deposited in such natural archives as tree-rings, polar and montane ice, as well
as lake and marine sediments. Both institutions have associated cosmogenic
isotope laboratories and tree-ring research laboratories as well as access to
vast regions containing the necessary natural archives. The cooperative research
effort would enhance knowledge of the frequency of supernova explosions in the
Earth's vicinity and provide information on past changes in the geomagnetic
field and solar activity extending back several million years. This work has
practical socioeconomic significance because, for example, solar activity is a
factor in climate change. #
