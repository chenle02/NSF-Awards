This award is for supporting a community workshop on astrophysical research at
the South Pole Station and at some remote locations on the Antarctic Plateau.
The overarching theme of the workshop is to address the current status and
future prospects of the astronomy and astrophysical research in the Antarctic.
The workshop attendees will: (a) briefly review the history of astrophysical
research from the South Pole, with emphasis on why the kinds of observations
currently being pursued came to dominate, and the suitability of the site for
other observations; (b) summarize the current on-going projects (IceCube, SPT,
CMB polarization) and their results to date and expectations; (c) summarize
other astrophysical research going on in Antarctica - the long-duration balloon
program from McMurdo and the new installations at Domes A and C; and (d) discuss
plans and visions for future generations of experiments at South Pole and at
remote sites supported from South Pole.
