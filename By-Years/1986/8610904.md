Building on its initial contacts in Mexico made soon after the earthquake, the
Disaster Research Center will conduct a collaborative project with La Facultad
Latinoamericana de Sciencias Sociales (FLACSO) and the Instituto de
Investigacion de la Communication, A.C. The focus will be on the Mayor's office
effort to coordinate levels of government as well as private and international
organizations during the emergency period. The research will look at the
development of ways to respond to the new tasks created by the earthquake. It
will focus on problems of decision making in the absence of public might respond
to the new tasks created by the earthquake. A complementary focus will be on the
public's response to the disaster.
