9707820 Carignan The R/V BLUE FIN is used primarily to support research programs
in biological, physical and chemical oceanography on the S.E. Continental Shelf
between Capes Hatteras and Canaveral. The Blue Fin is a 72' general purpose
research vessel owned and operated by Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. The
vessel is scheduled for 116 operational days in 1997, all are in support of NSF-
sponsored research. The BLUE FIN is part of a fleet of ships used by the
National Science Foundation in support of marine science. Most oceanographic
projects require highly specialized equipment and extensive support from highly
trained crew members. Increasingly, research projects require equipment which
must be permanently installed on the vessel, thus requiring specialized vessels.
These vessels do not operate the same as general cargo/fishing vessels, as a
result NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated
to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and research
institutes around the country. ***
