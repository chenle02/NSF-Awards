This research is on testing large scale analog and mixed-signal circuits. There
are two tasks being undertaken. First is to develop a decomposition approach for
testing large scale analog and mixed-signal circuits. A time domain
decomposition method, which does not break interconnections, is being explored.
It is based on taking voltage measurements at partition points and formulating
new test equations at these nodes. Thus measurement errors are reduced to a
local area and computations are performed in each subcircuit. Second is to
establish a test strategy for automatic testing of large scale circuits. A set
of pre-test computations to be done off-line during the design stage or before
manufacturing test is being developed. Methods for extracting parameters during
test are being investigated. A set of post-test computations using the
parameters extracted during the test is being developed. Software for doing the
tests is being built and benchmark circuits are being tested.
