A National Symposium on Frontiers of Science will be held March 2-3, 1989 at
the recently dedicated Beckman Center of the National Academies of Science and
Engineering in Irvine, California. This symposium is intended to bring together
a selected group of outstanding young U.S. scientists to discuss exciting
advances and opportunities in their respective fields. A central purpose is to
foster communication among the likely future leaders of U.S. science. The
symposium will comprise about 100 invited participants plus ten to fifteen
invited science journalists. Speakers and other participants will be individuals
involved in basic research in varied disciplines such as astronomy, biology,
chemistry, earth sciences, material sciences, mathematics, and physics. A format
is planned that encourages, and allows time for, informal discussions among
participants.
