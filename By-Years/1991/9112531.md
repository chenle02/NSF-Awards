Stability analysis for neural control systems is a difficult and important open
research question. The problem is difficult because neural control systems are
inherently non-linear and may involve large scale plants with unknown parameters
and structure. The problem is important because practical application of neural
control demands that the closed-loop system operate in a stable manner. In this
project several ideas from different control system fields are integrated to
generate stability arguments for neural control systems. The concepts of
Lyapunov functions from adaptive control systems, performance measure
minimization and dynamic programming from optimal control and the adaptive
critic from reinforcement learning are combined to formulate a methodology for
stability and convergence rate analysis for neural controller.
