9709420 Cochrane This project consists of two parts: 1. Theoretical and
empirical investigation of the fiscal theory of the price level. The fiscal
theory states that the price level is determined by the ratio of the nominal
value of total government (or "outside") debt to the real value of (net of
interest) fiscal surpluses that will pay off the debt. This theory establishes a
direct connection between fiscal events and the price level. The fiscal theory
may help resolve a host of empirical embarrassments of monetary economics. These
include exchange rates (another measure of the price level) that seem to have
little to do with relative money stocks and a relation between monetary
aggregates and the price level that is notoriously unstable. This project adds
long-term debt to existing theoretical treatments; finds conditions when news of
future deficits can lead to inflation today, and when it leads only to a decline
in the price of long-term bonds; solves for the optimal maturity structure of
government debt that achieves price level objectives; and provides the first
rigorous empirical tests of fiscal theory. 2. "Good deal" asset pricing bounds.
Pricing by arbitrage, in which one learns about the price of a given payoff from
prices of "nearby" payoffs, is very attractive to many practical and economic
applications of asset pricing theory including investment theory, corporate
finance and even environmental economics (the rainforest as an option on a cure
for cancer). Unfortunately, the absence of arbitrage tells us nothing about the
price of a specific untraded financial instrument. This project develops a new
method for calculating tight upper and lower bounds for the "fair values" of
untraded financial instruments from the prices of related assets and a little
information about the underlying economics. ??
