The primary purposes of the project, which is to involve practicing design
professionals and researchers from the U.S. and Japan, include: (1) exchanging
information and ideas in areas identified during the first U.S.-Japan workshop,
(2) developing mechanisms through which the two countries can improve current
design and construction practices and more effectively utilize information
developed in each country, and (3) improving channels for rapid interchange of
research ideas relating to the improvement of building design and construction
practices.
