The acquisition of a 20-KW induction melter coupled with a vacuum chamber and
zone refining apparatus provides the capability to deal with high melting point
metals such as iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, zirconium and titanium.
Undergraduate engineering students perform experiments on solidification,
purification, gas-metal reactions and preparation of alloys for electrical and
mechanical property determinations.
