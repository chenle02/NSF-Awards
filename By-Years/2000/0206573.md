&lt;br/&gt;Habitat fragmentation and small population size may lead to a
decrease in genetic variation and, consequently, the long-term viability of
populations. New molecular genetic techniques have been developed to identify
changes in genetic variation over time from contemporary samples. However, these
techniques have rarely been tested in species in which both historic and
contemporary patterns of genetic variation are known. This research will examine
the power of these techniques to reconstruct historic patterns of genetic
variation in greater prairie chickens, a species of grouse that formerly
occurred throughout the prairies of midwestern North America and is now found in
fragmented populations, some of which are threatened with extinction. Historic
patterns of genetic variation will be obtained from mitochondrial DNA sequences
of museum specimens collected prior to habitat fragmentation and population
decline (1872-1950). These will be compared to already analyzed sequences from
contemporary populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This analysis of both
contemporary and historic populations will provide empirical support for several
critical assumptions of new molecular techniques and an extraordinarily detailed
picture of population processes during the decline of a threatened species. From
a conservation perspective, this information will also be essential for
delineating management units and identifying populations that may be suitable
for translocation programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
