Recent research suggests that hatcheries have been an important factor
contributing to the decline of salmon runs throughout the Pacific Northwest.
This dissertation research project is designed to cast historical light on the
construction of management policies through time, with particular attention paid
to the emergence of artificial propagation as the primary tool of salmon
management. The Oregon salmon fisheries serve as a long term case study of the
intersection of federal, state, and private understandings of salmon management.
Archive-based research will focus on correspondence between government
administrators, fishery managers, industry leaders, and fishermen. The research
is designed to illuminate the varied understandings of the nature of salmon and
to discern the relative influence of economic interests, political agendas, and
science in the shaping of fishery management. A central question is why
artificial propagation emerged and remained the primary tool of salmon
management when there was little scientific support or demonstration of its
efficacy. A historical approach to this question should help scientists and
managers better understand the forces that have shaped fishery science and its
application over time.
