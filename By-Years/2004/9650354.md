Nationally, students typically do not improve in conceptual understanding of
basic physics principles under traditional instructional techniques. The primary
goal of this project is to provide a means for students to improve their
learning, retention, and utilization of physics concepts and principles. This
goal is being accomplished through the use of computers and microcomputer-based
laboratories. These laboratories (from Tools for Scientific Thinking, Workshop
Physics, and others that are being prepared in-house) in kinematics, forces,
rotational motion, energy, heat, and light use probes and other accessories
connected to the computers to gather data. The students can then analyze this
data and, through discovery, learn and internalize physics concepts. The new
approach results in new learning experiences for the students and, according to
data gathered by Thornton and Laws, improve conceptual understanding. The
laboratories are being equipped with the software and hardware for three
complete workstations and one portable computer. These items can be used to
supplement the current laboratory, which has three Power Macintosh 7100/72
computers and the accessory probes and interfaces. Other new equipment includes
two laser printers, networking cables and accessories, and some laboratory
supplies. This project can encourage students to complete the physics courses at
the college, to improve their science experience, and to expose current and
future teachers to an instructional method other than the traditional lecture
format.
