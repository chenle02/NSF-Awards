This award will provide approximately one-half the funds required to purchase a
gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometer and two gas extraction lines for
sample preparation. The system is to be installed and operated in the Department
of Geosciences at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. The stable
isotope facility will be applied to research problems in tungsten ore
deposition, hydrology, and the geographic distribution of sulfur in acid rain
from coal combustion.
