This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Cal State University, Los
Angeles to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site. Funds will
support 8 undergraduate students in seven areas of biological research:
Developmental Biology, Population Biology, Behavioral Genetics, Renal
Physiology, Physiological Animal Ecology, Neurobiology, and Molecular Biology.
The 8 students will be supported for 12 weeks of full time research during the
summer of 1989. At least 1/2 of these students will be recruited from 2-year and
4-year colleges and universities throughout California, with the remaining
students from on campus. Minorities, women, disabled and economically
disadvantaged students will be the target group. Cal State L.A. has had no
difficulty targeting these groups, since the majority of the students (70%) are
minority, are women (56%), and are economically disadvantaged (90%). The
University also has an active disabled students program that recruits students
with various physical disabilities. The campus is located in East Los Angeles
servicing the San Gabriel Valley which is predominantly Hispanic.
