Mathematical Sciences: Shock Waves and Geometry

0102493 Temple

This project is focused on the interplay between principles of geometry and the
principles of the mathematical theory of shock waves. There are three main areas
of research. The first is analysis of regularity and shock formation in initial
value problems for weak solutions of the Einstein equations. The second area is
development of shock-matching methods with application to blast waves in general
relativity. The third area is investigation of oscillations in systems of
conservation laws, with particular emphasis on analyzing oscillations that are
generated in transonic flow. As part of the project, we combine Glimm's theory
of wave interactions with the theory of general relativity to analyze shock wave
interactions for Einstein's equations. Since the Einstein equations contain the
compressible Euler equations as a subsystem, results on shock wave propagation
in general relativity are expected to have new implications for analysis of
shock waves in classical fluids.

We are developing a theory of shock wave propagation in Einstein's theory of
general relativity. A shock wave is best known as the blast wave that marks the
leading edge of an explosion. In that case, the shock wave is the surface
between the rapidly expanding material and the ambient, undisturbed air into
which the shock front propagates. In general relativity, shock waves are waves
in the curvature of spacetime itself. There are thus new and interesting
fundamental issues involved in extending Einstein's equations to a setting that
admits shock wave propagation. As part of the project, we are constructing new
exact solutions of Einstein's equations that incorporate a blast wave into the
Big Bang -- the explosion that first set the universe into expansion. The
mathematical results will also have application to shock waves in ordinary
fluids.
