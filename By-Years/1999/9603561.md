9603561 Stewart This proposal requests support for travel compensation for
graduate students to present results of basic research at the third World
Conference of Herpetology. No other meeting in the field of herpetology bring
together such a diversity of researchers and veiwpoints as does this Congress.
The Congress will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from August 2 - 10, 1997.
The previous World Congresses have provided avenues for presenting current,
innovative, problem-oriented biology that have contributed to the advancement of
many disciplines of science. The third World Congress is designed in a similar
multidisciplinary fashion. As such, these meetings are of particular value to
students. Individual travel awards will be made by a selection committee of
three experts (one each from the major cooperating U.S.-based societies, the
American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, the Herpetologists
League, and the Society for Study of Amphibians and Reptiles). The experience
gained by student-participants at this conference will help insure that
researchers in the United States remain at the center of international research
activity concerning general advances in biology, and particularly advances in
the biology of lower vertebrates.
