This proposal requests funding for the renovation of some thirty research
laboratories and twelve research instruction areas. Renovation is to include
replastering, repainting, reflooring, receiling, changing interior walls,
refurbishing and equipping research areas with tables, cabinets, benches, sinks,
fume hoods, distilled water, gas, electrical outlets, compressed air, etc.
Additionally, instrumentation, such as fume hoods, support vital to a growing
research area in cellular and molecular biology is requested. The local impact
will be great and will make a strong statement designation as a Commonwealth of
Kentucky Center of Excellence for Reservoir Research the local impact can and
should generate national interest. One goal for the College is to become
nationally, even internationally recognized for excellence in reservoir ecology.
A parallel goal is to develop a strong cellular and molecular biology program.
