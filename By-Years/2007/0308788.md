Abstract&lt;br/&gt;DISSERTATION RESEARCH: The Application of Resource
Competition Theory to Invasive Species and Biological
Control&lt;br/&gt;Carson&lt;br/&gt;DEB-0308788&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will apply resource competition theory to rigorously evaluate the
underlying mechanism that has allowed an invasive plant species to displace a
widespread, dominant plant species. It will specifically test the hypothesis
that an invader is successful because it can outcompete a native plant, via the
invader's ability to deplete the level of the shared limiting resource (Tilman's
R* theory). It will also test the practical hypothesis that a biological control
agent will only be effective if it prevents the invader from depleting the key
limiting resource (Grover's keystone herbivory theory). These theories will be
examined using the invasive purple loosestrife, its primary native competitor,
broad-leaved cattail, and the biocontrol agent Galerucella calmariensis, a leaf-
feeding beetle. The work will involve a rigorous, dual experimental approach
that combines the use of carefully controlled mesocosms and in situ field
manipulations. Prior funding has allowed the establishment of both the mesocosm
and field experiments, which have now completed their third and first full field
season, respectively. This award will allow the treatments to be maintained and
the collection of response data for two additional field seasons, to achieve
competitive exclusion, which is the critical response to definitively test these
theories.&lt;br/&gt;
