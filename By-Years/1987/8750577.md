A Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer with an interfaced computer-based data
station is being used by the Chemistry Department at Lebanon College in the
following activities: 1. A qualitative organic analysis experiment during the
first semester of organic chemistry. 2. Measurement of reaction kinetics,
determination of isotope exchange, and the determination of the fatty acid
composition of natural fats in the second semester of organic chemistry. 3.
Demonstrating the principles of operation, and the analytical applications of
GC/MS in an instrumental analysis course. 4. Independent study, undergraduate
summer research, and an annual summer chemistry program for advanced high school
students.
