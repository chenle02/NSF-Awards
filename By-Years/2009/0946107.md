This workshop is concerned with extraordinary attacks mounted by nation-state
adversaries for strategic gain. Recent events demonstrate the vulnerability of
banking from cascaded effects, such as the sub-prime lending disaster. Banks
have done reasonably well in protecting themselves from sophisticated criminals;
losses have been growing, but are tolerable. It is expected that banking will
continue to be effective against ordinary cyber attacks as part of the cost of
doing business. A workshop will be held to develop set of representative worst-
case strategic cyber attack scenarios and the options the nation may need to
mitigate the effects of those scenarios. Key issues that will be addressed,
include: worst case scenarios; factors contributing most to dame; long and shot
term steps to reduce risk, early recognition of attacks; way to speed recovery;
and ways to thwart attack. A summary of the report will be made publicly
available online.
