A great deal of social research has looked at motherhood and mothers, but
fatherhood, by contrast, has been virtually ignored. Still, changes in marriage
and fertility patterns have fundamentally altered key aspects of fatherhood in
the late twentieth century. Yet, because we lack any comprehensive picture of
fatherhood in the past, it is difficult to put together a meaningful,
historically informed picture of fatherhood today. The proposed research
involves the study of changes in the social institution of fatherhood between
1918 and 1941. The study is based on a content analysis of letters, newspaper
and magazine articles about fatherhood. The study will classify data into those
relating to the culture and conduct of paternal engagement, accessibility, and
responsibility. Changes in the data over time will then be measured and
analyzed. Charting the course of fatherhood during a recent and significant
period of American history will permit the testing of the "changing father"
hypothesis, that today's fathers are considerably different from their
grandfathers. It also will demonstrate the extent to which paternal behavior can
be shaped by economic, cultural and political conditions.
