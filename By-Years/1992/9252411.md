This project provides equipment for a new hardware laboratory designed to allow
students to develop the skills of critical analysis, careful reasoning,
creativity, and self-expression. The laboratory will include ten laboratory
stations based on Macintosh computers and equipped with oscilloscopes, logic
probes, and prototyping hardware and software to explore the use and
construction of computer hardware.
