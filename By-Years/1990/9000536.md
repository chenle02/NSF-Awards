The Principal Investigator will investigate the absence of deformation on the
Magdelena fan, located on the northern Colombian convergent margin, using GLORIA
images and single-channel seismic data collected in the summer of 1989 on the
RRS Charles Darwin. Two competing models have been proposed to explain the lack
of shortening on the fan. One proposes that the low surface slope of the fan
suppresses deformation; thus sedimentation rates would alter the geometry of
compressional deformation. In the other model, block tectonics in northern South
America creates different amounts of convergence along the various blocks. If
the block-boundary faults continue offshore across the active accretinary wedge
then the amount of convergence should change across block boundaries. These
models will be tested by determining the geometry, and rates and timing of the
deformation near the edges of the fan.
