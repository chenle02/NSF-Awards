A Sr-Isotopic stratigraphy will be developed for the middle Cretaceous
(Barremian to Turonian) interval that is coincident with the long magnetic quiet
zone. Seven continuous DSDP/ODP sections from major basins will be used that
have well worked out biostratigraphies and good foraminiferal preservation.
Effects of digenesis of Sr isotopes will also be investigated. The results will
help understand the mid Cretaceous paleoceanography.
