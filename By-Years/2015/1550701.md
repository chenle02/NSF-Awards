This award supports the transition of the World Wide Telescope (WWT) project
from Microsoft Research to the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Amateur
astronomers support an industry of considerable value and are involved in
research through citizen science efforts such as the Zooniverse. The WWT
software provides a uniquely capable platform for involvement of amateur and
professional astronomers alike in research, education, publishing, outreach, and
communication. Keeping this package available is a valuable service for the
country. The investment to ensure a smooth transition from its current state of
being proprietary, albeit free, to an open source project led by the AAS, is
clearly very worthwhile and at the same time extremely cost-
effective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microsoft supported the WWT software system up
until the fall of 2014, when they decided to release WWT to the open source
community. The AAS is keen to assume a leadership role in a project of such
evident value, but needs time to arrange for long-term support of WWT in aid of
the US astronomical community. Microsoft funding ended on June 30, 2015, so this
project will bridge the gap, although supporting only maintenance activities.
This will ensure both that the WWT remains available to AAS and that the system
remains available for existing users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As noted, WWT is
currently used widely by many constituencies. This software has unique
capabilities, including the creation of video abstracts for publications. It is
used in many schools, planetariums and museums across the country and the world.
Under a community-driven open source model, these activities will be supported
by experts from the respective constituencies, and connections between the
various activities can leverage the work in one community for the benefit of
all.
