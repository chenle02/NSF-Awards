Scientific researchers are now called upon to more engage more fully with
diverse publics and policy-makers. Public engagement, however, comes with its
own challenges. As they leave their labs and enter the public sphere,
researchers need to consider how to make responsible use of communication
techniques by coupling skill in communicating effectively with deeper reflection
on communicating ethically. This combined education and research project
advances that goal by researching, piloting, and disseminating case studies
addressing scientists' obligation to engage with the public, and the ethical
issues they may encounter when they do so. The project draws on ten important
instances of public science communication across five natural science and
engineering disciplines, examining the ethical principles at work in
communicating scientific knowledge to a non-expert audience, and using these
cases to train young scientists to achieve the broader impacts society
rightfully expects.

Leveraging the recent growth of communication training initiatives directed at
scientists, the project pilots and assesses the resulting case studies at
fifteen partnering institutions, in diverse settings in those institutions,
including communication practice workshops, communication seminars, and courses
on research and science ethics taught by scientists, philosophers, and
communication scholars to STEM graduate students, postdocs, REU students, and
students in communication fields. Case materials and associated research are
published in book and ebook formats and in peer-reviewed journals of national
communication societies and associations relevant to science and engineering
ethics,and distributed to national research ethics case banks.
