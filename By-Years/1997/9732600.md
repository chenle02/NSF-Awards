Professor Jeffrey H. Byers, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
Middlebury College, is supported by a Research in Undergraduate Institutions
award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of
radical aromatic substitution via atom transfer addition. Professor Byers
studies the reactions of aromatic and heteroaromatic substances with a variety
of electrophilic radicals. The electronic nature of the aromatic ring is
modified through the use of suitable protecting groups and through the formation
of arene chromium tricarbonyl complexes, thus providing aromatic substrates
reactive toward electron-rich radicals. Professor Byers is also exploring
intramolecular reactions leading to the formation of mitocene and pyrrolizidine
ring systems, common structural features of a range of biologically active
compounds. Although organic molecules containing an unpaired electron
(`radicals`) are often very reactive, they have until recently received
comparatively little attention as potential participants in the synthesis of
organic molecules. With the support of a Research in Undergraduate Institutions
award from the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jeffrey
H. Byers, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Middlebury College,
explores a class of radical-forming reactions known as atom-transfer additions
for their ability to facilitate the synthesis of aromatic compounds. Products
potentially made accessible through the discovery and development of this
chemistry include aryl acetic acids, a general class of compounds frequently
used as analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications, as well as a variety of
more complex structures representing common structural features of a range of
biologically active compounds.
