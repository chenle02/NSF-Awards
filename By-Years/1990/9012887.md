This proposal describes an ambitious investigation into connections between
corporate control activities (acquisitions, divestments), commitment to
innovation (research and development -- R&amp;D), and performance measures (such
as a decline in competitiveness). Acquisitions, for instance, take considerable
corporate effort and promote a short-run view. In turn, this draws attention
away from longer-run emphasis on corporate R&amp;D, which may make a firm less
competitive. Similarly, corporate restructuring can lead to increased debt,
which inhibits R&amp;D commitments. Although plausible, these ideas have yet to
be addressed in the economics, finance, or management literature. The principal
investigators propose a combination of primary and secondary data sources to
provide insights into internal corporate dynamics. The primary data source will
be based on a large-scale survey of almost 1000 companies, with detailed
interviews at 30 companies. The secondary data source will involve analysis of
longitudinal records available from COMPUSTAT and other sources. The integration
of these two data sources offers the opportunity to gain theoretical and
empirical advances in understanding corporate response to restructuring.
