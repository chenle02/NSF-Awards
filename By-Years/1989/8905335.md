This is a project to produce an inexpensive material that can be used to perform
experimental stress analysis. The main ingredient of the material is common
sugar. The proposed project is to calibrate and evaluate reproducibility of the
material. The results will encourage the use of experimental stress analysis
methods when cost is major factor.
