Acquisition of a Mobile Robot Scanning System This research instrumentation
grant contributes to the purchase of a mobile robot scanning system, comprised
of a an outdoor, autonomous robot vehicle with a large payload and an on-board
centimeter resolution Global Positioning System for accurate location of the
vehicle. The instrumentation will enable the following projects:- Automatic 3-D
Site Modeling,- Automated Visual Navigation,- Integration of Physical and
Virtual Views, and- Optimal Representation and Verbal Description of Large Scale
Objects and Path. The mobile scanning equipment acquired will contribute to
develop highly accurate 3-D site models that encompass geometric and photometric
properties of the scene. There are 4 aspects to this research which require a
mobile base robot, an accurate GPS location system, and 2-D and 3-D imaging
sensors. First, the models will be built by using the mobile base to acquire
images and a new range scan mesh extrusion algorithm will create volumetric
models. Sensor planning algorithms will also be developed to determine regions
where the robot can navigate to complete a partially built model by further
sensing. Second, the robot will be equipped with omnidirectional cameras which
can be used for structure-from-motion scene recovery, and model registration
research. Third, the system will be used for research on change detection and
model evolution on existing models of the environment. The GPS system can
provide ground truth for the accuracy of these algorithms, and allow interaction
with an existing low-precision human-mounted system for tracking. Fourth, the
system will be used as a "guide" through an environment. It can take
navigational and environmental queries in verbal/gestural form, and present its
findings about the objects of interest in the scene in natural language.
