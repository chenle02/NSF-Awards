A seven week summer program at Louisiana State University is proposed in which
students entering the eleventh or twelfth grade at the end of the summer will:
1) take short courses on science subjects; 2) work in a faculty research
laboratory; 3) participate in discussions on science careers, science
methodology and scientific ethics; and 4) take weekend field trips to nearby
scientific and industrial facilities. Six of the students will be commuters and
six will reside in campus dormitories. (The residential students will be
recruited nationwide.) The short courses in science will take place in the
mornings of the first three weeks of the program. Participation in faculty
research projects will start in the afternoons of the first three weeks, and
continue full- time in the final four weeks. The twelve students will be divided
among the six departments of the College of Basic Sciences: Biochemistry,
Botany, Chemistry, Microbiology, Physics and Astronomy, and Zoology and
Physiology. The students will be expected to develop a science project for
submission to a science fair, junior academy of science, or Junior Science and
Humanities Symposium. Follow-up activities will center around reporting on
progress in the science project (for all students), but will also include
classroom visits by staff members and a Saturday renewal session (for local
students).
