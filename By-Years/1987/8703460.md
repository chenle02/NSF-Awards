This grant, in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, supports
theoretical research to study the dynamics and relaxation of molecules and
solids at low temperatures. Problems in relaxation of excitons, excitation
transport in disordered systems, and the effect of strong coupling to a constant
temperature reservoir on tunneling will be addressed. The significance of the
work lies in the fundamental insights into the structure and properties of
crystalline materials and their interactions with light of various frequencies
or colors. These insights will be extended to include glassy solids, which do
not have the degree of regular arrangement found in crystals. The ways in which
energy is absorbed by these materials is a particular focus of this project. The
results will be of direct value to groups performing experiments on these
materials.
