Rodent whiskers, called vibrissae, are part of a highly specialized tactile
sensory system on the face that detects textures of objects. The individual
whiskers are 'mapped' by their location into the somatosensory cortex of the
brain. Recent work suggests that an individual vibrissa has resonant vibration
properties from the biomechanical resonance of the whiskers length and
stiffness, along with the adjustable stiffness of the tissues surrounding its
base. This project uses physics, mathematical modeling, electrophysiology and
anatomy in a novel multidisciplinary combination to test whether these features
may provide a new alternative interpretation of the spatial map of whisker input
to the brain. If each whisker has a tuned preference or amplification for
certain frequencies, then the spatial map in the brain might also be a frequency
map for the tactile system, in some ways analgous to the frequency maps found in
the central auditory system. Results will be important for a new interpretation
of sensory coding of the whisker somatosensory system, and are likely to have an
impact on interpreting central coding and mapping in other sensory systems. In
addition, this project has an impact on graduate and undergraduate cross-
disciplinary training and education by incorporating a strong mathematical
component into this biological study.
