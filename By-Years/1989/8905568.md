A new excimer-laser based diagnostic method is being developed that should yield
instantaneous two-dimensional temperature and density fields in high-temperature
media such as occur in open flames or in internal combustion engines. Because
the method has excellent time resolution ( 10ns), it is ideal for analysis of
turbulent burning. It uses laser induced fluorescence, but with a novel approach
that eliminates the problem of collisional- quenching that normally limits LIF
to pressures less than 0.01 atmosphere. A powerful narrow-band UV laser excites
molecules to predissociating states that are so short-lived that there is no
time for quenching collisions. It is proposed to acquire a UV image intensifier
and a self scanned array camera to obtain two-dimensional images of the
fluorescence. One can then literally take "snapshots" of the density
distribution of a single selected quantum state. By comparing the densities of
two such states using two camera systems, the temperature distribution can be
calculated with a single laser shot. Laser techniques are particularly promising
for combined detector/computer technologies for optimization of combustion
system, minimizing pollutant emissions or maximizing fuel economy for example.
The method proposed here will lead us in that direction by extending LIF to a
more useful pressure regime.
