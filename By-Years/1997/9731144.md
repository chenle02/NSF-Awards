9731144 Sulkin Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center
(SPMC) in Anacortes, Washington will serve as the site of an REU program during
the summers of 1998-2000. Each summer eight students recruited from around the
nation will spend nine weeks at SPMC engaging in independent research under the
supervision of a faculty member. Students will plan, execute, and develop oral
and written reports for individual projects relating to the marine environment
and living resources of the Puget Sound region, including nutrient dynamics,
water quality determinations, predator-prey interactions, and the developmental
characteristics, physiology, and behavior of marine animals and plants. Students
will receive a $275 per week stipend, travel allowance, and housing at SPMC.
Students will be encouraged and supported in developing their projects for
presentation in regional and national scientific meetings.
