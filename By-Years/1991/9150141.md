In 1988 and 1989, ASTC offered a seven-day institute for founders of new
science centers, funded by the National Science Foundation. The impact of these
institutes was profound, making the difference between success and failure for
several, and helping many others clarify and strengthen their plans. Since then
demand for technical assistance to new science centers has increased rather than
decreased. Building on its experience, ASTC proposes a 3-1/2 year multiple-
strategy program to provide knowledgeable, supportive guidance to the founders
of new science centers. The elements are: (1) a 4-day workshop on how to start a
science center; (2) a resource book on starting and operating science centers;
(3) a network for new science centers which meets at the ASTC annual conference
for mutual support and information sharing; (4) one-day workshops held in
Conjunction with the ASTC conference and planned by the steering committee of
the New Science Center Network; (5) increased coverage in the ASTC Newsletter;
(6) an annual progress report on new science centers; and (7) on-going,
individualized technical assistance.
