The brown mouse lemur, Microcebus rufus, is the world's smallest living primate,
and heretofore virtually nothing is known about its natural history - it is
nocturnal and is restricted to a section of Madagascar. This dissertation
project is designed to understand the basic survival and reproductive strategy
of this secretive primate. It will involve observations on its reproductive
pattern and potential, seasonal changes in natural diet, body weight and
activity patterns, and seasonal patterns of spatial distribution. Its importance
to conservation strategies is very clear, as well as the door it will open on
nocturnal observations of such primates.
