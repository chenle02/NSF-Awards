Abstract Sahi The research will consist of two parts. The first part is
concerned with constructing explicit models for small unipotent representations
of reductive Lie groups, and with using these models to study the decomposition
of tensor products and restrictions of such representations. It is expected that
this will provide a natural context for extending the theta-correspondence. The
second part of the proposal gives an extension of the theory of Jack
polynomials, which are themselves generalizations of spherical polynomials for
GL(n) where one replaces the root multiplicity by an arbitrary parameter. The
polynomials we describe are obtained by varying the half-sum of positive roots,
hence depend on n auxiliary parameters. It is expected that a study of these
polynomials will lead to new and interesting results. The first part of the
proposal will have applications to Number Theory, a deep and beautiful area of
mathematics that has often had unexpected and profound implications for
practical problems of various kinds. For example in the design of networks, in
order to facilitate efficient dissemination of information, it is desirable to
have a high degree of inter-connectivity. It turns out that some of the best
networks are constructed by using number-theoretic considerations. The second
part of the proposal has relevance to diverse areas such as Physics,
Multivariate Statistics, and Combinatorics.
