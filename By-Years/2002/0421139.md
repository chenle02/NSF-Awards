This award supports the purchase an isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC), a
differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and related software and hardware
support for data analysis. The instruments are designed for ease of use,
repeated operation (rugged design) and rapid throughput. This new generation of
calorimeters provides an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and
baseline reproducibility with small cell volumes. Thermodynamics of biomolecular
systems can be directly measured in a model-independent specific method. DSC and
ITC directly measure enthalpy, melting temperature and binding constants for
biomolecular systems providing accurate measurements of free energy and entropy
of the systems. Specific research projects include: (1) thermodynamics of
trinucleotide repeat DNA sequences, (2) determination of the heat capacity of
DNA duplex formation, (3) binding constant measurements, and (4) thermodynamics
of DNA dumbbell molecular wires. Acquisition of these instruments will provide
for biophysical chemical research with undergraduates students, biophysical
research training of advanced undergraduate students and development and
application of new laboratory modules for undergraduate course work in
biochemistry and physical chemistry.
