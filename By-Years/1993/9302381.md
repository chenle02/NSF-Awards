9302381 Schwarz Experiments are to be conducted which characterize the boundary
layer with air flow over a flat surface coated with a flexible, complaint
material. The effect of surface compliance on linear stability of the boundary
layer, transition to turbulence, and drag reduction for turbulent flow will be
systematically explored. Preliminary experiments have been completed to
demonstrate that increase of stability is possible with a compliant surface in
air flow. Drag and turbulence transition reduction from a compliant surface is
known to exist for flow of a liqud, with important hydronautic and liquid
pumping application. For air or a gas, similar energy saving possibilities are
implied by this research. ***
