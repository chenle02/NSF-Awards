This dissertation project is an investigation of the interplay of the Monticello
radiation-standards debate with the specialty of health physics. It focuses on
an understanding of the history of health physics and of the mechanisms by which
politics interacted with science in the context of the civilian nuclear power
debate. Through the examination of the unexplored impact the Monticello
controversy had on health physic's concepts and profession, the study offers a
promising basis on which to elaborate some of the most prominent arguments of
the social construction of science. The funds will be used to research documents
used by each of the protagonist parties in the Monticello debate, on documents
pertaining to the history of health physics, and on oral interviews with
scientists who participated in the debate and/or were members of the Health
Physics Society.
