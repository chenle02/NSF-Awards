Computer architectures dominated by control logic are an important class since
many applications specific designs are dominated by design of the control logic.
This research is developing new optimization algorithms for behavioral synthesis
of control dominated machines. Research is being done on: a. how to partition
the behavioral synthesis process into manageable compilation steps, b. finding
optimization algorithms to implement the compilation steps, c. determining how
various optimizations interact, and d. developing reliable methods to estimate
hardware costs to drive optimization. An experimental behavioral synthesis
compiler is being built and will be used to experiment with real examples to
test the optimization algorithms.
