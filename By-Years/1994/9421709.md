9421709 Posakony The long-term goal of this research is to understand how cells
in the ectoderm layer of the body are directed to become neurons (cells of the
nervous system) instead of epidermal (skin) cells. In insects, a small group of
genes called "proneural" genes have been identified as the major determinants of
a cell's potential to become part of the nervous system. These genes specify the
synthesis of regulatory proteins that control the activity of other genes. Very
similar "proneural" genes have been identified in mammals (including humans),
where they also control nervous system development. In this project, the
peripheral (sensory) nervous system of an insect will be used as a model to
investigate, at the molecular level, how the expression of the proneural genes
is controlled, and how the protein products of these genes act to confer on
cells the competence to become neurons. The results of this research will
provide fundamental information about the mechanisms that control the
development of individual cells in the nervous system. ^Z^Z
