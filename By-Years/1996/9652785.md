This project reforms first-year computer science and computer engineering
curricula by implementing a common integrated freshman core curriculum. This
integrated curriculum involves coordination of content and assignments for its
courses. We utilize "just-in-time" instruction, where topics are introduced in
given courses at precisely the appropriate time for those topics to be applied
in other (concurrent) courses. Our efforts involve the integration of three one-
year course sequences: a hardware sequence, a software sequence, and a
mathematics sequence.
