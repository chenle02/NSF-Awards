This action funds Chelsea Anne Griffith of Western Michigan University to
conduct a research project, entitled "Practical analysis of seismic responses of
structures," during the summer of 2012 at the National Center for Research on
Earthquake Engineering at National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The host
scientist is Dr. Keh-Chyuan Tsai.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the contribution to the
stability and accuracy of large scale hybrid testing in earthquake engineering.
The research demonstrates that hybrid testing is an economical alternative to
traditional testing methods as it combines experimental and analytical models to
characterize overall structural response. A full scale critical assembly can be
tested while remainder of the structure is modeled by computer, thus eliminating
the need for an entirely physical prototype specimen. Results of hybrid tests
are applied to safer, more efficient design and evaluation of new and existing
structures, respectively.

The Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-
hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science,
science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
