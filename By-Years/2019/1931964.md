Thermal radiation plays an important role in many fields, such as heat transfer,
energy conversion, optics and photonics, and remote sensing. When the gap size
between objects exchanging energy by radiation is very small, the radiative heat
transfer can be dramatically enhanced beyond what is usually predicted by
theory. The proposed research will significantly advance the basic understanding
of thermal emission at the nanoscale and facilitate the development of new
techniques for controlling thermal radiation. This project integrates research
and education via various outreach activities to K-12 students and general
public as well as dissemination of simulation tools. Multiple open-source codes
for directly calculating thermal radiation at the nanoscale is to be developed
and disseminated. The educational focus is underserved high school students in
the Pittsburgh area and undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon
University. A broader community of motivated scholars in science and engineering
will be reached through various workshops held in Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of this project is to control the
extreme spectral and directional characteristics of thermal radiation based on a
bottom-up method using individual coherent nanoemitters as fundamental elements.
The current effort delves deeply into the unique thermal emission properties of
a nanoemitter, and utilizes the nanoemitters as basic building blocks to create
a new type of macroscopic perfect thermal emitting surface, which can work in
both near- and far-field modes. The aim is to develop a new theory to understand
the fundamental limit of thermal emission from an arbitrary nanoscale plasmonic
structure. The overall thermal radiation from arrays of nanoscale plasmonic
structures in both near- and far-fields will also be
studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
