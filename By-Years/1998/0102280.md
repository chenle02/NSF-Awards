CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Sampling Based
Geometric Modeling

Many application domains ranging from engineering to medicine require the
computer modeling of physical objects. Laser range scanners and other modern
scanning devices are capable of sampling large numbers of points on the surface
of a physical object. Computing a model of an object, often referred to as
surface reconstruction, has received wide attention in recent years. In the
proposed postdoctoral training and research project, the problem of how to
perform surface reconstruction of a physical object from a set of sampled points
will be further studied. Specifically, a postdoctoral associate will focus on
extending the cocone algorithm to handle large, noisy, and undersampled sets of
data points. The associate's research will contribute to building a software
library that provides the reconstruction functionality needed to meet the
widespread demands of a range of users across disciplines.
