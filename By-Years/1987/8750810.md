The University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire will introduce the powerful analytical
technique of atomic absorption spectrometry to chemistry and geology students at
the undergraduate level. A flame atomic absorption spectrometer, including an
electrothermal atomizer, will be acquired and installed in place of the present,
obsolete instrument. The new instrument will be introduced and used in two
chemistry laboratory courses, Quantitative Analysis and Instrumental Analysis.
Applications will include comparison of this instrument with molecular
absorption instruments and a simple analysis in Quantitative Analysis and a
thorough familiarization and investigation of major instrumental parameters in
Instrumental Analysis. Elemental analyses are critical to the geological
sciences so it is necessary to teach this widely used technique. Atomic
absorption analyses will be done in at least three geology courses including
Geochemistry, Economic Mineral Deposits, and Chemical Hydrogeology. In addition,
the instrument will be used extensively in research projects in both
departments.
