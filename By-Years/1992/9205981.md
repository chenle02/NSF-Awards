The project continues of study of Ordovician and Silurian K- bentonites in the
Iapetus region that was started in 1990. The discovery that the Millbrig
K-bentonite in North America represents the same ash fall as the "Big Bentonite"
in Baltoscandia makes its possible to use this bed as a unique time plane for
various regional geological studies, such as a recently started Ph.D., project
on Middle Ordovician conodont biofacies differentiation in the Iapetus region
and its ecologic controls. Being apparently the largest volcanic ash fall known,
the Millbrig- "Big-Bentonite" offers an unusual opportunity to study mortality
and extinction effects of a giant ash fall on marine biota, and such a study
will be undertaken. Also, this horizon, along with new biostratigraphic data,
will be used for application of Sweet's American graphic correlation scheme to
European successions thereby greatly increasing the precision in trans-Atlantic
correlations. Geodynamic and event-stratigraphic studies will include chemical
fingerprinting of selected beds and modeling of the Millbrig- "Big Bentonite"
eruption based on regional grain-size pattern analyses. These will also be used
for obtaining a distance figure of the width of the Iapetus in the Middle
Ordovician. We also plan to get high-precision U-Pb dates on
biostratigraphically well-controlled K-bentonites that will provide significant
contributions to the Ordovician-Silurian time scale.
