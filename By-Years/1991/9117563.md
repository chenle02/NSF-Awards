The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the interconversion of the two forms of
inorganic carbon, CO2 and HCO3, which predominate in aqueous media at
physiological pH values. In the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one or more
forms of carbonic anhydrase are components of a system for inorganic carbon
acquisition and concentration. This system enables these organisms to
efficiently utilize CO2 present at low levels, which could otherwise limit their
growth. A carbonic anhydrase-specific active site-directed radiolabeled
photoaffinity reagent will be synthesized in order to study the physical
relationship between the large and small subunits with respect to the active
site of the enzyme, and as a tool in the identification and isolation of
physiologically important intracellular forms of carbonic anhydrase which are
present in levels too low to be readily identified and quantified by currently
available methods. This proposal will investigate the relationship between the
subunit structure and disulfide bond reduction status on both the catalytic and
inhibitor binding properties of the predominant extracellular form of carbonic
anhydrase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These studies will contribute to
understanding the structure-function relationship of the extracellular carbonic
anhydrase, and to the identification of other important components of the system
by which Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells are able to efficiently concentrate
inorganic carbon to provide CO2 for photosynthesis.
