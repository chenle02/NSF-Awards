During the past decade, cryptographers have identified several directions to
meet future security demands like secure outsourced environments, robustness
against non-traditional attacks, and post-quantum crypto systems. Despite many
exciting advances, many of these instantiations are still far from practical,
which reduces their potential impact. This project will provide critical thrusts
towards reducing these restrictions in order to make these techniques more
applicable in practice. This project introduces new research-intensive courses
on homomorphic computation, defines appropriate research activities for training
students, and has numerous outreach activities to underrepresented groups
including middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on
improving two significant classes of lattice-based cryptography: (1) homomorphic
computation, and (2) security against non-traditional attacks. These two classes
provide powerful tools to secure data in both outsourced and portable
environments, and additionally achieve post-quantum security. Particularly, this
project starts with several recently developed techniques that connect
homomorphic computation with (1) improved efficiency of identity-based
encryption, (2) tighter/stronger security, and (3) non-traditional attacks. The
objective is to refine these recent approaches and design practically efficient
solutions. The outcomes would yield multiple efficient post-quantum crypto
systems, contributing to further post-quantum standardizations, and providing
secure methods for more advanced applications. Techniques developed in this
project are expected to bring critical insights for making a leap towards the
general goal, aiming at building truly practical solutions for all homomorphic
computation and security against non-traditional
attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
