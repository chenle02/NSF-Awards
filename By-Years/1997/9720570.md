9720570 Robinson Misfolding or misassembly of proteins is a major problem in the
biotechnology industry, in biochemical research, and in human disease. Folding
problems limit production of commercially important proteins, and existing
methods of recovering native protein from aggregates are often inefficient and
time-consuming. Aggregation has also been identified as the cause of a number of
human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and prion
spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. In order to
address the aggregation problems in production and to understand the molecular
determinants that drive aggregation in vivo and in vitro, the research plan is
to investigate the inhibition and reversal of protein aggregation of P22
tailspike by application of hydrostatic pressure. The results obtained will
serve as a foundation for studying other important protein systems, of both
industrial and medical relevance. ***
