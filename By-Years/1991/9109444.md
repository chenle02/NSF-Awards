In this project the principal investigator will initiate preliminary work to
determine the feasibility of extending one- dimensional techniques to
investigate the rates of convergence of two-dimensional Fourier series and more
general eigenfunction expansions of Sturm-Liouville type. In particular, she
will consider rates of convergence and the asymptotic behavior of partial sums
of functions of bounded variation and functions whose derivatives have bounded
variation. Problems involving eigenfunction expansions arise in a host of areas
of applied mathematics and engineering. There are two basic questions that need
to be answered. The first involves the rate of convergence of the expansion and
the second involves the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums as the number of
terms increases to infinity. The principal investigator plans on answering these
questions for series expansions in two dimensions by extending techniques that
have worked for series in one dimension.
