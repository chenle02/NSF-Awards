This planning grant will allow the Principal Investigator to develop a research
proposal for a program in ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy. The
research areas of interest are surface modification on a nanometer scale,
magnetic force microscopy of thin magnetic films, and the structural and
electronic properties of semiconductor surfaces.
