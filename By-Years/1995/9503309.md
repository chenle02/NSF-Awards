This project involves a number of fundamental problems in several areas of
algorithm design and analysis. The first area is pattern matching and in
particular, one-dimensional string matching. A major goal is to obtain tight
bounds on the performance of string matching algorithms (measured in
comparisons). The second is the amortization and the performance of splay trees.
This effort is directed towards making further progress on conjectures relating
to splay trees, conjectures such as the Split Conjecture, the Traversal
Conjecture and the Optimality Conjecture. The third is the area of parallel
algorithms. The goal is to obtain work-optimal algorithms which run as fast as
possible. Future work on two problems, graph connectivity and Voronoi Diagrams
is described.
