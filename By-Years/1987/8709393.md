Responding to a charge of the 99th Congress for "a study of critical problems
and current and future options regarding communications networks for research
computers, including supercomputers, at universities and Federal research
facilities in the United States," the Federal Coordinating Council for Science
Engineering and Technology will convene a workshop/conference of communications
and supercomputer experts from universities, industry, and Federal research
centers. The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) has agreed to host this
planning workshop/conference on February 16 - 20, SDSC will plan the logistics
of the meeting and assist in the preparation of advance materials and provide an
"on site" overview of a supercomputer center and a communication operation
center at their headquarters near the University of California, San Diego. This
proposal for a planning conference is exempt from peer review under Circular No.
132 4.c.(3)(b). Based on the foregoing, DNCRI recommends that a grant be made to
the GA Technologies for $13,688 to host a Planning Conference/Workshop for the
study of current and future options regarding advances in computer networks.
