When two elastic bodies of different temperature are pressed together the
resultant heat flux causes distortions and changes in the contact area. Recent
work has shown that this situation may not be stable but under suitable
conditions self-sustaining oscillations may be generated. Perturbation
techniques will be used in an analytical study of this oscillation phenomenon to
probe the stability boundary and transient behavior at onset of instability.
Materials combinations will be classified according to their qualitative
stability behavior.//
