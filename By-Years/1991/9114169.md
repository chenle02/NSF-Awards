Reliable dating techniques for young (< 1 million year old) mid- ocean ridge
basalts must be established to understand the space and time scales of magma
supply, fractination and eruption, and tectonism along spreading ridges and
within distinct segments. This is an application of step-wise heating 40Ar-39Ar
dating methods to well located, fresh samples the Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and East
Pacific Rise spreading ridges. Many of these samples have been dated by mass
spectrometric 238U-230U disequilibrium, and the two techniques will be compared
and intercalibrated.
