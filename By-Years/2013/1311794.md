Adsorbent-based nanotechnologies have been shown to remove various toxic
contaminants from water rapidly and efficiently to acceptable levels. The major
benefit of this nanotechnology is that it does not generate brines or other
toxic disinfectant byproducts like other water treatment methods. Currently,
point-of-use commercial membrane filters available in the marketplace are not
capable of simultaneous inactivation of microorganisms and removal of heavy
metals. This project presents an inexpensive and easy method to prepare
membranes capable of removing heavy metals and inactivate microorganisms in
water at an affordable price. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology has
economical and societal benefits since this water purification system is
portable, multi-functional, and presents a low fabrication cost. This technology
has the potential to be applied in industrial, military, and domestic settings.
Furthermore, this technology, successful, could help improve water quality
availability worldwide and relieve water-related diseases that kill more than
three million people in the world every year.
