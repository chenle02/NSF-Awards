This award, for $390,000, is for the development of integrated undergraduate
educational programs on semiconductor devices for electric power flow control.
The award is motivated by deregulation in the power industry and concomitant
needs for flexible AC power flow control. At the distribution level, the
semiconductor revolution has penetrated power levels which make adjustable speed
drives and other forms of power flow control possible. Despite great advances in
applications of semiconductors in power engineering, there is an absence of
educational efforts (courses, texts, software) which integrate topics in
semiconductor device physics with power electronic circuits and power
distribution systems.
