This group of researchers will continue to study various problems in the theory
of continuous parameter Markov processes at both the general level and the
specific level (especially in connection with stable processes), stochastic
calculus and potential theory. The potential theory associated with excessive
measures, capacities and related objects has been a subject of continuing
interest to Fitzsimmons and Getoor, and they expect to further their
investigations in this area.
