0201246&lt;br/&gt;Weingartner&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Alaska
Fairbanks provides instrumentation to significantly upgrade and expand the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Alpha Helix, a ship
operated by the University's Institute of Marine Science as part of the
University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.
Specific instrumentation supported here includes a towed, undulating vehicle
system for studying mesoscale processes, especially in physical and biological
interactions, as well as spares for the MOCNESS net system, a new phased array
acoustic current profiler, new incubators and spare CTD sensors. These shared-
use systems will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship
in their research during 2002 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
