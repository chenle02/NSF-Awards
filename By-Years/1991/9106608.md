All common approaches to parallelizing compilers, high-level languages such as
functional languages, and explicitly parallel languages - require a common base
of support. This work will encapsulate this support in a language that abstracts
over resource management decisions and machine details, and develops a runtime
support system on different classes of MIMD machines for implementing this
language. The language can then be used by implementors of other high level
approaches to parallel programming as a universal and efficient back-end. It can
also be used for efficient application programming. The language and the runtime
system will support dynamic load balancing, and small to medium computational
grainsize, to meet the above objectives. For expressiveness as well as
efficiency, the language will support a rich set of primitives for expressing
specific forms of information sharing. The runtime support system for the
language has been implemented already on distributed memory machines such as
iPSC/2, and shared memory machines such as Sequent Symmetry, and a preliminary
compiler has been written. Performance results on these machines have been
obtained on simple benchmarks and are very encouraging: they show that we can
obtain excellent speedups with many processors, while costing only a few percent
overhead over the best sequential C programs, on one processor.
