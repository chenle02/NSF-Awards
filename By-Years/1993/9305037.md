9305037 Maliga The proposed research is on the general area of nucleocytoplasmic
interactions: The objective is to identify nuclear genes that control the
expression of single Arabidopsis thaliana plastid genes. Specific objectives of
the research are: (i) Clone and sequence the plastid rbcL and psbA regions from
Arabidopsis. (ii) Test expression of reporter genes encoding B- glucuronidase
and luciferase under control of psbA regulatory sequences. (iii) Arabidopsis
seed mutagenesis and screening of M2 seedlings for nuclear mutants with altered
reporter gene (uidA, luc) expression. (iv) Established complementation groups,
determine map position of mutations. *** Through the project, methods will be
developed for the manipulation of the Arabidopsis plastid genome so that plastid
molecular biology and genetics can also benefit from this model system. %%%
