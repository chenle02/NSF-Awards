ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. CTS-0210840&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:
Chengzhi Cai, U Huston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By placing a single
functional molecule at the tip of an atomic force microscopy, it will become
possible to study the inter- and intramolecular interactions of single molecules
by force spectroscopy in a wide range of chemical and biological systems. The
goal of the project is to provide the preliminary information for preparation of
many forms of AFMS with single molecule tips. &lt;br/&gt;
