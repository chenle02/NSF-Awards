Insects have relatively simple brains, and chemicals are one of the strongest
external stimuli that affect their behaviors. For insects, external molecules
largely dictate behaviors such as attraction, repellence, change of direction or
action, and cessation of activity. Predicting insect behavior in response to
chemicals is vital to insect and neurobehavioral sciences, including
understanding production of organic and conventional insecticides, finding
natural repellents for biting insects, or isolating pheromones to attract
beneficial insects. To address these questions, the project long-term goal is to
develop an artificial insect brain called aiNsect by using machine learning
techniques and the neuro-physiological map of fruit fly brains. The planning
grant activities will be an important first step by supporting feasibility
studies and establishing collaborations.

By training aiNsect to interpret how insects respond to chemicals, it will
uncover the patterns and rules that guide those behaviors. This
interdisciplinary research, combined with ever-expanding advancements in AI,
will pave the way for learning programs that comprehend even subtle shifts in
behavior and the neurons involved. The project's primary objectives include: (A)
settling on an assay design that captures even the smallest movements of all
test subjects; (B) fostering collaboration across our network of Historically
Black Colleges and Universities, large research institution, non-profit and
commercial organizations and government agencies, R01s, non-profits, government
agencies, and commercial organizations; and (C) proving the feasibility of the
AI we propose with published code. This work will provide a fundamental base to
generate a research plan leading to a full submission to the HBCU-Excellence in
Research Program.
