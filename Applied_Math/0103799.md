Title: Relaxation and Regularity Theory in the Calculus of Variations:
Applications to Multiscale Problems, Thin Structures, and Magnetic Materials

The general objective of this project is the development of techniques in the
calculus of variations, geometric measure theory, and in the regularity theory
for systems of partial differential equations to address equilibrium and
stability problems involving both bulk and surface energies, and where the
admissible fields develop fast, multiple scale oscillations, and well as defect
concentrations. The underlying models include singularly perturbed energies,
multiscale homogenization, shape optimization for gradient-constrained
functionals, and multiscale problems for dimension reduction.

The research activity will be motivated by contemporary issues in materials
science and solid physics, where the contribution of mathematicians has already
paved the way to important advances in the theoretical understanding of advanced
materials and in high-technology performance. Emerging issues require state-of-
the-art techniques in applied analysis, new ideas, and the introduction of
innovative tools. The program contemplates the study of phase transformations
(e.g. nucleation and growth of phases, dynamics of phase boundaries, multi-phase
elasto-plastic materials), micromagnetism and ferromagnetism, nanostructures and
thin films, optimal design of composites, and multiple scale problems.
