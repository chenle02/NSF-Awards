This three-year project "Discrete Random Structures" will enable the Principal
Investigator, Anant Godbole, to consolidate his involvement with undergraduate
research by leading eight students each year in a series of contemporary and
high-level research endeavours, each designed to convince the participants that
they may contribute in a meaningful way to the development of the field of
mathematics. The team-members' problems, while emanating in areas such as
combinatorics; number theory; graph theory; geometry; algorithms; and molecular
biology, will have a stochastic flavor -- so that solutions will be sought
through the use of methods in contemporary probability and classical analysis.
The participants will be selected after a nationwide search, and will spend two
months at East Tennessee State University during the summer. Based on the
Prinicipal Investigator's track record over the last twelve years, it can be
predicted that the student researchers will each work on an average of two
problems, either individually or in teams of two or more, and be able to make
significant progress on at least one of these endeavors. The students' findings
will be presented at national meetings such as the Annual AMS/MAA Meeting, or at
a carefully selected Probability/Combinatorics conference. As in the past, every
effort will be made to submit the students' papers to high-level journals for
possible publication. We expect to select students from a broad range of
colleges and universities, and are totally committed to the vigorous recruitment
of women, minorities and disabled students.
