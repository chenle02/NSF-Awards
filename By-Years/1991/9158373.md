Recently developed ultrashort-pulse (10-20 fsec) laser technology is applied to
the study of the interaction of high- intensity laser pulses with plasmas, gases
and solids. Two areas are emphasized in this five-year Presidential Young
Investigator Program: 1) The interaction of intense laser pulses with waves in
plasmas to generate tunable radiation in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet
regions of the spectrum, as well as the acceleration of charged particles; and
2) the study of ultrafast x-ray physics, including time- resolved auger-electron
spectroscopy, x-ray absorption and diffraction and the chemical dynamic of x-ray
ionized molecules.
