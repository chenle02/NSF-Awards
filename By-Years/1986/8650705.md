Through the purchase of Macintosh microprocessors, interfaces and software,
psychology undergraduates at Averett College are able to learn research skills
using up-to-date instrumentation and data management methods. A sequence of
three lab courses requires students to take increasing responsibility for
conducting psychological research; and an increased number of students are
enjoying improvements in the quality and variety of research projects available
to them in the labs. Student research projects also are being automated using
Macintosh microprocessors, along with the software needed to control ten
research stations and to support data management, statistical analysis, and
graphics functions. Test chambers using either rats or pigeons as subjects have
been procured, further increasing the range of observations that can be made.
