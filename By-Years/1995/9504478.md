Proposal: DMS 9504478 PI: Purushottam Laud Institution: Medical College of
Wisconsin Title: Bayesian Nonparametric Methods and Model Selection ABSTRACT:
This research develops new statistical methods for Bayesian nonparametric
models, with special attention to problems arising in survival analysis. In
particular, the investigation focuses on (i) Beta process models for the
cumulative hazard function and some attendant Markov chain models, (ii) hazard
rate models using the Extended Gamma process, (iii) Cox's proportional hazards
regression model with priors on hazard rates and cumulative hazards, (iv) the
problem of variable selection in Cox regression, and (v) unimodal distribution
models. In all cases, emphasis is placed on priors for which implementable
computational algorithms can be developed. With the recent developments in
hardware and software, high-speed computer simulation technology has made it
feasible to surmount the computational problems in Bayesian statistical methods
which have been advocated on foundational grounds by many leading theoreticians
for decades. The research in this project concentrates on furthering such
methods in the area of survival analysis. Originating with applications to
product reliability in industry and to patient survival after intervention in
medicine, statistical analyses of survival data have proved valuable in
evaluating new materials, new manufacturing methods and new medical procedures.
The investigator studies and implements refined techniques for the analysis of
data arising in such fields of application.
