The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean Studies Board (OSB), will
provide guidance to the National Science Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences
and other Federal agencies on major ocean science and policy issues. This
request is for continued Core Support for the OSB. The OSB plans to consider
scientific issues related to coastal oceanography, the carbon dioxide cycle,
fisheries oceanography, marine molecular biology, "Oceanography in the 1990's",
and the Roger Revelle Distinguished Lecture Series-- over the next few years.
The OSB will also support U.S. ocean scientist to provide leadership in these
areas internationally, through support of the participation in the Scientific
Committee of Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council of Scientific
Unions (ICSU). The OSB will, thus, continue to contribute to maintaining the
health of ocean sciences in the United States.
