A Physics-Based Geometric Modeling and Design System This grant provides
funding for the research and development of a novel interactive design
environment that integrates traditional design principles with advanced physics-
based design techniques. The objective of this research is to explore and
develop flexible, efficient design tools in order for designers to improve the
efficiency of interactive design during the entire computer-aided design and
manufacturing process. This research takes the following three-fold approach to
achieve its goal: (1) Address numerical and algorithmic problems inherent to the
physics-based modeling and design approach in a systematic way; (2) Devise a set
of new force-based design toolkits and investigate the effective integration of
physics-based design with existing geometric design techniques and approaches;
and (3) Integrate all the theoretical advances gained during the first two
stages of this project and further develop an experimental physics-based design
environment with real-time interactive capability based on commercial modeling
and design systems. If successful, the results of this research will enable
designers to either utilize standard geometric design techniques for
conventional design or apply various physics-based force sculpting tools for
direct manipulation of geometric primitives in an integrated design environment.
Thus, these research advances could help to improve product quality, reduce
product cost, and increase the effectiveness of design engineers. Furthermore,
this project seeks to promote the rapid dissemination of physics-based design
techniques and the accompanying experimental design system to the US design and
manufacturing industry in order to realize the full potential of all the
research results. Ultimately, this project could advance the state of the art of
computer-integrated engineering and make significant contributions to geometric
and solid modeling, graphics, visualization, robotics, computational vision, and
virtual environments.
