Boltonia decurrens is on the Federal list of threatened plant species; and is
currently threatened in Illinois and endangered in Missouri. Its endangered
status is due to habitat loss resulting from channelization of the Mississippi
and Illinois Rivers. Following a disastrous flood in the American Midwest in
1993, state and federal agencies are re-evaluating flood control policies,
including the effects they have on floodplain plant species. The present project
will enable us to acquire knowledge concerning the habitat requirements of B.
decurrens, the effects of floodplain hydrology on the species, and how new
management practices can be implemented to reserve suitable habit for it and
other threatened floodplain species. The project will yield the most complete
picture of an endangered species ever obtained, and result in a model that can
be applied to other species in similar environmental systems. This knowledge
will reduce the waste of valuable resources by avoiding the hit or miss
preservation efforts which result from conservation actions in the absence of
sound biological knowledge.
