Richland College, the only Center of Academic Excellence for Information
Assurance 2-Year Education and Training (CAE/2Y) in Texas, is expanding its
Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree Digital Forensics and Information
Assurance (DF/IA) program to address a critical nationwide need for as many as
65,000 new specialists in cybersecurity. More specialists are needed to prevent
and investigate threats to the national cyber infrastructure such as theft of
data, disabling of networks, and communications disruptions. The project
objectives are: to develop a model on ground and online curriculum; to implement
a replicable strategy to create awareness of cybersecurity careers among
elementary and secondary school teachers, guidance counselors, students, and
parents; to shape articulation agreements and other transfer models with
universities (especially CAE/IAE institutions); and to create a learning model
that helps military veterans earn AAS degrees in DF/IA and advance into
technician-level careers and/or further education at universities.
