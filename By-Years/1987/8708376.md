This project is a comprehensive geochemical study of volcanism on the island of
Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. The volcanic rocks of this island are
representative of a chemically distinctive end-member among ocean island basalts
(OIB), and it is planned to fully characterize the trace element and isotope
geochemistry of these basalts by analysis of stratigraphically controlled
samples. Ratios among Sr, Nd, and Pb isotope analyses, combined with major and
trace element determinations, will be used to quantify mixing relationships and
ultimately to identify mantle sources for these basalts. This should help
identify the end-member mantle components which are responsible for the chemical
heterogeneity of OIB. Major and trace element geochemistry will be carried out
be Weaver at the University of Oklahoma, radiogenic isotope geochemistry be
Zindler at Lamont- Doherty Geological Observatory, and stable isotope
geochemistry by Harmon at the NERC Isotope Geology Centre in the UK.
