This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
conference "Classification of C*-algebras, Flow Equivalence of Shift Spaces, and
Graphs and Leavitt Path Algebras" that will be held from May 11-15, 2015, on the
campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

The purpose of this conference is to update the operator algebra community on
recent advances in the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras and
related topics. The feature activity in the event will be series of five
lectures by Soren Eilers of the University of Copenhagen. These will be
complemented by a small number of plenary lectures and a host of contributed
talks. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students,
postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
