This award supports cooperative research between a U.S. scientist, Dr. Richard
Vook, Syracuse University, and a Chinese scientist, Professor Zhang Jigao,
Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, on "The Role and Formation of
Thin Interfacial Layers in Sliding Electrical Contacts". This research will be
carried out using facilities at both institutions. The goal of this joint
research is to understand the formation and relevance of certain thin surface
layers on electrical contact phenomena. By combining the expertise of Dr. Vook
in surface science research and Professor Zhang in electrical contact research,
it is anticipated that a productive multidisciplinary approach to the complex
problems associated with sliding electrical contact phenomena will result.
