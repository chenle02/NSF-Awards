Professor Gabriel Kotliar has been given a Presidential Young Investigator award
to study a wide range of problems of current interest in condensed matter
physics. These include non- equilibrium phenomena such as dendritic growth,
disordered systems such as glasses and spin glasses, heavy fermions and
superconductivity. These are important problems and their understanding may have
significant impact on technology.
