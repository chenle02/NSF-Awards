9451614 Naumann Programming expertise is based on a solid theoretical foundation
as well as practical experience. At Southwestern, we teach formal derivation of
programs from specifications (as developed and practiced by Edsger W. Dijkstra,
David Gries, and others) as the central organizing topic of our first-year
courses in computing. Program derivation provides the foundation for most of the
student's subsequent study. To support the creation and revision of lengthy
programs and derivations, we propose to use a "proof editor" for which we need
workstation computers. The proof editor program will facilitate communication
among students and among faculty at a number of schools developing courses in
program derivation. Availability of advanced workstations will also enhance
student's practical experience in several other courses.
