Bourdin&lt;br/&gt;1312739&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to
contribute to the development, analysis, and implementation of variational
models for the mechanics of defects in solids, derived inductively from first
principles, analyzed using the same mathematical methodology, and implemented on
parallel supercomputers in a compatible numerical framework. Specifically, the
investigator studies a concept of thermodynamically consistent evolutions as an
alternative to global minimality for rate-independent material models. These
evolutions are based on criticality and energy balance and avoid some of the
paradoxes of global minimization while remaining compatible with first
principles. The investigator also develops a novel, rigorous, and efficient
numerical approach to plasticity, also based on a variational model.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The controversies around hydraulic stimulation in gas
shales, induced seismicity and subsidence near geothermal fields, and sinkholes
caused by collapsing made-man caverns and over-extraction of water from aquifers
highlight how technology has gotten ahead of the predictive understanding of
failure in solids. The goal of this project is to study consistent models for
the mechanics of defects. These models for fracture, damage, and plasticity are
well-rooted in theory yet applicable to realistic situations. They are
implemented on parallel supercomputers in such a way that they can easily be
combined in order to study complex problems. As applications, the investigator
studies fracture of deep underground salt domes leading to surface sinkholes,
fracture in thin films, which are commonly used in thermal barrier coatings in
turbines, and damage in the manufacturing of micro-mechanical devices and
sensors. The outcomes of this project affect diverse areas and industries
ranging from geo-mechanics to structural engineering.
