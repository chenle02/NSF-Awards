A high resolution, nonlinear, time dependent gravity wave model extending from
the surface to thermosphere has been recently developed (Bacmeister and
Schoeberl, 1988). Professor Strobel and Dr. Bacmeister will use this model in a
coordinated series of investigations to understand the role of gravity wave
forcing, propagation, breakdown and transport in the middle atmosphere. These
investigations will also involve the use observational data from STEP, AAOE and
AASE aircraft experiments, as well as MST observations to verify model results
and develop parameterizations for gravity wave stresses in general circulation
models. Results from the proposed investigation will have application to
modeling the transport of chemically active constituents in the middle
atmosphere, e g. H2O, CO, and O, and the transport of heat in the upper
mesosphere. The latter may directly affect the thermal structure in this
region.//
