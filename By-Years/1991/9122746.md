Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigation will be
conducted of species separation in a binary mixture. The species are smoke and
air. Unusually rapid separation of smoke particles was observed in preliminary
experiments in a vortex flow designed to study vortex breakdown. The process was
much too rapid to be due to centrifugal separation, and is not explainable with
conventional mechanisms. A further systematic exploration of the phenomenon,
together with numerical particle path simulations, is to be carried out. A new
mechanism for rapid species separation would be highly useful in separations
technology for a broad range of engineering systems.
