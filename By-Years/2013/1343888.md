This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the
"Eleventh East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium" that will be held from October
12-13, 2013, on the campus of the University of Cincinnati.

This event is the eleventh installment of a series that annually brings together
a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in
operator algebras and related topics. Among the topics to be discussed by
speakers at this year's meeting are the following: classification of C*-algebras
(the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and the Novikov
conjecture; rigidity and deformation theory; free probability and its
applications; subfactors and their invariants; C*-algebras and dynamical
systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate
students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
