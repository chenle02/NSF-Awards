The broader impacts of this I-Corps Node project are to develop programs and
resources that will accelerate the translation of fundamental research to
practical applications that will improve the well-being of society and increase
the economic competitiveness of the United States. These activities will also
result in increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others on a
national scale. The Node will actively work to engage the participation of
women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities, as well as
individuals from diverse economic regions and backgrounds, in all activities and
programs. The Node research will investigate utilization of business and
industry mentors and various methods of interaction to guide researchers
exploring commercialization of their technologies. The training and materials
developed by the Node, lessons learned, and the research findings will be shared
and disseminated widely across the region and nationally.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Node project will deliver I-Corps training
programs at research universities throughout New England, build a large regional
instructor pool with individuals from its academic partners., support and
collaborate with regional I-Corps Sites to enhance their programs, identify and
assist potential new I-Corps Sites, and investigate methods of assessing I-Corps
team composition and alternative models of mentoring. The Node will explore
creative and potentially transformative concepts and widely disseminate
findings, lessons learned, new content and training materials across the region
and the national innovation network. The Node will build and coordinate a
growing and robust pipeline of teams from across the region for the National
I-Corps Team program. It will provide additional support and nurturing for those
teams to continue to advance after completing the team program. This project
will enable MIT to reach and influence researchers across New England, to act
upon their ideas based upon basic research and initiate the exploration of
getting their inventions and discoveries to the
marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
