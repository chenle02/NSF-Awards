This project seeks to promote and advance the mathematical theory of free-
surface water waves and compressible fluids, which host a wide range of
interesting physical phenomena and whose dynamics is governed by the Euler
equations. The main goals are to develop new or extend existing analytic
techniques to establish existence and stability theory for steady water waves,
and to investigate uniqueness properties for weak solutions to one-dimensional
system of compressible gases. Progress in this project will enhance our
understanding of the mathematics of ideal fluids and develop novel mathematical
tools that can provide insight into truly nonlinear phenomena in partial
differential equations. This research will also involve training and
collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

This project will bring new perspectives and develop novel approaches to make
progress on some fundamental problems in the study of ideal fluids.
Specifically, the PI will use a novel global bifurcation theoretic machinery to
construct large-amplitude solitary water waves in presence of localized
disturbances coming from either submerged objects or the bottom topography. The
second topic of this project concerns stability of solitary water waves. The PI
will study the spectral stability of multimodal gravity-capillary internal
solitary waves and prove nonlinear transverse instability of gravity-capillary
internal solitary waves. The final track of the project consists of the study of
the non-uniqueness of entropy solutions to the compressible isentropic Euler
system. The main ingredients and techniques involved in the study include
bifurcation method, complex analysis, stability analysis, convex integration
machinery, and the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws.
