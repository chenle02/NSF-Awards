Abstract: US ? Japan Workshop on Future Directions for Earthquake Engineering
Research &lt;br/&gt;A US - Japan Workshop to explore future directions for
earthquake engineering research is proposed for March 6-7, 2010 in Tokyo, Japan.
Co-Chairs on the Japanese side are Professors Khoji Tokimatsu of the Tokyo
Institute of Technology and Mitsumasa Midorikawa of the Hokkaido University. US
co-Chairs are Professors James Wight of the University of Michigan and Mete
Sozen of Purdue University. The primary purpose of the workshop will be to
identify major challenges in earthquake engineering and to define research
initiatives that will mitigate the social and financial impact of future
earthquakes in the Asian-Pacific region. Workshop participants will be broadly
based, and thus, will be intellectually free to define research thrust areas
that have the highest potential to mitigate the earthquake threat without regard
for where the research will be conducted and what agencies will finance the
research. Workshop participants will be encouraged to pursue joint research
projects that address major initiatives defined during the workshop and will
facilitate a broader international exchange of students and young researchers
between the US and Japan. The Workshop report will provide guidance for future
research studies throughout the Asian-Pacific region, as well as for countries
around the world facing an earthquake threat.
