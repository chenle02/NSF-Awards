9632684 Brannon The listings of endangered species and the species recovery
plans proposed by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) administration agencies are
characterized by a lack of information on the genetics and biology of the
species. These omissions have resulted in ESA errors and higher public costs. To
help make the ESA more effective, and to increase coordination with state and
federal fishery agencies, a laboratory for ESA salmonid and freshwater species
research will be established to provide the genetic information and concomitant
conservation recommendations for current and candidate endangered species. Idaho
is the ideal laboratory site because the only remaining native fish of some ESA-
listed species (i.e. Snake River chinook salmon, Snake River sockeye salmon, and
Kootenai River white sturgeon) are found in the state.
