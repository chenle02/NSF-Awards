Geosat radar altimetry data have made a significant contribution to mapping of
seafloor topography. This grant provides partial funding for a workshop that
will review (1) the need for improved ocean bathymetry and gravity, (2) the
fundamental physical limitations for recovering seafloor topography from
measurements of the ocean surface slope, and (3) the mission requirements to
achieve significant improvements in accuracy and spatial
resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
