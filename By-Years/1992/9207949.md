If neutrinos have nonzero rest masses, then, either in matter or in vacuum, a
neutrino of one type can change into one of another. This phenomenon is known as
neutrino oscillation. In the present theoretical physics project, an attempt
will be made to achieve a more correct and thorough understanding of the
behavior of massive neutrinos in matter and in vacuum, and in particular a
better understanding of neutrino oscillation. Since the observation of neutrino
oscillation, with its implication that neutrinos have mass, could be the first
evidence for any physics beyond the well- established so-called "Standard Model"
of the elementary particles and forces, a correct understanding of oscillation
is very important.
