Julia Fulghum and Javed Khan of Kent State University are supported by the
Division of Chemistry under the Information Technology Research (ITR) program to
create new methods for the non-destructive, three-dimensional characterization
of heterogeneous, solid polymeric materials. Data will be acquired from polymer
samples of increasing complexity using a variety of analytical techniques,
including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass
spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. All of these methods
can be used to obtain chemical information from different sample volumes, and to
generate multidimensional data sets. Multivariate statistical analysis and
classification methods will be used to enhance interpretation of the acquired
data sets, ultimately enabling creation of a unified polymer framework, called
an active knowledge mesh. The combined system will create synergy between the
computer and the user in large and complex information space exploration, posing
interesting challenges for multi-modal data analysis and its multi-perspective
visualization.

Polymers are widely used in a variety of high technology applications. For
example, many current and proposed biomaterials are polymers, and polymers are
contained as well in composites used for a light aircraft and automobiles.
Commercially important materials often involve molecularly complex polymer
blends whose surface chemistry and structure are particularly challenging to
analyze. Outcomes from this project are expected to improve the understanding
and evaluation of complex polymer blend characteristics, and ultimately enable
enhanced control of technologically important materials properties.
