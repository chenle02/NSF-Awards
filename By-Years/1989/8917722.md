Pulsars are rotating neutron stars with strong magnetic fields that emit regular
pulsed signals in the radio and, in some cases, the optical and other
frequencies. These emissions are believed to be the result of complex processes
involving the acceleration of charged particles in the stars' surface magnetic
fields. The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate obser-
vationally and theoretically pulsar emission, with particular attention paid to
these topics: 1. determining the geometry of the magnetic fields in the emitting
regions; 2. investigating the processes that occur in the polar cap regions just
above the pulsars' surfaces and how they produce the pulsed radiation; and 3.
looking at the pulsar population as a whole (including X-ray and radio binary
pulsars, millisecond pulsars, as well as ordinary single radio pulsars) and
exploring neutron star formation and evolution. Observations will be carried out
at Arecibo, the Pushchino Observatory (Soviet Union), Bonn (West Germany), Green
Bank, and the VLA.
