PROPOSAL NO.: 0323222 Jaskyte&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Jaskyte,
Kristina &lt;br/&gt;TITLE: Organizational Culture and Innovation in Nonprofit
Organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study
seeks to enhance our understanding of the role of organizational culture in
facilitating innovation in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, it examines
the relationship between cultural consensus (degree to which employees share
organizational values), organizational values (the content of consensus), and
the structure of organizational culture and organizational innovativeness.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of the study will involve testing and
validation of the proposed model in a nonprofit organization called Communities
in Schools, which operates through 48 programs in Georgia. Data will be
collected using a variety of techniques: semi-structured interviews, surveys,
and organizational documents. After testing and validating the model, the second
phase of the study will include data collection in a larger sample of
Communities in Schools organizations in the states of North Carolina (27 sites),
Florida (17 sites), and South Carolina (30 sites).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
study will have important theoretical, methodological, and practical
implications. It will improve innovation models by incorporating organizational
culture into the conceptual model. By applying innovative theoretical and
methodological tools from the field of cognitive anthropology, the study will
address some of the conceptual and methodological issues plaguing innovation and
culture research. Finally, while the findings of this study will have
implications for all types of organizations - nonprofit, business, and public -
they will be especially relevant for nonprofit organizations partnering with
school systems. Having knowledge of how organizational culture affects
innovativeness of an organization will help not only organizational managers,
but also school administrators to identify the ways in which culture needs to
change in order to foster innovation, and to design managerial practices for
influencing and modifying organizational culture. &lt;br/&gt;
