Using cores collected in the Cariaco Basin (Venezuela) in 1990, proposed
analyses will focus on interannual and millennial-scale variability in
upwelling, regional wind strength, and the hydrological balance in northern
South America\ over the last 20-30 thousand years. Of particular interest will
be decadal records over the Little Ice Age and the Younger Dryas Event.
Comparison of varve and 14-C chronologies will provide the much-needed
independent record of e\secular 14-C variations through the last deglaciation.
