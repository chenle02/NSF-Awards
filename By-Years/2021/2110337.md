The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Coastal Pioneer Array was commissioned
in 2016 and is located off of the coast of New England. It was developed as a
relocatable asset, deployable over time periods appropriate to the scientific
questions at hand. It has been four years since the commissioning and now is the
appropriate time to consider the next location for the Pioneer Array. The
proposed project will assist NSF in determining the next location for the
Pioneer Array. The Sequestial Labs proposed would increase community
participation in the scientific endeavors funded by NSF. The workshops are
directly related to NSFâ€™s objective to enhance infrastructure for research and
education and the outcomes would contribute to enhancing oceanographic science
and would have important scientific, educational, and societal benefits.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI requests funding to hold community Sequential Lab
events (Micro Labs and Innovation Labs) that will bring ocean scientists,
educators, and other stakeholders together virtually to evaluate future location
options for the Pioneer Array. These Labs will inform the selection of the next
Pioneer Array site, as well as identify new science opportunities that can be
offered by the next site. This information will assist the National Science
Foundation and the OOI Program informing design decisions regarding sensor
configurations of the future Pioneer Array. The Labs will be modeled after the
Ideas Lab approach that has been effective in promoting innovation,
collaborations, and idea sharing. The services of a facilitator will be utilized
to design and deliver the Sequential Labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
