Title: Nonlinear Problems of Elasticity for Multiphase Solids and Shells

ABSTRACT

T. Healey plans to study various problems from nonlinear elasticity, with
applications to multi-phase, shape-memory solids and nonlinearly elastic shells
- especially bio-membranes or bio-shells. For the first class of problems,
coming from a field dominated by global-energy minimization techniques, the main
goal of the work is provide new tools and results concerning meta-stable
equilibria in the presence of loading and interfacial energy. For shell problems
the main goal is to understand non-axisymmetric equilibria of nominally
spherical shells, which has recently become an important question for lipid-
bilayer membranes or "bio-shells", which are ubiquitous in molecular-biological
structures. The nonlinear partial differential equations governing these models
are essentially untouched - from the point of view of analysis. The proposed
work is interdisciplinary and challenging, requiring tools and perspectives from
several different fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and partial differential
equations, bifurcation theory, nonlinear continuum physics, computational
methods, symmetry ideas, materials science and bio-physics.

The proposed work will provide new mathematical models and predictive analysis
for two seemingly different physical phenomena - phase transitions in shape-
memory solids and in bio-membranes. Of course the detailed mathematical models
for the two phenomena are distinct, but the overall approach and philosophy of
the project is the same. As verified in experiments, there is a "perfect" or
homogeneous state, which loses stability, after which more exotic patterns
emerge. The goal of the work is to provide new mathematical tools to predict and
understand the emergence and persistence of such phenomena from a quantitative
point of view. The work has direct connections to technology: Shape-memory
alloys are important in applications as "smart materials" and can potentially
provide actuation capabilities on the micro scale; the deformability and
mechanical behavior of bio-membranes is closely related to cell function, which
is of central importance in biology.
