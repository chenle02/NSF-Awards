Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are lesions that arise in DNA as a result of
exogenous insults (e.g., radiation and drug therapies) and normal metabolic
processes (e.g., DNA replication). Mammalian cells (e.g., mouse and human cells)
can use homologous recombination (HR) as one method to repair DSBs. In HR, the
damaged DNA molecule uses a very similar or identical, but undamaged DNA
molecule to guide the repair process. This is considered to be a very precise
method of repair. In addition to HR, there are other DSB repair pathways,
including nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in which ends are simply rejoined,
often with the loss of sequence information. The research in this project is
aimed at understanding mechanisms of DSB repair by HR in mammalian cells to
provide insight into how it precisely repairs damaged DNA without creating
genomic alterations. Another issue regards the influence of different DSB repair
pathways on each other. Loss of NHEJ leads to elevated levels of HR. This
project will address whether the DNA ends are processed differently when there
is loss of NHEJ and how this affects HR. Deficiency of HR, by loss of HR
proteins, will also be examined, to try to discern the exact step that is
affected by loss of individual HR proteins. Understanding mechanisms of HR, its
interrelationship with NHEJ, and the role of the protein components involved in
these processes will provide insight into how genomic integrity is maintained.
The project will also involve the training of graduate students and postdoctoral
research associates. &lt;br/&gt;
