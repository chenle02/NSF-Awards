This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused on several thrusts
in the area of fluid flow with complex, non- Newtonian fluids. The approach is
both theoretical/numerical and experimental. The areas are: composites, polymer
melts, and suspensions; viscoelastic instabilities; and material transport
characteristics. In addition, layer phenomena related to plasma etching and
bilayer lithography are included in the research plans. Impact of the research
will be on improved process control for superior material characteristics
involving electronic materials and solid fiber composites.
