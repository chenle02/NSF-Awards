This award will be used to expand the Principal Investigator's (PI) current
research program in cell-surface interactions into areas of application in
tissue engineering. The interaction of cells and tissues with polymeric material
surfaces will be investigated at the molecular and cellular level, addressing
both biomedical and biotechnological applications. The PI plans to determine
material surface properties and surface-protein-cell interactions that lead to
the desired protein, cell and tissue behavior.
