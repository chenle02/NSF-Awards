9408860 Wood ABSTRACT The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs)
are proposed to have roles in brain development by modulating actions of
insulin-like growth factors (IFGs). To directly test the role IGFBP-2 in the
developing nervous system, Dr Wood established a mutant line of mice deficient
in IGFBP-2. In these studies she proposes to study both normal and IGFBP- 2
deficient mice to test the hypothesis that IGFBP-2 modulates the rate of cell
division in the developing brain and to study the interactions between the
IGFBPs, IGFs and other growth factors in the central nervous system.
