Four high impact science projects will be carried out to advance key science
areas identified in the U.S. Astro2010 Decadal Review, namely characterizing and
understanding: dark matter and dark energy, the environments of supermassive
black holes, the formation and evolution of early galaxies and gas-giant
protoplanets, and General Relativity in a strong gravity regime. All data will
be publicly released to ensure the U.S. community is provided with a valuable
scientific legacy. The associated education program supports twin goals of
training and mentoring students in the technology and science of adaptive
optics, and broadening the participation of women and underrepresented groups in
instrumentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The required science performance will be
achieved via the addition of new capabilities on one of the world?s largest
telescope, the 10-m diameter Keck I telescope. In theory the larger the
telescope the more detail can be seen. In practice these details are lost by the
blurring effect of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics systems
are designed to measure and correct for this blurring. The measurements are made
using a source above the turbulence; a star or, to allow more objects to be
observed, an artificial star created with a laser. The new capabilities that
will be added to the existing Keck I adaptive optics facility include multiple
laser guide stars to better measure the atmospheric turbulence, the use of new
techniques to measure the turbulence components not measured by the laser guide
stars, and new image processing methods for the adaptive optics corrected
images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
