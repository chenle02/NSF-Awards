The Neurobiology of Cognition conference will enhance communication and
collaboration among scientists from several disciplines, theoreticians, and
technical development specialists. It emphasizes both the most recent findings
in traditional "core" areas, such as memory and decision making, as well as
several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to
the human brain's cognitive abilities; 2) implications of machine learning for
cognitive neuroscience; and 3) cognition in natural contexts. The program is
highly interdisciplinary, bringing together scientists who use behavioral,
neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals
with investigators who use computational approaches to construct realistic
models of cognitive operations to guide future
experimentation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide registration, or
registration and travel, for up to 40 doctoral and postdoctoral trainees and
early-career scientists to attend the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), which
prepares attendees for more in-depth participation in the Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition that immediately follows. The
format promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from
different disciplines and, in particular, between experimentalists and
theorists. The program is about 40% female, which approximately matches the base
rate representation of women in this sub-discipline of neuroscience. The GRS and
GRC will expose early-career scientists to novel, state-of-the-art experimental
and theoretical approaches that promise to elucidate fundamental principles of
cognition.
