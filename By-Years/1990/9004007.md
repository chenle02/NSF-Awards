The proposed research will focus on the mineralogic, and structural features
preserved in gabbros and basalts of the Kap Edvard Holm, Nordre Aputiteq and
Patulajivit complexes in order to characterize processes of elemental mass
transfer related to hydrothermal metasomatism, stoping and assimilation during
rifting in the North Atlantic. To achieve these goals we will address the
following questions: 1) What are the cumulative effects of multiple intrusions
on hydrothermal metasomatism and the evolution of porosity and permeability in
gabbroic plutons and basaltic rocks? 2) How does hydrothermal metasomatism of
host rocks affect subsequent mass transfer from host rocks to magma during
stoping and assimilation? Completion of the research outlined in this proposal
will provide a framework for understanding the geochemical and structural
evolution of gabbro-hosted magma-hydrothermal systems during crustal rifting.
