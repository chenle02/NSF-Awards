9632633 Prather This project addresses natural modes in atmospheric chemistry,
defined as patterns in the concentrations of atmospheric chemical species. The
pattern can include co-variation of coupled chemicals (e.g., methane, carbon
monoxide, and hydroxyl radical), the vertical and/or latitudinal gradients in
trace gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, ozone), or even the seasonal cycle of a trace
gas at a location. Prior work has show that natural modes are a mathematically
rigorous, fundamental property of the chemical transport system and do not
depend on the manner of forcing; a unique mixture of modes is excited by
perturbations to a single species; true time scales in atmospheric chemistry are
often different from the steady-state lifetimes; and the steady-state lifetime
and pattern can be derived from the natural modes. Therefore, identification of
the natural modes in current atmospheric chemical transport models is useful for
diagnostics, but also for prediction. In particular, models used for
understanding the impact of anthropogenic emissions of trace gases such as
methane, methyl bromide, or nitrous oxide on global ozone distribution have
reached a large degree of complexity. Natural mode analysis could help in
analyzing model results and explain effects such delayed recovery of ozone
depletion after stopping emissions of a short-lived gas like methyl bromide. In
the course of this project, this analysis technique will be further developed
and extended to more complex 1-dimensional, as well as 2- and 3-dimensional
systems. ***
