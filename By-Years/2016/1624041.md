This award supports a workshop designed to explore indigenous perspectives on
scientific research and research processes in western Alaska. The workshop will
focus on: a) the types of scientific research being conducted in and near
indigenous communities of the Kawerak region; b) how these studies are being
conducted, whether collaboratively with communities or not; c) and to elicit the
impressions and suggestions of indigenous communities about the science being
conducted in their region and how they might engage more directly with the
scientists and their projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring
together approximately 20 individuals, most of whom will be Alaska Native people
from western Alaska who are involved in scientific research and knowledgeable of
the research being conducted in the region. Additional workshop participants
will include other science research stakeholders, including some of the
scientists doing research in the region. The workshop organizers will structure
the multi-day workshop around the topics and objectives outlined above. A report
summarizing and analyzing the results of the workshop will be produced which
addresses the main research topics and questions and suggests avenues for future
research on this topic. An additional goal for the workshop is to lay some of
the groundwork for a full research project that would be a meta-study of
scientific research in Alaska Native communities from an anthropological
perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the NSF Division of Ocean
Sciences (OCE), Ship Operations Program, is contributing to the workshop; the
Kawerak Region is on the Bering Sea and the program is very interested in ways
that ship-based science can engage local people, primarily Alaska Native
communities, in their research projects. These specific questions will be one of
the topics of discussion for the workshop.
