DMS-0305094&lt;br/&gt;Frederick R. Cohen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI intends to
study problems with origins in classical&lt;br/&gt;homotopy theory as well as
their overlap with function spaces,&lt;br/&gt;cohomology of groups, and
properties of classical configuration &lt;br/&gt;spaces. The specific problems
are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Extend the P.I.'s recent solution of a 25 year
old&lt;br/&gt;conjecture of M.G. Barratt on the growth of torsion
in&lt;br/&gt;the homotopy groups of certain finite complexes.&lt;br/&gt;(2)
Analyze these structures for other finite complexes&lt;br/&gt;through simplicial
models for iterated loop spaces as&lt;br/&gt;developed by the P.I., and R.
Levi.&lt;br/&gt;(3) In joint work of the P.I., J. Berrick, Y. Wong, and J.
Wu,&lt;br/&gt;continue to analyze the interplay between braid groups,
and&lt;br/&gt;the homotopy groups of the 2-sphere. These connections
extend&lt;br/&gt;in joint work with D. Cohen to analogues of classical
modular&lt;br/&gt;forms obtained from the cohomology of the braid groups
with&lt;br/&gt;coefficients in a symplectic representation.&lt;br/&gt;(4) In
joint work with A. Adem, and D. Cohen, continue to&lt;br/&gt;analyze the
structure of spaces of representations of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental groups of
complements of complex hyperplane&lt;br/&gt;arrangements, and their associated
vector bundles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main directions here is a
connection between&lt;br/&gt;Artin's braid groups, and the classical problem of
enumerating&lt;br/&gt;ways of continuously wrapping spheres of any dimension
around&lt;br/&gt;other geometric objects. The methods can be thought of
as&lt;br/&gt;enumerating topological properties of many particles,
not&lt;br/&gt;allowed to collide, moving through time. The
methods&lt;br/&gt;overlap with several mathematical structures
given&lt;br/&gt;combinatorially as well as number theoretically.
These&lt;br/&gt;methods involve the "geometry of braids", and how
this&lt;br/&gt;structure encodes counting problems through connections
to&lt;br/&gt;other mathematical
objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
