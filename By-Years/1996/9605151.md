This award supports a planning visit to India by Dr. Mahadev Bhat, from the
Department of Environmental Studies at Florida International University, to
visit Dr. Anil Gupta, of the Indian Institute of Management, Dr. K. N. Ninan, of
the Center for Ecological Studies at the Institute for Social and Economic
Change, and with local government officials in Ahmedabad and Bangalore, for the
purpose of developing a research project on the causes and resolutions of multi-
tier conflicts associated with changing global intellectual property rights for
biotechnology. Technology's impact on how people work and increases in
international economic endeavors cause changes to intellectual property rights.
