The polarization vector of laser light can be modulated in time and space to
produce what is referred to as structured light. Structured light has been a
powerful tool in optical manipulation, communications, imaging, and microscopy,
as it provides access to phenomena not otherwise visible. The research effort
supported by this award aims to drive and probe new phenomena in interactions of
structured laser beams with plasmas, states of matter consisting of a
significant portion of positively-charged ions and free electrons. High-power
elliptically polarized and vortex laser beams will be used to produce plasma
harmonics with tunable ellipticity and vorticity of the polarization state.
Interactions of structured light with plasmas will provide new insights into
their optical and magnetic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
investigates new theoretically predicted phenomena in relativistic laser-matter
interactions using uniquely structured laser beams tailored in space and time as
well as through their polarization state. The objectives of the proposed
measurements are to produce elliptically polarized and vortex harmonic beams
from plasma mirrors and, for the first time, demonstrate the ability to control
their polarization state and vorticity by tuning the energy, ellipticity, and
vorticity of the driving laser beam. Experimental results will be compared to
the results of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
