Information-theoretic security is the science of safeguarding information across
a communication network based on the use of concepts and techniques in
information theory. It encompasses protection against eavesdropping,
impersonation, and substitution attacks made by potential adversaries present in
the network. Whereas eavesdropping and impersonation attacks (and solutions) are
well studied, substitution attacks, in which the adversary replaces messages
from a source by different valid messages from the same source, present new
risks in an increasingly networked world. This work explores how it is possible
to make use of side information that is often available in a typical
communication network to check against substitution attacks made directly on raw
messages by potential adversaries in the network. This frees the process of
guaranteeing information integrity of the messages from the requirements of
secrecy and authentication, and better isolates the mathematical structure that
leads to information integrity in relation to the network topology.

The separation principle developed in this work then allows one to more easily
incorporate secrecy and authentication back into the overall information-
theoretic security design. The broader implications of information-theoretic
network security are increasingly manifest in electronic commerce, reliable
communications, and confidentiality of legal, proprietary, diplomatic, and
medical information.
