This proposal contains a research program that systematically covers a novel
source discovery problems involving dynamic visibility, the Poisson equation,
the heat equation, and the wave equations posed in complicated, non-simply
connected domains. These problems are motivated by robotic path planning
applications. Assuming sparse and sequential measurements of data, the PI and
collaborators propose new robotic path algorithms along which new measurements
can be added in order to efficiently determine plausible source locations and to
reach particular vantage points such that the plausible source locations are
under visual surveillance. The PI further studies situations in which obstacles
in the domains are partially known through the visibility along the robotic
path.

Consider the situation in which a robot, sent into an unknown environment, is
supposed to discover the location of a signal source and place it under its
line-of-sight in an efficient manner. The unknown environment contains non-
penetrable solid obstacles and should be avoided along the robot's path. In this
environment, the properties of the signal, such as the signal strength, are
assumed to satisfy certain mathematical equations. The robot gathers
measurements from two different sensors: a range sensor that gives distance from
the robot to the surrounding obstacles, and a sensor that measures the signal
strength that is being emitted from the yet-to-be-located source. While
measurements can be taken anywhere, the PI and the collaborators are interested
in having the robot take very few measurements with its sensors. This
consideration is particularly relevant to efficient surveillance and anti-
terrorism applications. The goal is to design an robust algorithm that
determines how the robot should navigate through the environment and where along
its path it should take measurements so that the ob jective of discovering
signal sources and their surveillance can be achieved efficiently.
