The objective of this project is to study the analytical aspects of inverse
scattering in tow spatial dimensions. The topics include: 1) determining the
best function classes for inverse scattering on the plane which yield well-
posedness for Cauchy problems for nonlinear evolution equations; 2) developing
numerical algorithms for nonlinear evolution equations based on inverse
scattering; 3) analyzing the emergence and development of solitons from general
data; 4) propagation of singularities of nonlinear hyperbolic equations. The
equations involved in this research have applications to problems in fluid
mechanics, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, etc.
