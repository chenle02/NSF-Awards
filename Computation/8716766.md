This research deals with the numerical solution of multidimensional problems by
spectral methods. The aim is to retain the rapid convergence of these methods
that might otherwise be lost due to corner singularities in the underlying
solution. The approach adopted in this research uses appropriate singular basis
functions which will append the rapidly converging Chebyshev expansion for the
smoother part of the solution. Corner singularities occur in a variety of
problems with important engineering applications. This work should lead to
increased computational ability in application areas such as driven cavity
flows, cracked beams with torsion, and convection in nuclear reactors.
