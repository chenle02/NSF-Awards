The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study&lt;br/&gt;(IAS)
was formed in 1930 at the founding of the IAS. The initial&lt;br/&gt;goal of the
School was to provide a haven for scholars where they&lt;br/&gt;could work in an
environment that was exceptionally favorable for&lt;br/&gt;conducting research.
Over the years, other roles have emerged&lt;br/&gt;and the School has assumed
additional responsibilities including&lt;br/&gt;guiding junior visitors in their
research and organizing special&lt;br/&gt;programs that widen the School's
coverage of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Although it has functioned in an
international context, the main&lt;br/&gt;impact of the Institute has been on
the U.S. mathematical&lt;br/&gt;community, with a majority of its visitors
having come from or&lt;br/&gt;been absorbed by it. The Institute frequently
conducts programs&lt;br/&gt;in special areas of mathematics. Topics of some
recent and&lt;br/&gt;forthcoming programs include symplectic geometry and
holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves, theoretical computer science and discrete
mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;motivic homotopy theory, computational complexity, and
stochastic&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations and models of
turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support postdoctoral and mid-
career visiting&lt;br/&gt;researchers at the School of Mathematics of the
Institute for&lt;br/&gt;Advanced Study with the goal of supporting a wide
spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical research at the highest level. This activity
will&lt;br/&gt;provide these researchers unique opportunities for
consultation&lt;br/&gt;and collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;
