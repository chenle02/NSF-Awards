9410188 Chen The investigator will study various Boussinesq systems which
describe the two-way propagation of water waves in a nonlinear, dispersive
media. The major goal for this project is to decide which system of equations is
best suited for the modelling of physical problems in fluid mechanics. The
investigator will study the systems both theoretically and numerically, and
compare results with laboratory experiments. The investigator will also be
involved in developing and implementing an efficient algorithm for the computer
modelling of water waves through numerically integrating the full Euler's
equations. The numerical results obtained here will also provide a source for
the verification of Boussinesq systems. In addition, the investigator will
continue research on the recently developed idea of Inertial Multigrid
Algorithms. The dynamical behavior of the algorithms will be studied from the
perspective of bifurcation theory. The investigator will study the bifurcation
diagram generated by the numerical approximation and compare it with that of the
underlying continuous problem. In practice, this means examining the numerical
method for all range of the physical parameters at once. ***
