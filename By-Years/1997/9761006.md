*** 9761006 Carrig This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
project uses advanced solid-state laser technology and lidar engineering for a
compact, turn-key, eyesafe differential absorption lidar (DIAL), suitable for
range-resolved atmospheric profiling of ozone to distances of up to three
kilometers. Such systems are needed in municipalities in ozone nonattainment
status in order to target actual pollution sources. The new DIAL system is based
on a frequency-agile ultraviolet (UV) laser transmitter that is substantially
smaller and more efficient than existing UV laser sources. This will permit
mobile remote sensors that are lighter, more compact, and potentially less
expensive than current UV DIALS. Further, Phase I will incorporate lidar
transceiver technology effective in flight-qualified wind-sensing systems. This
includes a real-time signal processor with an easy-to-use graphical user
interface. In Phase I a complete turn-key system design will be completed. In
Phase II a prototype device would be built. The applicability of this lidar for
atmospheric measurements of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter will also be
investigated. The primary market is local and regional municipalities declared
to be in ozone nonattainment status. The sensor can be modified for profiling of
sulfur dioxide. The instrument will also be scaleable for long-range
tropospheric and stratospheric ozone measurements. ***
