The focus of this project is to examine situations where finite- or infinite-
dimensional parameters are to be estimated from i.i.d variables from a common
distribution and to apply a generalized theory of adaptive and efficient
estimation. Specific applications include inference for software reliability and
field testing, response functions under shape restrictions, gene mapping
procedures and the construction of similarity indices in molecular biology. This
project will take some very general theoretical results and refine these for
specialized complexities seen in particular circumstances.
