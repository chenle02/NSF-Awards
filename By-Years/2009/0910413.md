The primary objective of this workshop award is to reflect recent advances on
several fronts of processing multiphase polymeric materials and to address major
challenges related to design and processing issues in multiphase materials for
an array of application areas including electronics, alternative energy,
aerospace and biomedicine. The Multiphase Polymer Symposium will be held in
conjunction with the American Chemical Society Spring National Meeting at the
Convention Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, March 22 - 26, 2009.

The symposium will include scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of
disciplines and will provide a platform for a globally diverse community of
engineers from the United States, Asia and Europe. The extensive interactions
among industry, academia and research institutions facilitated by the symposium
are expected to catalyze collaborations in the area of multiphase materials
processing which can yield important advances in several industries.
