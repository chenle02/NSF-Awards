This research explores the nucleation of martensite with emphasis on
premartensitic properties of the parent phase. Of interest are premartensitic
dynamics and the nucleation of martensite at frequencies considerably slower
than accessible by inelastic neutron scattering. Dynamical information pertinent
to the deformation of martensite in the lower frequency regime is experimentally
determined through application of internal friction, stress relaxation, and
time-resolved X-ray scattering studies. Metal alloys which show premartensitic
anomalies are selected for the experiments.
