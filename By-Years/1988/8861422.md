The research addresses the development of a computer-based model to perform
concurrent life-cycle analysis for the design of advanced launch system
concepts. The motivation for this effort stems from the high cost of
manufacturing, operating, and supporting current Earth-to-orbit vehicle designs.
Presently, design, manufacturing, operations, and support domains are addressed
serially with little integration; thus, results from one area tend to drive up
costs in other areas. The lack of a defined set of procedures and functional
relationships makes it difficult to trace high cost drivers. The proposed
research will develop a methodology and subsequent computer model to
concurrently address each of the four domains to reduce the life-cycle cost of
the overall system. This work will consist of concurrent life-cycle analysis
methodology development, computer model architecture definition, and proof-of-
concept model demonstration.
