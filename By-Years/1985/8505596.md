The international building research community is meeting in Washington, DC,
during September 21-26, 1986, at the International Council for Building
Research, Studies, and Documentation's (CIB) 10th Triennial Congress (CIB.86). A
travel grant program is being established to enable a number of highly qualified
technology experts to attend CIB.86. Many research organizations and
universities have qualified staff but lack the resources for travel per diem and
registration fees to attend meetings other than their respective professional
societies. It is important for the U.S. building community and CIB to attract as
many experts to participate in this Congress as possible, to share a broader
knowledge of building research, and to further extend technology application.
The end goal is improved building practices for a better quality of life
worldwide. This travel grant program supports economy airfare, per diem and
subsistence expenses, and registration fees.
