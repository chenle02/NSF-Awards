Multivalent impurity centers in silver chloride and silver bromide play an
important role in photographic processes. This project uses perturbed angular
correlation measurements of indium-111, which is introduced as a probe nucleus
in the silver halides. The research addresses the structure of the indium-
vacancy complex, electron and hole trapping at the defect complexes, stability
of the complexes, the dynamics of vancancy motion around the complexes, and the
metastability of the configurations following nuclear decay to cadmium -111. The
primary objective of the research is to improve the understanding of defect
properties in halides, and to relate the results to the role that these or
similar defects play in the photographic process. The research involves a
university-industry collaboration between the University of North Carolina and
Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, New York.
