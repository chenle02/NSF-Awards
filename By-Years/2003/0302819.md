The Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College, in
partnerships with the leading researchers and policy makers in renewable biomass
energy technologies, is establishing a technician training program in this
field. The Institute has recently converted the College's all-electric campus to
a biomass heating system. This biomass system at the College serves as the focal
point for the project. The goal of this project is to establish a biomass
technology demonstration site in the Northeastern United States where industry
and government decision-makers, students, and educators can learn about
renewable biomass energy technologies. A long-term goal of the Institute is to
produce replicable undergraduate curriculum for development of skilled workers
in emerging renewable biomass energy technologies and policies. Specific
activities for this one-year period include: expanding relationships to include
new partners in the development of biomass energy; developing support among
State and Federal agencies involved in renewable energy technology and policy;
and creating an Advisory Board of regional and national stakeholders in the
field.
