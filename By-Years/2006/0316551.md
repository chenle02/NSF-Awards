John Straub of Boston University is co-supported by a grant from the Theoretical
and Computational Chemistry and Molecular Biophysics Programs to continue his
efforts at developing computational methods that enable the accurate description
of protein dynamics on both long and short time scales. Such techniques must
identify and isolate thermodynamically important low lying energy basins and
effectively sample those basins and move between them in a way that produces
exact thermodynamic averages. A current emphasis is on improving the means for
proper accounting of solvation energies that influence protein configurational
distributions. Two specific applications are studied. First, with respect to
vibrational energy flow, current interest is on exploring the nature of heme
cooling as function of protein type and solvent environment. Second, a coarse-
grained potential energy function is being improved to enable studies on
lysozyme folding dynamics. Methods used for these studies include Monte Carlo
simulations, path-integral methods, molecular dynamics and quantum-chemical
methods

The ability to computationally understand biological processes requires methods
that can accurately describe processes that occur on vibrational time scales and
protein folding which requires longer time scales. Predictive capabilities on
the vibrational time scale allows one to predict relaxation kinetics and
directly test such predictions by comparing aspects of theoretically deduced
vibrational spectra to experimentally determined results. Computational
deduction of protein-folding mechanisms and pathways requires accurate and
efficient coarse-grained models that are significantly more complex then those
that are currently available. The new techniques being developed and advanced by
Straub are beginning to be used for simulating chemical and biophysical
processes. Further improvements will significantly impact the field of
computational biology.
