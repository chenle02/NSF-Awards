The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Information Management
Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with the
University of Arizona will support research that integrates information system
concepts into end-user computing research. It will emphasize the application of
information systems theory to the current and future business and government
environments. It will promote the integration of advanced information
technologies in storage, retrieval, transmission, etc., with traditional
information systems, and develop a framework for the management of information
systems which is consistent with the organizations' management systems. This
Center was coordinated with Dr. Stephen Wolff, Division of Networking and
Communications Research and Infrastructure. The Program Manager recommends that
the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with the University of
Arizona be awarded $200,000 each year of a five-year continuing grant. The Army
Institute for Research and Management Information Communications and Computer
Sciences (AIRMICS) is providing a $100,000 per year to co-sponsor the Center.
Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or the Director of
The Engineering Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a
number of renewal criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which
university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) extent to
which the support base for the center is expanding; (3) extent to which a robust
research program is developing. If review is satisfactory, the Program Manager
will recommend support of the next period of this continuing grant.
