Hysteresis is a ubiquitous phenomenon arising in diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas of
engineering. In applications, it is closely linked to&lt;br/&gt;energy
dissipation, and it is associated with quasi-static&lt;br/&gt;memory-dependent
behavior. Many applications involve&lt;br/&gt;rate-dependent hysteresis, which
merges quasi-static hysteresis&lt;br/&gt;with fully dynamic behavior, thereby
yielding quasi-static&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis as a limiting feature of dynamic
system properties. In&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research, we plan to develop
differential models for&lt;br/&gt;rate-dependent hysteresis and use these models
for nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;system identification and adaptive feedback control. The
proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will simplify and extend existing hysteresis models
and&lt;br/&gt;provide new techniques for identification and control
of&lt;br/&gt;hysteresis in diverse applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
