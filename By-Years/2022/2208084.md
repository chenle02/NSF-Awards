This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop
a novel noninvasive device for detecting and diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux.
Reflux occurs when a bolus of gastric contents flows from the stomach into the
esophagus. Symptoms of reflux can include chronic cough, choking, difficulty
breathing or swallowing, upper airway infections, and chest pain. These symptoms
can also be associated with other serious medical conditions. The proposed
technology will aid clinicians in quickly being able to assess their patientsâ€™
symptoms and determine if reflux is the underlying cause. A noninvasive
diagnostic modality for assessing reflux could save the healthcare system $10
billion annually, allow clinicians to provide improved care to their patients,
and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of the 80 million Americans who are affected
by reflux-related symptoms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation
Research (SBIR) Phase II project will continue the development of a patented
technology which uses pulse-echo ultrasound and proprietary algorithms in a non-
conventional way to create an acoustic signature. The acoustic signature can
detect and differentiate a bolus in the esophagus. The esophagus distends in
response to a bolus of material, eliciting the esophageal layers to change in
respect to one another. These changes can be observed with ultrasound sensors
placed externally on the skin. This project will develop and validate electronic
hardware, software, and custom ultrasonic transducers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
