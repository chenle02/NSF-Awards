0405210&lt;br/&gt;Forbes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year US-UK cooperative
research award supports visits by undergraduate students and the principal
investigator to the University of East Anglia. David Forbes of the University of
South Alabama and his UK counterpart, Robert Stockman, propose to conduct
chemical studies of sulfur ylides and apply their methodologies to medicinally
important compounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Undergraduates at
Alabama will participate in several research projects during three-month stays
in East Anglia. They will focus on the use of chiral sulfinyl imines as
receptors using a methylidene transfer approach and stidy sulfur ylides in model
systems. The research project's ultimate goal is to develop a complete synthesis
of a system of biological and medicinal importance.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This international collaboration is
highly complementary and combines the expertise of investigators in synthetic
organic chemistry and their different synthetic methodologies. It also provides
an international research and training experience to undergraduate researchers
from a predominantly undergraduate US institution in an EPSCoR state.&lt;br/&gt;
