Principles and applications of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry is being
introduced into the chemistry curriculum as one phase of improving chemical
education. Through the purchase of a bench top GC/MS complete with computer
operating system and software the students are being given the opportunity to
gain hands on experience with this powerful modern analytical technique. The
instrumentation is being introduced in analytical and advanced opportunities
sequence and carries over into organic, inorganic, physical and biochemistry
courses. The project is fostering within the undergraduates the familiarity,
knowledge, and expertise in modern chemical instrumentation required for
successful undergraduate research, careers in industry or entry into
professional and graduate schools. Through an advanced opportunity program,
students are being exposed to the major areas of chemical instrumentation in
their freshman and sophomore years. Analytical instrumentation, presently
fragmented throughout the curriculum, is being brought together in a unified
junior level advanced analytical course. A new emphasis is being brought to
undergraduate research within the department. The grantee is matching the award
from non-Federal sources.
