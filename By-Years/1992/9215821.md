The objective of this work is to prepare and publish an identification atlas of
the galaxy M33, which is one of the two closest galaxies to our own. This atlas
will make astronomical research on various objects within the galaxy more
efficient, and will be particularly useful in the coming era of very large
telescopes. Charts as well as tabular and positional material will be included.
The Principal Investigator is a highly regarded expert in this field.
