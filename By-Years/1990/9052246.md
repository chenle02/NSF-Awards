An immunology course is being developed to teach students modern immunology and
some of its experimental approaches. In the laboratory, students learn state-of-
the-art techniques that are used in many different aspects of immunological
research. They generate and characterize novel monoclonal antibodies, learn
tissue culture techniques and the theory and practise of immunoassays. The
equipment purchased for tissue culture includes laminar flow hoods, a CO2
incubator, a centrifuge, and inverted microscopes. For immunoassays, the
equipment includes a plate puch kit for immunodiffusion assays, a plate reader
for enzyme-linked immunoassays, and the apparatuses for Western blot analysis.
The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.
