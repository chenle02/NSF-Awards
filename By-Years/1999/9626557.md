Michael Morse of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental
Physical Chemistry Program to continue his investigations on the chemical
bonding and electronic structure of diatomic transition metal molecules using
electronic spectroscopy. The methods to be employed include resonant two-photon
ionization spectroscopy, laser-induced and dispersed fluorescence
spectroscopies, and resonant two-photon pulsed field ionization zero electron
kinetic energy photoelectron spectroscopy. In all cases, the sample will be
generated by pulsed laser ablation of the appropriate metal target, followed by
supersonic expansion. The expansion reduces the complexity of the spectra
associated with the open d subshell systems, facilitating interpretation of the
spectra. Research will focus on the transition metal silicides, homo- and
heteronuclear transition metal diatomics, and on diatomic platinum. In the
latter case, a detailed comparison to ab initio quantum chemistry will provide
an important test for relativistic theories of chemical bonding. These studies
will greatly enhance our understanding of the chemical bonding between
transition metals and will provide important tests for the development of
theoretical methods applicable to transition metal systems. For example, very
little is known about the transition metal silicon bond, despite the wide use of
transition metal silicides in microelectronic devices, solar cells, infrared
detectors and as protective coatings.
