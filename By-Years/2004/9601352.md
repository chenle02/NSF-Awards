This grant will be used in developing software for The LINGUIST Network, an
electronic discussion forum for academic linguists produced at Eastern Michigan
University and Texas A&M University. In its 5 years of operation, LINGUIST has
become the central international clearinghouse for information relevant to
linguistics. Its current issues and 10,000 back issues represent a rich source
of data about languages, linguistic methodology, and the sociology of the
discipline. However, LINGUIST has come to need additional software to support
its expanding list of services and to accommodate the dramatic changes in
Internet technologies that have occurred during the last 5 years. Such software
will enable LINGUIST to develop its new World Wide Web site in such a way as to
provide functionalities not commonly available and to accomplish its ultimate
goal: offering the discipline a central location for storage and retrieval of
the rapidly expanding amount of linguistic information on the Web.
