A significant fraction of the energy in the universe has been absorbed and re-
emitted by dust, in dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Most of the star
formation in the universe at cosmological redshifts between 2 and 3 may have
taken place in such galaxies and emitted no visible or ultraviolet light because
of dust obscuration. Using the NSF- and DOE-funded South Pole Telescope (SPT),
the proposing team has identified approximately 100 bright DSFGs, all of which
are magnified and brightened by gravitational lensing. They now intend to use
the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe these
galaxies, obtaining spectroscopic redshifts, measuring elemental abundances, and
inferring the distribution of dark matter. The goals are to determine the
distribution of DSFGs in redshift, the physical conditions in their interstellar
media, and the mass function of dark matter substructure. As a broader impact,
the proposers intend to develop new interferometric analysis tools that
incorporate self-calibration as a modeled uncertainty for gravitationally lensed
objects. The project will support the work of two graduate students, and the PI
will conduct outreach presentations and develop undergraduate laboratory
exercises on interferometry.
