Long and Medium-Term Research: Astrophysics Research at Cambridge This award is
under the Long and Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence
Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve
months of research abroad at research centers of proven excellence. The
program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique
or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This
award will support a three-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Paul Green
to work with Dr. Martin Rees at the University of Cambridge. Dr. Green plans to
study the dependence of UV emission-line parameters on soft X-ray luminosity in
quasars, using samples of quasars with no emission-line bias. He will measure
IUE equivalent widths and Einstein X-ray fluxes to determine the relative
importance of the UV and X-ray ionizing continua to emission from the broad line
region of quasars. He will analyze the potential of an X-ray "Baldwin effect"
for use as a standard candle in cosmological tests. The award recommendation
provides funds to cover international travel and a stipend for three months.
