This grant permits Dr. Susman and his colleagues to continue their research on
the pygmy chimpanzee (>Pan> >paniscus>)>>>> in the Lomako Forest of Central
Zaire. Previous work by the team has been hampered because of the difficulty of
locating and tracking individual animals for extended periods of time. The
species is aboreal and the vegetation thick. With NSF support radio collars will
be placed on focal animals. These collars, which have been tested for safety, do
not hamper the animals, and with the aid of a receiver, will allow researchers
to pinpoint the location of individual animals. Thus the team will acquire an
accurate record of individual and group movements to calculate home range areas
and assess ranging behavior. These variables will then be correlated with
resource distribution and availability. The size and shape of an animal's home
range and the spatial relationships between groups are often the starting points
for understanding socioecology. Home range size has been a focal variable in
studies of the adaptive significance of body size, group size, diet, and social
organization. To understand the size and shape of home range areas requires long
term data on the movements of known individuals. Without these data home ranges
can only be estimated. Unfortunately, most studies of forest primates rely on
ranging data that is pieced together, often from discontinuous observations on a
number of individuals over an extended study period. This project will, for one
species at least, remedy this situation. This research is important because of
the light it will shed on the earliest stages of human development. Of the
extant great apes, the pygmy chimpanzee is nearest in size to early hominids.
Thus it provides the best baseline against which uniquely human triats can be
compared. This work should also aid in the protection of this extremely rare
species.
