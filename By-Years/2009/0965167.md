This grant provides funds to support the participation of approximately 7-9
students in the Symposium of the Materials Research Society (MRS) titled
"Scanning Probe Microscopy - Frontiers in NanoBio Science" which will be held in
the frames of 2010 MRS Spring meeting at Moscone West Convention Center, San
Francisco, CA, April 5-9, 2010. The symposium will focus on recent developments
in Scanning Probe Microscopy techniques and applications to nanomaterials, soft
matter research, biotechnology, and life science with the intent of bringing
together scientists from different disciplines and encouraging discussions at
the cross-disciplinary level. One of the major topics is the study of nano- bio-
mechanics, a proliferating area among SPM applications. One of the key purposes
of the symposium is to show the importance of fundamental research of
biomechanics at nanoscale. Student recipients will be selected by an ad-hoc
selection committee based upon their research statements, adviser
recommendations, including underrepresented status, paper authorship, and
degrees being pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium serves as a knowledge
dissemination platform of innovations in the area of scanning probe microscopy
for student participants. The students will share and learn the state-of-the-art
and challenges of the nanomechanics research through invited presentations and
regular paper presentation sessions. They will also have opportunities to
interact with industrial researchers, professors, and other students. Such
interactions will facilitate future domestic and international collaborations.
This symposium experience will be invaluable for developing the skills of this
highly talented group of students who will be the next generation of industry
professionals and academics.
