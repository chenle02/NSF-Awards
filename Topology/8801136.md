A confluence of ideas from geometry, algebra, and analysis is involved in this
project. Vilonen plans to work on the following questions on perverse sheaves
and D-modules, with applications to representation theory: 1) micro-local
Riemann- Hilbert correspondence, 2) applications of perverse sheaves to
representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras, Harish- Chandra modules,
and character sheaves. In addition, some other directions are suggested,
foremost a geometric approach to the Langlands program.
