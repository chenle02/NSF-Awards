In a two-semester laboratory sequence students are guided to rediscover the
basic principles of chemistry. Instead of first learning theories in lecture and
verifying the principles in the laboratory, students make laboratory
observations and cases each student preforms experiments under slightly
different conditions and the class results are entered into a PC, graphed and
displayed by the instructor. Students participate as a group in the discussion
of the results and in some cases are able to return immediately to the
laboratory and test the predictive power of their hypotheses. Modern, rapid-
scanning spectrometers and chromatographs are a central feature of the discovery
laboratory process. These allow large numbers of students to discover concepts
which are usually not considered in the general chemistry laboratory. In
addition, certain classical general chemistry experiments are made more
efficient through use of this modern instrumentation thus making it possible for
students to gather more data in a single period thereby maximizing the amount of
data available and still leaving time for group discussions of the trends. The
institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.
