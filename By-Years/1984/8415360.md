A theoretical and experimental study of thermal plumes arising from finite heat
sources is conducted. The research is aimed at advancing fundamental
understanding, but the study has significant relevance in the environmental and
electronic cooling technologies. In the case of a horizontal, upward-facing
heated disk, the preliminary study indicates the importance of the developed
thermal plume and the near-disk flow. The near-disk region can be characterized
by a boundary layer analysis which connects with the analysis of the entrainment
flow above the boundary layer. The study predicts analytically the local and
averaged disk and plume analyses. The theoretical study is supported by three-
dimensional full field temperature data obtained using holographic
interferometry and thermocouple probes.
