The main parts of this mathematics research project by Shiferaw Berhanu involve
the solvability of complex semi-linear partial differential equations, the
regularity of the solutions of fully nonlinear, first order complex partial
differential equations, and the properties of CR manifolds where the strong
maximum principle holds for CR functions. The semi-linear equations are
analogues of Vekua's equation for the Cauchy Riemann operator and arise from
geometrical and physical problems. The questions to be investigated for the
nonlinear equations include the smoothness and real analyticity of the
solutions. The tools that may be used for the nonlinear partial differential
equations include a new family of nonlinear Fourier transforms that characterize
smoothness and real analyticity and the methods developed in the regularity
theory of CR functions. For the semi-linear equations, the tools include the
solvability of complex vector fields in various function
spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this mathematics research
project have important applications to function theory of several complex
variables, geometry, and the theory of so-called semi-linear and non-linear
partial differential equations. The semi-linear equations considered in this
project are crucial in solving a geometric problem that involves the existence
of certain types of bending of surfaces which in turn has physical applications
to the elasticity of thin shells. The non-linear partial differential equations
under study are relevant to physical and geometrical applications such as the
modeling of atmospheric phenomena and the study of limit shapes of surfaces that
minimize surface tension. This project will provide many interesting research
problems to graduate students and young researchers.
