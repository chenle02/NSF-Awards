The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of avalanches in a
plasma, a cloud of ionized gas, that is permeated by a magnetic field.
Avalanches are sudden events that cause major changes over an extended region of
a physical system. Although the concept is commonly associated with catastrophic
"snow avalanches", the general phenomenon occurs widely in both natural and
artificial systems. A typical driver and source of energy for an avalanche is a
sharp change in one of the parameters that describes the underlying system. This
project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical study of avalanches
triggered by a steep slope in plasma temperature and density across a magnetic
field. This is a situation widely encountered in natural plasmas, such as in
magnetic field structures on the Sun and around the Earth, and has to be
accounted for in any design of a magnetic fusion device. The project will
involve a graduate student who will gain a unique perspective on modern
experimental techniques and will also participate in theoretical and numerical
modeling work.

To date, the majority of experimental information about avalanche transport in a
magnetized plasma has been obtained in devices designed for fusion studies.
However, due to the complexity of these devices, it has proven difficult to
unravel the underlying physical mechanisms of the process. This project aims to
significantly expand the experimental knowledge base by exploring the behavior
of a well-defined plasma configuration that exhibits repeatable, controllable
avalanche events. The data obtained in the experiments will provide quantitative
information about the role of self-organized criticality dynamics, the formation
and evolution of streamers, the effect of flows and flow shear, and the
manifestation of nonlocal transport of both temperature and density. These
topics are at the frontier of plasma science and are the subject of numerous
ongoing theoretical and computational studies.
