This proposal is to develop a general representation framework that uses
similarity to capture relationships in large scale image collections. The
representation is not restricted to any specific distance function, feature, or
learning model. It includes new methods to combine multiple kernels based on
different cues, learn low-rank kernels, and improve indexing efficiency. In
addition, new methods for nearest neighbor search and semi-supervised learning
are proposed. It has relevance to machine learning and computer vision research
agendas. Two major research problems addressed are: (1) defining and computing
similarities between images' in vast, expanding, repositories, and representing
those similarities in an efficient manner so the right pairs can be retrieved on
demand; and (2) developing a system that can learn and predict similarities with
'sparse supervisory information and constantly evolving data.' The approach is
notable in its embrace of the scale of web archives and its use of verbal and
visual means of analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
