0139127 Bechert

This is a planning visit for Dr. Ursula Bechert, with the Department of
Biomedical Sciences at Oregon State University, to travel to Maun, Botswana to
consult with Dr. Lars Ramberg, Director of the Harry Oppenheimer Okavango
Research Center. The purpose of the visit is to finalize plans for the
initiation of a cooperative, multi-disciplinary project to study the role of
hippopotamuses in wetland ecosystems and their interactions with humans.
Hippopotamuses are a keystone species of the Okavango Delta, and many other
animal and plant species are dependent upon them. No systematic studies have
been conducted on the hippopotamuses in the Okavango Delta, and it is
anticipated that such a project will yield valuable information on their
population biology and interactions with their environment.
