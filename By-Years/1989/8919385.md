Large box girder bridge sections of reinforced concrete are being designed with
high width-to-thickness ratios which have never been investigated for buckling
behavior. This project will investigate the buckling behavior of reinforced
concrete plates in bending and/or compression in order to establish maximum
limits. Important parameters, such as creep and nonlinearity will be evaluated.
