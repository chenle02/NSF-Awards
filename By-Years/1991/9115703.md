Dr. Reynolds will continue his investigation into the nature and origin of warm
ionized gas in the interstellar medium. This gas is a major, newly identified
component of the medium about which very little is known. An accurate
understanding of interstellar matter and processes is going to require as
thorough an investigation of this ionized component as of the other principal
components of the medium. The work will concentrate on observations of the
structure and kinematics of the ionized regions, the relationship between the
regions of ionized gas and regions of neutral hydrogen at high Galactic
latitude, and the ionization conditions within the gas. The observations will be
carried out with the large aperture Fabry-Perot spectrometer at the University
of Wisconsin, which has made possible the detection and study of the faint
optical line emission from this gas, and which as a result has become the
primary source of information about the properties of this last major component
of the interstellar medium. Developments in the instrumentation will provide
significant improvements in the observational capabilities and will help to open
up further this new area of interstellar medium astronomy.
