A Model of Sunk Cost Research has shown that individuals who invest money in a
project, receive negative feedback regarding that decision, and then face a
decision as to whether to invest still more money are more likely to do so than
people who did not make the initial investment. Individuals who throw good money
after bad in this manner are said to succumb to the `sunk cost` fallacy. While
there is no doubt that people do sometimes honor sunk costs, experiments
conducted to date fail to make clear why such behavior occurs. In this proposal
the PI presents a general framework for modeling the thought process involved in
investment-reinvestment decisions. He then proposes a set of eight experiments
to identify which of the potential set of relevant factors actually produce sunk
cost behavior.
