Geophysical Field Research and Training Program&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
proposed Geophysical Field Research and Training Program has two complementary
objectives. The first is to broaden the geophysical science training facility to
include field&lt;br/&gt;equipment for geophysical surveying. Students will
participate in design and&lt;br/&gt;acquisition of geophysical surveys using
sophisticated equipment, and in the collection of field data using a variety of
geophysical methods. The purchase of geophysical equipment will strengthen the
University's research and educational infrastructure in geosciences, and help
faculty secure future funding for both academic and research projects.
Geophysical field research and training will produce data and analysis that can
be used as resources for both research and innovative course/curriculum
development, hence having potential of improving faculty research productivity
and providing students with a responsive learning environment. The second
objective is the complete geophysical characterization of a selected field site
that will serve as a test case for seismic physical modeling and for
computational modeling. It is anticipated that students coming through the
proposed summer geophysical field research training program will be well
equipped with knowledge and skills to conduct near-surface geophysical surveys
using a variety of geophysical methods, hence broadening career paths for
persons from underrepresented groups in the environmental, geotechnical, and
engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;
