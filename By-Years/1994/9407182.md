The major obstacle to developing automated tools for the detection of faults in
concurrent software systems is the state explosion problem: the number of
possible states of a concurrent system is, in general, exponential in the number
of processes making up the system. A number of techniques have been proposed to
address this problem, but most real concurrent software systems remain beyond
the reach of existing approaches to analysis. This project continues the
development of an approach to analysis based on generating necessary conditions
for the existence of certain executions of a concurrent system and using integer
programming to check the consistency of those conditions. This approach does not
require enumeration or explicit representation of the states of the system being
analyzed, and can be used to check such properties as deadlock, starvation,
mutual exclusion, and minimum and maximum elapsed time between events. This
project includes research to take advantage of the compositional structure and
symmetries of a concurrent system and investigates connections with other
automated analysis methods.
