9619048 Lapp The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) has developed a one
year planning process to initiate, support, and prove the viability of regional
development sites as described in the proposal, Capacity Building for Science
Education Reform. Two regional science education reform sites will be initiated
during the planning year. Each site will be composed of a coalition of 7 - 15
neighboring school districts, representing about 3000 teachers from 100 - 150
schools. These regional sites will work together to develop and sustain
comprehensive professional development programs for all K - 8 teachers. These
programs will be designed to impact the "core educational practice" of
participating districts, that is how teachers understand the nature of science
knowledge and the student's role in learning, and how these about knowledge and
learning are manifested in teacher practice. Specifically, NSRC will work with
regional sites by developing and beginning a planning process (Alabama and South
Carolina have agreed to become sites) to: (1) identify participating school
districts; (2) develop a master plan for professional development; (3) identify
resources to establish an electronic network; and (4) develop a plan for
obtaining needed resources.
