This project is designed to broaden and strengthen the undergraduate program in
Biology, with particular impact on departmental majors whose programs emphasize
the subdisciplines of Botany or Ecology. The acquisition of a modern
photosynthesis instrument system (portable infra-red gas analyzer which measures
photosynthetic gas exchange and instantaneously computes photosynthetic rate,
water-use-efficiency, intercellular CO2 concentration, and stomatal conductance)
will allow the introduction into the curriculum of modern courses in Plant
Physiology and Plant Physiological Ecology. The photosynthesis system will be
used by students in the laboratory and in the field to measure and evaluate the
interrelationship between plants and the environment. This system is ideal for
teaching undergraduate students about plant physiological processes because it
allows them to collect and analyze real data, thus creating a favorable climate
for learning the scientific methods that are critical to designing and
conducting meaningful experiments. The system also will be used for science
demonstrations in outreach programs for pre-college students, thus serving the
additional goal of interesting uncommitted students. The grantee institution is
matching the NSF award with an equal sum obtained from non-Federal sources.
