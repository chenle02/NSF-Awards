This award supports the research of a team of cultural anthropologists,
biologists, and remote sensing experts to study the sociocultural and
environmental change in tropical forests of Papua New Guinea. The project will
develop a database of geographic images of a highland area occupied by
indigenous farmers. Using ground surveys of agricultural activities and of tree
forms along with remote sensing images, the investigators will try to explain
the patterns of stability and change in the tropical forest as an interaction of
indigenous farming activities and ecological processes that do not involve
humans. This projects is important because understanding the interaction of
human and non-human processes in the change and stability of tropical forests is
critical if the biological resources represented in these tropical forest areas
are to be conserved.
