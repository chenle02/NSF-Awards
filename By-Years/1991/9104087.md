The objective of this proposal is to investigate the function of the paternal
contribution to early development of Drosophila melanogaster. For this, Dr.
Schubiger will screen male sterile mutations for paternal effect mutations that
permit normal sperm motility and egg penetration but subsequently disrupt
embryogenesis. In addition to identifying the spectrum of genes which, when
mutated, cause paternal effects, he will first characterize the existing
mutation ms(3)K81. By analyzing the embryonic defects caused by paternal effect
mutations, the nature of the mutations and their wild type gene products, he
expects to determine the unique role of the paternal nuclear and centrosomal
contributions in the Drosophila embryo.
