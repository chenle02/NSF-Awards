9314515 O'Brien In this project, the PIs will establish a Data Assembly Center
(DAC) for surface meteorological data, and extend efforts in their specical
Analysis Center (SAC) for surface fluxes. Focus will be on surface
meteorological measurements collected by buoys and ships during the field period
of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, and providing the data, as well as
derived forcing fields to other participants in the program.
