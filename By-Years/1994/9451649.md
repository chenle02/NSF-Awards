9451649 Wallace We are implementing a multi-media approach to learning that
stresses problem solving with visual techniques, intuitive exploration, drill
and practice exercises and develops strong computational skills. We are
developing the Computing Laboratory for Undergraduate Education (CLUE) to
facilitate: (1) visualization and intuitive exploration of Earth processes
through computer modeling and simulations; (2) development of student
computational skills by further integrating computer applications into the
geoscience curriculum; and (3) reinforcement of classroom instruction with
faculty sponsored research experiences. Our project represents a major change in
the style of teaching both geosciences and computational skills and places a
strong emphasis on research experiences to reinforce those skills. We have
embarked on a three prong approach to realize our goals. In a preliminary
project, on which our current, expanded project is based, we have: (1) developed
and are teaching a modular computer skills course designed especially for
geoscience majors, (2) implemented curriculum changes that integrate computer
technology throughout our undergraduate curriculum, and (3) developed and taught
a research methods course that actively involves undergraduate students in
research labs and develops the organizational, communication and computational
skills required to perform research.
