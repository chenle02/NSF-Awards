meetings involve presentations and workshops conducted by principal speakers on
the the frontier level of research in many aspects of dynamical systems and its
applications. This series has a strong educational aspect for graduate students
and provides a suitable forum of interaction for recent PhD's in advancing their
research potential. ***
