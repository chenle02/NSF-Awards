The Emory University Robert P. Apkarian Integrated Electron Microscopy Core
(RPAIEMC) has acquired a 200kV field emission gun transmission electron
microscope (FEG-TEM) with this award from the NSF Major Research Instrumentation
(MRI) program. Over 100 Emory University research groups from 26 departments
utilize the RPAIEMC for the structural characterization of biological, chemical,
and materials science research samples. The instrument provides Emory
researchers with the ability to explore specimens at much higher resolutions
than previously possible. The microscope will have a wider pole-piece to support
cryo-electron microscopy and tomography applications, a Zernike phase plate for
enhanced phase contrast of cryo-specimens, an in-column energy filter for
energy-filtered imaging and energy loss spectroscopy of biological and materials
science specimens, a 4kx4k high-resolution CCD camera, and several specimen
holders suitable for cryo-, biological and materials science applications. This
instrument will be used, under cryo-conditions, to examine the structure of
isolated macromolecules, viruses, and whole cells in order to explore basic
mechanisms of macromolecular assembly, viral packaging and infection, and
bacterial development. The new, state-of-the-art electron microscope, housed
within the RPAIEMC of Emory University, will provide a research technology and
environment in which cross-disciplinary collaborations will be established and
developed between researchers investigating biological, chemical, and materials
systems. The new FEG-TEM will enhance our ability to attract and educate
students, postdoctoral fellows, young and senior investigators working in a
wide-range of research fields. Results from studies conducted with the new
microscope will be disseminated through student and faculty presentations at
regional and national meetings, and in peer-reviewed journal
publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
