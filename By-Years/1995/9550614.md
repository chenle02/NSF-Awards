This project is concerned with the general problem of translating policies
designed to raise standards in math and science education into classroom
practice. It attempts to identify how three different types of mechanisms-
management-based mechanisms, professionally-based mechanisms, and client-based
mechanisms-exert pressure and provide support for teachers to eo upgrade
instructional practices. It also examines how the efficacy of these different
mechanisms varies across different settings, in particular settings serving
students from different SES backgrounds. The project involves intensive and
detailed fieldwork in 14 schools: 12 public schools, half located in central
cities and half located in suburban areas, and 2 private schools. Schools were
selected form two states representing different policy contexts. data include
interview data from district and school administrators, teachers, and parents;
surveys of parents and teachers; logs of parent-principal and parent-teacher
interaction; and review of classroom tasks. The study is designed to provide an
early indication of the progress of reforms by analyzing the local mechanisms
which promote them. It will also identify areas of possible concern which may
require policy attention.
