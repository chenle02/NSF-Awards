The PI proposes to study four problems on diffusion scaling limits and their
applications to Internet congestion control models, queuing theory, and
financial mathematics. Diffusion limits are ideal for capturing the random
fluctuations of heavily loaded systems, which makes them a natural tool to study
the variabliltiy of congestion in bandwidth sharing networks such as the
Internet. Similar considerations suggest that diffusion limits are an
appropriate tool for studying the behavior of the Shortest Remaining Processing
Time (SRPT) policy being implemented in modern web servers. The variability of
the queue length is paramount is such systems, which frequently operate near
capacity. The PI will also study a model of continuous double auctions, such as
those used in computerized financial markets, and identify conditions under
which the model is arbitrage free.
