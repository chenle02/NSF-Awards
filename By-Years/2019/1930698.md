This award will partially support the participation of approximately 14
participants in the combined Gordon Research Conference on Soft Condensed Matter
Physics: "Living and Non-Living Soft Matter on the Edge" and the associated
Gordon Research Seminar. The conference will be held between August 11-16, 2019
in the Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire. Preference will be given to
supporting graduate students and postdocs. This is a long-running conference
that brings together a diverse group of scientists from the broad spectrum of
areas covering soft-matter physics. The conference has a substantial mentoring
component as the main event is preceded by a two-day Gordon Research Seminar.
The conference is expected to lead to fruitful collaborations and new insights
on both theoretical as well as on experimental efforts in the
field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
