The Principal Investigator proposes to gather information about the scientific
research, unique biology and evidence of a changing climate occurring on the
Antarctic Peninsula. Actin during her voyage to the Antarctic as an "expedition
artist," simialr to those who were carried by early explorers, the PI will
closely observe the climate, landscape, oceanography and ecology to gain first-
hand knowledge about the region. She will also interact with scientists in the
lab and on field studies to learn about their research and its importance to
human understanding of the world and climate change. The artist will make
detailed documentations of her discoveries using daily log entries, drawings,
photographs, small copperplate engravings, audiofield recordings and interviews
with scientists.

The Pi will use use the information gatheeed in the field as the basis for a
series of cameo-glass engravings. The PI's medium is a traditional technique of
carving away layers of glass to make a relief engraving. The engravings will aim
to capture the essence of the region and the research being carried out for the
purpose of educating a wide public about Antarctica and the continent?s
importance to global welfare. Some of the engravings will be large, wall mounted
panel works and other pieces will be carved glass objects shown in wood and
glass display cabinets. A catalog compiling the artist?s field studies and notes
will accompany the exhibition. The Pi will also teach workshops to Seattle-area
high school students. and run a similar program with youth in the summer arts
program of the Service Board, a non-profit organization that mentors under-
represented youth of South Seattle.
