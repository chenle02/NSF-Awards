The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps is a novel noninvasive
ventilation modality for treatment of mild and severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Two million Americans have such severe COPD
that, even on maximal medical therapy, they are unable to walk up a single
flight of stairs due to severe shortness of breath. As the disease progresses,
patients become bound to their house, their chair, and finally their bed. This
technology provides a non-intrusive pulmonary support to patients in a form of a
lightweight, mobile, and noninvasive ventilator, which can help support these
patients during physical activity and help them live a full life again, free of
suffocation. Long term impacts of this technology include: (1) increased quality
of life and treatment effectiveness for severe COPD patients; (2) development of
novel pulmonary rehabilitation therapies; (3) expansion of noninvasive
ventilation technology in the field of pulmonary care to supplement and enhance
current ventilation techniques.

This I-Corps project is a mobile, non-invasive ventilation technology targeted
at COPD patients. The device works by supplementing patient's breathing with
pressure changes on their chest and abdomen. With each breath in, the device
generates a vacuum that helps lift the chest and abdomen, helping the patient
breathe in. With each breath out, the device increases pressure over the chest
and helps the patient breath out faster. By assisting the work of breathing,
patients no longer feel short of breath and can once again engage in normal
daily activities. The device promotes a healthy breathing cycle, which prevents
hyperinflation of the airways and degeneration of alveoli in the lungs.
Noninvasive ventilation and pulmonary rehabilitation have both been shown to
have significant, positive effects on the quality of life and medical outcomes
of COPD patients. The technology aims to improve patient's well-being.
