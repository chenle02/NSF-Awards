The Discover STEM-Generation Innovation project at Owensboro Community &amp;
Technical College (OCTC) is based on a prior NSF-supported project. OCTC is
developing a comprehensive recruitment and retention model to increase the
number of students, particularly underrepresented groups including females,
minorities, and disabled populations, exposed to STEM education and careers, and
is promoting technician education in Kentucky. The current project is a scale-up
project. STEM pathways in advanced manufacturing, mechatronics, engineering,
biotechnology, and information technology are being developed throughout
Kentucky by collaborating with five mentee sites located at two-year colleges
across the state. Middle and high school students are attracted to STEM
activities using clubs, academies and robotic competitions with the intent that
at least 70% of these students will transition to enrollment in college.
Professional development offerings for 200 teachers expose them to the
importance of technician education and help them to teach and support the K-12
students. Industry involvement in the professional development efforts for
faculty and teachers is an important added feature. Evaluative activities are
informing both the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) and
the community college STEM system at large about the important features
essential to fidelity of implementation and quality scale-up efforts.
