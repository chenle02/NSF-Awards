This project will use tools from analysis to investigate fundamental
mathematical models for physical systems driven to equilibrium by surface
tension effects. A complete mathematical understanding of these systems is
useful in addressing biological and engineering problems of mechanical nature,
as it allows investigators to obtain analytical predictions on the implied
consequences of physical theories motivated by such systems. At the same time,
obtaining such predictions requires one to address hard mathematical challenges,
which stimulates the growth and development of new and useful mathematical tools
and methods, thus advancing the field of mathematics as well. The project will
also provide research training opportunities for graduate students.

A first series of questions addressed in this project concern the use of minimal
surfaces as models for liquid films at equilibrium. The classical idealization
of liquid films as two-dimensional surfaces cannot account for liquid films
properties where the thickness of the film plays a crucial role (e.g., the
relation between the stability of a given geometric film configuration and the
size of the diameter of the film itself). This project intends to develop a
model for liquid films as three-dimensional regions with a small volume, which
was recently proposed by the principal investigator and his collaborators, and
which is capable of explaining physical features not accessible by classical
approaches. A second direction of investigation includes rigidity theorems for
minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces possessing physically meaningful
singularities. This project investigates the possibility of systematically
developing them into quantitative almost-rigidity statements, and of extending
their applicability to non-smooth settings, with motivations in the description
of equilibrium configurations in capillarity theory and in the asymptotic
behavior of extrinsic curvature flows. Finally, the vast reach of this circle of
ideas naturally leads to an investigation of related problems for isoperimetric
clusters, fractional perimeters and fractional mean curvatures, and for
geometric flows and equilibrium shapes in diffused interface models.
