Proposal#11129017 PI Name: James Bottum (Clemson University) Title: EAGER: A
Study of the National Software Cyberinfrastructure Environment

Abstract

This study of software infrastructure for the NSF community includes analysis
and inventory the state of software technologies and their use in science and
engineering environments dependent on cyberinfrastructure. Results include a
taxonomy of software funded by NSF to support NSF science and engineering
research and education, recommended questions for NSF to consider in the
analysis of impact by software investments, the identification of a target set
within the NSF community to engage in a future possible survey intended to
inform NSF on use of software infrastructure, and culminating in a presentation
to NSF's Advisory Committee on Cyberinfrastructure (ACCI). The study addresses
the need for a more accurate understanding of the state of comprehensive
software infrastructure in current NSF community settings from a combined
qualitative and quantitative perspective - the project attempts to provide new
insight and awareness of the software infrastructure.
