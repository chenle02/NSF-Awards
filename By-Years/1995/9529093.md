With funding from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Stang at the
University of Utah will investigate the chemistry of molecular squares. The
recent discovery of these complexes by the principal investigator provides the
basis for this award. In this endeavor the dynamic chemistry as well as the
synthesis of new models will be investigated. Molecular squares that are derived
from the self-assembly of organometallic and inorganic complexes are unique
materials. They are proposed to be useful for general catalysis, chiral
catalysis, molecular recognition and electronic devices. An electron rich cavity
of 20-30 angstroms within the squares may provide a unique host-guest system for
catalysis. An attempt shall be made to incorporate a myriad of transition metals
at the corners of the square to provide new electronic and three dimensional
characteristics. New molecular structures prepared by scientists often provide
for new materials and material properties. In addition to yielding new practical
applications, these new systems stimulate others to expand on the paradigm to
produce unique compounds and chemistry. This project results from an initial
discovery by the principal investigator and has gained considerable momentum of
late. It promises to have significant impact on catalysis, molecular
recognition, and ultimately nanoscale molecular devices.
