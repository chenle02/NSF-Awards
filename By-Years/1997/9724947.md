9724947 Tubbesing As part of a Cooperative Agreement with FEMA, Earthquake
Engineering Research Institute EERI has undertaken a project to produce an
Action Plan that will lay out the necessary steps that must be taken to develop
performance-based engineering design criteria and the tools necessary for
engineers to communicate performance concepts to building owners, building
officials, and other design professionals. FEMA intends to use the Action Plan
to initiate a Performance-Based Design Program for new and existing
construction. This project will provide funds to complement FEMA funding to
support the participation of an additional steering committee member selected
from universities who would represent the engineering research perspective in
all activities of the Project Steering Committee, in order to ensure its
inclusion in the resulting Action Plan. This is an interagency collaboration in
support of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) activities.
