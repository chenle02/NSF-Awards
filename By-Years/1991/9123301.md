This grant supports research to study nucleon interactions and nuclear dynamics
with neutrons by scientists of the University of California at Davis. Nuclear
reactions and scattering at neutron energies from 60 to 260 MeV will be carried
out at Crocker Nuclear Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory for a range
of nuclear targets. In addition, studies of relativistic nuclear collisions
centered at the Heavy Ion Superconducting Spectrometer at Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory will be augmented with a new time projection chamber, which is now
under construction. Planning and detector research and development by the
U.C.-Davis group for the STAR detector at RHIC is also being supported.
