The proposed research lies in the interface of several complex variables, number
theory, and differential geometry, in particular, it involves the somewhat
mysterious relationship between Nevanlinna theory and the theory of Diophantine
geometry. The following topics will be investigated: moving target problems in
Diophantine approximation and Nevanlinna theory, Diophantine approximation by
algebraic points of bounded degree, and the Kobayashi conjecture in the theory
of complex hyperbolic geometry. A second part of the project will involve the
study of the value distribution properties of the Gauss map of minimal surfaces
and minimal submanifolds in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.

Number theory and complex analysis, two old but important subjects, have been
found to have important applications in Engineering, Biology, Computer Sciences,
and other fields. Historically these two subjects developed independently.
Recently it was discovered that they are somewhat related; in particular,
Nevanlinna theory in complex analysis and Diophantine approximation in number
theory bear striking similarities and connections. This interplay has lead to
several important new results in number theory and in complex analysis. It is
hoped that the newly discovered relationship will revolutionize the researches
and will lead major new advances in both subjects. Such advances would have a
great impact in the whole area of mathematics.
