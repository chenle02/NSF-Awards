This award supports the principal investigator's research on number theory.
Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural numbers. It is
among the oldest branches of mathematics. Within the last half century it has
become an indispensable tool, with diverse applications in areas such as data
transmission and processing, communication systems, and internet security. The
PI is one of the organizers of a workshop, the Arizona Winter School. He is also
training graduate students in topics related to this
award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the project centers
around the theory of automorphic forms, a branch of number theory which studies
natural numbers through symmetries. The theory of L-functions and its special
values is of particular interest in this subject. The main goal is to apply
various techniques from representation theory and harmonic analysis to prove
identities linking special values of L-functions to other objects, e.g. period
integrals, or heights of special cycles on Shimura varieties. More concretely
the PI will study the following conjectures: (1) Gan--Gross--Prasad conjectures
and its arithmetic variant; (2)Guo--Jacquet conjecture on linear
periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
