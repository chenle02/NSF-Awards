This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cardiovascular system is the first
operational organ system in developing vertebrates and proper control of its
function, which transports oxygen and nutrients, is absolutely critical for the
subsequent normal development of the animal. Any perturbation, whether natural
or experimental, of its normal function will negatively impact further
development and ultimately embryo survival. This project will entail an
extensive investigation of the cardiovascular system during the development of
two reptilian vertebrates, American alligators and common snapping turtles.
Prior studies have shown that these animals experience alterations in the
developmental environment (the nest), resulting in periods of hypoxia (low
oxygen levels). This research project will determine the effects of these
hypoxic periods on the gene expression, regulation, and function of the
cardiovascular system in order to construct a complete picture of the
environment-induced changes in embryonic cardiovascular physiology. Given the
potential for variation in nest temperature, water content and oxygen content,
this study will clarify how environmental stress can alter the embryonic
survival of these species as well as other egg-laying vertebrates. During the
tenure of this research project several education goals will be achieved. This
project will further physiological education on the UND campus through the
development of a specialized course in physiology and will have regional impact
through the development of the internet based experimental modules in
physiology. In addition, Native American students will participate in a summer
research experience program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
