9505375 Bartoszynski Bartoszynski and Scheepers' research is in set theory. Some
of their problems are well-known, while others have arisen from more recent
work. One common theme for many of these problems lies in establishing a link
between forcing and inductive constructions. Another underlying goal is to
express various properties of sets in the language of infinite games. It is
expected that notions from model theory, forcing theory, combinatorial set
theory and game theory will play a significant role in this research. With its
roots in the work of Cantor, Hausdorff, Godel and Cohen, their projected
research will deal with the notions of the infinite and some subtle ways in
which these notions manifest themselves in areas of modern mathematics. The
questions they explore are specifically focused on that area of mathematics
known as "foundations," with answers that potentially extend beyond its
boundaries. In essence, their approach will apply the advanced methods of modern
logic and game theory to problems that lie in the intersection of foundations
and real analysis. ***
