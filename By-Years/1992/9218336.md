This award is for support of a study to perform in-situ deformation experiments
on pollycrystalline freshwater ice using synchrotron- based transmission Laue
technique using x-ray beam-line X-19C on the synchrotron at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The work will examine the conditions under which slip can be
transmitted across grain boundaries in ice; dislocation pile-up formation and
relaxation; whether grain boundaries can act as disloction sources for non-basal
slip; creep and sub-boundary formation; grain boundary sliding and grain
boundary faceting. The results of these experiments will be relevant to
understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing both texture formation in ice
and the flow of glaciers.
