This program deals with heat and mass transfer phenomena in the freezing of
mammalian biological tissue and to provide a fundamental understanding of the
thermophysical processes that occur during freezing of tissue. This study will
be important to the development of methods for long-term storage of frozen
organs, organs to be used for transplantation of other purposes. The method to
be employed involves the correlation of the structure of the mammalian tissue
after freezing to the perfusion treatments prior to freezing and the thermal
history during freezing. Freezing and thawing will be performed under a range of
controlled thermal conditions with a special "directional solidification:
apparatus developed by the authors. The structure and chemical composition of
samples will be assessed with Low-Temperature, Scanning Electron Microscopy,
High Voltage Electron Microscopy, and X-Ray Microanalysis. As an outgrowth of a
recent expedited award, the PI's will perfuse biological organs, specifically
heart, kidney, and liver, with antifreeze glycopeptides, and study the role of
this promising substance on the processes of tissue freezing. The experimental
results will be used to develop mathematical models for the process of the
freezing of tissue.
