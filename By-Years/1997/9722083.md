Research in theoretical physics of elementary particles and strings will
include: Precision calculations of the quantum corrections to the Standard Model
of elementary interactions. This kind of calculations has been crucial, already,
to show that the Standard Model is the most successful theory of elementary
interactions ever. In the present and future, it shall allow us to compare this
theory with experiment, with accuracy sufficient to open a window on possible
new physics. ii) Non-perturbative calculations in string theory. Strings are the
only reliable theory of (perturbative) quantum gravity available today. Some
calculations can be performed using to the fullest extent special symmetries
(extended supersymmetry, duality etc.). These calculations are crucial in trying
to understand the deepest aspect of string theory, as, for instance, to which
degree it is unique. They also provide a powerful technique for understanding
the physics of strongly interacting quantum fields.
