The long-term objective of this project is to improve our understanding of the
kinematics and dynamics of continental collision and associated mountain-
building processes along the Alpine-Himalayan collision zone. Towards this end,
the PIs wish to begin establishing and monitoring a network of Global
Positioning System (GPS) sities in the Pamir-Tien Shan region of Soviet Central
Asia, ideally involving joint observation and measurement by American receivers
monitoring the NAVSTAR satellites and Soviet receivers monitoring GLONASS
satellites. The GPS network in the USSR would be interconnected with GPS
networks being established along other segments of the Alpine- Himalayan belt,
including the eastern Mediterranean network and the Nepal and Tibet networks.
This is a one-year project intended to establish the necessary agreements with
Soviet conuntermarts to untake the GPS monitoring program. If these preliminary
efforts prove successful, future proposals will be submitted for support of
actual establishment and minitoring of a regional GPS network, beginning in
1991.
