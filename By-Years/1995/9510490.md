9510490 Noble The objective of this industry internship project is to develop an
integrated analysis for material flow systems based on an empirical study of a
manufacturing system. The project will develop and apply an integrated material
flow system design and analysis methodology that accounts for the hybrid nature
of the manufacturing environment under consideration. The methodology will
consist of the integration of mathematical programming, computer simulation, and
existing facility layout software packages. The research plan is to (1)
determine the optimal unit load sizes to achieve material flow synchronization
in a hybrid manufacturing environment, and (2) develop a plan for facility
layout and material flow system evolution over a time horizon. The project
addresses the incremental adoption of an integrated material flow system so as
to provide an implementable methodology for small and medium sized manufacturing
firms. Material flow system is a primary integrating component of a
manufacturing system. Therefore, an inefficient material flow system can affect
manufacturing productivity and competitiveness. Research in the integration of
material flow systems can advance the understanding of the interaction between
material flow and other systems within a shop floor. Increased understanding of
the nature of interaction will provide some insight in the development of
methodologies whereby these types of complex environment can be analyzed. .
Because the research is directed at small to medium sized manufacturing
operations, the tools developed can be used by these firms to evaluate their
material flow systems in order to achieve better shop performance.
