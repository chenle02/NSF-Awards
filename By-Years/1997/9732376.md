This project deals with the design of computational algorithms that blend
together the practical virtues of efficiency and numerical accuracy for matrix
problems with structure. The two requirements of speed and accuracy have often
been regarded as competitive and, for this reason, the design of fast and
numerically reliable algorithms for large-scale structured linear matrix
equations has remained a significant open issue in many instances. Structured
matrix equations arise in several applications in the disciplines of filtering,
estimation, and control. In this way, the results of the proposed work will
further play a concrete role in addressing some of the annoying discrepancies
that have always existed in these areas between the theoretical findings and the
practical results. These discrepancies are often due to the pitfalls of finite-
precision implementations, especially in systems that involve interconnections
of digital and analog components, and studies to resolve or ameliorate many of
these difficulties have long been overdue. This investigation will address the
challenge of combining numerical accuracy and structure exploiting techniques
into a unifying framework. The project will build on the work recently done,
will extend the results and the framework to a wider class of structured matrix
problems, and will explore applications in filtering, estimation and control.
