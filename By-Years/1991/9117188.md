This project will use gravity and bathymetry data from a large number of
detailed surveys of ridge axes with spreading rates that vary by an order of
magnitude to examine the spreading rate dependence of mantle bouguer anomalies
at mid-ocean ridges crests. The spreading rate dependence of the along-axis
segmentation of the ridge axis will be examined and the transition between
patterns observed at slow-spreading ridges and fast-spreading ridges will be
determined. The spreading rate dependence of isostasy and the support of ridge
axis topography will also be examined.
