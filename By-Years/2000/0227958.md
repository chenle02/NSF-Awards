The Arizona MESA works to increase the number of historically underrepresented
minority and low-income students participating in mathematics, engineering, and
science and to stimulate students starting at the elementary school level
continuing through high school. This program's emphasis on yearlong academic
stimulation was thought to be quite valuable, as was the engagement and support
of both students and parents. There is a strong focus on leadership development,
and the support systems embedded in program are excellent. Support for students
is maintained through an organized, effectively executed
plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a model program that extends deep roots into
the community using creative methods, including the "train the trainer"
methodology, thus leveraging it's ability to make a significant impact on
children. Some of the program achievements include 89.5% of the participants
pursue higher education opportunities, and 65% engage in some type of technical
plan of study. &lt;br/&gt;
