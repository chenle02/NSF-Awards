The University of Hawaii at Manoa will initiate a six-week, summer residential
Young Scholars project in the Agricultural Sciences for 26 students entering
grades 11 and 12. The Pacific Region Program (PRP) will focus on science in
general and the agricultural sciences in particular. Students will be exposed to
contemporary societal issues (e.g. world food problems, environmental
degradation, etc.) and will learn how knowledge from research is used in
generating solutions. The PRP summer curriculum will consist of four inter-
related active learning experiences: classroom presentations; field trips;
research with mentors; and small group activities. Students will conduct
individual research projects under the guidance of scientists and enhance their
computer, library and communications skills. they will engage in analyzing and
discussing real-world case studies and ethics in science and explore the career
opportunities in the field.
