This award provides travel support for 12 United States researchers to attend an
international meeting on ?Synergy with and Learning from Nature? to be held on
October 20-22, 2011, in Istanbul, Turkey. The goal of the meeting is to bring
together diverse research communities to identify research areas that will
advance knowledge both in engineering and physical sciences as well as in life
sciences. Specifically, the meeting will focus on the understanding and design
of engineering systems that are in synergy with and learning from nature. The
meeting is co-sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF), the Turkish
Science and Technology Council (TUBITAK), the Japan Science and Technology
Agency (JST), the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC), and the Korea
Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM). It will be attended by experts from
all over the world.

A key outcome of the meeting will be an international research agenda designed
to help funding agencies to prioritize the investment of their research funds in
the area of advanced sensors and sensor-based decision making and control. A
secondary outcome of the meeting will be encouragement to women and minorities
to become involved in this area of science and engineering.
