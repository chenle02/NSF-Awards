(International Rice Research Institute, the
Philippines)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plants in the real world are continuously
exposed to multiple environmental signals and must respond appropriately to the
dynamic conditions found in nature. Environmental signals can fluctuate during
an individual's life cycle with varying degrees of predictability, and complex
natural environments are the norm. This project will analyze public data and
undertake time-series microarray experiments to infer Environmental Gene
Regulatory Interaction Networks (EGRINs) in the rice leaf associated with
fluctuating environmental signals. The research focus will be on temperature and
water availability, and examine genomic networks for these environmental signals
in four different landraces adapted to rainfed upland versus paddy field lowland
environments. This research will adapt and scale-up computational methods for
biclustering and network inference for use with plant transcriptome data,
including the use of data from multiple genotypes. Rice global gene expression
patterns in natural seasonal environments will be studied by carrying out
transcriptome analyses in different agricultural field conditions. This study
provides a systematic determination of genomic networks associated with
environmental signals and their behavior in ecologically relevant field
conditions. This work lays the foundation for a broader dissection of plant
responses to both normal environmental fluctuations as well as extreme
environmental conditions that lead to plant stress, and develop systems
biological approaches to understanding plant-environmental interactions. These
results will be especially useful in understanding plant response to climate
fluctuations, as well as develop cultivars that can tolerate temperature and
water stress in agricultural environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project
will develop software packages for gene network inference in plants, and provide
inferred gene biclusters and networks to the plant science community through
Gramene (www.gramene.org). As part of the outreach efforts, graduate-level
science journalism students from the NYU Science, Health and Environment
Reporting Program will also be trained in plant genomics and systems biology.
Finally, plant biologists from both the US and the International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI) will also be trained in systems biology by developing a Rice
Systems Biology training workshop to be held at IRRI.
