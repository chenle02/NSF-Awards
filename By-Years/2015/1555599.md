One of the main uses for computers is to solve large computational problems of a
discrete nature, for example to find ways of optimally routing vehicles to make
deliveries within minimum time. To be useful, the amount of computing time
needed to solve the problem must be small. Unfortunately, many, if not most of
the problems of this nature tend to be of a class for which there is no
algorithm that can finish quickly for all problem instances. On the other hand,
these problems have to be tackled and it has been noted that algorithms tend to
do better than the worst-case scenario might
suggest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integer Programming is a framework within which
many of these problems can be described. The PI will conduct research on the
average performance of algorithms for these problems. The aim is twofold. First,
the PI wants to explain, in terms of probability, why the average performance is
much better than the worst case. Second, the PI will seek ways to practically
exploit the ''friendly'' nature of typical problems, thus leading to more
efficient algorithms for Integer Programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The related
problem of Linear Programming has been a spectacular success for mathematics.
The Simplex Algorithm and more recent Interior Point Method have enabled us to
solve huge linear programs. Integer Programs are superficially similar to Linear
Programs and one approach to solving them is through polyhedral methods. We try
to approximate the convex hull of the integer solutions and then apply Linear
Programming. This has led to the study of Polyhedral Combinatorics. The PI
proposes to study Polyhedral Combinatorics within a probabilistic framework. For
example, the PI will try to determine the expected number of Gomory cuts needed
to solve a pure Integer Program. This will require a combination of
probabilistic, geometric, and algorithmic ideas in order to be successful.
