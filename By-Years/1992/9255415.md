The Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture is conducting a three-
week summer project for undergraduate faculty that demonstrates environmental
problem-solving as an effective teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates'
interest in environmental science. Using the theme of Stressed Stream Analysis
participating faculty will study NEPA-based environmental analysis concepts and
techniques and work in teams to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for a
proposed pollution source in a disturbed stream ecosystem. Concepts and skills
participants will explore include: habitat evaluation procedures, using biotic
indices, electrophoretic and microscope techniques to evaluate pollutant effects
on organisms, and water quality analysis of nutrients and metals in a stressed
stream ecosystem.
