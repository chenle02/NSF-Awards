Does mental conditioning, such as that fostered by some religious practices,
affect the mental habits and physical health of those who participate? The
answer to this question is unclear. For example, some research has suggested
that meditation changes human attention and alters the body's immune response,
blood pressure, and other physiological markers. Other research has found that
active church going may improve one's health. Weekly church attendance has been
found in some studies to add two years on average to the length of the
congregant's life. However, critics point out that the reported improved health
could result simply from relaxation (in the case of meditation) and social
support (in the case of church going), and have nothing to do with the religious
contexts in which these practices take place. To help resolve this debate,
anthropologist Tanya Marie Luhrmann will use scientific measures to examine the
effects of religion-based training on cognitive
performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Luhrmann and her team will focus on one
group of religious practitioners who train for intensive prayer practice. The
researchers will collect data from this population by combining intensive and
repeated interviewing with a neuroscience evaluation using a tested EEG
neurophysiological protocol. They will collect data from both highly experienced
practitioners and novices to see whether those who are more experienced perform
differently. Findings from the research will help health researchers better
understand if there is a neurophysiological basis to reported experiences of
mental cultivation and whether training affects these experiences. Findings also
will contribute to social science theory about the interactive effects of human
culture and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
