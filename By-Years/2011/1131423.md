The research objective of this award is to determine how elastic suspended loads
affect the dynamic stability and energetic cost of locomotion using fundamental
spring-mass models and an experimental robotic platform. The objective will be
pursued by: investigating the effects of tuned elastically suspended loads by
analyzing the dynamics of a double-sprung-mass vertical oscillator model,
determining how a vertically elastically-suspended load affects the dynamic
motion of a clock-torqued spring-mass model of locomotion, and determining how
suspending loads affects the locomotion of a multi-legged robot. Dynamical
systems modeling, analysis, and simulation will be the primary theoretical
methods used throughout the project. Further, video capture and data acquisition
of the power consumption in an experimental robot setup will be utilized. This
work will focus on fundamental and general spring-mass models of locomotion
along with a multi-legged hexapod (or quadruped) robot platform.

The results of this research will enable advancement of robot, exoskeleton, and
other load-carrying systems, and provide a greater understanding of the role
elasticity plays in biology. Load-carrying systems, whether autonomous or
directly attached to a human, can reduce the load for those conducting
challenging or dangerous work. Example applications include load-carrying
robots, exoskeletons, and devices to assist humans carrying load while walking
or running. The results of this research will be disseminated and integrated
with teaching through an interdisciplinary training course on biological and
robotic locomotion and by including students in research activities.
Demonstration of this research to K-12 students is expected to encourage greater
participation in engineering, math, and science.
