This project will develop an innovative, effective, and economic process for
high temperature, high pressure gas cleanup. This will promote the cost
effective utilization of domestic coal reserves. This objective will be achieved
by the development of a novel carbon molecular sieve-ceramic composite membrane.
The unique chemical and physical properties of carbon molecular sieves formed
interstitially in a macroporous ceramic support offers the potential of facile
incorporation into existing ceramic membrane-based particulate removal systems
to provide relatively clean, concentrated hydrogen from hot coal gas. Membrane
separations for gaseous mixtures have become wide spread since the development
of asymmetric polymer membranes over the last three decades. This is because of
the relatively low operating costs for a membrane-based gas separation process.
Utilization has been limited to low temperature systems, however, because of the
lack of membrane systems capable of withstanding high temperatures. A number of
ceramic membranes, capable of withstanding high temperatures, have been
developed in the last few years, but they are not suitable for gas separations
because the channels they contain are too large to separate gas molecules. In
this project an organized carbon structure will be formed inside of the channels
of one of the commercially successful ceramic membranes. The deposited carbon
will act like a sieve to selectively pass hydrogen molecules while rejecting
larger molecules. The process for making these membranes promises to be
inexpensive. One of the many possible applications of such a membrane is the
conversion of coal to gaseous fuels in a manner which would allow an economical
separation of sulfur compounds from the final product.
