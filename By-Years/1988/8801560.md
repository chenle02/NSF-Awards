This award will support Professor Eric Kaler of the University of Washington in
collaborative work with Professor Jorge Puig of the University of Guadalajara,
Mexico. The investigators plan to investigate the structure and dynamics of
microemulsions, using scattering techniques, transient and steady state
fluorescence spectroscopy, pulsed field gradient nmr, and conductivity. Building
on previously funded work, the researchers will investigate microemulsions
formed with three, four, and five components, focusing on the transition from
liquid-crystalline to microemulsion phases. Microemulsions are thermodynamically
stable, isotopic microstructured fluid phases containing substantial amounts of
oil and water, surfactant, and, frequently, alcohol. Because of their unusual
physico-chemical properties and their potential for large-scale applications of
commercial importance, such as detergency, enhanced oil recovery, phase-transfer
catalysis, and photochemical and polymerization reactions, microemulsions have
become increasingly important as a research area. Yet, although more than four
decades have elapsed since their discovery, their microstructure and changes in
these structures are still not well understood. Using a systematic combination
of several experimental methods, some to be carried out in Washington, others in
Guadalajara, the investigators hope to arrive at a more acurate understanding of
microemulsion structure. Knowledge of these structures will allow better designs
of microemulsion based processes and more effective formulations of appropriate
microemulsions for applications.
