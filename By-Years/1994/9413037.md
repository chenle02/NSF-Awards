9413037 Holmes The research proposed in this application is concerned with
improving three-dimensional fluorescence microscope imaging by further
developing, refining, and evaluation of maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based
on blind deconvolution algorithms. Specifically, the objectives are to further
extend, implement and test the MLE blind deconvolution algorithms in ways that
will provide superior noise reduction over other deblurring algorithms, shorten
computation time and improve repeatability. These algorithms will be evaluated
in a neurophysiolgical testbed. Images will be reconstructed from biological
cell systems that are well studied by other means of imaging, but will benefit
from improved visualization of 3D microanatomy. The resulting 3D images will be
evaluated for their ability to display 3D structures that elucidate answers to
specific neurophysiological research questions. ***
