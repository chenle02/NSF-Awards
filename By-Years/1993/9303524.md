9303524 Langmuir This is a cruise to dredge igneous rock samples from a 2200-km
long section of the Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise between 35 and 56
degrees south. The work will provide a systematic petrologic comparison between
eruptive rocks along straight ridge segments and those obtained both from
adjoining overshot ridges constructed on the floors of transform faults and from
isolated intra-transform spreading segments in the same transform domains. The
work will also provide samples from a region that has not previously been
samples.
