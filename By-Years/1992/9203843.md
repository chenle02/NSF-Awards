This grant supports the research of Professor N. Katz as principal investigator
and Drs. H. Darmon and F. Rodriquez- Villegas as post-doctoral associates.
Professor Katz will work on the l-adic cohomology of varieties over finite
fields, the l-adic theory of exponential sums and the arithmetic theory of
differential equations. Dr. Darmon will study relations between the arithmetic
of schemes and the analytic properties of l-functions. Dr. Rodriquez-Villegas
will study the arithmetic properties of special values of l-functions of CM-
fields. This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a
subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and
geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently
solved problems that withstood generations. Among its many consequences are new
error correcting codes. Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard
disks) and compact disks.
