&lt;br/&gt;Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud computing systems are
revolutionizing business, government, and science by providing easy access to
scalable computing. These public services, as offered by Amazon, Google,
Microsoft, and others, allow an arbitrary customer to rent, by the hour, the
resources needed to run their applications within virtual machines (VMs) hosted
on the provider?s compute infrastructure. With these new services, however,
comes subtle new security issues. Prior work by the PI uncovered attacks that
abuse two aspects unique to cloud computing: resource sharing among mutually
distrustful customers and pricing that incentivizes malicious behavior.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is organized along the two themes of
resource sharing and pricing. In the first theme, the work explores whether
cryptographic side channel attacks and resource-freeing attacks pose serious
threats to cloud customers and then develops new placement and CPU scheduling
algorithms that realize the security principle of soft isolation: minimization
of potentially dangerous cross-user scheduling interactions (e.g., sharing a
server or CPU core). Within the second theme, the work explores the implications
of fine-grained pricing mechanisms on security. This includes developing
pricemarks (mechanisms for accurately determining the true costs of a cloud
service), understanding customer-controlled placement gaming that exploits cloud
performance heterogeneity, and explores pricing-based security mechanisms that,
in conjunction with the aforementioned scheduling mechanisms, will degrade
fiscal incentivizes for adversarial behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact
of the proposed work will be deeper understanding of threats in cloud IaaS
systems, new security design principles, deployable security technologies, and
improvements in security education.
