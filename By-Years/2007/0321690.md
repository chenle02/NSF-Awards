The goal of this project is to determine how natural rubber is synthesized in
plants. Natural rubber is required for the manufacture of thousands of products
needed in daily life. Due to its superior performance properties, natural rubber
is an irreplaceable material in the manufacture of many products, such as
automobile and aircraft tires. Surprisingly, even with its high economic and
strategic importance, the biosynthesis of rubber has been poorly characterized.
Move than fifty years of biochemical experimentation has so far failed to
identify the proteins required for rubber biosynthesis in plants. This is
primarily due to the fact that the membrane associated rubber biosynthetic
machinery is resistant to purification by classic biochemical methods. To
circumvent this problem, proteomics, genomics and reverse genetic analyses will
be used to functionally identify the genes/proteins required for rubber
biosynthesis from two hyper-producing rubber species, guayule (Parthenium
argentatum) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz). The novel approach
used here represents the most rapid means of advancing our knowledge of rubber
biosynthesis in plants and will lead to identification of genes/proteins that
regulate the quantity and quality of natural rubber. The gene-based resources
generated from this research will be used for the improvement of current rubber
producing crops and the development of alternative rubber producing domestic
crops through genetic engineering and molecular breeding approaches. The
development of domestic rubber producing crops will provide a number of benefits
to the American public including: 1) decreased dependence on imported natural
rubber, 2) the creatation of a new high value commodity crops for the American
farmer, 3) the generation of a hypoallergenic alternatives to Hevea derived
rubber for persons with latex allergies and 4) decreased dependence on petroleum
for the synthesis of synthetic polymers.

It is anticipated that 20,000 high quality EST sequences will be obtained from
rubber producing preparations and these will be immediately made available on
GenBank. Clones for these EST's will be made available without reach-through
restrictions and for a nominal fee.
