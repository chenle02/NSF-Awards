Ethology, the biological study of behavior, emerged as a major new scientific
discipline in the first two decades after World War II, building upon conceptual
and methodological foundations established by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen
in the 1930s. In the post-war period, increasing numbers of researchers were
drawn to the study of behavior, the primary institutional structures of the
discipline of ethology were created, biennial international congresses served to
define and guide the ethological community, and ethology's early conceptual
foundations underwent elaboration and alteration. Dr. Burkhardt's goal is to
describe and analyze ethology's development from 1945 to 1965. Taking a
comparative and "ecological" approach, he is exploring how the guiding issues,
concepts, and practices of ethology evolved as the original founders of the
discipline and a new generation of investigators established research centers in
Germany, Holland, Great Britain, and the United States and responded to the
challenges and opportunities provided by contact with investigators from other
disciplines. This study builds on Dr. Burkhardt's earlier research on animal
behavior studies before World War II. This research is aimed at presenting the
first systematic treatment of the history of ethology in this century.
