9723602 Stillman The meeting on Eukaryotic DNA Replication will be the 6th
meeting held on this subject and follows the highly successful meetings that
were held in September 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1995. The meeting will be
devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication,
structure and function, and will include important areas of biological research
in the areas of cell cycle and growth control, DNA replication, replication-
associated gene regulation, genome amplification, drug resistance and cancer
research. The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid advances made in
this field over recent years. The meeting will ensure that recent results will
be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of face-to-face contact, which
should enhance progress. The participation of younger investigators and women
scientists will be encouraged. The areas to be covered by the 1997 meeting will
include studies on (1) the replication of virus chromosomes, including SV40,
polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr
virus; (2) chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as
diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA
replication; (4) structure and function of chromosomal elements such as
telomeres; and (4) control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene
expression. ***
