Abstract; There is a three month program (Nov 24th 2003-Feb 20th, 2004) at
Institut Henri Poincare in Paris on: Complex Analysis and Applications.

The main themes are: 1. Radon transform and applications (inverse problems) 2.
d-bar equation and Complex Geometry 3. Several complex variables dynamics.

The program will include, courses, series of lectures on recent progress, and
three one week workshop, one for each theme. It is an opportunity to introduce
young researchers to the most striking development in Several Complex Variables.
There will be an emphasis on interplay between the various techniques and on
applications (short courses on applications of complex analysis to economy and
tomography).
