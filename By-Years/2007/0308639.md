This is a collaborative between NSF/ANIR and DoE. The purpose of this workshop
is to discuss challenges in cyber-security in large-scale networks and identify
impediments and deployment obstacles of security on a large
scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has potential to develop a long-term
research and development vision to address not only the technical impediments to
large scale deployment of cyber-security, but also identify the technical
challenges and develop strategies to address these impediments.
