Recent technological advances have left manufacturing industries struggling to
upskill current or find new employees at a sufficient pace to keep up with new
developments. The Reskilling Education Via Advanced Manufacturing Practicum
(REVAMP) project aims to support these industries by helping traditionally
underrepresented populations in STEM pivot into successful careers in
manufacturing. In particular, the participants will be those who have some
background in STEM, but, due to experiencing major life events, have either
remained unemployed for some time or require upskilling to work in this sector
including veterans, new Americans, and stay-at-home parents. Each cohort will be
trained in various aspects of professional development and advanced
manufacturing through hands-on learning modules over a summer followed by 30
weeks of practical work experience with local manufacturing companies. By
providing technical and core skills, the project will aid in filling this need
for manufacturing that will exist both locally and nationally for the
foreseeable future.

The median operational date for many investments in new manufacturing and
decarbonized industrial capability is approximately 2025. In total it is
expected that these new manufacturing activities will create over 50,000 jobs
just within a day’s drive of Cincinnati. Therefore, it is critical to the Great
Lakes and Upland South regions of the U.S. to redouble efforts to reskill a
manufacturing workforce within the next five years. The REVAMP project aims to
assist in this effort. The project structure will follow Kolb’s Experiential
Learning Theory as a framework and the content topics to be covered include
sustainability, additive modalities, and computational tools. The project
evaluation data and analysis will help to elucidate how experiential learning
creates and informs pathways for individuals seeking upskilling to work in
advanced manufacturing and determine the barriers to participation and the
resources necessary for participants to have a transformative experience. This
project aligns with the NSF ExLENT Program, funded by the NSF TIP and EDU
Directorates, as it seeks to support experiential learning opportunities for
individuals from diverse professional and educational backgrounds to increase
their interest in, and their access to, career pathways in emerging technology
fields.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
