Intracellular membrane traffic in cells has been postulated to require small
vesicles which shuttle between fixed endomembrane compartments of the cell. Such
vesicles are thought to carry contents in a vectorial manner and return membrane
material to the point of origin after delivery. Though often postulated, little
morphological evidence has been forthcoming to show that these are real.
Cryoelectron microscopy will be utilized to attempt to visualize such vesicles
in Paramecium. Cryofixation will be used to physically fix cells ultrarapidly so
intermediate steps in fission or fusion can be preserved. Subsequent
cryosubstitution or deep-etch rotary-shadow steps will allow observation of the
cell interior in a nearly native state, making it possible to locate small
transport or shuttle vesicles. Monoclonal antibody histochemistry will be used
to identify membrane components of the shuttle vesicles. These studies will
provide new information on the movements of membranes and membrane components
within cells.
