Drawing on prior work and a pilot study of DNR based instruction. The PI
observed that such instruction has brought about positive change in teachers'
knowledge of algebra, in their use of justification and proof, in their
understanding of how students learn, and in their practices of teaching
mathematics. Consequently, the general goal of this proposed research is will,
and if so how will, a DNR-based instruction be effective in developing the
knowledge base of algebra teachers, particularly with respect to mathematical,
cognitive, and instructional aspects of proof schemes? Teachers will be randomly
assigned to treatment and in the last year of the study explicit links to
student achievement will be estimated.
