The project addresses some fundamental issues in scientific computation in the
modern age: multiscale modeling and simulation, which play essential roles in
nanotechnology, communications, material sciences, and other areas of science
and technology. The research will develop state-of-the-art computational methods
for systems involving multiscale quantum-classical coupling. The methods under
development have a wide range of applications to problems arising in solid-state
physics, semiconductor device modeling, quantum chemistry, and materials
science. Several graduate students will be trained through these research
activities. Some of the research results also will be incorporated in the
graduate curriculum to better train the next generation of researchers in modern
applied mathematics.

The investigator will develop efficient semiclassical and multiscale
computational methods for some problems in quantum dynamics with non-adiabatic
effects. The non-adiabatic effects are important since they correspond to
quantum transitions between different potential energy surfaces that are
important to describe quantum dynamic behavior in chemical reactions and
semiconductors. Specifically, the project will investigate surface hopping and
quantum dynamics in periodic lattices. In the adiabatic cases only the diagonal
entries of the Wigner matrix need to be considered in the semiclassical limit,
which often results in classical Liouville equations. To account for the non-
adiabatic effects, one needs to also follow the dynamics of the off-diagonal
entries of the Wigner matrix in order to adequately describe the quantum
transition between different energy surfaces. These yield coupled,
inhomogeneous, oscillatory partial differential equations that will be
numerically solved by Gaussian beam and multiscale methods.
