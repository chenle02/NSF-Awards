One tactic for potential improvement of Numerical Weather Forecasting (NWF) is
the timely incorporation of large bodies of new observational data. These will
become available from networks of Doppler radars and other automated
instrumental systems that are to come on line throughout the remainder of this
decade. The oppor- tunity will be enhanced with the concurrent growth of
computer data-handling power. Also, and just as important, will be recent
developments in applied mathematics, particularly in the theory of optimal
control. By the mathematical analysis of the equations (or computational
algorithms) governing the behaviour of evolving systems, it is possible to
identify key values whose adjustment will minimize undesirable properties of the
system. However, the analysis becomes extremely difficult as the governing
equations become complex, and even if it is successfully carried out, there
remains the problem of implementing its results quickly and cheaply enough to be
useful in practice. In the case of NWF, the procedure can be applied to the
problem of adjusting the initial meteorologi- cal fields that start a forecast
so that the differences between the predictions of a numerical model and
measurements coming in early in the forecast period are minimized. This is done
by making repeated trial predictions for a short period, while simulteneously
and repeatedly fine tuning the initial fields until the desired minimum error is
found. The adjusted initial field is then used to carry out the prediction over
the full forecast period. The model of concern to the PIs is the workhorse
operational weather prediction model of the US National Meteorological Center
(NMC). In a grant just ending under the NSF-NMC Joint Program in NWF they have
successfuly constructed a set of algorithms (the "adjoint model") that
complement the NMC computer program in such a way that by alternately using the
adjoint and prediction models during the trial prediction period the number of
iterations can be significantly reduced. This has been characterized by the
Director of Development of NMC as a "most significant achievement". The proposed
work is to exploit the breakthrough by further analysis of the properties of the
two models in order to achieve successful operational implementation of the
theoretical findings. This could enhance the accuracy of the weather forecasts
to levels equal to or exceeding those achieved at the European Center for Medium
Range Weather Forecasting, and increase the return on the national investment in
the next-generation weather observing network.
