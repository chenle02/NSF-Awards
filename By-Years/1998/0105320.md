The Ohio State University, Arizona State University and Arizona Public Service
Company will undertake a collaborative research effort in a fundamental study on
the modeling of power system loads. In the next decades, the power systems of
the United States will face bottlenecks of bulk power transfer capabilities
because of the virtual absence of new transmission facilities. The increased
utilization of the existing facilities to cope with growing magnitude of bulk
power transfers and third-party access will require a closer look at system
dynamic performance. Accurate power system models are needed for accurate study
of system dynamic performance. The motivation is to make load modeling accuracy
commensurate with generation and system modeling accuracy.

The main theme of this project is to utilize the advanced system identification
concepts developed for generator parameter estimation and generator modeling for
power system load modeling. Features of the load modeling include: automatic
updating of the model, utilization of an artificial neural network model, and
work with actual industrial data throughout the project. If successful, the work
would be a major advance in the automated load modeling of power system loads as
well as a significant increase in system modeling accuracy for dynamic studies.
Therefore, the economic impact of the proposed research is significant in
permitting operation of power systems closer to the stability limit by
increasing the transfer capabilities and postponing the need for new
construction.
