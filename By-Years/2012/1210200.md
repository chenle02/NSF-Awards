This action funds Nikole Nielsen of New Mexico State University to conduct a
research project, entitled "Gas properties in interacting galaxies using
fingerprints in background quasar light," during the summer of 2012 at Swinburne
University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia. The host scientist is Michael
Murphy.

The Intellectual Merit of the research project is to contribute to the quest to
understand the evolution of galaxies and provide key insights for understanding
isolated galaxies such as the Milky Way and their histories. This is
accomplished by studying the gas in galaxies - an important component of baryons
in the galactic ecosystem and the fuel from which stars and planets form and
evolve - and how it responds to interactions between galaxies. Because all
galaxies were interacting galaxies at one point in their history, interacting
galaxies provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to observe cannibalistic
events in progress and test current theories of how these events affect
galaxies.

Broader Impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand
research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science
policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an
orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF
goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its
scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S.
scientific workforce.
