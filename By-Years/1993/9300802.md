This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral Dissertation Research
program. The research will examine the occupational culture of municipal
firefighters and the relationship of that culture to racial, ethnic and gender
diversity in the workforce. The investigators will employ a range of qualitative
techniques of data collection, notably interviews and participant observation,
in a number of branches of the fire department in Oakland, California. The study
will focus on the aspects of occupational culture that resist the influx of
workers from previously excluded minority groups and on variations in the
process of occupational socialization that may reflect the race, ethnicity or
gender of the newcomer. This research will contribute to the sociology of
occupations, race and ethnic relations, and gender, as well as increasing the
knowledge base for municipal and national policies concerning occupational
integration of minority groups and women. In addition to the scientific gains to
be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a highly
promising student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation. Thus it
contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next
generation of sociologists.
