The University-Industry Demonstration Partnership will host a workshop on the
Discovery-to-Innovation (D-I) process. The participants will include leaders
from the university, industry (large and small) and government. The workshop
participants will discuss the strategic, operational, and scientific issues
associated with new opportunities to accelerate the D-I process. In addition to
researchers from the engineering, computer science and physical science
disciplines, the workshop will engage social and behavioral scientists who are
leaders in the area of science of science and innovation policy. The
intellectual goals of the workshop will focus on discovering new approaches to
innovation research, identifying emerging and potentially supportive research
activities at NSF, investigating new opportunities for University-Industry
innovation research partnerships, and incorporating scientific analysis into the
Discovery-to-Innovation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this
workshop will be to strengthen and broaden U-I research partnerships and
collaborations which will ultimately amplify U.S competitiveness.
