The acquisition of the Fourier-transform-infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer
allows the chemistry program to improve and update the chemistry laboratory
curriculum. Applications of FTIR spectrophotometer are being incorporated into
all chemistry courses with the emphasis on organic chemistry. Organic chemistry
students use the FTIR to study functional group interconversion, identify
unknowns, follow the progress of reactions, and help establish the level of
purity of synthesized compounds. Other introductory general chemistry classes
may use the FTIR in the chemistry content related to carbon compounds and
experiments. The introduction of the FTIR spectrophotometer into the chemistry
program, particularly into the teaching of Organic Chemistry, is aligning the
curriculum and laboratory experiences that students receive with the
expectations and practice of 4-year transfer institutions and in industry.
