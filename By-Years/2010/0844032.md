&lt;br/&gt;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This project will establish an analysis resource
consisting of a cluster equipped with MATLAB on the
Teragrid.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This will provide a valuable
addition for TeraGrid users pre and post-processing their outputs with complex
analytics and fast simulations using a very user friendly interface -- one
conducive to rapid innovation and discovery.&lt;br/&gt;Broader
Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Matlab is an important data analysis tool for many Teragrid
users and will support many user communities.
