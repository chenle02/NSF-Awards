This research is developing an understanding of the mechanical properties of
cubic forms of trialuminides. Phase stability and ductility of cubic forms of
aluminum-titanium-chromium and aluminum-titanium-manganese ternary alloys are
the focus of the study. Part of the phase stability work involves the effect of
fourth element additions on the extent of the cubic phase (L12) region. This
includes the determination of specific element site occupation, atomic size and
electronic structure. Micromechanisms associated with the dislocations
accounting for plastic flow in the alloys are being studied. It is expected that
the research will contribute to the knowledge base needed for the development of
new families of low density, heat-resistant alloys that have high specific
strengths and excellent oxidation resistance.
