In this project, investigators from UNC Charlotte are building a
software&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure named ``BRIDGES" (Bridging Real-world
Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;Designed to Goal-align, Engage and Stimulate) to
transform student&lt;br/&gt;experiences in computing education. The primary goal
of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;improve retention of CS majors, especially at the
sophomore level. BRIDGES&lt;br/&gt;facilitates a hands-on experience for solving
traditional problems in computer&lt;br/&gt;science using real-world information
systems, such as Facebook, Twitter,&lt;br/&gt;Google Maps, etc. BRIDGES is being
integrated into two computer science&lt;br/&gt;required courses, the senior
capstone course and the sophomore level&lt;br/&gt;data structures and algorithms
course, enabling a senior-sophomore bridge.&lt;br/&gt;Sophomore and senior
students in these courses will partner in joint lab&lt;br/&gt;sessions to
utilize and create new extensions to the BRIDGES infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;to
support data structures programming assignments. Sophomores will act
as&lt;br/&gt;customers for the new tools and data sets created by seniors and
use them in&lt;br/&gt;their course programming assignments. In this manner,
BRIDGES will create a&lt;br/&gt;more connected student body by partnering
sophomores and seniors, which&lt;br/&gt;should lead to improved student
retention and engagement. BRIDGES is&lt;br/&gt;being built using open source and
web technologies, promoting easy&lt;br/&gt;dissemination. Two workshops on the
BRIDGES system will be held,&lt;br/&gt;involving educators from regional
colleges and high schools, including&lt;br/&gt;minority and underrepresented
institutions. An additional workshop will be&lt;br/&gt;held associated with a
major education conference. Students from the STARS Alliance (an NSF funded
Broadening Participation in Computing consortium) will be given access to the
learning materials and infrastructure to incorporate into their outreach and
teaching activities.
