This research program will focus on the development and characterization of
organic thin films deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum. The project
entails optimization of the thin film deposition process, structural studies of
the organic films and systematic characterization of organic film- based
structures. Measurements include current-voltage characteristics to understand
physical processes of conduction and breakdown, capacitance-voltage
characteristics to determine nature and density of surface states. The overall
objective is to make a realistic assessment of potential applications of the
thermally grown films in active electronic devices such as MIS structures.
