Over six months, the University of Texas at San Antonio will bring a team of
high school mathematics and science teachers together with college and
university mathematics and science teachers to align curricula. The objectives
of the three-day seminar are: (1) to identify difficult topics in algebra and
physics and design strategies to ensure mastery by all students; (2) to
establish the foundation for an ongoing dialogue between K-12 and higher
education; (3) to engage the broader business community in the articulation of
the needs for science, mathematics, and technology skills for the future
economic development of the city region; and (4) to develop a community campaign
to encourage higher standards in mathematics, science, and technology.

This proposed activity will directly impact the entire 9 area San Antonio school
districts and indirectly impact other urban school districts in Texas. This
effort is based on a documented need for providing curriculum alignment of high
school math and science courses with college level courses. This project focuses
on aligning high school Algebra II with college algebra and developing
strategies for teaching high school physics.
