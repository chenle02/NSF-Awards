Dimensional tolerancing and metrology are extremely important manufacturing
technologies. They are key elements of the Federal Coordinating Council on
Science, Engineering and Technology (FCCSET) Taxonomy of Technologies for
Advanced Manufacturing Research and Development (R&D), and are critical to the
internationalization of United States industry. This forum will serve the useful
purposes of: (1) helping to define the progress to date on emerging standards;
(2) delineating the current key research problems; (3) enlarging the pool of
involved, knowledgeable researchers, users, and teachers; and (4) yielding an
archival record useful to a growing community in industry and the universities.
