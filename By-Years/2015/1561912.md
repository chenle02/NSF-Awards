The Basic Plasma Science Facility (BaPSF) at UCLA is a national user facility
for the study of ionized gases, or plasmas. Plasmas pervade our universe with
almost all visible matter, such as stars, in the plasma state. Earth is immersed
in a plasma environment, with plasma flowing from our sun in the form of the
solar wind and intercepting the Earth's magnetosphere; plasma processes help
generate the charged particles that populate the Van Allen radiation belts and
also lead to phenomena such as the Aurora Borealis. In addition, there are many
important terrestrial applications for plasmas, including processing of
semiconductor chips and magnetically-confined plasmas for producing energy by
nuclear fusion. Studying fundamental plasma processes in the laboratory is
therefore essential to further our understanding of the cosmos and enable
important advances in terrestrial applications of plasmas. The BaPSF provides a
unique and cutting-edge platform for these studies. The National Science
Foundation, along with the Department of Energy Office of Fusion Energy
Sciences, provides funding to support the operation of the BaPSF for the use of
researchers across the United States. Users apply for experimental time on the
facility; if approved, this experimental time is free of charge to researchers
who will publish the results of their research in peer-reviewed
journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the BaPSF is the Large Plasma Device
which produces 20 meter long, ~60cm diameter magnetized plasmas using cathode
discharge plasma sources. Typical plasma parameters are electron density of
10^12 per cubic cm, electron temperature of 5 eV and magnetic field strength
from 0.04 Tesla to 0.2 Tesla. Recent research by users of the facility has
included studies of collisionless shocks generated by laser-blowoff; electron-
beam-driven chirping whistler waves; nonlinear parametric instability of Alfven
waves; current sheets, flux ropes and magnetic reconnection; and acceleration of
electrons by inertial Alfven waves. An upgrade of the plasma source will be
undertaken in the current award period, using a Lanthanum Hexaboride cathode to
produce much higher density and temperature plasmas with electron densities of
10^13 per cubic cm, electron temperatures of ~12 eV, and ion temperatures of ~6
eV.
