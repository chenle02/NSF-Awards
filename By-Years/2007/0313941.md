This grant provides support for the acquisition of instrumentation for low
temperature research and education on micro/nano-scale electromechanical
resonators at Cornell University. This critical instrumentation will enable low
temperature actuation and detection of ultra-small, high frequency resonant
structures. Nanoscale mechanical structures have the potential to enable new
functionalities and ultra sensitive sensor technology by taking advantage of
their low mass. New designs that optimize devices are one of the foci of the
research that will be enabled by this instrument. Access to low temperatures
where intrinsic loss mechanisms are quenched should lead to a significant
increase in the quality factor, a basis of new high-sensitivity devices. The new
instrumentation will also enable parametric amplification at low temperatures
via electromagnetic, optical, or other methods. The enhanced quality factor is
critical in helping to expose non-intrinsic design and process dependent losses.
The optimization of the low temperature properties of these structures will
positively impact applicability, improve room temperature behavior, and provide
significant educational opportunities.

The simultaneous exploration of these frontiers will present exciting research
opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral associates and will be a
valuable introduction to nano-technology for undergraduates as well as high
school teachers. The intuitive appeal of these ultra-small devices will attract
students into the sciences at an early stage. Access to these diverse audiences
is planned under our program. The instrument itself will be a challenge to
complete, and will provide an outstanding training ground for researchers at all
levels in the fundamental sciences, and advanced nano-technology that is vital
to our future technological infrastructure.
