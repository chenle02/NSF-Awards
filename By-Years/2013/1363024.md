Abstract (Climenhaga, 1363024): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides
funding to help defray the expenses of 25 US graduate students for a 10-day
summer school in Houston, Texas called "Houston Summer School in Dynamical
Systems". It will also help support one lecturer who will deliver some of the
lectures to the graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be 7
internationally recognized lecturers giving expository talks on many of the
recent exciting results and developments in probabilistic dynamics and
applications. Most of these techniques are not in textbook form and are only
found in specialized journals in a form not readily accessible to a beginning
graduate student. The school will enable the students to become familiar with
main ideas and techniques of modern dynamics at a formative stage of their
research career. In particular, the school will introduce recent developments in
probabilistic dynamics to mathematical researchers who may go on to work in
other fields that will benefit from these ideas.
