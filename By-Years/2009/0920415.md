Prior experience with SENCER, an NSF-CCLI dissemination track, shows that the
SENCERizing of courses attracts students to STEM fields and cultivates an
understanding of science and mathematics. However, SENCER ideals have rarely
been applied beyond individual courses and have not been attempted on a campus-
wide scale or within Early College programs. This project establishes an
academic bridge between high school and college and integrates SENCER civic
issues into non-STEM courses. Three institutions are collaborating to implement
SENCER pedagogy and build STEM faculty expertise via a SENCER learning community
for first-year non-declared majors while simultaneously embedding the STEM-
driven civic issue into multiple disciplines across the university via an
innovative educational model, Rethinking STEM. Additionally, this project
introduces SENCERized courses into an Early College high school program. The
thematic course sequence focuses on science inquiry, applied data analysis,
service learning, and information literacy within a project-based learning
environment. STEM concepts from biology, chemistry, mathematics, public health,
and engineering are woven into student writing, speaking, and teamwork
assignments. The various linked components of the project can be adopted at
multiple levels including into a single course, an Early College program, or a
campus-wide integration model, depending on institutional resources. The
comprehensive SENCERized model is designed to overcome institutional barriers to
STEM reform including disciplinary silos, faculty resistance to novel teaching
pedagogies, and constrictions of traditional course scheduling. Through
intentional curriculum design, students are better informed, educated, and able
to make responsible decisions about pursuing a STEM major.
