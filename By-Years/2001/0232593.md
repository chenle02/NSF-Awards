This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
novel method of pumping and controlling fluid flow within microfluidic devices
via surface nanostructures consisting of self-assembled monolayers containing
covalently bound electrochemically active species. By controlling the surface
energy (surface wettability) within the flow channels, fluid can be made to flow
to the desired location within the device. Application of a low voltage (<2
volts) switches the surface between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states. At this
low voltage, silicon can be used to make the microdevices, in contrast to
electro-osmotic pumping which requires glass, quartz, or plastic devices.
Silicon is highly advantageous because unique ultraprecise low cost
manufacturing methods have been developed by the electronics industry for
silicon, which will lead to cost-effective manufacturing of the microfluidic
device.

Commercially, the compact integrated sensor devices emerging from this work will
have widespread commercial use in clinical medicine, drug discovery, genetic
testing and research, environmental monitoring, and military and antiterrorism
security (monitoring pathogens, toxins, and nerve agents). In particular, these
enhanced microfluidics can be combined with the unique silicon microneedle
devices developed for painless one step diabetic glucose self-testing, relevant
to minority populations in which diabetes is very prevalent. Additionally, the
ease of use of biodiagnostic products made possible by this new technology will
benefit long-term diabetics handicapped by poor eyesight and limited hand-eye
coordination, because performance of a test is completely automatic requiring no
transfer of blood from a fingerstick or armstick to a test strip (required in
all current products).
