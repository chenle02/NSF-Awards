The 2016 IEEE SEC Conference (Symposium on Edge Computing) will be held in
Washington, D.C. on Oct. 27-28, 2016. This preeminent technical conference is
the primary venue for presenting new research results in the area of "edge
computing", a new paradigm in which the resources of a small data center are
placed at the edge of the Internet, in close proximity to mobile devices,
sensors, and end users, and the emerging Internet of Things. Participants will
have the opportunity to present their work, attend panel and keynote sessions,
and interact with many people conducting leading-edge research in the field.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help build student participation, this award will
support 15 students. Participation in conferences is a valuable and important
part of the graduate school experience providing students exposure to senior
researchers and leading edge work in the field.
