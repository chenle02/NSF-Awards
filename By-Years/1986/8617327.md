Neuroengineering research investigates the potential of very large numbers of
multiply-connected nonlinear circuits to model certain brain functions such as
pattern recognition, associative and content addressable memory, self-teaching,
etc. Such neuromorphic systems have had increasing interest due to increased
cross-disciplinary communication, as well as effective computer simulations of
potential applications, electronic implementations, and optical implementations.
Applications to such problems as the Travelling Salesman Problem, which
demonstrates the advantages of massively parallel approaches for some problems,
has brough attention to the fundamental approaches. A workshop to bring together
those most intimately involved in these approaches to provide a chance for the
community at large to have an exposure to this new field is both timely and
needed.
