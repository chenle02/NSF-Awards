9401206 Bourdon The project focuses on intertwining maps for holomorphic
functions on the open disc. Given a holomorphic map a model can be constructed
using the pair consisting of the intertwining map and the associated map. The
project considers how change in the original map affect the intertwining
component of the model. In particular, computer investigations will be made of
the convergence properties of a sequence of intertwiners for a given holomorphic
map. Progress in understanding these linear-fractional models will provide
insight into both the behavior of composition operators and the dynamics of
holomorphic self-maps under iteration. The project involves the interplay of
operator theory and function theory. Operator theory is that part of mathematics
that studies the infinite generalization of matrices. Classical function theory
provides a source of models for operator theory. The current project involves a
study of such function theoretic models. The importance of this work is a
consequence of connections with iterative graphic computer computations.
Undergraduate student involvement in the project will have a long term benefit
for science. ***
