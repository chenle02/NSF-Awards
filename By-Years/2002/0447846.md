This SGER award supports studies of contamination and alteration of Antarctic
meteorites during long-term storage. It's goal is to both characterize the
processes and understand their effects on subsequent research using these
meteorites. These effects are poorly constrained at present, but are critical to
a number of meteorite research areas, especially those regarding the origin of
life. Three meteorites from the 1977 ANSMET field season will be sampled and
examined for their microbial populations, as well as the type and level of
metabolic activity. The meteorites will also be examined for anthropogenic
contamination by petroleum products, plastics, plasticizers, and other compounds
that directly affect their inorganic and organic carbon componet. The
information gained will ultimately be used to frame a more comprehensive
Antarctic meteorite contamination study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T Wagner
