Several small-scale experimental studies in classrooms by Star and Rittle-
Johnson demonstrate the value of comparison in mathematics learning: Students
who learned by comparing and contrasting alternative solution methods made
greater gains in conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and flexibility
than those who studied the same solution methods one at a time. This study will
extend that prior work by developing, piloting, and then evaluating the impact
of comparison on students' learning of mathematics in a full-year algebra
course. Sixty Algebra I teachers will participate in a randomized controlled
trial of the contrasting-examples instructional approach, using a delayed
treatment design.
