This award is partial funding for the purchase of a high power copper vapor
laser for use as a source of illumination for imaging various rapid processes.
The major project involves particle dispersion in turbulent shear flows. Other
uses include investigating the structure of burning liquid pools and the
chipping and tool wear processes during machining. The major project should help
clarify the role of particle inertia on the transport properties of small
particles in turbulent flows. Mixing of powders and sprays is important in many
combustion and gas- solids contacting processes.
