The primary objective of this research is to examine the skeletons from a well
documented archaeological sequence (Illinois Valley) in an attempt to detect the
development of more expert bone setting over time. The working hypothesis is
that, with increasing specialization of roles with increasingly complex societal
structure, medical/healing techniques should have become more adept. This is a
new idea, and will call for a new approach of skeletal materials, with readily
available techniques. The idea and approach are novel, and the proposal is a
very modest one.
