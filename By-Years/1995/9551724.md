The revision of the chemistry curriculum centers around the acquisition of an
automated gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer with volatile and semivolatile
capability. In addition to gaining experience with complex multicomponent
analyses and automated systems with this equipment, students analyze more
unknowns during one laboratory exercise than they once completed during their
entire undergraduate career. The objectives of the project are: (1)
modifications of existing courses; (2) development of new courses focused on
environmental applications; (3) development of an emphasis area in applied
chemistry; and (4) support for interdisciplinary undergraduate research.
University faculty, students, and the Spokane Intercollegiate Research and
Technology Institute are collaborating to disseminate and evaluate the project
from the perspective of regional universities and employers.
