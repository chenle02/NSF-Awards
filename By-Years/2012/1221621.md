Following on the outcomes of an NSF-funded conference to this project's
principal investigator, a team of educators, scientists, and communication
experts from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, University of Massachusetts
Boston, Hofstra, University, the Boston Museum of Science and other
professionals is implementing a full-scale development project to investigate
the impact of an Out-of-Home Multi-Media (OHMM) exhibit on adults riding
Boston's subway system (the "T"). The project's goal is to design, implement,
and study the efficacy of an OHMM model for free-choice science learning about
our changing climate. A rotating exhibit of twelve specially designed placards,
posters, as well as virtual, web-based learning resources linked to the exhibit
content will potentially engage over 420,000 adult riders per day along two of
the T's four lines.

Wireless access throughout light rail systems and the rise of smart phones
represent a confluence of factors making an innovative form of engagement
possible. The work is positioned to test this new model for informal science
education and potentially could be expanded in Boston and into other cities
around the country.
