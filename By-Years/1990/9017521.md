The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in
chemical process design between Peter Glavic, Z. Kravanja, of the University of
Maribor and I. Grossmann of Carnegie Mellon University is to develop a computer
system to solve production problems in chemical processing. The researchers
propose to develop a software model for optimal planning and scheduling of
multiproduct processes. Dr. Kravanja and Dr. Grossman have conducted some
preliminary work together. They propose to develop software which can be applied
to environmental, energy consumption and factory retooling and retrofit
problems, and which can be used as a teaching tool in engineering education.
This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in
Science and Technology and is supported through a joint fund consisting of
matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments. The U.S.
contribution is provided annually by the Department of State. No NSF funds are
involved. The award, except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the
Yugoslav institution.
