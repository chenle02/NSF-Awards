Does a neighborhood experience more crime when its population suddenly
increases? Are individuals more fearful when they move from a neighborhood they
know to one they do not? Sociological and criminological research has clearly
substantiated that neighborhoods matter in generating crime; but this research
has yet to fully explain how neighborhood change matters. This study examines
what happens when traditional, project-based public housing is eliminated and
residents have to relocate to private-market rental housing in other
neighborhoods. Building on existing baseline interviews, this study will track
former public housing residents to (1) examine changes in criminal victimization
and fear of victimization at the individual level and (2) identify neighborhoods
that receive a disproportionate share of former public housing residents
allowing for a geospatial analysis of how patterns of crime change at the
aggregate level. Not only will the study take advantage of a unique opportunity
to examine the effects of neighborhood change on crime, it has considerable
broader impacts. The elimination of project-based public housing is being
planned in cities across the country. Understanding the effects of such a large
change in housing policy on crime will aid housing authorities and police
departments in working together to lessen the potential negative implications of
these transitions. Beyond informing public policy, this study will serve as a
model of faculty-student mentorship and collaboration. Graduate and
undergraduate students at a majority-minority university will take part in all
aspects of the study, broadening opportunities in research for underrepresented
students.
