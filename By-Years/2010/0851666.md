EEC -0851666&lt;br/&gt;P.I. - Sheng-Jen Hsieh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two year
REU site program at Texas A&amp;M University will provide an opportunity for ten
undergraduate students per year to participate in hands-on research focused on
the use of imaging techniques to characterize biomarkers and biomaterials. In
addition to the research projects, students will participate in weekly research
seminars, field trips, and career development workshops. They will be required
to write a report and present the results of their research to their REU peers
and at an REU poster session on campus. After completing the program,
participates will be encouraged to polish their reports in order to present at a
national conference and/or publish in an academic journal. Participants in this
program will benefit from the activities coordinated with other REU and summer
research programs at the university, shared housing accommodations with other
REU and summer school students, and special programs for minority students
offered by the Associate Dean for Diversity in the College of
Science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this REU site program is to help
participants learn and understand the research process, to acquire laboratory
skills, and to prepare for graduate school and career success. Recruitment
efforts will be targeted to participants from underrepresented groups in
engineering and science and students who have limited opportunities to
participate in research at their home institutions. All participants in this REU
site program will come from outside the host
university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
