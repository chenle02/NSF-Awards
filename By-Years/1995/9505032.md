In the project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program, Donald Setser of
Kansas State University will study state-resolved dynamics and kinetics of phase
species important in combustion and atmospheric chemistry. Various spectroscopic
methods will be used to prepare reactants and observe product state
distributions. Infrared chemiluminescence will be used to study products from
atom-radical and radical-radical reactions, identify mechanisms, and determine
overall rate constants. Electronic emission and laser induced fluorescence will
be used to study the mechanism and state distributions of rare gas halide
molecules produced by two-photon laser assisted reactions. These studies will
compare the state distributions of products resulting from collisions in dilute
gas mixtures with those obtained from reactions within a prepared van der Waals
molecule. The results of these investigations will be interpreted in terms of
dynamical models which have been developed for certain types of gas phase
reactions and the insights obtained will be used to understand more complex
reactive systems. Radicals are highly reactive, usually unstable molecules which
are present in high concentration in energetic chemical reactors such as
combustion systems. Reactions of radicals are also important in the mechanisms
responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Professor
Setser's investigations will provide information about the elementary reactions
involved in these mechanisms, and the nature and energy content of the species
produced by these reactions.
