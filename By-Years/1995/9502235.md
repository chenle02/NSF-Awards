CTS-9502235 Roger Harrison U of Oklahoma Research will be performed to improve
the purification of recombinant proteins by avoiding the initial expression of
these proteins as insoluble inclusion bodies. A primary goal is to test new
fusion proteins that are predicted to enhance the solubility of normally
insoluble recombinant proteins. Four proteins with very high solubility in
Escherichia coli will be combined with two different target proteins known to
have low solubility. The fusion proteins with highest expression levels will be
purified. The target protein will be purified after its cleavage from the fusion
protein and characterized further. The experiments will test the validity of a
model proposed to predict the solubility of fusion proteins. The results may
lead to fundamental advances in fusion protein technology which could have
significant impact in biotechnology.
