Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy is being introduced into the chemistry
curriculum. The project centers on a modern FTIR spectrometer, FTIR accessories,
and a dedicated microcomputer. The equipment is being used with old experiments
as well as with new ones designed to illustrate modern infrared spectroscopy.
Students from the introductory laboratory courses to the advanced, integrated
laboratory courses and thesis research projects are using the FTIR instrument.
It is likely that it will become the chemistry department's most heavily used
spectrometer, replacing three unreliable vacuum-tube instruments. With the FTIR,
students are able to characterize unknowns and synthesized materials faster and
with greater confidence. Studies of "real world" samples are being facilitated
as well as the investigation of reaction rates and molecular structure. Since
FTIR methods are finding increased use in government, industrial and academic
laboratories, students are better prepared to enter the workforce, graduate
schools, and professional schools because of this project. The grantee is
matching the award from non-Federal sources.
