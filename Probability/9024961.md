This research is in the area of probability and involves the limit theorems for
real and vector valued random variables with emphasis on the law of the iterated
logarithm (LIL) and the Gaussian central limit theorem (CLT). In particular,
problems related to the CLT and LIL motivated by trimming and self-
normalizations will be studied. The second order behavior of Gaussian random
vectors and limit sets for random samples of processes, as well as coverage
problems, will be examined. Other items under consideration concern vector
valued partial sums, empirical processes, and the rates of growth, local
asymptotics, and rates of escape for Banach space valued Brownian motion. The
central theme in probability, and throughout its diverse applications to
problems in engineering, physics, and statistics, is the study of limit theorems
for partial sums of random variables in both finite and infinite dimensional
settings. Of primary importance is the strong law of large numbers (SLLN), the
central limit theorem (CLT), and the rate of convergence for the SLLN, namely
the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). This research project will be
concentrated on the study of these limit theorems.
