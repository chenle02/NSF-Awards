This project is a Special Quarter in Statistical Diagnostics at the University
of Minnesota. Professor Anthony Atkinson of Imperial College, London will be in
residence at the University of Minnesota in the Spring Quarter, 1989, and ten to
twelve researchers from outside Minnesota will be invited to participate in an
ongoing research colloquium, each visitor spending several days at Minnesota.
Support is available for these visitors, with a portion allocated for young
Ph.D.'s and graduate students. Several areas will be emphasized, including
diagnostics for time series, for multivariate analysis, and for quality control.
Among the U.S. visitors who have agreed to participate are R. Carroll, N. Duan,
D. Hinkley, W. Meeker, and T. Haste. The activities are directed by Professor
Sanford Weisberg of the Applied Statistics Department at the University of
Minnesota. Statistical diagnostics concerns methods used to examine assumptions
made in the analysis of data and to choose between competing models. Methods
have been developed for many types of statistical models.
