9314092 Kreisler This group will continue to analyze the massive quantities of
data taken in runs at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at Fermilab to study
hadronic interactions in which charm and strange particles are produced in
multiparticle final states. An innovative use of fast on-line computational
techniques and specially developed hardware allowed trigger logic decisions to
be made and data to be recorded at extremely high rates. Similar techniques are
applied to off-line reconstruction to prepare event samples for analysis. Topics
of interest to the University of Massachusetts group include Bose-Einstein
correlations, hyperon polarization, precision measurements of hyperon masses,
and meson-spectroscopy based on study of four-mesons states among which evidence
will be sought for "glueball" production. ***
