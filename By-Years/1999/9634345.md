Title: Selenium in Lake Sediments: A Measure of the Extent of Sea- Ice Cover
Several lines of paleolimnological and lake water chemistry research suggest
that (1) selenium (Se) in lake sediments is linearly related to the percentage
of organic matter for individual lakes and (2) normalized to organic matter
concentration for lake districts, Se concentration is related to distance from
the open ocean. The linkage is through the delivery of Se in marine aerosols
from the open ocean to lake basin catchments and the subsequent incorporation of
Se (a chemical analog for S) into organic matter. Marine aerosols are the only
significant sources of Se to most aquatic ecosystems. This SGER award supports
the investigation of stratigraphic variations in Se concentration in coastal
lakes as a record of changing distance to open ocean and as a proxy for sea-ice
cover. Methods will involve chemical palynological, and radiometric analyses
(the later to establish absolute age) of existing cores spanning the Holocene
and core spanning the Little Age to the present. This will enable calibration of
the method against known climate variation and historically-documented variation
in sea-ice cover.
