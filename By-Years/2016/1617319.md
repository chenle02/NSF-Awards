This research addresses the challenges of continually-aware high-fidelity
sensing. The key challenges include the energy consumption of the sensor
interface and the amount of data that needs to be communicated by the sensor by
considering two sensing scenarios in which a sensor must be constantly operate
with high fidelity. In the first case, the sensor continuously processes a
signal and delivers an output, e.g., a hearing aid operating continuously, and
performing sophisticated high-fidelity audio signal processing and yet running
from a small battery for a long period of time. In the second scenario, the
device detects and acts on a particular sensory stimulus, e.g., the detection
and recognition of a speaker (person) or words or sentences. The broader impacts
of this research will be enhanced with substantial efforts in outreach and
education. These include outreach to K-12 students, research experience for
undergraduates from underrepresented minorities, and updated graduate and
undergraduate curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this research
investigates a new type of sensor interface circuit that efficiently implements
both of these high fidelity sensing scenarios. It does this by embedding
sophisticated processing and intelligence within the sensor interface
architecture. This approach is different from the conventional approach which
relies on separate signal processing devices or alternatively sends data to the
cloud for processing. The new approach is implemented with little extra cost and
energy consumption, beyond that of the original interface circuit. The expected
benefit is that the overall energy consumption is greatly reduced and the amount
of data generated by the sensor is to be reduced by orders of magnitude.
