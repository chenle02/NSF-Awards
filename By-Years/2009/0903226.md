A consortium of two year colleges in South Carolina, Clemson University and
three ATE Centers builds on previous projects to plan a center for conducting
education for automotive and aviation technicians using e-learning technologies
including virtual classrooms and personalized learning. Automotive and aviation
curriculum materials are to be identified for inclusion in electronic format to
field test the effectiveness of virtual classrooms to achieve the learning
objectives for a diverse group of students in different educational settings. A
community of scholars to engage students in automotive and aerospace technician
education is formed through professional development workshops and interactions
with industry. The dissemination of the products is also planned.
