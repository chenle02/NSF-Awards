In this project in the Physical chemistry program of the Chemistry Division,
Prof. Richard Bersohn of Columbia University will conduct research in the area
of controlled chemical reactions. The yields of chemical reactions are to be
changed by variation of the relative phase of two lasers, following the
suggestion of Brumer, Shapiro and Hepburn. Specifically, systems of the form
HABC: HONO, HNCO, HNNN, HOOH and HOCD3, dissociating into competing channels HA
+ BC or H + ABC will be investigated. While control of the relative phase has
been used to successfully demonstrate one photon and three photon absorption
processes, phase control of molecular dissociation has not been demonstrated so
far. These experiments will contribute to our understanding and ultimately to
our ability of controlling the outcome of chemical reaction along a desired
path.
