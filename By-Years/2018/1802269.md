This research project concerns one of the basic questions in mathematics:
solving algebraic equations. Information about solutions is encoded in various
mathematical objects: algebraic cycles, automorphic forms, and L-functions. The
project aims to deepen the understanding of these mathematical objects and the
connection between them. It will also advance the techniques for understanding
the arithmetic of elliptic curves, particularly the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics
Institute. Elliptic curves and similar algebraic equations have wide application
in other disciplines such as cryptography; results of the research are expected
to advance understanding in these areas as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
research comprises several projects in number theory: the arithmetic of Heegner
points, L-functions of elliptic curves, and their higher dimensional
generalizations. The work will investigate the congruences between Heegner
points and their various applications, including Goldfeld's conjecture on
elliptic curves in quadratic twists families and the rank of elliptic curves in
Rubin-Silverberg families. The project will also investigate the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer formula for elliptic curves at additive primes. For higher-
dimensional generalizations, the investigator will explore arithmetic
intersection problems on Rapoport-Zink spaces arising from arithmetic Gan-Gross-
Prasad conjectures and the arithmetic fundamental lemma. It is also planned to
initiate a new program for simultaneous generalization of the Waldspurger and
Gross-Zagier formulas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
