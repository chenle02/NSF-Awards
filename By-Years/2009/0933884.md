(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submarine mid-ocean ridges are the most
volcanically active places on the planet. Lavas erupted from them cover roughly
2/3 of the Earth's surface. This volcanism is a major outlet for heat and matter
in Earth's interior and plays a significant role in ocean chemistry and the
ecology of the seafloor life. This research evaluates processes responsible for
variations in erupted lava compositions that occur at the regional (100-1000 km)
to local (10-100 km) length scales and that operate over decades to millennia.
Using data mining techniques, global databases of seafloor volcanic rock
compositions, and statistical analysis, the work seeks to determine coupled
variations in magma differentiation, magma mixing, and mantle source
composition. Constraints on timescales will be determined from published
radiogenic U-series dates as well as new radiogenic dates that will be
determined on key rock samples. Work focuses on study sites where melt supply
has recently varied in time or space over a range of volcanic conditions and
where rock samples and compositional data are already in hand. The importance of
the work is that it sheds light on the magnitude and temporal-spatial
variability of movement of material and heat from Earth's interior to its
surface, with attendant implications for how Earth's crust is constructed and
environmental change in the deep oceans. Broader impacts of the work include
international collaboration, student training, and support of an institution in
an EPSCoR state (Hawaii).
