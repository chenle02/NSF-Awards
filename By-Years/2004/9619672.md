Paleoclimate Record from South America: Lake Titicaca A long and continuous
paleoclimate record from tropical South America is needed to answer several
persistent and important questions. This award supports the recovery of such a
record by coring the deep basin of Lake Titicaca on the northern Altiplano of
Peru and Bolivia. Through the preliminary analysis of a series of short, mini-
piston cores, it is demonstrated that the sediments of the lake are suitable for
climatic reconstruction. Previous studies revealed large-amplitude fluctuations
of lake level in the Holocene and Pleistocene, implying that effective moisture
(and probably temperature) has dramatically fluctuated. Siting of a series of
long cores will be aided by medium-resolution, deeper penetration seismic
reflection profiling. The cores will be subsequently analyzed for chronology
(AMS radiocarbon), sedimentology, physical properties, geochemistry, stable
isotopic analysis of organic carbon and cellulose; determination of organic and
inorganic phosphorous, and biogenic silica; and paleobiota (ostracode and diatom
species compositions), This record will allow us to examine in detail the timing
and mechanisms of tropical forcing of high-latitude climate, as well as the
linkage between the climate of the Altiplano and the Amazon basin.
