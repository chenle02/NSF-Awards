Project Abstract Title: TOPICS IN LAGRANGIAN GEOMETRY

The project will investigate the question of the existence of special lagrangian
submanifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds using variational techniques and using mean
curvature flow. The variational techniques involve the study of constrained
variational problems for lagrangian cycles. These problems can be formulated in
arbitrary Kaehler (or symplectic) manifolds and involve minimizing volume among
lagrangians that represent a fixed homology class and proving optimal regularity
of the minimizer. In particular the project hopes to show that if the ambient
manifold is a Calabi-Yau $3$-fold then, for a suitably formulated problem, the
minimizer is special lagrangian. It has long been known that the mean curvature
flow of a lagrangian submanifold preserves the lagrangian condition if the
ambient manifold is Kaehler-Einstein. The project intends to investigate the
regularity properties of the mean curvature flow of a lagrangian submanifold of
a Kaehler-Einstein manifold. In particular, it intends to investigate the
conditions under which the flow does and does not develop singularities in
finite time.

Variational problems with geometric constraints and mean curvature flow in
codimension greater than one are on the frontier of mathematical analysis. These
problems are natural in geometry but they are also important in many different
applied problems. In material science a ``model'' problem asks to find a
minimizer of ``kinetic energy'' among area preserving maps between disks and to
find the optimal smoothness of the minimizer. At present, the existence of a
minimizer is known but nothing is known about its singularities. Parts of this
project are closely related to this kind of ``regularity'' question. In string
theory well known work conjectures the existence of a certain class of volume
minimizing three dimensional surfaces called special lagrangian submanifolds.
This project is a direct attempt to answer this question in the affirmative.
Mean curvature flow in various codimensions models many different physical
phenomena. This project attempts to exploit the ``lagrangian'' constraint to get
an understanding of mean curvature flow in higher codimensions. This subject is
relatively unexplored. The techniques investigated in this project hold the
promise of enhancing the interaction between geometry and various fields of
applied mathematics and engineering and in bringing new results and techniques
into these fields.
