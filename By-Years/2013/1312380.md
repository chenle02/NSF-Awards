This program will develop theoretical tools and analysis methods to apply to
current and upcoming Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) &lt;br/&gt;total
intensity and polarization data. Three specific analyses will be considered: the
Cosmic Microwave Background lensing signal by foreground galaxy clusters, the
large angle CMB lensing versus temperature cross correlation, and an extension
and improvement of ACT's measurements of galaxy motions via the mean pairwise
velocity of galaxy clusters. These three studies will advance the understanding
of growth of structure in the universe and the nature of gravitation on
cosmological scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include
training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, Dr. Kosowsky will
organize a scientist-teacher partnership program in the Pittsburgh region,
modeled on the successful NSF Graduate STEM Fellows in K-12 Education program.
