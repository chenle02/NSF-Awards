A laboratory is being developed for the purpose of conducting experiments and
demonstrations on the principles of plasmas and plasma processes. The RIT
facility is well equipped with tools for the production of integrated circuit
chips. This facility includes plasma etching equipment, but it is heavily
automated and mechanically inflexible, making it difficult to use for
demonstrations and experiments. This project will provide demonstrations and
experiments designed to improve student understanding of plasma formation,
plasma etching, and sputtering. The major components of the apparatus are (1)
the plasma chamber (2) vacuum pumping system and (3) gas flow controls. The
assembled apparatus will be interfaced with existing plasma diagnostic
instruments for use. Laboratory demonstrations are planned to show the spectra
of the plasma light emission, the chemical species in the plasma itself with and
without etching, the sputtering phenomenon, and the various effects of
parameters such as pressure, feed gas composition, Ac vs. DC power, and
electrode spacing.
