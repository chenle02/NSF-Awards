Geographers, demographers, sociologists, and other social scientists have
clearly documented that both migration and fertility rates are highly correlated
with employment rates, but little attention has been paid to possible direct
relationships between individual and household decisions to relocate and to have
children. This Research Opportunities for Women Planning Grant will enable the
investigator to begin a systematic exploration of that relationship by
articulating and refining statistical methods that can be used in a variety of
regional contexts and at different scales. The investigator also will begin
testing a macro-level model of the linkages between migration and fertility,
using data at the state level. This project will be the first step in what
should be a significant effort that will enhance both theoretical and empirical
knowledge about these important demographic relationships. The project also will
provide a superb opportunity for a young female scholar with an excellent
background to further improve her basic research skills.
