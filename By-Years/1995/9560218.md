This Small Business Innovation Reserch (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
a new class of plasma deposited organosilicon resists. These will be highly
photosensitive organosilicon hydride network materials, which may be photo-
oxidatively patterned and processed without removal from a vacuum processing
environment Image development is accomplished by chlorine based reactive ion
etch (RIE), leaving a robust, negative tone SiO2-like etch mask that allows
pattern transfer into underlying materials in a single RIE sequence. This
approach will allow significant reduction in facilities and materials costs, and
the proposed plasma deposited photosensitive films will be applicable to all
phases of current semiconductor manufacturing and other microelectronic devices
as well. Commercial applications are also expected in the flat panel display
industry, multi-chip modules, and photomask manufacture.
