The primary objective of this ongoing research project is to improve our
understanding and prediction of atmospheric variability with time scales longer
than a week. The research involves the diagnosis of observational and model
generated data sets, using statistical techniques such as simple compositing,
digital filtering in the time domain, principal component analysis and canonical
correlation analysis, and emphasizing the dynamical interpretation of the
results in light of our current understanding of large-scale atmospheric
dynamics. The work is closely linked to projects in general circulation modeling
at NCAR and NOAA/GFDL and to operational and experimental numerical weather
prediction at NOAA/NMC and ECMWF. Fluctuations with periods on the order of
weeks and longer are generated both by dynamical processes internal to the
atmosphere and by interactions between the atmosphere and the underlying media
(primarily the oceans and the land-surface hydrology). The relevant dynamics
include a variety of processes that operate on low-frequencies, as well as the
forcing by high frequency transients associated with baroclinic instability. By
careful analysis of the spatial patterns and time sequences of time-filtered
meteorological fields, the PIs hope to isolate the signatures associated with
the various processes and document how they contribute to the total variability.
This research is important because it contributes in a direct way toward our
ability to predict atmospheric variability on time-scales relevant to human
activities.
