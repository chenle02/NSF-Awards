The objective of this research is to investigate the integration of novel two-
dimensional materials in silicon-based, planar photonic circuits to achieve
broadband optoelectronic devices operating in the near- to mid-infrared spectral
range. The two-dimensional materials to be studied include graphene and
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides of various types. The approach is to
develop fabrication processes and conduct characterization and measurement of
two-dimensional materials integrated optoelectronic devices. The specific
research goals include development of broadband and highly efficient
photodetectors and modulators for the near- and mid-infrared, investigation and
utilization of nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional materials, and
demonstration of waveguide integrated and coupled two-dimensional light
emitters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The optoelectronic
properties of two-dimensional materials have not been widely utilized for
integrated optoelectronic devices. The proposed research will demonstrate
practical optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional materials with
unprecedented performances. The integrated approach will also provide effective
near-field means to investigate the optoelectronic properties of the two-
dimensional materials. The research results will be the first steps to
incorporating two-dimensional materials in large scale integrated, silicon-based
photonic circuits and systems for optical communication and
computation.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will impact the
industry and the scientific community by providing new materials for
optoelectronic devices. The education and outreach activities will encourage
high-schools students to pursue a career in science and engineering, disseminate
the knowledge learned in the project through undergraduate participation in
research and curriculum development, and recruit minority students to
participate in research.
