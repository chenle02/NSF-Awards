The Deep Submergence Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
develop a prototype sampling device for an opportunistic test in early CY 1993.
In February and March 1993, the Jason Project will sponsor a major expedition to
the Guaymas Basin in the Pacific. An advanced ROV system will be used to take
high quality video images from the seafloor and relay them to the surface
support ship, thence via satellite to select sites across the U.S. where
scientists and students will be able to operate certain functions of the ROV
while it's on the bottom. Two NSF-funded investigators will participate. The
high quality video capabilities will augment the collection of data for their
NSF research, but the collection of discrete biological samples in addition to
the video will greatly enhance it. A conceptual design for a new deep-sea
suction sampler for use on the Jason ROV has been completed and preliminary
tests have been made. This SGER funding will allow the construction and testing
of a full prototype sampler in time for use during the Jason Project expedition.
If scientifically successful during the Jason expedition, the sampler will be
useful on upcoming NSF-sponsored cruises.
