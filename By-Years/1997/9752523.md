Much of statistical reasoning involves combining ideas of data and chance to
carry out inferential procedures and interpret results. Underlying this
reasoning is a conceptual understanding of some important ideas, such as
probability, variability, samples, sampling distributions, and the normal
distribution. Although statistics courses teach this content, students are often
unable to fully integrate and apply these ideas when reasoning about real
statistical problems or when interpreting the results of research
investigations. This project will develop and disseminate materials that help
students learn the core concepts underlying statistical inference. Specifically,
we will create instructional modules that use simulation software to help
students develop abstract concepts such as sampling distribution, confidence
interval, p-values, and power. Based on our previous research, we will build the
modules on a model of conceptual change, where students first make predictions
and then test them, using the simulation software. These modules will also
include assessment instruments to assess prerequisite conceptual knowledge and
instruments to assess understanding of the statistical concepts underlying
statistical inference. All materials (including our simulation software
programs) will be made available to statistics educators on the World Wide Web.
