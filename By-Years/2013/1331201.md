This project will study knock-off electronics focusing on the case of mobile
telephones. Using ethnographic methods the PI will study Chinese entrepreneurs
and artists who specialize in the practice of copying and improving upon
cellphone technology and design. He will situate this study in terms of the
Chinese concept of learned mastery which embraces practices of imitation as
route to creativity.

The research will result in a dissertation and scholarly articles. A fuller
understanding of the practice should be of interest to US corporations and
policy makers, as well as scholars in a number of fields
