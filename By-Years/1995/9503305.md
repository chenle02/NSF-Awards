9503305 Schmitt The aim of the work is to understand the dynamics and
regulation of structured, open populations, which typify most marine reef fishes
and invertebrates. While there is broad agreement among ecologists that
attributes of populations are shared by more than an single process (e.g.,
availability of propagules, competition within and between life stages,
competition with other species, predation), there remains considerable
disagreement regarding their relative importance. There also is some confusion
about what roles various processes have in producing dynamics; few empirical
workers have distinguished between processes that regulate populations (i.e.,
bound fluctuations) as opposed to those that cause variation around the mean
abundance. An enormous amount is known about the caused of fluctuations in
abundance of reef organisms, but very little is known about what regulates their
populations. This work will contribute in several key ways to understanding the
general issue of dynamics and regulation. It is one of the first comprehensive,
pluralistic evaluations of reef fishes that will distinguish effects of
processes on regulation and on variation. Second, it will use for the first time
operational definitions and analytical protocols for quantitative assessments of
the relative importance of various processes. As such, the research could yield
standard approaches and procedures to address relative importance. Third, the
application of infrared video technology enables the exploration of little
studied but crucial processes of settlement and early mortality.
