9309270 Runger The objective of this work is a comprehensive, optimal solution
to the design of an adaptive statistical process control (SPC) algorithm. The
work will develop adaptive algorithms for SPC that optimize the fundamental
design parameters of an SPC algorithm. The system is adaptive in the sense that
it has the capability to dynamically vary elements, such as sampling intervals
and sample sizes, based on the deviations of the measured variable from its
target value. One phase of the research will use a semi economic model to relate
total system cost to system design parameters. This research will optimize
adaptive SPC systems. Process control in manufacturing operations will be
improved by these techniques. The result is the ability to identify a process
which is off target much faster, without additional false alarms, and without
additional samples. This translates to a more powerful process control system,
which results in lower manufacturing costs and better quality. A software system
which will provide guidance in designing an adaptive SPC system will provide a
means of quickly transferring a significant, new technology to industry.
