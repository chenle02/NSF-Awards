This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award is to
conceptualize and research a generalized machine learning framework and the
associated software tools needed to categorize manufacturing data acquired from
a full-scale, operating commercial microelectronics fabrication facility and
derive reliable control actions from that data using machine learning methods.
Research on manufacturing-relevant machine learning methods has been frustrated
by a lack of access to the large amount of industry-validated data needed to
enable it. The project will explore the potential of new machine learning
methods to reveal the implicit knowledge incorporated in that data to improve
yield and productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the three
most critical impediments to the application of machine learning (ML) in
manufacturing systems: (1) a lack of access to the massive amounts of data
needed to research and develop machine learning architectures that are suited to
manufacturing-derived data, (2) a lack of manufacturing-specific ML methods for
aggregating and classifying that data to produce datasets tailored to training
ML systems for specific processes, machines or operations and a lack of ML
architectures that have been designed for and can make inferences using that
data, and (3) a reluctance of manufacturing engineers to trust “black box”
methods. The project is a collaboration with Seagate Technology to address all
three impediments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
