This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate
a low-voltage waveguide modulator device, capable of operation at speeds up to
40 Gb/s. Ultimately, this device will be capable of operating at speeds up to
100 Gb/s, with drive voltages as low as 4 volts. The enabling technology for
these devices is a process for deposition and patterning of single crystal
LiNbO3 thin films. The full potential of LiNbO3 electro-optical devices has not
been realized, due to the limitations of producing them by diffusion processes
in bulk crystals. This new approach to developing this technology will open the
way for a new class of electro-optical devices. This work will transition the
epitaxial LiNbO3 film technology to commercial viability. A commercial supplier
of electro-optical components will collaborate to provide technical guidance
during this effort. Fiber optic networks are being implemented in industry,
defense and domestic and international telecommunications. The proposed
technology will enable new products that will add increased speed, capacity and
flexibility to growing optical communications networks. It is anticipated that
products developed from this effort will achieve a significant market share by
the year 2005. This technology will be applied to devices for all-optical
computing systems, which also require single crystal films of non-linear
materials such as LiNbO
