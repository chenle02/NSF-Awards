The most familiar products of modern astronomy research are the breathtaking
images produced by several spectacular, ambitious, and often general-purpose
space-based satellite missions that have reshaped our view of the Universe.
Equally important to actually understanding the workings of specific objects is
the laborious, detailed study using ever-improved instrumentation on ground-
based optical telescopes. Spectroscopic studies, comparing light output from
astrophysical sources at different wavelengths, and recognizing the
characteristic patterns emitted by specific atoms and molecules that emit in the
same way as those components do here on Earth, is particularly powerful. The
investigators on this project aim to build a sensitive instrument dedicated to
observations of one particular spectral transition that is key to a number of
interesting puzzles facing modern astrophysical research, including the behavior
of the material that is seen to form a halo around distant galaxies.

The spectral line targeted by the instrument being built is the H-alpha line,
and the instrument takes its name from that line and the principal science
interest, galactic halos: CHaS, the Circumgalactic H-alpha Spectrograph.
Kinematics of gas in the circumgalactic medium of galaxies in the nearby
universe will measure the distribution of infalling and outflowing gas within
the central 50-100 kpc of a galaxy's halo, and will establish a new technique
for testing the modes of accretion and outflow in galaxies across cosmic time.

This project will contribute solidly to the training of the next generation of
instrumentation scientists. A novel approach to outreach will also be explored:
making simplified versions of the Integral Field Unit available to amateur
astronomers, exploiting and building upon a long-standing synergy between
amateur and professional astronomers.

Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical
Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.
