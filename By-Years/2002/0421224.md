With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
Department of Chemistry at the University of Delaware will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
Spectrometer. The research that this instrument will support includes high-
throughput approaches to the asymmetric syntheses of strained molecules;
electroactive polymers and oligomers for light-emitting diodes; protein-polymer
architectures for applications in materials and biology; molecular
complementation of nuclear receptor associated genetic disease; catalysis of the
alkyne to cyclopentene conversion; coordination and bioinorganic chemistry with
sulfur ligands; and homogeneous chromium catalysts for olefin polymerization.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of
the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the
structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-
art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier
research. Faculty and students from three regional institutions (Lincoln
University, Delaware State University, and Delaware Technical and Community
College) will carry out research using this instrument. The results from these
NMR studies will have an impact in materials chemistry and biochemistry.
