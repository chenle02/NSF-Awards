This award supports participation in the conference "Recent developments in
noncommutative algebra and related areas", which will be held March 17-19, 2018
at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the
conference is to survey recent developments and to chart new paths for further
progress on several topics of active current interest in noncommutative algebra,
with broad connections to other subjects such as combinatorics, algebraic
geometry and mathematical physics.

The conference will bring together researchers who work in noncommutative
algebra and related areas, namely, algebraic geometry, representation theory and
topology. The focus of the conference will be new research directions of several
important topics such as noncommutative algebraic geometry, Hopf algebras and
quantum groups, noncommutative invariant theory, higher category theory, and
algebraic aspects of mathematical physics. Special effort will be made to bring
together a group of junior researchers, women and underrepresented minorities,
who are currently working in different directions, and to engage them in
interdisciplinary activity through collaboration. More information can be found
