This is an award of $25,000 to support the New Mexico Analysis Seminar (NMAS),
an annual conference in mathematical analysis, for the next three installments
in this conference series. The organizers plan to make this conference a forum
for the presentation of the most recent significant results in this area of
mathematics. The NMAS will provide a very exciting intellectual atmosphere for
students and faculty. The funds requested support travel and subsistence for
invited speakers and participants, especially student participants, without
other means of support. The funds will be used to support mainly graduate
students, recent graduates, women, minorities and persons with disabilities
attending the conferences.
