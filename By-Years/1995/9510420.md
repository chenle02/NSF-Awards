9510420 Lenhoff This proposal is on research to continue to develop a
quantitative thermodynamic basis for the analysis and design of protein
separations, comparable to that which is routinely applied to conventional
separations in the chemical process industries. This will involve research on:
(1) molecular theories to predict key thermodynamic properties of proteins in
solution, based on protein structure, when it is known, and on key experimental
biophysical characteristics, when the structure is not known, and (2) use of the
descriptions of phase behavior and physical properties to develop rational,
thermodynamically- based approaches to predict separation performance for
important processes, including precipitation and two-phase aqueous extraction.
