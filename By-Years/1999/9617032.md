Hughes, Philip AST 96-17032 Dr. Hughes will study the dynamics of relativistic
astrophysical flows and compute the radiative properties of such flows for
comparison with single-dish and Very Long Baseline Interferometry data. The work
will center around existing code which will be improved and extended. The goals
of the study are to explore the propagation of shocks in curved flows, to
address whether shocks arise from feedback between flow and cocoon or from near
the central engine, to determine whether shocks have structure thin enough to
explain observed variability, to establish realistic parameterizations of the
velocity and density field of flows, and to infer flow patterns of observed jets
to discriminate between central engine models.
