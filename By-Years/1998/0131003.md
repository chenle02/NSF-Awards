With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
(CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
of Colorado in Boulder will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the mechanism, design,
synthesis and evaluation of anti-cancer drugs involving DNA cross-linking
(Koch); b) new "naked" and extremely reactive cations of a variety of elements,
and studies of fluorinated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (Michl); c) organic synthesis,
including glycopeptides and glycoproteins, and derivatized structural analogs
(Halcomb); d) organic synthesis involving a new class of catalysts for
accomplishing hydroxyl-directed reactions (Sammakia); e) the design and
characterization of nanostructured solid-state organic materials (Gin); and f)
fundamental structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic investigations of
metalloenzymes (Hagadorn). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and
to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to
state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out
frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a
number of areas including biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and catalysis.
