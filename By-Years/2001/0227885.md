Using background atmospheric states based upon the latest observations from
space-bourne and ground-based platforms, re-analyses, and empirical models,
global climatologies of monthly planetary wave activity in the mesosphere and
lower thermosphere (MLT) will be produced using a linear planetary wave model.
Predictions will be made for realistic lower atmospheric and in-situ forcing
conditions. Electronic datasets, consisting of the model outputs, the blended
mean states, and diagnostic parameters will be made available to the Aeronomy
community. Model predictions will be constrained by observations of planetary
waves in the MLT region. Classical wave propagation theory will be tested and
exceptions noted and extensions provided.
