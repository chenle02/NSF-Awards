It is a well-known fact that light, stable nuclei, those with which we are most
familiar, are made up of roughly equal numbers of protons and neutrons. This
project will explore the structure of neutron-rich nuclei that are far from
stability and consequently much less familiar. This will provide a vital
understanding of the subtleties of the nuclear force in nuclei that can be found
in explosive astrophysical environments, such as a supernova. These experiments
will help us to understand the different abundances of the observed elements in
the universe, in addition to engaging students in the study of these fundamental
questions. In addition, the applied nuclear physics efforts at Hope College will
use traditional accelerator techniques for the rapid testing of consumer goods
and environmental samples containing chemicals of concern. Work on non-
destructive characterization of automotive paint samples for forensic
applications will continue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments producing unstable
nuclei at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab (NSCL) (excited states of
helium-9 and oxygen-26) will measure decay neutrons with the Modular Neutron
Array, while emitted charged fragments are deflected with a high-field dipole
magnet into timing and energy detectors. The properties of the decaying nucleus
will be determined with invariant mass spectroscopy. Astrophysics measurements
will also be done at the NSCL with the Summing NaI Detector supplemented with an
internal beta detector or an internal gas cell constructed at Hope College. The
interdisciplinary applied physics portion of the proposed research, done with
the Hope accelerator, is principally based on particle induced gamma-ray
emission, particle induced x-ray emission, and Rutherford backscattering
spectroscopy.
