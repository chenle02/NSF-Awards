Gallium oxide is an emerging ultrawidebandgap (UWBG) semiconductor that has
attracted a lot of interest in recent years for next generation power and
wireless applications. The gallium oxide device performance has been phenomenal
in terms of breakdown voltages and device figures of merit. This performance
enhancement has been underpinned by the availability of large area bulk
substrates. Despite this progress there are still significant challenges both at
the fundamental materials understanding and the device technology transition to
real world applications. To foster fruitful discussions, collaborations and
student training, the 6th US Gallium Oxide Workshop is organized in August
13-16, 2023, at the University at Buffalo (SUNY) campus in Buffalo, NY.

This premier US domestic conference will provide researchers and students with a
broad platform to present their results. By supporting student participation,
this project will contribute towards workforce development. The project will
also increase the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) students. In
addition to presenting their work, the students will get an opportunity to
listen to three keynote speakers and twelve invited speakers presented by
academic and industry leaders. The conference will cover a wide range of topics
in gallium oxide and related materials (theory, synthesis, characterization,
devices, circuits, and systems), thus casting a wide net to capture more diverse
students and attendees. All these topics have strong positive social impact both
in terms of economic and energy security. The activities will increase the
knowledge base in semiconductor manufacturing which is a significant contributor
to the US economy.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
