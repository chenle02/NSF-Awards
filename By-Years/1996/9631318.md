Many important sampling problems occur within a spatial context. Examples range
from estimating the total concentration of DDT at a dumpsite to counting the
number of polar bears in a region of Alaska to determining the number of
distinct species in an ecosystem. This project involves the problem of designing
sampling schemes for spatial data where information about the degree of
clustering of the elements being sampled is utilized. Initial research will
consider univariate point processes with extensions to the multivariate case.
The basic premise is that some extant sampling schemes can be modified to take
advantage of available knowledge such as that assumed about the population units
themselves or additional information obtained during sampling. The intended
research is divided into several areas. The first is based on a univariate
model. Two approaches will be considered. One is a "non-parametric" sequential
sampling effort where no assumptions are made about the population under study.
Here, information collected during sampling will be used to provide an initial
characterization of the spatial aspects of the population. The other approach is
parametric in that it will be assumed that the population is generated via a
general Poisson cluster process (or the more specific Neyman-Scott process).
Sampling will then be used to estimate the parameters as a means of estimating
the population size. The latter is useful when it is of interest to describe a
more general situation than exhibited by the current population (a single
realization from the cluster process). Later, the results will be extended to
the multivariate case. Multivariate data models of interest include a spatial
marked point process such as would arise from a superposition of spatial Poisson
processes.
