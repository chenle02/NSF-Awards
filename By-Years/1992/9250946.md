The aim of this project is to enhance the undergraduate science experience in
the life sciences at Fordham through the acquisition of a new transmission
electron microscope (TEM). A new TEM will provide students in courses
(Microbiology, Bacteriology, Histology, Microanatomy, Cell &amp; Developmental
Biology and Cell/Molecular Biology) with hands-on use of an instrument that
provides fundamental information about cell structure and function. More than
50% of the target audience consists of women and a high proportion belong to
underrepresented minority groups. The new TEM will also provide expanded
opportunities for these students to become directly involved in cell biology
research. In addition to serving undergraduates, a component of the project
involves organizing electron microscopy workshops for two- and four-year college
faculty and AP high school teachers.
