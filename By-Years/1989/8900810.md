This award to the Cornell Theory Center (one of the five (NSF/DASC
supercomputer centers) will fund a month long intensive training and research
experience for undergraduates (REU). The focus of the training and learning will
be on supercomputing technologies, personal scientific research, methodologies,
and applications. Approximately twenty students will be involved in the
process.. In line with the Foundation's outreach goals the supercomputer center
will aggressively recruit undergraduates from historically black and women
colleges and will target those institutions which are lacking in a strong
research orientation. This is the second year the Center has sponsored this type
of REU activity. The sessions held last year were well received and very
productive. The Centers Program recommends support for this award.
