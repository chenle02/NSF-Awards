This award will provide support for a eight graduate students and young
postdoctoral scientists to attend the XIIth International Conference on Beauty,
Charm and Hyperons in Hadronic Interactions in George Mason University, Fairfax,
Virginia, June 12-18, 2016. This conference is held bi-annually and is one of
the largest of major interest to the particle flavor physics community, with an
expected attendance of at least 100 persons. Topics covered will be mostly in
flavour physic,s including results from neutrino and LHC experiments. Attendance
by graduate students to participate, either as members of the audience or as
speakers, is the particular role for NSF funds. Priority for this support will
be given to students from under-privileged communities.
