In this award, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the
Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Skinner of Wright State University and
his graduate student researchers will be supported to investigate the
development of new pulse sequences for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using optimal control
methods. Prof. Skinner and his students will develop robust methods that will
work in experiments where other methods fail. In addition, in this grant period,
Prof. Skinner's group will begin to work on developing pulse sequences for use
in X-band EPR spectroscopy. NMR and EPR spectroscopy are workhorse techniques
used by chemists, chemical engineers, materials scientists, medical researchers,
and other scientists in many more fields where determine molecular structures is
critical for advancing understanding. Typically radio-frequency pulses are used
to interrogate the sample in these techniques. Prof. Skinner's group is
investigating the creation of new kinds of robust pulse sequences that are less
susceptible to the effects of distortion or magnetic field inhomogeneity. The
results of this work will yield new tools that will increase the speed with
which these experiments can be done, without introducing artifacts. The broad
dissemination of this work is increased through the continued collaboration with
an industry leader in NMR and EPR instrumentation, making the results of this
research widely available to a large community of users. In addition, Prof.
Skinner's students are trained in cutting edge methods in a scientific area that
shows continued growth, guaranteeing that they will have valuable skills for the
scientific/technical workforce.
