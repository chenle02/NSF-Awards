The project implements an Industry/University/Government Cooperative Research
Program between the United States and the United Kingdom. The program will
couple the New Jersey Institute of Technology in the US with the Queens
University of Belfast in the UK. The ultimate objective of this joint effort is
to couple the Environmental Science and Technology Research Center at Queens
University, (established in 1989) with the I/UCRC for Hazardous Waste Management
at NJIT. The joint research program is to study the potential of lignite and
lignite derived activated carbons as solid absorbents to provide a support-
matrix for treatment of waste water streams using microbiological process to
degrade organic toxic constituents. Additional support is provided for an
evaluation activity in studying the industry/university interaction occurring in
both Centers as well as the interaction between the Centers. The British Science
and Engineering Research Council has reviewed and funded the Irish (UK)
component of this collaborative effort at approximately $240,000 over a three
year period. The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute of
Technology be awarded $80,000 for first year of a three-year continuing award.
This project is being coordinated with the National Science Foundation's
Division of International Programs. Also, $8,000 is awarded for the first year
of three-year continuing award for an evaluator function.
