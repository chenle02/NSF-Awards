This is a project to establish a Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM)
environment for undergraduate level CIM lecture and laboratory course. This is a
new course which will be offered for the first time in Fall 1993.The project is
consistent with the objectives of the Department and the School of Engineering
to develop CIM education. The main goals include: (a) providing a fundamental
course and well- constructed lab experiments for undergraduate students so they
can function better in a modern, industrial environment, (b) utilizing a state-
of-the-art computer control system to integrate the many facets of a
manufacturing facility, (c) furnishing an up-to-date medium for attracting and
motivating minority and women students into engineering programs. The results of
this project will be reported in professional and educational journals and
conferences.At present, students learn the components (design, manufacturing,
and business functions) of computer integrated manufacturing. They have no
opportunity to integrate the knowledge taught separately in the respective
subjects. The CIM laboratory is intended to challenge the students to experiment
on integration and explore different levels of hierarchical control. The
equipment which will be a part of the laboratory includes 486 Personal Computers
which will be networked and integrated with the Engineering Computing Center, a
Puma 560 Robot, Denford NC Machine, ASRS, and a closed loop conveyor. A separate
room has been allocated for the CIM Laboratory.
