This award provides 64% of the funds needed to acquire equipment for a fluid
dynamics laboratory system that will be installed, operated and maintained in
the Department of Geology at the Graduate School of Oceanography of Rhode Island
University. The institution is committed to providing the remaining funds
required for this equipment purchase. The development of plate tectonics,
coupled with advances in understanding of seafloor geological processes and the
geochemistry and geophysics of the underlying mantle, has led to the view that
the solid earth is a system in active circulation. The equipment to be installed
in the fluid dynamics lab will be used, in conjunction with theory, to test
various models of crust and mantle dynamic flow.
