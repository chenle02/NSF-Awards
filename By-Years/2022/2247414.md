This award provides support for two iterations of the Redbud Geometry/Topology
Conference, the first of which will be held March 31st - April 2nd, 2023 at the
University of Oklahoma. The conference will focus on the interplay between
mapping class groups and discrete subgroups of Lie groups. This event is part of
an ongoing series of conferences held alternately at universities in Arkansas
and Oklahoma, intended to increase interaction and collaboration among young and
senior mathematicians in the area. It will feature prominent speakers, from
across North America and the United Kingdom, presenting their latest research,
as well as a graduate student workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2023 Redbud
Geometry/Topology Conference will focus on mapping class groups of surfaces,
outer automorphism groups of free groups, discrete subgroups of lattices and
their interactions. In particular, talks will discuss how these groups relate in
terms of their homology and rigidity properties. The invited speakers are Tara
Brendle (University of Glasgow), Alan Reid (Rice University), Rita Jiménez
Rolland (Instituto de Matemáticas, UNAM, representación Oaxaca), Nathan Broaddus
(The Ohio State University), Lei Chen (University of Maryland, College Park),
Rylee Lyman (Rutgers University, Newark), Daniel Studenmund (Binghamton
University), and Richard Wade (University of Oxford). The conference begins with
a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate students and junior
researchers by providing relevant background information and introductions to
the topics of the conference. Specifically, the workshop will feature expository
talks by Tara Brendle, Alan Reid, and Rita Jiménez Rolland. More information is

reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
