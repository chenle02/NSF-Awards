The Symposium on Subtypes of Muscarinic Receptors is the sixth in a series of
very successful and well-documented conferences held over the past decade which
have helped to integrate advance in basic research with the results of studies
on the role of these receptors in dysfunctions. The conference organizers and
participants are an international group of scientists who represent a breadth of
research areas from academia and industry and who have made and are making
important contributions to muscarinic receptor research. This Symposium also
provides the opportunity for young investigators to present their work and will
be the occasion for the first Otto Loewi New Investigator Awards and Lectures
sponsored and supported by the Symposium.
