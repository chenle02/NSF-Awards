This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
FY2002. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
locations.

The research and training plan is entitled "Investigating the Role of Cell-to-
Cell Communication by the Endophytic Bacterium Xylella fastidiosa in the
Colonization of Grapevines." Bacterial cells can communicate using signaling
molecules, allowing them to monitor population size and to coordinate behavior
as a group. Xylella fastidiosa colonizes the xylem vessels of plants, causing
blockage and water-stress symptoms in some hosts. The role of cell-cell
signaling and community behavior in successful colonization of the xylem is
being investigated.
