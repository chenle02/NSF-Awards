Although identified clusters of mechanosensory neurons in gastropod molluscs
have provided detailed information about cellular events correlated with
behavioral modifications, little is known about the functions or evolutionary
significance of these cellular mechanisms. In these studies, comparisons will
focus on short-and long-term changes in the excitability of the sensory neuron's
cell body within the central nervous system and changes in the sensory neuron's
peripheral receptive field. These comparisons should illuminate the functions of
mechanosensory plasticity in this group of animals, and may point to primitive
mechanisms involved in memory traces of peripheral injury.
