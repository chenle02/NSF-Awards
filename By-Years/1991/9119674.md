The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the roles played by plant
chemistry in the ecology and evolution of a single taxon of herbivorous insects,
namely the butterfly family Papilionidae. Emphasis during the next three years
will continue to be placed on the chemical basis of plant recognition by
oviposition males. The occurrence of contact and volatile oviposition stimulants
for the black swallowtail, Papilio polyxenes (tribe Papilionini), will be
surveyed in a variety of host and non-host plants to assess the specificity and
variability of chemical response profiles in one insect species. Identification
of oviposition stimulants from Asimina spp. for Eurytides marcellus (tribe
Graphiini) will be completed for comparison with known stimulants for Battus
philenor (tribe Troidini) and P. polyxenes (tribe Papilionini). Identification
of stimulants and deterrents will also be carried out with P. machaon, which
shows evidence of a host switch from the Apiacea to the Asteraceae (genus
Artemisia) These comparative studies will permit testing of a long-held
hypothesis that the evolutionary radiation of swallowtail butterflies has been
constrained by the botanical distribution of particular chemical compounds that
are used as behavioral cues in host recognition.
