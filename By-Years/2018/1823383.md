As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments,
the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative research,
approaches and resources for use in a variety of settings. A frequently
overlooked but significantly under-represented STEM audience is people who live
in rural settings. The proposed conference is the first of its kind to bring
together key innovators and experts in rural Informal STEM education, to address
this question: How can we build on recent innovations to create more effective
and scalable pathways for informal STEM learning in rural
communities?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus primarily on
advancing informal STEM education for rural youth, but will also include some
participants who cross boundaries, to situate the work in an ecosystem
perspective: informal-formal education, childhood-adult education, rural
ecosystems and economic drivers for STEM related jobs. The provisional list of
topics will be refined through a pre-conference survey of participants, and will
be followed with a report that includes survey responses, conference discussion,
and final recommendations by participants. The conference will be held in
Washington D.C. to enable policymakers to attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
