This award will support student participation to the Southeast Regional
Programming Languages Seminar (SERPL) 2019, to be held at Augusta University in
Spring 2019. The meeting is an informal regional workshop with the goal of
cultivating a regional research network in programming languages and allied
topics. The funds help support students at US universities primarily located in
the southeast, and focus on students presenting at the meeting, students from
underrepresented groups, and students who would otherwise not be able to attend
due to financial limitations. Supporting student travel to attend professional
conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader
impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important
research area and to facilitate their career development in graduate school and
subsequently in research, industry, and other sectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support
through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts
review criteria.
