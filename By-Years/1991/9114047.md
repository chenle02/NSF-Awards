This project consists of two research parts: (1) verification and utilization
as a proposed controller of a new system identification (SI) technique, and (2)
study of two active control schemes, i.e., the modified Luenberger pole
placement and neural control algorithms, for the active control of structures
against earthquakes. The main objective is to investigate the feasibility and
application of these two control schemes in protection of civil engineering
structures under seismic conditions. A 10-story apartment building in San Jose,
California whose 13 seismic instruments have recorded many earthquake response
data will be analyzed to validate a system identification technique which is
capable of identifying the structural dynamic model from the measured response
records and without knowing the seismic input. This SI technique will be
incorporated into the formulation of two control schemes, whose feasibility and
effectiveness will then be studied. This project contains an important component
of Research Opportunity Awards (ROA) and provides collaborative support for a
faculty researcher from a historically minority institution.
