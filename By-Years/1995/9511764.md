9511764 Laurent Although brains and computers are thought to be quite similar,
the mechanisms which they use to encode and store information are fundamentally
different. This is partly because computers were developed by engineers using
tools of formal logic to solve rather limited sets of problems, while brains
were developed over millions of years with selective pressure of evolution as
the only engineer. Indeed, brains evolved to increase the chances of survival of
their "owners", and thus primarily to facilitate the detection of prey,
predators and mates. Consequently, they succeeded in solving the very complex
problems of pattern recognition, problems which present computers are
notoriously poor at handling. How do we recognize something as complex as a face
or an odor, how do we store their infinite number of possible appearances, how
does our brain represent them with neuronal activity patterns? To understand
this, we must understand coding in the nervous system; we need to determine the
rules that underlie stimulus representation in the brain. Conventional views of
coding by the brain hold that information resides in the average number of
impulses produced per unit time (rate coding); the role of relative timing of
impulses produced by groups of neurons has not been carefully evaluated. The
work of this young scientist focuses on circuits that process smells.
Experiments are designed to determine whether the relative timing of neuronal
impulses (temporal coding) is a potential carrier for information.
