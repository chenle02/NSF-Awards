The proposed project involves the development of a stochastic individual-based
simulation model of parasitoid behavior within a tritrophic context. This model
will be used to investigate the role of learning in a) determining foraging
success, and b) facilitating changes in the size and composition of parasitoid
populations. In the process of addressing these larger questions, the model will
be used as an experimental tool for testing specific hypotheses drawn from
current theory in insect learning, and as a tool for organizing current data and
identifying key questions for future investigations of tritrophic interactions.
The model will be based on a review of the current literature and developed
using an iterative feedback process involving empirical studies with live
parasitoids. Informal collaborations will be encouraged during all phases of
model development; the resulting comprehensive and user-friendly model will be
available to all interested researchers.
