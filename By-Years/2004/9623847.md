w:\awards\awards96\*.doc 9623847 Nunes Scanning probe microscopy techniques
will be applied to the study of magnetic interactions in quantum transport at
milliKelvin temperatures. Force microscope tips with deposited magnetic
impurities will be used to place defects of a known type at known positions in a
mesoscopic sample. The effect of spin scattering from these artificially
introduced defects will be studied via conductance fluctuations and Aharonov-
Bohm oscillations in narrow wires and rings. These experiments will provide
insight into inelastic scattering processes in small devices, and offer
sensitive tests of universal conductance fluctuation theory. The ability to
probe and manipulate the defects in nanoscale wires and devices will ultimately
allow the investigation of disorder in quantum transport at the single defect
level. %%% This research program will apply techniques from the rapidly growing
field of scanning probe microscopy to the study and manipulation of defects in
nanoscale electronic devices. In the past, electrical measurements have only
been sensitive to the average properties of a device, rather than to the
individual defects out of which the average behavior is built up. The ability of
scanned probe microscopes to provide spatially resolved, local information will
allow us to look beneath the general properties to the underlying behavior on
the atomic scale. This information will provide new physical insights
unobtainable by any other means---insights which will be required for predicting
and understanding the nano-electronics of the future in which the atomic-scale
disorder will inevitably influence the behavior of nominally "identical"
devices. ***
