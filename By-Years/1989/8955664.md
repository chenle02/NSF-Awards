Central State University will initiate a commuter and residential,
multidisciplinary, Young Scholars project for 100 students in grades 11- 12.
This project is designed to increase the number of high school students who are
pursuing careers in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering. One hundred
sophomores and juniors from six school districts are expected to participate in
an after-school component during the academic year, focused on career
exploration, research methods, and science ethics. Twenty-five students from
this group are then be selected to participate in a 4-week residential summer
research experience on the main campus of the University.
