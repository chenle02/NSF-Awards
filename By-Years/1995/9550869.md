This project is purchasing a capillary gas chromatograph (GC) for investigative
chemistry laboratories at the college. This equipment aids the project director
in redirecting the organic and biochemistry laboratories toward real-life
research experiences. Students require capillary GC systems in such independent
research as the isolation of sulforaphane from broccoli cultures. New projects
include a multidisciplinary project on characterization of microbial communities
in soil by GC analysis of fatty acid profiles. Ready availability of capillary
GC instrumentation for student projects is essential to expand the project-
oriented laboratory approach the science curriculum and to incorporate practical
GC theory into the research-oriented projects.
