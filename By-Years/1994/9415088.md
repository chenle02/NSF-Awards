Originally constructed thirty years ago for teaching, approximately one-half of
the Physics building now is used for research and research training. The
building is structurally sound and has been well maintained, but it requires
renovation and modernization to outfit it for the needs of researchers.
Seventeen faculty and approximately seventy-five graduate and undergraduate
students working in the specialty areas of Molecular Physics, Condensed Matter
Physics, and Cloud and Aerosol Science research will be beneficiaries of the
Facilities award. NSF support will address five areas of specific need:
reconfiguration of space to provide larger laboratories; upgrade of electrical
systems; addition or replacement (as appropriate) of central HVAC service to all
labs; addition of central utility systems for exhaust and equipment cooling; and
substantial improvement to safety systems. As Missouri's officially designated
technological university, over 90% of its 5,200 students major in engineering or
science. The Physics renovation project will be important to continued efforts
to both increase student enrollment, including attracting women and minorities
to the program, and enhance the quality of research and research training
activity.
