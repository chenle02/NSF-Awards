This project concerns control and inverse problems for differential equations on
graphs. Network-like structures play a fundamental role in many problems of
science and engineering. The classical problem here comes from oscillations of
flexible structures made of strings, beams, cables, and struts. The models
describe bridges, space-structures, antennas, transmission-line posts, steel-
grid reinforcements and other typical objects of civil engineering. More
recently, applications on a much smaller scale have come into focus. In
particular, hierarchical materials like ceramic or metallic foams, percolation
networks and carbon and grapheme nano-tubes have attracted much attention.
Quantum graphs arise as natural models of various phenomena in chemistry (free-
electron theory of conjugated molecules), biology (genetic networks, dendritic
trees), geophysics, environmental science, decease control, and are even
relevant in connection with the Internet (Internet or network tomography).
Control and inverse theories for quantum graphs constitute an important part of
the rapidly developing area of applied mathematics --- analysis on graphs. They
are tremendously important for all aforementioned applications. The main goal of
the proposed research is to develop new methods and approaches to these
theories.

Recently a new effective leaf-peeling method has been developed by the PI and
his collaborators for solving inverse problems for differential equations on
trees (graphs without cycles). The project will extend this method to general
graphs which include trees and graphs with cycles. We will focus on inverse
problems for differential equations that are important for applications in
science and engineering. Along with unknown coefficients of the equations on the
edges, the topology of the graph and geometrical parameters (the lengths of the
edges and, in relevant cases, the angles between neighboring edges) will be
recovered. Exact controllability of the corresponding dynamical systems on
graphs with cycles will also be established. The leaf-peeling method is based on
the Boundary Control method for inverse problems of mathematical physics. The
characteristic feature of these methods is their locality: recovering the
topology and other parameters of a subgraph requires only the data related to
that subgraph. This property gives the leaf-peeling method an advantage over
other methods and allows to extend our approach to graphs with cycles.
