David M. Hanson of the State University of New York-Stony Brook is supported by
the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to selectively excite, using x-ray
radiation from the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), core electrons in
gas phase molecules, and then study the core-hole decay. He will determine how
this selectivity is preserved during decay, identify the excited states
involved, and look at the molecular structure dependence of the decay processes.
In addition, the mechanisms and dynamics of fragmentation after core electron
excitation will be investigated, as will the final state energy distribution and
its relationship to the potential energy surface. The processes to be studied
play a key role in the chemistry occurring in space, in planetary atmospheres,
and in atomic reactors. For example, x-ray absorption spectra are used in
astronomy to provide information about the universe. Core-electron excitation
and ionization and core-hole decay processes are used to study heterogeneous
catalysis, and occur with the techniques of electron- and x-ray microscopy and
lithography. Insight provided by this knowledge may eventually produce novel
materials.
