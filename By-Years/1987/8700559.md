John Guckenheimer will carry out research in a number of different areas. These
include one dimensional mappings, quadratic vector fields in the plane and
multiple bifurcations. He has already established himself as an international
leader in all of these areas. The current proposal is a continuation of this
very successful program. Over the last decade there has been a rapid growth in
the mathematical theory of iterations of one dimensional mappings. This theory
has been successfully applied in such diverse areas as the theory of chemical
reactors, the dynamics of semiconductor devices and the transition to chaotic
behaviour in fluid dynamics. Guckenheimer has a good record of interaction with
scientists in other fields. His research into multiple bifurcations will be
aimed at classifying types of degenerate bifurcations which occur near quadratic
Hamiltonian systems. This will be used to find solutions to a restricted form of
Hilbert's 16th problem.
