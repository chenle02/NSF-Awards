Abstract Nowak

The proposed project focuses on a number of problems related to isoperimetric
inequalities on discrete groups and metric spaces. Sobolev and Poincare
inequalities are classical examples of such inequalities, properties like non-
exactness or Kazhdan's property (T) can also be viewed as generalized
isoperimetric conditions. The main objective of the project is to broaden the
understanding of isoperimetric inequalities with coefficients in a C*-algebra on
which the group acts by automorphisms and of their geometric implications. In
particular, the problem of finding explicit, natural examples of groups carrying
such inequalities will be addressed. This will lead to a better understanding of
the geometry which lies behind recent progress towards the Novikov and the Baum-
Connes conjectures in which exactness and a-T-menability played major roles.

The isoperimetric problem is one of the most fundamental problems in mathematics
dating back to antiquity. In its simplest form it amounts to finding the largest
area on the plane enclosed by a closed curve of fixed length. This classical
case has been studied extensively and has numerous applications in analysis and
geometry. It is therefore natural to ask for generalizations in which "area" and
"perimeter" are replaced by more flexible notions, allowing to implement ideas
from the classical case to a more demanding setting. These problems lie at the
intersection of several major branches of mathematics and one of the main goals
of this project is to foster interactions between the underlying algebraic,
analytic and geometric structures.
