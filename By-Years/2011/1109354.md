Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution (SAMs) use relatively
simple, but physically motivated parameterized prescriptions for the effects of
complex processes such as merging, gas accretion, star formation, and feedback
to follow a simulated population of galaxies through cosmic time. Though
inexact, SAMs are necessary since direct simulation of these processes is still
beyond the reach of computational hardware and techniques. The disadvantage of
SAMs is that the degeneracies among the adjustable parameters can be large and
poorly understood. In response, the proposing team has developed a Bayesian
inference based SAM. The Bayesian approach yields the posterior probability
distribution of the SAM parameters for a given set of data, and an assessment of
how well a particular model is supported by the data. In this project, the team
will apply their analysis to archival data on high-redshift galaxies, and
address the following issues: (1) how galaxies assemble their masses, how star
formation proceeds in different galaxies, and whether a universal stellar
initial mass function is consistent with the data; (2) how feedback affects the
gas component in galaxies, and why most of the baryons today are not in
galaxies; (3) the growth of supermassive black holes, and how feedback from
active galactic nuclei (AGN) affects galaxy formation and evolution; (4) the
properties of ionizing sources at high redshift and how the Universe was re-
ionized; (5) whether the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm can accommodate all
observational properties of galaxies. These models will be used to create mock
galaxy catalogs tailored to the properties of specific galaxy surveys; the team
will make these mock catalogs available to the community. The project will
support the work and professional training of a graduate student, and is
intended to provide research opportunities for undergraduates.
