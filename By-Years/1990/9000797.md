This project will provide a summer's research experience for eight undergraduate
geology majors. Of the participants, two to four of the students and one to
three of the faculty involved, will be from schools other than Furman. These
outside participants will be drawn from the geology programs of schools that
belong to two consortia of which Furman is a member. These schools include
Millsaps College, Centenary College, The University of the South, The College of
Wooster, Oberlin College, Denison University, and Ohio Wesleyan University.
Faculty involved will work with one or two students to direct them in a 10-week
research effort. As the summer progresses, the student will be encouraged to
become increasingly more independent. The goal of each effort will be to produce
valid verifiable results that will contribute to the body of knowledge in
geology and that can be presented to the scientific community in the form of a
presented paper or journal article. The overall goal of the program will be
educating the student to understand the process of research and instilling in
him an excitement about his field that will encourage him to continue on to
graduate school.
