This grant will enable the purchase of a laboratory digestor, which will be used
to determine the technical and economic feasibility of processes designed to
combine the advantages of organosoly delignification with acid hydrolysis for
the purpose of producing energy and chemical feedstocks from woody biomass or
agricultural residues. It is also intended to be used in the proposed research
work to determine the effect of recirculation of varying amounts of spent liquor
(with dissolved lignin and cellulosic material) on the soda-AQ and kraft
delignification of woody biomass. The effect of these methods on pulp properties
(such as bleachability, beatability, and strength development characteristics)
of the result pulps will also be determined.
