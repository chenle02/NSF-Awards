This proposal is concerned with the number of characters in a block of a finite
group. The principal investigator will complete the reduction of his conjecture
on this to the case of almost simple groups. He will also verify it for as many
such groups as possible and will search for a simpler direct proof of it. The
research supported concerns the representation theory of finite groups. A group
is an algebraic object used to study transformations. Because of this, groups
are a fundamental tool in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as
mathematics. Representation theory is an important method for determining the
structure of groups.
