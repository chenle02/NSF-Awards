ABSTRACT CTS-9528897 Chemistry and chemical reactions involving microparticles
levitated in an electrodynamic balance will be investigated. The research has
five components: (a) Measurements of the thermophoretic forces on nonspherical
particles over a wide range of Knudsen numbers ranging from continuum to free
molecular domain; (b) Raman spectroscopic studies of sorption reactions by
slurry droplets; (c) Chemical reactions of multicomponents droplets by
decomvolution of Raman spectra; (d) Development of technique an device to study
rapid chemical reactions and composition changes with pulsed lasers; (e)
Measurements of chemical reactions associated with atmospheric aerosols,
particularly in the stratospheric ozone destruction zone. An attempt will be
made to study an assembly of droplets/particles suspended in the electrodynamics
balance. The fundamental investigations planned in this project have relevance
to atmospheric aerosol studies associated with ozone depletion, and
nanoparticles generation for advanced materials. ***
