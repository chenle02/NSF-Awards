ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor E. Roland Menzel of Texas
Tech University is developing new forensic field methods for trace explosives
detection. The idea is to use photoluminescence methods analogous to current
methods for fingerprint detection. The goal of this project is to develop a
reliable, sensitive field method for the detection of trace amounts of
explosives. The work is to develop the particular chemical and physical methods
to efficiently transfer energy from a compact, battery-operated green laser to
functionalized nanoparticles to optimized lanthanide-complex sensitizers. One
graduate student will be involved in this work on photoluminescent explosives
detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported jointly by the NSF and
the Intelligence Community. The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the
Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic
research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national
security.&lt;br/&gt;
