With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
Professor Frieder Jaekle of the Chemistry Department at the Rutgers University-
Newark will develop synthetic routes that will provide highly selective and
controlled access to new classes of conjugated organoboron oligomers,
macrocycles, and polymers ? all from the same set of precursor molecules. The
modular approach that is being developed is expected to allow for facile
optimization of the desired materials properties, photophysical characteristics,
electronic behavior, and sensing ability. To evaluate and fine-tune the degree
of extended conjugation through p-pi overlap will be of critical importance. It
is anticipated that this project will generate new fundamental knowledge in the
field of main group chemistry and in the areas of conjugated organic and hybrid
materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research by Professor Jaekle at Rutgers
University- Newark will in the longer term contribute to the development of
novel and more efficient conjugated materials that can be used in applications
such as plastic electronics and sensors. The project will effectively contribute
to the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in a
highly interdisciplinary area that involves aspects of physical organic
chemistry, organometallic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science.
The experience gained through this research is of direct relevance to the
chemical industry in the US. Another important aspect is to build bridges
between undergraduate education and research. As part of this award, a new
experiment on luminescent sensor materials will be added to a senior laboratory
course. Professor Jaekle will also continue to involve ACS Project SEED high
school students in the research and continue the very successful outreach
programs with local high schools that were established as part of the prior
award.&lt;br/&gt;
