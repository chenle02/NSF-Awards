This project seeks to improve the education of undergraduate industrial
engineers in the effective management of productivity. Productivity management
encompasses the classical industrial engineering (IE) activities of work
measurement, motion study, methods improvement and work simplification, coupled
with the consideration of human factors. As with most technical fields,
improvement in the practice of these IE basics can result from technological
advances in the equipment used. No longer is it sufficient to arm an IE with
paper, pencil, and a stopwatch. This project offers the IE student an
opportunity to gain experience with an array of today's sophisticated tools,
including automated data collection and analysis systems, computer interfaces,
and videotape technology. These tools enhance the IE's own productivity. This
experience combined with the underlying theory of productivity management better
prepares the student to effectively manage productivity in the workplace. The
award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's
institution.
