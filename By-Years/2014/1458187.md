In order to remain vital, the American economy must compete globally, attract
investment, and create jobs. This project will address the shortage of qualified
STEM technicians and professionals in the nation's workforce by increasing the
number of well prepared graduates with an Associate of Science degree with a
focus on biology, chemistry, or mathematics or an Associate of Applied Science
in engineering from Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College (A-B Tech).
The project will amass multiple stakeholders including faculty members and
collaborators from public schools, 4-year institutions, and industry to serve a
minimum of 134 academically talented and financially needy students.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to bolster student
persistence and achievement through support services (co-advising, case
management, tutoring, mentoring, and internships) and academic enrichment
activities (seminars, service learning, college tours, and industry visits). A
secondary goal is to develop a viable and reproducible model for joint high
school, community college, and university pathway efforts to address an
increasing labor shortage of well prepared STEM technicians and professionals.
Formative evaluation will focus on student participation in student support
services and engagement in enrichment activities (surveys and focus groups).
Summative data collection will focus on student persistence and completion
information (mid-term and final grades, re-enrollment, and goal completion).
Dissemination of results will be achieved through presentations at the NC
Community College Student Development Personnel Association and NC Community
College System Office State-wide conferences and through the institution's AB-
Tech Education Journal.
