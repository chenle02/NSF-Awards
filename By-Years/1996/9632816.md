In this project Professor Kuppermann of the California Institute of Technology
is being supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the
Chemistry Division. The project involves the study of electronic non-adiabatic
effects in state-to-state chemical reaction dynamics. The primary reaction used
is the hydrogen exchange reaction between H + H2 and various isotopic variants.
Other reactions considered include the reaction of F + H2, as well as O + H2.
Various ways of treating and incorporating multiple electronic surfaces and non-
adiabatic effects will be investigated. Considerable use is being made of
massively parallel supercomputers. Special attention is being placed on the role
of the `geometric phase` in influencing the reaction probabilities for such
reactions. Elementary bimolecular chemical reactions are the basic steps of
complex technologically important chemical systems, such as combustion
processes, atmospheric chemistry, chemical lasers, and plasma reactors. These
systems may involve many steps whose reagents are very frequently short-lived
and in many instances cannot be isolated experimentally. Studying their cross
sections and rates theoretically constitutes in such cases the best, if not the
only, available approach. Such studies also elucidate their molecular level
details and lead to a fundamental understanding of how they occur. The
theoretical description of very simple gas-phase chemical reactions such as
those between a hydrogen atom and a hydrogen molecule, and oxygen atom and
hydrogen molecule are being advanced in this computational study which makes use
of massively parallel computers.
