The equipment purchased under this grant will be used in an interdisciplinary
research program in automated and computer assisted image data interpretation.
The principal components of the program are automated image processing and
environmental remote sensing, all within the college of engineering.
Applications of the requested equipment would lie in the general area of earth
and ocean science and global change. Some examples of existing research are as
follows: o Interpretation of synthetic aperture radar observations of sea ice. o
Satellite remote sensing for the control of tropical diseases. o Topographic
mapping of Earth's surface via synthetic aperture radar.
