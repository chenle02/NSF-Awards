This project aims to prototype and deploy a Supply and Demand Open Knowledge
Network (SUDOKN) that can serve as the knowledge base for supply chain analysis
and risk management solutions in various industries, including defense,
aerospace, automotive, and biomanufacturing. SUDOKN will consist of several open
and interconnected knowledge graphs, built on various types of supply and demand
data. These graphs will address challenges related to supplier discovery,
capability, and capacity analysis, and will align with formal ontologies. This
project will democratize access to publicly available supply and demand data and
maximize its utility by developing a set of principle-based, accurately
axiomatized, and reusable ontologies, creating the tools required to ingest,
gather, process, and search manufacturing data, and utilizing these tools and
ontologies to build an open Manufacturing Capability Network and its supporting
knowledge graphs from diverse datasets. This research integrates concepts from a
variety of disciplines, including philosophy, computer science, systems
engineering, supply chain and logistics, and design and manufacturing
engineering.

The project advances the state-of-the-art in cyber-manufacturing by establishing
a new formalism for manufacturing capability modeling. It creates an open
ecosystem of manufacturing services aligned with the Manufacturing-as-a-Service
(MaaS) paradigm and develops original methods and algorithms to provide
manufacturing resources with cognitive capabilities. This effort aims to empower
small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) by enhancing their visibility,
competitiveness, and agility. It will stimulate new research into understanding
how manufacturing capabilities form and evolve over time. The results will
contribute to more resilient and robust U.S. supply chains, directly impacting
our national security and economic prosperity. The project outcomes will be
integrated into the graduate and undergraduate curricula at the participating
institutions, with students playing a direct role in this research agenda.
