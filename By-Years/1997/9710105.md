9710105 Holmgren In a comprehensive two-year planning process begun in the early
1990s, The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) developed a Master Plan for the
years 1993 through 1999 intended to clarify and document the institution's
priorities and commitments for the future. The construction and endowment of a
Plant Studies Center to allow expansion of the currently crowded herbarium and
library collections, to store the collections under state-of-the-an
environmental conditions, to provide space for their growth through at least
2020, and to provide nine study rooms for scholars visiting the Herbarium merged
as the centerpiece of the Master Plan and is the largest single investment NYBG
is making in its future. A campaign was conducted to fund the needs outlined in
the Master Plan, including $33,000,000 for the construction and endowment of and
the equipment for the Plant Studies Center. Funds needed for both the
construction and endowment of the Plant Studies Center and the compact storage
equipment for the Library and 65% ($1,621,178) of the cost of compact storage
equipment for the Herbarium were raised in the campaign. Funds to cover the
remaining 37% ($952,121) of the cost of the compact storage equipment for the
Herbarium are provided by this award.
