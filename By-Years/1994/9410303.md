9410303 Kohn This Research Initiation Award allow fundamental studies by the PI
in focal areas of bone and implant biomechanics. This research will provide a
more quantitative understanding of the factors controlling microdamage in
compact bone. By detecting microdamage at an early stage, material failure
mechanisms can be related to microstructure and mechanical parameters, yielding
insight into potential mechanisms governing failure. Data from these studies
will be of benefit in identifying mechanisms of microdamage, failure and
remodeling in bone, and in the design of man-made materials. ***
