You turn to look at the stranger and suddenly you're sure; you have seen her
before and been here before. Nearly everyone has had the feeling of deja vu but
from where does that feeling come? How can someone know that they know something
without being able to recall how they know it? Dr. Anne Cleary's research is
aimed at understanding what features of a situation produce this feeling of
familiarity. Her research focuses on a newly discovered and controversial
phenomenon called recognition without identification: This is the ability to
recognize fragments of information as part of earlier experienced events, but
which event is not reliably matched to the information. &lt;br/&gt;With a CAREER
award from NSF, Dr. Cleary will implement a five-year study of familiarity-based
recognition. She will address such questions as: What features of an experience
give rise to later feelings of familiarity? And, what aspects of mind underlie
the subjective sense of familiarity? Broader impacts of Dr. Cleary's career plan
stem from its educational impacts. A major educational goal is to improve
teaching of psychology through the use of NSF funded innovative classroom
technology. This technology allows students to respond to questions on wireless
remote keypads then view collective responses on a screen. The technology
actively engages students in demonstrations of known findings, and in the
methods used by experimental psychologists. Some qualified undergraduates will
be invited to work in Dr. Cleary's lab. In particular, Dr. Cleary will provide
mentorship and financial support for students from traditionally
underrepresented groups in university-wide mentoring programs, such as the Iowa
State Undergraduate Summer Internship Program for Women in Science and
Engineering.Financial. This support and NSF support will allow students to
travel to research conferences where they will present research
findings&lt;br/&gt;
