This project is expanding a pilot version of the web-based Electronic
Encyclopedia of Earthquakes (E^3) into a major collection under the auspices of
the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), the Consortium of Universities
for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE), and the Incorporated Research
Institutions for Seismology (IRIS). E^3 provides a portal for students,
educators, and others seeking information about the science of earthquakes,
earthquake engineering, and the practical aspects of hazard characterization and
loss reduction. Access to a wide variety of teaching materials is enabled, along
with curricular linkages to interfaces to many types of archived and real-time
databases, including data from global and regional seismic networks, national
seismic hazard maps, and elastic and inelastic response histories of structures
exposed to real or simulated (e.g. shake table) earthquakes. The collection
facilitates the use of large data sets as part of an on-line learning
environment that encourages and facilitates inquiry and exploration.
Furthermore, E^3 is informed by the National Science Education Standards content
recommendations for grades 5-8 and 9-12. As an entry-based collection built on
three tiers of content: (1) Glossary &amp; Outline, (2) Synopsis, and (3)
Content In Depth and Curricular Connections, E^3 promotes a user's ability to
access knowledge on a simple level quickly or probe deeper for more detailed
information. Three types of search interfaces will be included: keyword search,
controlled vocabulary, and map-based. Important co-funding of this project is
being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in NSF's Geosciences
Directorate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
