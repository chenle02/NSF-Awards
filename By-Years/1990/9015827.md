The heavy metal composition of the central nuclear Bulge of our Milky Way Galaxy
is important to studies of the types of stars constituting both external
galaxies and the first generation of stars in the disk of our Galaxy. Currently
star formation is thought to proceed more rapidly in the Bulge than in the
neighborhood of the Sun. A point of controversy over the last twenty years has
been the question of whether strong absorption lines in the spectra of red giant
stars actually reflect an enhanced abundance of heavy elements, or whether they
perhaps arise as a consequence of anomalies in the structures of the atmospheres
of these stars. The Principal Investigator (PI) wishes to conduct research in
this area by measuring the abundance of the heavy metal elements in a selected
group of Bulge red giants. This study will differ from those of the past in that
high dispersion spectra will be obtained with modern solid state arrays to
conduct the abundance analysis. The results will be used to estimate the mass
distribution of supernovae which return nuclear-processed material into the
interstellar medium. A secondary project will be to determine whether carbon-
star giants (the origin of which is likewise unclear) in the Bulge have enhanced
metal abundances relative to the Sun's composition.
