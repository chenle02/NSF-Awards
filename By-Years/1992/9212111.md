Workstations will be purchased to enhance the acquisition, real time treatment
and post-processing of large amount of experimental data obtained from moire and
coherent gradient sensing interferograms, and STM pictures. High graphic
capabilities, good computer power and large memory space are needed for better
resolution and to handle the quantity of information.
