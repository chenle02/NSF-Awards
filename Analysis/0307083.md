'Miniconferences on harmonic and Real Analysis'

Since 1984, a total of 33 one and two-day conferences in harmonic analysis,
real analysis, and related areas have been organized, primarily at Auburn
University. More recently, two of the meetings were held at the University of
Louisville and California State University at San Bernardino. The main purpose
of these meetings was to enable mathematicians and students in the vicinity of
the universities where the meetings were held to interact with each other and
with mathematicians and students from outside the region. The meetings also
afforded mathematicians in the fields the opportunity to present recent
mathematical research.

The success of these conferences has increased with each passing year, and we
have recently averaged around 20 to 40 participants from other institutions at
each meeting. Of course, we always have participation by about 30 local
university faculty and graduate students. The meetings are relaxed and informal,
include hour lectures by leading experts, plus many contributed talks. Time is
also available for discussion and initiation (or continuation) of collaborative
research.

The current grant will enable us to continue this series for another three
years. The planned schedule is to hold three meetings at Auburn University.

1. Miniconference on Real Analysis, March 28-29, 2003.

Highlighted Topics: Gauge integrals and fractal measures, Applications of set
theory to topology and real analysis, Continuous restrictions to compact sets,
plus other topics. See
