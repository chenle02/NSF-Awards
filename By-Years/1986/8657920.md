This Presidential Young Investigator is studying the manipulation dynamics and
anthropomorphic features of the human arm for applicability to industrial
robotic manipulator design; the feasibility of a walking wheelchair for
handicapped people which can climb stairs, negotiate smooth terrain, and sit and
stand; and development of CAD software that can design ladder diagrams for
sequential control circuits. The PI is establishing a computer integrated
manufacturing laboratory with several robots, an automated materials storage and
retrieval system, conveyor, programmable controller, and test benches for
various types of control hardware.
