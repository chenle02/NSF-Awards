9315365 Guinan There are several special classes of eclipsing binary stars whose
orbital and physical properties are well suited for them to serve as
astrophysical laboratories, both for the study of the stars themselves and the
galaxies in which they reside. The aim of this project is to provide essential
information from binary star systems concerning: the internal structure of the
component stars, the helium abundance, the effect of overshooting in the
convective cores, the General Relativistic component to apsidial motion, and the
properties of stars and the distance moduli to the Large and the Small
Magellanic Clouds. This award is made under the auspices of the Research in
Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at the NSF.
