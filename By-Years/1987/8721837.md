The Center for Marine Science at the University of Southern Mississippi is
establishing a trace element laboratory and clean facility at its National Space
Technology Laboratories (NSTL) location. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer
system will be acquired and maintained for use by all investigators and will
especially benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by increasing the
capabilities of the institution to support research and engineering activities.
