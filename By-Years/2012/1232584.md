This project fundsapproximately 25 graduate students to attend the Ninth
Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 2012) Conference.

NSDI 2012 will be held in San Jose, CA, on April 25-27, 2012. The conference
focuses on the design principles of large-scale networks and distributed systems
and, in particular, challenges that are shared across systems as diverse as
internet routing, peer-to-peer file sharing, sensor nets, scalable web services,
and distributed network measurement. The goal of the conference is to bring
together researchers from across the networking and systems community?including
computer networking, distributed systems, and operating systems?to foster cross-
disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-
disciplinary emphasis makes it well-suited as a target for student
participation. The support requested in this proposal will enable the
participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend NSDI. The
