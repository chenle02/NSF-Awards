This award provides funds for an REU Site at the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The focus of the research is on Native
American material culture collections at the Museum. The Museum curates about
200,000 objects of Native North American origin derived from dozens of Native
American tribes and were collected at the end of the 19th and the beginning of
the 20th centuries. Most, if not all, of these objects are of singular interest
to native groups and are fully catalogued under the guidelines of NAGPRA (Native
American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act). Each year, six Native American
students will be recruited to the University of Pennsylvania campus. For one
semester, the students will enroll in U-Penn courses and live on campus while
conducting independent research at the Museum. The Native American students will
each partner with a current U-Penn student, and the U-Penn student will then
spend six weeks during the summer at the Native American community, reservation,
or research institution where their Native American partner is from.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
experiences.
