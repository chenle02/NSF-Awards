The timely screening and quarantining of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers are extremely
critical to prevent the aggressive COVID-19 transmission. Motivated by the
urgent need of rapid, sensitive, and reliable tests of coronavirus infection,
this project aims to deliver a handheld diagnostic module for direct detection
of the virus without complex and time-consuming nucleic acid amplification
process. The battery-operated portable system can be broadly deployed in various
locations (e.g., a port of entry, remote clinic, drive-through test center,
etc.). The smartphone-connected module is designed to enable wireless cloud data
collection/sharing to track the locations and numbers of infection outbreaks for
epidemiological surveys and alerts. Additionally, this biosensor module can be
readily adapted for screening other viral species in future
epidemics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This innovative technology strategically
integrates plasmonic biosensing and ultralow-noise photodetection to enable
rapid, ultra-sensitive colorimetric detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its
structural proteins using a disposable microfluidic chip. The specific aims of
this project are (1) synthesis of novel antibody- or aptamer-conjugated
nanoprobe materials for plasmonic biosensing, (2) nanofabrication of 2D
transition metal dichalcogenide photodetectors for low-power, ultralow-noise
near-infrared optical signal detection, (3) development of theoretical kinetic
model and fundamental understanding of scientific principles that lead to an
optimal transient response of the nanoprobe assay, and (4) system integration of
biosensor components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory
mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the
Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
