Ramsey Theory is a central area of mathematics aptly characterized by Motzkin's
motto, "Complete disorder is impossible." It is often the case that by starting
with a large enough structure, a substructure with desired properties emerges.
Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers
into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have
the same color. Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple
directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems
from a wide range of mathematical disciplines. This project utilizes techniques
in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational
structures. A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite
structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing
analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not. Progress on infinite
structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology,
creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics. This project
includes important questions suitable for graduate students and early career
researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-
trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.

This research program investigates infinite relational structures supporting
Ramsey theory. A major focus of this project is to develop the Ramsey theory of
homogeneous structures. This involves constructing new types of trees which code
homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce
(in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees, as well as developing
purely combinatorial proofs. Computability theoretic strengths of structural
Ramsey statements will be investigated, as will model-theoretic dividing lines.
The second main focus is the continued development of topological Ramsey space
theory and its implications for forcing, ultrafilters, and Banach spaces.
Development of Ramsey spaces for homogeneous structures ties this together with
the first focus. The third line of research will develop Ramsey theory on
uncountable structures. The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of
logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas
of mathematics.
