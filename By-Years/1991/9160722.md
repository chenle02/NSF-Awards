This project addresses the need of the applications specialist for advanced
mathematical programming methods without the heavy investment of time which is
normally required. It aims to provide advanced modeling aids for setting up
Lagrangean Techniques which are usually indispensable when dealing with large
complex problems. This will be accomplished by imbedding Lagrangean Modeling
into an interactive environment under state-of-the-art systems such as GAMS and
MPSX/370. The user will be guided in setting up models and associated Lagrangean
Techniques without having to code the details. He will be led by the system and
will be able to try out various options before committing to a final set of
decisions (how to decompose, how to set the various parameters, how to select
from a set of specialized solvers, how to guide the Lagrangean Dual solution
procedures, etc.) Various algorithmic devices will be provided as needed,
including: solving the Lagrangean Dual by subgradient optimization or dual
ascent; providing an overall Branch and Bound shell; making available special
purpose algorithms; modifying GAMS to take advantage of the decomposition;
introducing advanced integer programming (logical processing, probing) and
heuristics.
