Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Core concepts, such as Newton's second law of
motion or the ideal gas law, underpin a rigorous science education. These ideas
and laws come from physics, math, and chemistry; their necessity to practical
and advanced science literacy is evidenced by widespread institutional standards
requiring study in these disciplines by students in the sciences. Over the
course of their careers, students mature in their understanding of fundamental
scientific concepts, moving from memorization to analysis and synthesis of core
ideas. The goal of science education at Brown University is to provide learning
environments where students can become self-driven inquirers and investigators
capable of scientific discovery. To achieve this growth, students require
grounding in core scientific concepts and practice in the in self-driven inquiry
and investigative behaviors they will use as scientists and scientifically
literate citizens. To improve understanding of key science concepts and promote
inquiry-based learning, we are developing a prototype Context-Rich Interactive
Science Teaching and Learning System (CRISTALS) for pilot testing in 13 Brown
University courses and at Rhode Island College and Worcester Polytechnic
Institute. The web-based CRISTALS environment provides students with information
and problems facilitating the exploration of a core concept in a context rich in
interdisciplinary applications and examples. The CRISTALS environment is
expected to support instructors in adapting science pedagogy to better meet the
needs of a diverse student population. The CRISTALS tool provides students with
opportunities to improve their ability to apply core scientific concepts in
problems from multiple disciplines, and encourages self-driven inquiry into
fundamental scientific principles.
