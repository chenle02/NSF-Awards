Statistical learning techniques have made significant progress in the past 15-20
years. Some representative areas include neural networks, applied regression,
classification, and clustering. As a result of these developments, a powerful
collection of adaptive regression and classification techniques are now
available and can be applied to a wide range of important science and
engineering areas. Some typical applications include medical diagnosis,
bioinformatics, chemical process control, and face recognition. The focus of
this project is on high-dimensional statistics and data science. This work will
help scientists working in biotechnology and other areas to interpret and
uncover important patterns in large-scale data sets. This research will also
help scientists and doctors discover the biological bases of many diseases, and
improve prognosis and treatment selection for patients. The project will provide
research training opportunities for graduate students.

This project includes four main thrusts in the area of supervised learning. In
the first thrust, the investigator will build feature-efficient, or lean, models
that depend on only a small number of unique features. The investigator will
develop COVID-19 case forecasting through customized training and collaboration
with a team in the second thrust. In the third thrust, the investigator will
develop a model-free approach to the challenge of local feature importance via
building a convex region around a point for prediction. The fourth thrust
focuses on improving the large-scale computation of l1- regularized models.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
