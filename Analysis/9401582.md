9401582 Enflo The proposers plan to work on two projects involving bounded
operators on Hilbert space. The first project is to study orbits of cyclic
vectors of operators. In particular, different regularity properties of these
orbits. The second project involves a study of some aspects of invariant
subspaces using recently developed techniques of the proposers. The focus here
is on quasinilpotent operators. Operators on Hilbert space represent an infinite
dimensional generalization of matrices. It is a well known fact that given a
matrix there is always a vector such that the span of iterates of the matrix
action on this vector is not the whole vector space. This project is focused on
the analogous question in the infinite dimensional case. Appropriately
formulated, this question is called the invariant subspace problem. It has been
the focus of much research on operator theory. The question is an attempt to
decompose operators into building `locks and is central to the analysis of the
structure of operators. ***
