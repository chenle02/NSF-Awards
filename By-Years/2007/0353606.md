This project will study the role of vegetation processes (changes in land use)
and snow cover in East Asia, especially on the Tibetan Plateau, in influencing
monsoon evolution by modulating the thermal gradients and Bowen ratio - a ratio
of the transport or gradient equations of sensible heat and latent heat) at the
land surface. A coupled general circulation model and Simplified Simple
Biosphere Model will be used to perform a series of 20-year runs spanning the
period 1982-2001. This project promotes international collaboration between the
United States and China, also providing access to otherwise unavailable data
sets to facilitate model verification. A significant student-training component
is included in the work, and the project is expected to make a major
contribution in a formerly neglected area of research.
