It is proposed to continue a comprehensive experimental study of the excitation
of inner electron shells of heavy atoms by 0.1 to 3.0 MeV ion-atom collisions.
This investigation will shed light on curve crossing and other quasimolecular
phenomena which occur at small internuclear separations. Two scattering
apparatuses are available for this study: The first, completed during the
present NSF grant period, detects Auger electrons or characteristic x rays in
coincidence with ions scattered to angles between 2 and 20 degrees by single
collisions with gaseous targets. The nature of the Auger electron-ion
coincidence spectra obtained with this apparatus is surprising and the primary
thrust of this proposal will be to continue with this new effort. The data
obtained is differential in nature and provides unique and detailed information
about the excitation and decay of unusual atomic and molecular states. The
second apparatus is a high resolution x-ray spectrometer and will be used to
investigate the radiative decays corresponding to the above Auger decays. These
efforts will be supplemented with calculations using a Dirac-Fock program. It is
the total of these three efforts that will provide new and unique information on
the interaction of ion beams with matter. The results of this research will aid
in the understanding of basic processes in atomic interactions, and will be of
use in such practical problems as controlling high-temperature plasmas and
modelling naturally-occurring phenomena.
