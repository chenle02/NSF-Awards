This project acquaints electronics engineering technology students with the
theory and application of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using a hands-on
approach. The student experience is novel in that the developed course centers
around carefully chosen practical DSP systems. This provides motivation and
direction to students over the duration of the course. A set of experiments are
focused on a practical system and lead the students to conclude a course project
in one semester. The equipment acquired includes PC based instrumentation with a
DSP engine. Project work is accomplished using a commercial processor. With
powerful software and interface hardware, students are able to design and test
systems on the workstation. The award is being matched by an equal amount from
the principal investigator's institution.
