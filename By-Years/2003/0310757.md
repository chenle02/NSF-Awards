Computer Science (31) This project involves the evaluation and adaptation of
hardware implementations and software architecture simulators for implementation
in two courses, currently primarily software-based, in the Hope College computer
science curriculum. Adaptations of the use of field programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs) for the computer organization course are based on their use in an
electrical engineering course at Bucknell University and in the Circuit
Cookbook. Previous work with the SimpleScalar computer architecture simulation
system at the University of Virginia and the University of California at San
Diego is being scaled down for use at the undergraduate level in Hope College's
computer organization and computer architecture courses.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is that the
implementation of these systems will provide students with more hands-on
learning and faculty with visual demonstrations. It is expected that the
students' exposure to hardware and simulation environments, usually missing in
undergraduate CS programs, will increase their understanding of hardware and
software interactions. Another outcome is the development of new class and lab
materials. The broader impact includes the sharing of the materials and
experiences from this grant with other institutions through papers at
conferences and workshops and via access to web pages.&lt;br/&gt;
