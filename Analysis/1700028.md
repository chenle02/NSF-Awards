The mathematical theory of homogenization identifies the average, macroscopic
behavior of a phenomenon that is subject to microscopic effects. For example,
one may be interested in determining the general properties of a porous
material, or predicting the evolution of a substance traveling through a
heterogeneous medium. Such phenomena are typically modeled by partial
differential equations that depend on microscopic length-scales describing the
heterogeneities. Homogenization is the process of approximating such detailed
equations with smoother, macroscopic models. The principal investigator will
focus on the subject of so-called stochastic homogenization, in which the
microscopic effects are randomly distributed. Such models are significant for
developing a robust framework to represent "typical" physical settings that are
subject to uncertainty. Generally speaking, the study of homogenization combines
tools from several different areas of mathematics, including analysis, partial
differential equations, dynamical systems, and probability theory. The principal
investigator is committed to using collaborative approaches to the project. This
flexible perspective promotes a unified understanding of the physical phenomena,
as well as enhancing the theory of the relevant equations.

The principal investigator will focus her efforts on two main classes of
elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations: (a) non-divergence-form
equations, which describe general diffusion processes and are frequently used in
the study of stochastic control theory and geometry; and (b) reaction-diffusion
equations, solutions of which represent front-like evolution and serve as the
primary mathematical models in chemical kinetics, combustion, and biology. The
research will encompass proposes a variety of sub-projects that are motivated by
the following two objectives: (1) to show that homogenization is applicable to a
broader class of partial differential equations than previously expected; and
(2) to obtain more specific information about the process of homogenization than
is currently known, such as error estimates or properties of the effective
behavior. Questions posed initially in stochastic homogenization typically have
equivalent formulations in probability theory. Consequently, the research may
lead to progress in the study of random walks in random environments, first
passage percolation, and large deviation principles.
