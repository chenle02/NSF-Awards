This award will support the activities of an interdisciplinary team of
researchers in terms of maintenance of the Conneciton Machine of the UCLA
Cognitive Science Research Program. The research resulting from this support
will be in the following six areas: (a) language processing, which includes
reasoning, planning, inference and search, (b) evolutionary studies in the newly
emerging paradigm of artificial life, (c) simulation studies of neural networks
- both synthetic and neurally plausible - for modeling memory, learning,
language and vision, (d) parallel algorithms for biological image processing,
for example, the manipulation of MRI images, (e) research in the fundamental
mathematics and logic of parallel computation, such as the development of
parallel programming language semantics, and (f) the use of parallel algorithms
for scientific computing. This award will support the activities of an
interdisciplinary team of researchers in terms of maintenance of the Conneciton
Machine of the UCLA Cognitive Science Research Program. The research resulting
from this award will be in cognitive sciences and in the development of parallel
computation.
