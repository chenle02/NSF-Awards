9406520 McEnroe The PI will investigate the optical mineralogy and magnetic
properties of selected samples of high-grade metamorphic rocks exposed in the
Adirondack Mountains that cooled during the Grenville orogeny about 1050 my ago.
She will produce a selected suite of high-quality Grenville paleomagnetic poles,
which have been lacking until now. After this pilot study using paleomagnetic
and rock magnetic techniques, she will utilize the results to select a broader
suite of samples for a full determination of reliable Grenville paleopoles for
the Adirondack Mountains. ****
