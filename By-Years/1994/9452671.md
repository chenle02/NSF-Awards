9452671 Steadman The University of Wyoming seeks to initiate a three-week,
residential, Young Scholars program in engineering for 36 students entering
grade 12. The project provides students with classroom lectures and discussions,
field trips, hands-on laboratory and research experiences in the specific
engineering areas of material science, environmental, and computer-assisted
engineering. The students are guided by experienced university faculty to
develop research methods and problem-solving skills. Projects developed during
their research experience are shared with classmates during the academic year.
Continued student involvement in engineering related activities with the
university takes place through video tele-conferencing and participation in
university sponsored designed competitions.
