Integration of innovative investigations into undergraduate microbiology,
zoology, and plant biology laboratories is occurring through the acquisition of
a computer-interfaced Lecia Stereocan 420 scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Innovative investigations enable undergraduate students to (1) utilize the
scientific method in designing experiments, (2) master new technologies, (3)
obtain qualitative and quantitative data, (4) develop conclusions based on data,
(5) understand the principles of specimen collection and preparation, (6)
understand the principles of SEM operation, and (7) develop expertise in SEM
operation. Undergraduate students can use the instrument in Introductory
Microbiology, Ornithology, Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy, Plant Physiology,
Plant Anatomy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Independent Study as part of
required laboratory exercises. SEM exercises are being integrated into existing
laboratory schedules designed to (1) teach concepts, sample preparation, and
analyses and (2) to interest students with information and research
opportunities that are revealed by utilization of the instrument. Students are
given hands-on experience utilizing the SEM to study micromorphological
characteristics of bacterial isolates, mallophagous mites of birds, effects of
heavy metal containing wastewater on root hair development and nodule formation
in legumes, quantitative assessment of sunken glandular trichomes in sweet basil
treated with or without natural pesticides, evaluation of organelle purity
obtained by density gradient centrifugation of soybean extracts, and surface
modification in avian epidermal pore structure. Students can acquire knowledge
in data analysis, instrumental "know-how," and state-of-the-art training needed
to enter the job market as confident and productive scientists.
