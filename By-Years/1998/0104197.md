Professor Robert Field of MIT is supported by the Experimental Physical
Chemistry Program for a novel study of the dynamics of energy transfer in
molecular Rydberg states. A nanosecond pulse will be used to prepare a carefully
designed initial state, and a pair of scanned-delay phase-coherent IR
femtosecond pulses will be used to study the dynamics of the initially localized
excitation. In particular, the first pulse is used to prepare a coherent
superposition among a well defined set of Rydberg states, and the second pulse
interrogates the recurrences or rephasing. Detection will be by a field
ionization voltage ramp. The mechanistic details of electronic and nuclear
energy flow will be studied, varying the extent of resonance between interacting
states. Alkaline earth monohalides such as CaF, CaCl and BaF prepared in
molecular beams, previously studied by the PI in the frequency domain, will be
utilized as model systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of Rydberg states
enhances our understanding of energy flow and storage in small molecules. As the
method is improved, it may be applied to increasingly complicated molecules,
with potential impacts on fields such as photochemistry and quantum information
storage.&lt;br/&gt;
