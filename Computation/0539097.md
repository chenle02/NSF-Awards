The Sixth International Workshop on Accurate Solution of Eigenvalue Problems
(IWASEP VI) will bring together leading researchers in the numerical solution of
eigenvalue and singular value problems. The IWASEP meetings have a strong
history of research presenations in perturbation theory and algorithms for the
symmetric eigenvalue problem, the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem, singular
value problems, and, more recently, polynomial eigenvalue problems. The format
of the workshop is designed to facilitate interaction, give visibility to
leading research in the field, and stimulate new research. Eigenvalue and
singular value computation has always been an important area within numerical
linear algebra and numerical analysis, thus the workshop will stimulate research
in an important and intellectually deep field.

Eigenvalue and singular value software is at the core of software in many
engineering disciplines. Many computer similation codes for the stability of a
structure (e.g. a building, bridge, or tower), and fluid flow codes (for gas
dynamics or weather prediction) rely upon eigenvalue software. The Google web
page solves an eigenvalue problem inside its page rank software, a commonly used
web browsing tool. The singular value decomposition is the basis of computations
in face recognition applications in vision (for security at airports), data
mining (interpreting large volume of information in a concise understandable
manner), and image compression (reducing the storage for an image or video so
that it can be transmitted more quickly over the internet).. The funding of this
proposal will help graduate students, post doctoral researchers, and new
university faculty to attend IWASEP VI; having an impact on education of the
graduate students and post doctoral researchers, having an indirect impact in
university classrooms throughout the U.S., and further developing our
understanding of a field of scientific computation that is important in many
practical engineering problems.
