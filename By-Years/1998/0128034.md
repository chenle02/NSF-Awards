This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
method of UV curing composite structures that will extend UV curing techniques
to any size, thickness, or shape composite and with any type of reinforcing
fiber by uniformly distributing UV light throughout a composite structure. The
anticipated result is a new UV curing process that can be used in many diverse
applications, including aircraft, automotive, spacecraft, and marine. The
process will significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing composite parts,
improve the performance of these parts (by reducing residual stresses), and open
new applications for composite materials using this fabrication technique. This
novel UV curing technique is most attractive for large or complex composite
parts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed UV curing process has the potential to
replace thermal curing for nearly all composite parts because it will achieve
large cost and time savings while improving, or at least equaling, the thermally
cured composite part performance. Additionally, the size limitations imposed by
the use of an autoclave are removed because this UV curing process does not
require an autoclave or any specialized tooling. Applications for this UV curing
process exist in all fields, including next generation vehicle
applications&lt;br/&gt;
