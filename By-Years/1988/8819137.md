Abstract Blue Light irradiation of etiolated pea seedling strongly reduces the
capacity of a 120 kD plasma membrane- associated protein for subsequent in vitro
phosphorylation by added ATP. Experiments are described that will a) provide a
complete photobiological characterization of the light reaction; b) investigate
the correlation of its photobiological properties with known physiological
responses to blue light; c) characterize the phosphorylation change
biochemically; and d) characterize the protein itself. The measureable changes
in phosphorylation occur in seconds, and the PI will show that progress in these
four areas will elucidate early steps in one or more signal-transduction chains
from blue light photoperception to final physiological response. Plant growth is
controlled by light, both the amount and kind of light it receives. Certain
plant growth responses are regulated by high energy blue light. This research
will examine the mechanism by which plants perceive light and transform that
energy into plant functions.
