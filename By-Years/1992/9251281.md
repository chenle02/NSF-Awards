This project will provide partial funding to equip a teaching laboratory with 14
workstations for twelve students and two instructors. The project will provide
for a number of improvements in the curriculum: 1) The courses in the curriculum
for majors will be taught in an interactive, hands- on, doing instead of
listening manner. Laboratory sessions will provide for more one on one time with
professors and knowledgeable proctors; 2) The curriculum will become more real
world. The students will do their learning in a production type environment
using state-of-the-art software engineering and development tools. The
environment includes UNIX and X- Windows based tools; 3) The computer learning
environment will become more graphical. The students will be able to better
learn about program execution and structure because of graphical tools that
trace execution, that measure execution, and show the structure of programs and
systems of programs; 4) The project will allow for group learning managed by the
instructor using the environment's revision control system and module library
capability; and 5) The project will allow for presentation of the content of the
curriculum along side the practice of the field. This is accomplished by
allowing students to reuse their own previously developed programs, techniques,
and experiences in a software environment in later courses in the curriculum
thereby reinforcing the usefulness and importance of their previous work and
courses.
