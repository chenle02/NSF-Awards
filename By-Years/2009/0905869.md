Professor Peter C. Searson of Johns Hopkins University is supported by the
Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry to
investigate the complex interplay between the substrate, nucleation, and surface
chemistry that dictates the shape and orientation of islands in
electrocrystallization. Since the properties of solid materials are often
dependent on crystallographic orientation, the ability to manipulate the shape
and orientation of islands in electrocrystallization is crucial to the
optimization of electrode materials for fuel cells, batteries, solar energy
conversion, as well as in a wide range of other applications. Graduate,
undergraduate, and area high school students will be trained in all aspects of
the proposed research.
