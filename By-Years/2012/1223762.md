Many recent security attacks are financially motivated. Understanding how
attackers monetize their activities is critical to combine technological, legal,
and economic intervention to render certain classes of attacks unprofitable, and
disincentivize miscreants from considering
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manipulation of social network and web search-engine
results to promote illicit businesses is increasingly common. Rather than the
product of isolated attackers, search-engine manipulation relies on
collaboration between many distinct actors, ranging from individuals installing
malware on end-systems, to miscreants funneling traffic in exchange for
commissions on sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to quantitatively
model the economic interactions between the actors behind search-engine
manipulation, and to infer which intervention policies could raise the cost of
carrying out these attacks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We develop novel measurement
methodologies to collect large amounts of field data, cross-reference our
measurements with data from industry partners, and gather forensic evidence on
compromised hosts that are unknowingly participating in attacks. This leads us
to quantify various operational parameters (e.g., common malware families,
common infrastructure components...), and use them to build economic models of
search-engine manipulation attacks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project outcomes
include (1) identifying salient features that denote relationships between
different entities participating in search-engine manipulation campaigns, (2)
describing possible relationships between different types of illicit online
trades, and (3) discovering points of failure in the attackers' infrastructure,
that the defenders can try to exploit. More generally, this study will further
refine our understanding of online crime economics, which will not only be
useful to security researchers, but also to economists and criminologists.
