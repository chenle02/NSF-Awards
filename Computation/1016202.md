The investigator, along with his students and collaborators, will develop
efficient high-order time-stepping methods that will be used in conjunction with
discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations. In particular, adaptive space-
time methods will be developed that will allow for either (1) explicit local
time-stepping that allows for different time-steps in different flow regimes,
or, (2) implicit time-stepping, which is sometimes required in certain
applications. A key feature that will be integrated into these numerical schemes
is error control in the form of adaptive mesh refinement. Several error
estimators will be investigated, as well as several shock-capturing strategies.
The resulting numerical schemes will be applied to a variety of model equations
that arise in plasma physics, including ideal magnetohydrodynamics, two-fluid
Euler-Maxwell, and kinetic Vlasov equations. Specific application problems that
are of interest include the dynamics of solar coronal loops, the formation and
propagation of astrophysical jets, and the simulation of collisionless magnetic
reconnection.

Plasma is the fourth state of matter (after solid, liquid, and gas), which can
be characterized as an ionized gas (i.e., a gas that is able to conduct
electricity). Plasma appears in a wide range of applications including
astrophysics and space physics, as well as in laboratory settings such as in
magnetically confined fusion. Modeling and understanding the basic phenomenon in
plasma have long been topics in scientific computing, yet many problems remain
far too numerically intensive for modern parallel computers. The main difficulty
is that plasmas span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The scope of
this research is to develop accurate and efficient computational methods that
can better solve various equations that model plasma behavior. A key aspect of
this research is the development of adaptive numerical methods that are able to
dynamically estimate and control the errors that are produced during the course
of a computation.
