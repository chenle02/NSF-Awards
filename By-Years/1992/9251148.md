A fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR) and two thermal
conductivity detector gas chromatographs (GC) with integrators will be used in
the laboratory portion of an integrated organic chemistry course. It will better
understanding of the principles and reactions discussed in the lecture. Several
problem-solving experiments will be used. In addition to allowing a significant
increase in the number of IR spectra that can be obtained, the quantitative and
spectral searching capabilities of the FT-IR will be exploited. The GC will be
configured as a thermal reactor and used to run and analyze several reactions.
Other uses will include product isolation from microscale reactions and product
analysis using electronic integration. The project will impact science education
majors and a wide variety of students in other disciplines as well as chemistry
majors.
