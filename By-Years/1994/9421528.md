Drs. Randall and Fowler, in cooperation with scientists from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), will organize and conduct a three day
workshop on prognostic cloud water representation in general circulation models
(GCMs) in May 1995 in support a numerous U.S. and international research
programs. Participants will be experts from around the world who are working on
the problem of how to incorporate the effects of cloud microphysical processes
in global forecast and climate models. Plans include production of a Workshop
Proceedings. The purpose of this award is to provide funds for travel support
primarily for U.S. academic community scientists. Other support will be provided
through NCAR, NASA, and the World Meteorological Organization. The topic is one
of the most challenging and important problems facing the global change and
weather forecast modeling communities.
