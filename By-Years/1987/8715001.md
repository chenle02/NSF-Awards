During repairs, replacement, and/or strengthening of bridges, bypass structures
are necessary to maintain traffic flow. The bypass bridge may be a temporary
structure or in some cases replace the original as a permanent structure. This
project will investigate a new concept for a rapidly installed bridge structure
using prefabricated units and assembled on site. Economies may result by rapid
installation, reduction in traffic delay time, and short duration for closing
the bridge during replacement or repairs. The potential for safety and economies
are very impressive.
