0201982&lt;br/&gt;McDuff&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington's
School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to significantly improve the
oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessels Barnes and Thompson,
two ships operated by UW as part of the University-National Oceanographic
Laboratory System research fleet. The specific items supported with this award
include a hull-mounted acoustic current profiler and a water purification system
for R/V Thompson, and a thermosalinograph for R/V Barnes. These improvements
will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using these two ships in
their research during 2002 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
