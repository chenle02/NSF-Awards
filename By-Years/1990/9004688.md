The PI will establish experimentally in both crystalline and clastic rocks
quantitative relations between in situ stress magnitudes and breakout
characteristics (such as location, span, depth, persistence) under realistic
simulation of field conditions. He will also study the mechanism of breakout
formation and growth in common crystalline rock such as granite and basalt, and
compare it to the failure process observed in clastic sedimentary rock, and
produce analytical model(s) of the breakout-stress relations, calibrated by
experimental results.
