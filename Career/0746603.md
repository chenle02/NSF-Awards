Mathematical and computational models will be used to study populations
hierarchically segregated into groups referred to as "households". These
households may represent patches within an agricultural field, fields within a
landscape, dorms within a school, schools within a city, cities within a region,
or even subnetworks within larger computer networks. Population models and
epidemiological models will be explored within this framework, complementing
other work with lattice-structured populations. In the models, interactions
within a household occur much more often than interactions between different
households. Primary goals of the models are to better understand how and why
spatially targeted and/or clustered treatments affect dynamics of infections,
for example varying the rates of pesticide application to crop fields based on
the levels of insect infestations among those fields. Factors such as spatially
varying resistance (both long-term, due to e.g. mosaic planting of different
crops in different fields; and short-term, e.g. as a result of pesticides) will
be included in the models. Another application will be better understanding the
spread of malicious computer software ("worms") using biological dispersal
strategies in clustered heterogeneous computer networks.

Entomologists and other researchers will cooperate with the principal
investigator and his students to develop applications of the project such as
controlling maggot flies in commercial blueberry fields in Maine, planthoppers
in rice fields in China, and other agricultural crop pests. Interdisciplinary
courses on modeling and simulation will incorporate various topics from the
project. Undergraduate research training will be a significant part of the work,
including participation in a summer research program primarily aimed at
underrepresented minority groups. Outreach to high school students and teachers
will also be included, with the participation of current undergraduates studying
to become K-12 teachers.
