BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY is a half-hour, weekly children's science education
series produced in Seattle, Washington by McKenna/Gottlieb Producers Inc. and
KCTS Television in association with Rabbit Ears Production. The series is
designed to make science assessable and interesting to children in the of forth
and fifth grades by relating science at the interests and everyday activities of
children and presenting basic concepts from elementary science curricula in a
humorous and exciting format. Programs are set in a variety of studio and field
locations and utilize special effects and the creative techniques of host Bill
Nye, a popular television entertainer and science aficionado. In each program,
studio demonstrations/experiments and field segments feature Nye and a diverse
cast of children, scientists and celebrity guests. Experiments and
demonstrations use inexpensive, safe household items to enable viewers to follow
along at home or in the classroom. As part of the promotion and outreach for the
series, ancillary materials such as a teacher's guide, parent's guide, activity
packages and newsletters will be developed and made available to schools as well
as in the home and such informal setting as community centers, libraries, and
clubs. ***
