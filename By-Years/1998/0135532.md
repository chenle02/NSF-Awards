This dissertation enhancement grant will support Jose G. Tello under the
direction of Dr. John M. Bates of the Field Museum of Natural History for a
detailed study of the phylogeography of two bird lineages distributed throughout
the Neotropical lowlands in Brazil. Phylogeography is a field of study concerned
with the principles and processes that underlie the geographical distribution of
genealogical lineages. Phylogenetic patterns of avian (bird) differentiation
within the Neotropics, or the existence of spatial and temporal congruence of
those patterns, are just beginning to be studied. This research involves the
study of the diversification of two independent avian lineages -- Cercomacra
antbirds and Platyrinchus flycatchers -- using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
sequences.

The generation of phylogenies will not only shed light on the region's
evolutionary history, but also will help to elucidate the roles that different
ecological and behavioral traits may have played in the diversification process.
This fundamental research will constitute one of the first to extensively
examine phylogeographic patterns in the Neotropical lowlands using multiple data
sets and multiple lineages, and hence provide important insights into the
history of diversification in the region.
