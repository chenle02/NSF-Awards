Extensional tectonism that overprints slightly older compressional events is a
common and fundamental aspect of many orogenic belts in the geologic record.
Several important questions about the control that the earlier features place on
the later ones will be addressed by this research in the southern part of the
Great Basin region of western North America. Results of this analysis will be
useful in studies of other orogens where extension follows compressive
orogenesis.
