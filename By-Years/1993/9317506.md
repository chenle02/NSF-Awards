9317506 Miller Dr. Miller will participate in the management and data analysis
of the GLOBEC Georges Ban Broad Scale Survey. This will include (1) work on the
formation and management of the Georges Bank Plankton Technical Group (GBPTG) at
Woods Hole, and (2) studies of the population biology of Calanus finmarchicus,
Pseudocalanus moultoni, and Pseudocalanus newmani using the very large sample
set to be collected by the Broad Scale Survey. In specific studies of copepods
he will use the broad scale survey preserved sample set, plus specially
preserved samples and subsamples, to examine aspects of C. finmarchicus and
Pseudocalanus spp. life history, growth, and production biology as functions of
season, temperature and stratification, location over or off the bank, food
availability, and hydrography. Goals will include comprehensive estimation of
secondary production by C. finmarchicus and Pseudocalanus spp. to allow
comparisons among seasons, years, and sites across Georges Bank.
