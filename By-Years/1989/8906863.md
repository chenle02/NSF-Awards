This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will provide funds for an innovative
high power picosecond KrF excimer laser system. In its initial stage, the laser
will deliver 30 ps pulses with 50 mJ of energy at 248 nm. A newly discovered
saturable absorber for KrF will greatly reduce the amplified spontaneous
emission problem pertinent to all short-pulse excimer laser systems and will
allow for a completely new approach for the construction of such systems. The
laser pulse will be used to produce a plasma on a solid target, and the soft x-
rays emitted from the plasma will excite inner-shell electrons of molecular
vapors. The feasibility of this technique for molecular species has been shown
within the PI's NSF funded program (ECS-
