9318578 Michl This Award is made in the Office of Special Projects in partial
support of the 15th IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry. The Symposium will be
held in Prague, Czech Republic, July 17-22, 1994. The scientific program will
consist of 15 one-hour Plenary Lectures, 10 one-half-hour Invited Lectures and
two poster sessions with as many as 300-400 posters. Participants will be drawn
from research institutions all over the world. With photochemistry as the common
theme, papers will be presented which cover organic, inorganic, physical,
biochemical, polymer and industrial photochemistry. %%% This international
symposium is a forum for discussion of photochemistry broadly and will provide
an environment for US scientists to meet and hopefully establish collaborations
with foreign scientists, particularly Eastern European Scientists, whom they
would not likely otherwise contact. NSF support will provide partial participant
costs to young US investigators. ***
