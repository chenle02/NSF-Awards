96-28861 Fei Abstract The PIs propose to constrain experimental laboratory
studies of stable hydrous silicate phases with seismological data to test
whether dehydration weakening in subducting slabs causes moderate- and deep-
focus earthquakes. The program is aimed at understanding the role of hydrous
phases in intermediate and deep-focus earthquakes through high pressure and
temperature simulation experiments in the laboratory. They will experimentally
determine the existence of hydrous phases for P-T conditions expected within the
descending slab, the maximum dehydration pressures of hydrous phases in both
simple MgO-SiO2-H2O and complex hydrous peridotite systems, and the
dehydration/melting temperatures of hydrous peridotite as a function of pressure
(depth). The PIs also propose to compare the characteristics of oceanic
lithosphere seismicity to evaluate the hypothesis that intermediate- and deep-
focus events occur on faults that were initally formed in oceanic lithosphere
before subduction. ***
