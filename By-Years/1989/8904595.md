Development of reliable and accurate advection methods continues to be a major
item in the construction of general-purpose computational fluid dynamics codes
for use in fluid dynamics, heat transfer, combustion, and process engineering. A
cost-effective implementation strategy for computation will be developed based
on "adaptive stencil expansion": the base scheme uses limited third-order
unwinding (ULTRA- QUICK); then in the strong curvature regions, the algorithm
automatically expands the stencil to higher-order unwinding to improve accuracy
and increase resolution. The expanded-stencil computation occurs only in narrow
isolated regions of the computational field, thus adding little to the overall
computational cost. Using a "downwind weighing factor", the arbitrary higher-
order mulit- dimensional algorithm can be made compatible with existing
commercial and research codes. The resulting algorithm will be tested and
optimized on a number bench-mark problems involving passive convection-
diffusion, laminar and turbulent flows and convective heat transfer.
