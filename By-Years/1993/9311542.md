PIs and collaborators will attempt to extract DNA from preserved cells in an
exquisitely preserved skeleton of the Upper Cretaceous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus
rex, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. Within vascular canals and in the
marrow cavities of leg bones, PIs have found spherical structures that have the
appearance of nucleated red blood cells. Preliminary analyses of these
structures indicate the presence of proteins and nucleic acids. An attempt will
be made to extract DNA from these apparent red blood cell remnants. If
successful, these results could be of great significance to our understanding of
dinosaur phylogeny, and will also be of great interest to the growing community
of scientists attempting to extract DNA from fossil material.
