Large-scale improvement in science and mathematics education require a shared
vision and commitment to action of an array of stakeholders who have limited
understanding of what is needed and lack a forum for effective communication. We
will bring together key groups in a statewide Summit to create this shared
vision and commitment and to develop specific, achievable policy and legislative
outcomes to be pursued for at least three years. Legislators, the Governor's
office, Florida Department of Education Officials, Business and Industry
representatives, and Science and Mathematics educators at all levels will
convene in a one-and-a-half day meeting to establish a common understanding of
the need for science and mathematics literacy in our workforce, the challenges
of today's schools, effective methods of science and mathematics instructions,
the nature and dimensions of creating change in mathematics and science
instruction, and action plans necessary to achieve them. &lt;br/&gt;The Summit
will be preceded by two planning sessions of STEM education leaders in the state
to identify priority actions, and to develop brief White Papers for distribution
to policy-makers. The Summit will result in written action plans that will
constitute drafts of bills and Florida Department of Education policy
statements. Together these will improve the environment for science and
mathematics learning in Florida's schools. A follow-up component assures that
these recommendations are kept under active consideration, if necessary, for
three years and thus three full legislative cycles.&lt;br/&gt;
