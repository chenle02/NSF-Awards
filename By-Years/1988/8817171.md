This instrumentation development project will design, build, and test a modern
digital signal processing sonar receiver (RXDSP) for ocean science research
applications. Development work will involve programming newly available signal
processing computer chips using modern analog-to-digital technology. An
integrated sonar receiver and transmitter will incorporate new acoustic signal
processing theory to produce a portable, single board sonar processor that can
be interfaced with a variety of microcomputers. A multiple frequency and
multiple transducer system will be built and tested. Final development efforts
will incorporate mult-frequency inversion techniques in data analysis.
Scientific sonar systems will play an important role in NSF- sponsored research
projects. These systems will be useful for studying fine scale patchiness in
oceanic fronts and within large lakes, where high resolution over great depths
is required. This development effort to merge new signal processing chip
technology and acoustic theory will result in a digital sonar system with
advanced capabilities.
