This award supports interdisciplinary cooperative research in the
delignification of wood to be conducted by Robert A. Blanchette of the
University of Minnesota and Eduardo A. Trumper of the University of Chile in
Santiago. They will carry out chemical, biochemical and structural
investigations to determine the mechanisms responsible for the preferential
degradation of lignin by "palo podrido," a type of white rot found only in the
rain forests of southern Chile. Cellulose is not degraded and the wood becomes
highly digestible. The major enzymes, which move from the fungus into the wood,
the morphology of how they move and how they attack lignin in the cell walls all
will be studied using immunocytochemical methods. The research will provide an
understanding of decomposition processes, information for use in new
biotechnologies as well as on how to use enzymes from lignin-degrading fungi for
industrial purposes. The investigators have complementary backgrounds and both
have excellent credentials. The facilities at St. Paul and at Santiago are
completely adequate for this work which will be a good example of cooperation
under the Science in Developing Countries program.
