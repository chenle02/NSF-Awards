Abstract The objective of the proposed Workshop to be held in Varenna, Italy, is
to analyze the recent advances in fiber reinforced concrete materials and their
applications for civil infrastructure systems in Italy and the United States,
and identify potential new research areas. The Workshop will focus on materials
properties, forms of deterioration and their effects on structural performance,
and quantitative analysis of materials. Emphasis is placed on further basic
research needed before this advanced technology can be transferred to
professional practice. The main inhibitor to the application of this technology
in engineering practice, both in Europe and the United States, is the lack of
appropriate codes and standards as well as governmental certification. ACI and
RILEM have already undertaken major efforts to refine design methodologies. The
important next step would be to identify the research that needs to be done.
Also, the most expedient ways need to be explored on how to use fiber
reinforcement either as partial replacement of conventional steel reinforcement
and in special cases to completely replace such conventional reinforcement.
Advances in the technology will be discussed that document the performance of
concrete structures with greatly reduced or no conventional steel reinforcement
at all. The intellectual merit of the proposed workshop derives from the
international cross-fertilization it makes possible. Both the European and
American participants have made significant advances in recent years, and it
will benefit both sides if an exchange of information is made possible in the
productive setting of a workshop. The outcome of the workshop has the potential
of a significant impact, because engineering practitioners are eager to use this
new technology and apply it to improve the performance of infrastructure
facilities worldwide at potentially reduced cost.
