9521052 Olsen In recent years, the design and use of compact transmission lines
has become more common for reasons related to aesthetics, power transmission
efficiency and environmental concerns. Hardware on these compact lines is
exposed to higher surface electric fields than on lines of more conventional
designs. Thus, corona which is responsible for a number of undesirable effects,
is a more important design criterion for hardware to be used on new and upgraded
lines. In this work, it is proposed to develop a new methodology for the design
of such hardware. The first part is to develop an appropriate criterion for
predicting the initiation of corona streamers on conductors with curvature in
two directions. To do this, a theory described in this proposal will be
calibrated using a set of carefully controlled corona initiation experiments.
The second is to incorporate this theory as an optimization criterion in a
computer program to design hardware. Finally, a number of hardware designs will
be developed and tested against those developed with simpler existing criteria.
