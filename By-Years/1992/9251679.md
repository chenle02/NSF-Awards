The acquisition of 12 Transputer Development Systems (with each system having
nine transputers) allows the use of parallel processing laboratory exercises in
a Microprocessor System Design course and also the support of senior-student
projects. The Transputer Development Systems provides an inexpensive but
excellent and effective approach to teaching and experimenting with parallel
processing systems. By the use of innovative laboratory exercises (such as
solving the mathematical equivalence of jigsaw puzzles) the Transputer
Development Systems enables students to fully explore the advantages and
pitfalls associated with trying to develop and execute algorithms on multiple
processor systems. Finally, the Transputer Development Systems also is being
used to support student Major Qualifying Projects which incorporate substantial
parallel-processing capability.
