0131384&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;We are seeking support for the travel costs of
speakers invited to participate in the 17th Penn State Symposium in Plant
Physiology to be held May 16-18, 2002 in State College, Pennsylvania. This
symposium is entitled "Plant reproduction: from evolutionary and physiological
analyses to molecular and cellular studies." Plant reproductive biology has been
a subject of great interest and intrigue for many generations. In recent years,
there have been very rapid advances in our understanding of plant development
not only from molecular genetic studies, but also from evolutionary and
physiological analyses. The goal of this meeting is to provide an
interdisciplinary forum for leading researchers working in diverse areas of
plant reproductive biology to present their recent findings, to share their
ideas, and to stimulate each other in discussions. The symposium will bring
together about 20 outstanding scientists from around the world, many of whom do
not regularly attend the same meetings because of their wide-ranging
specialties. In addition to the invited talks, we anticipate having
approximately 50 contributed posters summarizing current research by scientists,
postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. The results presented at the
symposium will be summarized in a meeting report to be published by one of the
leading plant journals. &lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide a valuable
service to the research community. We are not aware of any other symposia that
have considered this topic in such an integrated and comprehensive manner. By
bringing together scientists using different approaches to study the problems in
plant reproduction, the symposium will facilitate novel collaborations and
experimental approaches, and will further stimulate progress in this fast
advancing and growing field. &lt;br/&gt;
