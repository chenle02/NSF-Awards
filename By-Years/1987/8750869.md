The recent acquisition of a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer by the
Physical Science Department of Chaminade University of Honolulu is improving the
undergraduate laboratory and directed research experience of undergraduate
students. Freshmen and sophomores use the NMR spectrometer under close
supervision; juniors and seniors use it on a regular basis for laboratory work
and directed research. Nine different chemistry courses are affected, ranging
from the introduction of NMR theory in the general chemistry course to detailed
study and experimentation and research in the advanced chemistry courses.
