Discrete geometry is the study of combinatorial properties of finite families of
geometric objects. Results in this field often have applications to search
algorithms, data classification, and optimization. The methods used to answer
discrete geometry questions can be wildly different. Some are based on linear
algebra, where the rigid structure of the space is important. Some are based on
topology, and the results hold up to smooth deformations of the objects
involved. This research project aims to develop new ways to use topological and
linear algebraic methods in discrete geometry to expand the connections between
combinatorics and other fields. The driving motivation is to understand what
makes a combinatorial problem amenable to techniques from topology, and what
makes it amenable to techniques from linear algebra. The project also includes
topics that can be used to mentor undergraduate students in research. The
project focuses on questions related to finite families of convex sets. The PI
plans to develop new ways to apply topological methods to Tverberg-type
problems, related to a longstanding "colorful" version of Tverberg?s theorem.
The recent progress in quantitative Helly-type theorems can help build a bridge
between the analytic side of convexity and linear programming, which the PI aims
to formalize. Several of the questions under study aim to generalize classic
results in extremal combinatorics to high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
