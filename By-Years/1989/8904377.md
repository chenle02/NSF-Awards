Drs. Ridgway and Freeman have recently discovered that the eggs and embryos of
several species of hydrozoans contain endogenous calcium indicators similar to
aequorin. Because the calcium indicators are natural, exist in high
concentration, and emit light specifically in the presence of calcium, these
preparations offer unique opportunities for studying the role of calcium in
early development. They propose to investigate the mechanism that controls the
appearance of calcium channels in the membrane at first cleavage in these
organisms. These channels could play a role in establishing the anterior-
posterior axis of the developing embryo. They will determine where and why these
channels appear by using image intensification and image enhancement techniques
in conjunction with microinjection of heterochronic cytoplasm. They have
discovered that potassium depolarization of cleavage stage embryos leads to a
bright flash which is due in part to calcium release from an internal store.
They will investigate the mechanism that couples the calcium entry through the
calcium channels to the calcium release internally. They will study the
propagation of four sorts of calcium waves: 1. those due to IP3 diffusion in
unfertilized eggs, 2. those that may occur at fertilization, 3. those due to
depolarization of cleavage stage embryos, and 4. those accompanying
metamorphosis. %%% The importance of calcium as a regulator of a number of
cellular processes has been established. The question remains as to how is the
level of calcium itself controlled. Drs. Ridgway and Freeman have developed a
powerful model system in which to address this question. It exploits a naturally
occurring luminescent protein found in hydrozoan embryos which emits light in
the presence of calcium.
