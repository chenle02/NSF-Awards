Algebraic topology arose out of development of algebraic methods to answer
concrete questions about geometric shapes. One of the most successful tools
originally developed is homology theory, which gives qualitative information
about shapes that remains unchanged if the shapes are moved, twisted, or
stretched. Several decades were dedicated to understanding homology and
producing a sequence of new, more general tools that shared similar properties
but detected different types of information. Many new and powerful tools were
developed; in addition, a surprising connection was discovered with number
theory. This research focuses on expanding on our understanding of this
connection by lifting recent developments from number theory to topology, and
applying this new machinery of algebraic topology to concrete problems about
geometric shapes such as knots and links. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research
project extends work of the investigator and collaborators in constructing
structured ring spectra realizing connections to specific moduli of abelian
varieties. These phenomena and their impact on the chromatic filtration in
stable homotopy theory have been examined up through chromatic height two. The
project aims to produce new information at chromatic height three through the
study of Picard modular surfaces and to apply these results to detecting higher
periodic phenomena in the stable homotopy category. Further, the project will
study positivity phenomena in the theories of modular and automorphic forms and
their connection to the additive locus in chromatic homotopy theory. The work
also aims to extend recent results in constructing Khovanov spectra associated
to knots and to show Khovanov's work on complexes associated to tangles lifts to
a theory of stable homotopy types associated to tangles. Finally, the project
will apply work in stable equivariant homotopy theory, in particular the
equivariant Tate diagonal, to realize homology-level constructions in Heegaard-
Floer homology.
