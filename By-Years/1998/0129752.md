Abstract for Prof Aguirre's NSF Proposal
#0129752.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aguirre. This Small Grant for
Exploratory Research is being awarded to the Disaster Research Center at the
University of Delaware for project in Veracruz and Puebla, Mexico, in
collaboration with Dr. Jesus Manuel Macias of CIESAS, Mexico City. The
objectives of the project are to better understand: (1) the societal reactions
to the extensive flooding that occurred in the two Mexican states in 1999; (2)
the systems of warnings and evacuations that took place during these floods; (3)
the extent to which established empirical generalizations in the social science
of disasters regarding warnings and evacuations are applicable in a developing
country. The project uses multiple methodologies to investigate these issues:
(1) community survey of randomly selected residents in cities impacted by the
1999 floods; (2) content analysis of newspapers, agency reports, and other
textual information on the societal reaction; (3) extended field work employing
observational and intensive interviews of victims and officials; (4) the use of
key informants to ascertain recent, post 1945 changes in the vulnerability of
the communities. &lt;br/&gt;
