This project develops an integrated laboratory to facilitate undergraduate
instruction in the complete design through manufacturing process. The new
laboratory consists of three interconnected subsystems. The manufacturing
subsystem includes computer numerical control (CNC) machines and robotic
assembly stations. This equipment strengthens instruction in modern
manufacturing processes and reinforces the importance of manufacturability in
design. The design subsystem consists of new graphic workstations that support
computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADM) instruction at the advanced
undergraduate level. The integration subsystem consists of a new computer
workstation server with local area network connections to the new manufacturing
and design subsystems as well as to existing Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
and Controls laboratory resources. The server provides a shared platform for
computationally intensive elements of CADM. Undergraduate student instruction is
expanded and enhanced in a number of ways. Experience with the demands of agile
manufacturing systems with autonomous control is provided. The concept of
concurrent engineering design is reinforced by providing interdisciplinary
interaction in an integrated laboratory environment. The advantages of
distributed processing for rapid prototyping, modification, and design porting
is supported by hands-on experience.
