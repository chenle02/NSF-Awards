The field of nondestructive testing has a tremendous number ofcommercial
applications. The principal investigator and his team will develop an ultrasonic
microscope system for tomographic reconstruction of objects with realistic, non-
trivial structure. The system will incorporate acoustical microscope and
computer technologies presently available with diffraction-correcting tomography
algorithms that are being intensively studied by various researchers.
