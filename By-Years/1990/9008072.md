Random access machines typically have fixed, bounded word size. This research
concerns the computational complexity of solving data structure and algorithm
problems on such machines, assuming that the input descriptions for
computational problems involve quantities that individually fit into single
machine words. Specific topics include the inherent complexity of data structure
problems in the cell probe model of computation, the complexity of memory
mapping encodings, and the construction and applications of new data structures
that perform searching with sublogarithmic complexity.
