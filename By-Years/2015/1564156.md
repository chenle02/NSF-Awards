A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and
research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the
Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these
institutions expands the opportunities for their students to pursue challenging,
rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that
may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational
appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly
with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation's knowledge of the impact
of providing relevant STEM instruction on recruiting and retaining
underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next
generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce
directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill
set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College in New Town, ND will develop
a new AS degree in Sustainable Energy Technologies that incorporates culturally
relevant concepts and uses constructivist methods. Additional work will be done
to address recruitment and retention in STEM, expand undergraduate research
opportunities in the energy field, and engage the community. This project
addresses the need for a larger STEM-educated workforce in the energy field on
the Fort Berthold reservation and in the state of North Dakota by expanding the
STEM instructional capacity of a tribal college.
