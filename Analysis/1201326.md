One of the goals of dynamical system theory is to understand the orbit structure
of systems displaying some particular feature. In this project the principal
investigator will focus on dynamics displaying some sort of hyperbolicity. The
project will develop in two main directions, dynamical systems with
multidimensional time (i.e. actions of higher rank groups) and positive entropy
and classical dynamical systems (i.e. one dimensional time) displaying some
uniform (though possibly partial) hyperbolicity. The aim is to develop
techniques to understand the interactions between measure theoretical and
topological properties of a system. This interaction happens to go both ways.
For instance, in the direction of topology to measure theory it is observed that
on 3-dimensional nilmanifolds partially hyperbolic systems are always K-systems.
And in the direction of measure theory to topology it is known that a non-
uniformly hyperbolic higher rank action on a 3-dimensional irreducible manifold
can only exist on the torus.

Boltzmann's study of gas particles produced the nowadays accepted idea that
several systems display some chaotic behavior. While the system may be of very
diverse origin, e.g. from mechanical, biological, stock-market, etc., their
abstract mathematical model can hopefully be classified and then studied with
various mathematical technologies. The aim of this project is to classify
systems displaying some hyperbolic behavior, the hallmark of chaotic dynamics,
and prove that such systems should have some algebraic origin, thus introducing
a purely mathematical and very powerful technology into the study of an
otherwise intricate problem. While chaotic behavior is by definition impossible
to be deterministically predicted, algebraic systems present symmetries that
allows the researcher to study the long run behavior, and be able to describe
the orbit structure of such systems. The PI plans to continue with the formation
of graduate students, the writing of preparatory material on the subject (e.g.
books, survey papers, lecture notes, etc.) and collaborate with the teaching of
mini-courses, organization of workshop, seminars, etc.
