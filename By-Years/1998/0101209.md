An oriented matroid is a combinatorial abstraction which can be used to
encapsulate features of a nite point set in Euclidean space which are of
interest in combinatorial geometry. It is planned to study certain enumeration
problems involving oriented matroids by making use of the theory of valuations
on distributive lattices. Indeed some progress along these lines has already
been made. It is hoped that information on the range of certain important
functions for example, the f-vectors of convex polytopes, or the number of
"k-sets" of a finite point set will be generated. Additionally it is hoped that
this research will enable the extension to oriented matroids in general of
substantial results already obtained for uniform oriented matroids.

Combinatorial geometry is a subject with a venerable history which in recent
years has become an even more important arena for research, due to its
applications in the area of algorithms for geometrical structures. Research in
combinatorial geometry often leads to better algorithms in computational
geometry, which in turn leads, for example, to improved design of computer
chips, better algorithms for image analysis and processing, and so forth.
