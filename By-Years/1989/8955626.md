The Jackson Laboratory will initiate a nine-week, residential, Young Scholars
project in the life sciences for students in the 11th grade. Continuing an
annual tradition begun in 1949, high school juniors conduct independent,
original research in mammalian genetics as apprentices in staff scientists'
laboratories during a summer program. This full-time, at-the-bench experience is
supplemented by evening research presentations by sponsors (preceptors) and
students, and by a weekly discussion series on careers and ethical issues in
genetics. High-ability students, recruited on a national basis, are accepted.
Each participant's project is tailored to his or her academic preparation and
interests. Inbred and mutant lines of mice are used in many of the student
projects. Follow-up activities include contact among the sponsor, the student,
and a Key Teacher at the student's school. Program alumni include two Nobel
Laureates, as well as a Westinghouse Science winner.
