IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) is a consortium of
research institutions created to implement critically needed national facilities
for support of seismological research on the Earth's interior in the coming
quarter century. IRIS has a membership of 50 universities and includes nearly
all U.S. universities with seismological research programs. IRIS will act as the
agent of NSF in implementing IRIS programs. Coordination with other federal
agencies (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS), Department of Energy (DOE) is effected by an interagency accord.
The FY 1987-89 Program Plan and Budget for IRIS has been reviewed and approved
by the National Science Board at its August, 1986 meeting. The FY 1987 budget
for IRIS is $3,700,000 (15 months) which consists of $3,600,000 to be awarded
directly to IRIS and $100,000 to be transferred directly to the U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) as reimbursement for USGS services performed for IRIS under the
terms of the interagency accord mentioned above. This action provides for the
transfer of the $100,000 to the USGS.
