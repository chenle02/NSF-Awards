Proposal Number: 0428422&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: An Economic Approach to
Security&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Joan Feigenbaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internet security is universally seen as an extremely
important problem. Moreover, technical solutions developed over the last three
decades represent deep and elegant intellectual contributions. Yet few of these
solutions are in widespread use. Clearly something is amiss. It has recently
been argued, by Anderson and others, that the missing linkis economics: Only
through understanding the incentives inherent in various security proposals can
one decide which, if any, would actually lead to greater security. This research
project is a three-year, multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary investigation
of the economics of security in networked environments. Specific research topics
include security of interdomain routing, adoptability of trusted platforms, and
markets for private information. The intellectual merit and broader impact of
the project are intertwined, both based on the potential not only to solve
technical problems but also to develop general analytical techniques for
evaluating candidate solutions to real security problems in a manner that gives
adoption incentives their just due. If successful, it will lead to greater
actual security, rather than simply to more available security technology.
Educational activity that integrates security, networking, and economics is also
a major goal one on which the investigators have experience on both graduate and
undergraduate levels.&lt;br/&gt;
