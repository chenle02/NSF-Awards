This project has two elements. First, it proposes to test propositions derived
from a recognized rational choice theory of group cooperation. Second, as a side
benefit, it will help establish a small, computer-controlled experimental
laboratory usable for future rational choice
experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rational choice theories explain behavior as a
consequence of individuals' attempts to maximize rewards and minimize costs.
Thus "free riding" on public goods-in which individuals can benefit even if they
do not contribute-is an important theoretical (and practical) problem. Michael
Hechter has proposed a theory in which social control to prevent free riding is
a function of visibility and extensiveness of norms governing cooperation. The
theoretical contribution of this project states Hechter's theory formally,
permitting deriving testable propositions on control. Kanazawa's theory treats
visibility as the cost to gain information on cooperation or selfish behavior.
Normative extensiveness is inversely related to an individual's dependence on
the group. One theorem from the explicit theory is that group solidarity, which
is produced by high levels of cooperation among members, is high when visibility
and dependence on the group both are high. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental
theory tests will be conducted with volunteer subjects playing a game in which
they decide how to allocate points between themselves and the group. A mixed-
motive game structure developed by other investigators will be adapted for the
theory tests here. The game and point allocations will be controlled and
recorded by a local network of computers purchased with funds from this project.
Because the game structure in which points are given and taken is quite general,
that network will be usable for additional experiments testing rational choice
theories having different payoffs, amounts of information, and communication
structures. &lt;br/&gt;
