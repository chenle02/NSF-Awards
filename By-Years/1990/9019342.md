The most widely accepted driving mechanisms for regional migration of pore
fluids in sedimentary basins are sediment compaction and topography. Previous
analyses indicate that both mechanisms have potential difficulties explaining
some of the above geologic observations unless the fluid flow is spatially or
temporally restricted. Specifically, heat content of pore fluids or flow rates
or both are not sufficient for compaction driven flow to produce migration of
warm pore fluids on a regional scale. Topographically-driven flow may produce
warm pore fluids on a regional scale, but would result in depletion of saline
components of fluids. We propose to carry out a two year study on the following
aspects of regional migration of hypersaline brines: (1) develop suitable PTX
equations of state for hypersaline brines under basinal conditions and examine
the effects of salinity in controlling pore water flow in sedimentary basins;
(2) examine various mechanism for focusing or concentrating flow of warm, saline
brines, including: episodic expulsion of pore fluids, fluid flow along aquifers
or faults, deflection or focusing of fluid flow by basement or surface
structures and three-dimensional flow; and (3) apply these results to the
regional migration of pore fluids in the Colville Basin, Alaska and the Northern
Gulf Coast. The regional migration of hypersaline brines over hundreds of
kilometers through sedimentary basins has been suggested as a mechanism to
explain a number of important geologic observations. These include:
remagnetizations found in Paleozoic carbonates of North America, clay mineral
diagenesis, inclusions of high pressure, high temperature fluids, and
distribution of oil, gas and Mississippi Valley-type lead-zinc deposits.
