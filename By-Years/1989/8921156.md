This project is in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in
the subfield of bioelectrochemistry. Professor Rechnitz will study the use of
receptor assemblies from living animals and plants for the detection of
important biological molecules. Intact chemoreceptor structures from species
such as crabs and plant tissue structures will be coupled with analytical
transducers to develop new classes of biosensors. These sensors will respond
selectively and senstively to metabolites, hormones, toxins and drugs by
providing electrical signals that are related to concentrations.
