The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor Michael De Rosa's
investigation of the "Studies on the Mechanism of Electrophilic Aromatic
Substitution" in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania State University,
Delaware County. He and undergraduate research students will develop new
methodology that will unambiguously demonstrate how many intermediates are
present in electrophilic substitution reactions. The kinetics and products of
the dichloroethanoic acid catalyzed chlorination of pyrroles with
N-chlorobenzamides and the carboxylic acid catalyzed chlorination of
methoxybenzenes with N-chloroacetanilides are being studied. The intramolecular
selectivity and intramolecular selectivity will be determined in order to
elucidate the role of pi complexes in the electrophilic substitution mechanism.
