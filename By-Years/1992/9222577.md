The main objective of this activity is to organize a conference on automation
and computer integrated manufacturing for batch and continuous process
industries. The conference will bring together individuals from academia and
industry who have common interests in automation, production control, quality
control and related issues to stimulate exchange of ideas and collaboration. The
key issue is the focus on process industries. Strong regulatory oversight and
other conditions particular to process environments have spurred innovative
developments in control automation and quality assurance. This conference should
result in a better understanding of common important research topics of interest
in the process industries. Output of the workshop will include publication of
proceedings that will highlight these developments.
