9352699 Awad A Fiber Optics Laboratory is being enhanced through the acquisition
of equipment which allows the offering of a much more comprehensive curriculum
that reflects current advances in this emerging technology. The addition of
research- quality instrumentation enables students to make measurements of a
critical nature to verify classroom theories and principles. Also, the enhanced
facility enables students to grasp advanced concepts in optics, polarization,
semiconductor physics, fiber optics and fiber optic instrumentation and related
techniques. This program is a part of the course study in the
Electrical/Electronics Department and benefits courses open to students in the
electrical, electronics, computer, mechanical and technical management programs.
In addition, students use the facilities to do independent studies to complete a
comprehensive investigation, or the design and assembly of an optic
communication or optic transducer system. Also conducted are small-group
workshops for high school and college faculty and their students in cooperation
with representatives from the fiber optic industry to ensure the new laboratory
facilities are used to their fullest. ***
