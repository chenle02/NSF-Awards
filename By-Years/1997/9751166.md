This project introduces the spectroscopic techniques of circular dichroism and
stopped-flow absorption methods to the chemistry laboratory curriculum.
Spectroscopy is among the most fundamental of physical measurements, with
extensive applications to all areas of chemistry. However, the previously
available spectroscopic tools within the Chemistry Department have limited the
ability to address such structural questions as the distribution of
conformations within a macromolecular sample or the change in substrate
conformation upon ligand binding. Furthermore, the lack of fastmixing techniques
has reduced the accuracy of kinetic studies of fast reactions in solution
(typically those reactions with half-lives on the order of 10 ms to 10 s). The
new instrumentation facilitates the examination of the absorption of circularly
polarized light by chiral systems and the elucidation of time-dependent
phenomena in aqueous solution using stopped flow methods. Initial experiments
allow students to observe the sensitivity of circular dichroism to a variety of
conformational and organizational changes and to experience the utility of
stopped-flow methods for examining fast reactions in solution. The principles
underlying these techniques have already been presented in three lecture courses
in the department: physical chemistry, biochemistry, and biophysical chemistry.
The new instrumentation enhances the kinetic offerings in the existing sophomore
physical chemistry laboratory and helps initiate a biochemistry laboratory for
the newly approved biological chemistry option for chemistry majors. The
instrumentation also expands the range of questions that senior majors can
address in the required Introduction to Research course, including the
characterization of the cation effect in biochemical systems and of the
influence of phase behavior on the optical activity of metal-containing liquid
crystals.
