This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will address the
feasibility of designing and fabricating a one piece carbon fiber composite
membrane reflecting surface for an 8-meter aperture millimeter wave radio
telescope. Methods of fabricating a suitably precise tooling mandrel will be
explored, along with the selection of materials and fabrication processes for a
single piece membrane. In addition, metallization alternatives will be
identified along with the means for protecting the reflective surface from the
environment. Alternative protective coating samples will be submitted to
National Radio Astronomy Observatory for testing and evaluation. The Phase I
Final Report will include a membrane concept design, a tooling mandrel concept
preliminary manufacturing plan and cost estimate for the candidate reflecting
surface. The potential commercial applications of this research include radio
telescope applications in the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum where low
mass, high precision, thermal stability environmental endurance and low cost are
important. Ka-Band communications satellite systems ground segments are also
candidates for this technology. The current plans of the FCC to find commercial
uses for the millimeter wave portions of the spectrum makes it likely that the
technology will find additional commercial application.
