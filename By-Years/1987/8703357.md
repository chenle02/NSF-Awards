F.P. Peterson will continue working on loop spaces. D.M. Kan will continue
working on diagrams. S.R. Costenoble will work on equivariant Thom spectra, G.
Matic will use gauge theory to find conditions for 3-manifolds to bound
4-manifolds, R.D. Thompson will study v1-periodic homotopy groups. These are all
topics at the forefront of research in topology, popularly known as "rubber
sheet geometry". The topological point of view emphasizes qualitative behavior,
e.g. stability, or fundamental structural properties, e.g. knottedness, above
analytic detail, and this is often more illuminating.
