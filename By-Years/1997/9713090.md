This award is to provide partial support for the participation of ten people in
the 1997 Gordon Research Conference on Organic Thin Films. These participants,
graduate students or postdoctoral researchers, will receive assistance with
registration fees and travel expenses. The site of this conference has been
moved from California to Rhode Island and the time of the meeting from January
to July. The subject of this conference is multidisciplinary and technologically
important. The situation is opportune for the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
Program in the Division of Chemistry, Directorate of Mathematical and Physical
Sciences and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems in the Directorate
for Engineering to provide an opportunity for young people to attend the
conference and participate in the discussions. This award assists graduate
students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in the Gordon Research
Conference on Organic Thin films.This is a research area of major potential
impact in a number of technological fields.
