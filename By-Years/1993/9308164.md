CTS-9308164 Polytechnic University Nitash P. Balsara ABSTRACT The principal
objective of this research is to understand the thermodynamic properties and
phase behavior of ternary blends of polymethylbutene, polyethylene, and
polymethylbutene-polyethylene block copolymers. Theories suggest the possible
formation of complex fluids containing tubular and lamellar dispersed phases.
Time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering and light-scattering measurements
will be employed to determine microstructure as well as the evolution of phase
separation. Polyolefins are among the foremost products in the petrochemical
industry and are used to make many plastic materials. New knowledge and new
materials composed of ternary blends could improve the properties of current
polyolefin products or extend their use for new applications.
