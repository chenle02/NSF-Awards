This award supports the Midwest Representation Theory Conference, to be held
March 11-13, 2022 at the University of Michigan. The conference will gather
established experts, recent Ph.D.s, and graduate students to discuss and
disseminate new results in the broad area of representation theory of local and
adelic points of algebraic groups, a fundamental subject in mathematics, with
many applications both inside and outside mathematics. The conference will be
the latest in a sequence of conferences that have consistently provided a forum
in which students and experts alike present and discuss state-of-the-art-work in
the discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference features invited talks from
a diverse cohort of speakers, including several young researchers working in a
broad range of topics, as well as contributed talks. Speakers' specialties range
widely, with two broad themes being supercuspidal representations, and
automorphic forms and L-functions. Supercuspidal representations are the
fundamental building blocks of admissible representations of rational points of
groups over local fields, and they typically appear as ramified local components
of automorphic representations of adelic groups. These, along with their
associated L-functions, are central objects of study in modern number theory.
