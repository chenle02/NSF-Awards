The principal investigator will study the petrogenesis of the anorthosite-
mangerite association. He will integrate field, petrological, and geochemical
techniques to determine the parental magmas and differentiation mechanisms of
massif anorthosites, the causes of the anorthosite-mangerite association, the
nature of mafic and oxide-rich lithologies, and the origin and significance of
iron-titanium ore deposits. The work will be done in the St.Urbain/Charlevoix,
Labrieville, and Morin regions of Quebec. The project will help geologists
better understand the origins of this important group of igneous rocks.
