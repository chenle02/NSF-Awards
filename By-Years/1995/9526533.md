Tauxe 9526533 The PI's propose to continue their investigations into the origin
of magnetite and magnetic remanence in submarine basaltic glass and to acquire
paleointensity data for a globally distributed database throughout the Cenozoic.
They will carry out rock magnetic studies and laboratory synthesis of basaltic
glasses in order to further understanding of the origin of the magnetite that
carries the magnetic remanence in submarine basaltic glass. This research has
far-reaching consequences for understanding the nature of the earth's core and
generation of the geodynamo, and for reconstructing earth's geomagnetic field
history.
