0966908&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermal interface
material (TIM) is used to bond electronic devices to heat spreaders for thermal
management purposes. Desirable attributes of TIM include a low melting
temperature, necessary for device protection during bonding, good bonding
strength, and low thermal resistance. This research will develop a BiSn/carbon
nanotube composite material to meet these design
requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An electrochemical
deposition process will be developed for which uniformly-distributed carbon
nanotubes and good interfacial bonding can be achieved. The BiSn/carbon nanotube
material will be blended to meet the design requirements and to tailor the
coefficient of thermal expansion so as to promote durability of the bond.
Experimental approaches will be taken to measure the resultant properties of
BiSn/carbon nanotube composite material. Both microscopic observations and
quantum calculations will be carried out to understand the pertinent thermal
conduction mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed
bonding material and method can improve the thermal management of advanced
electronics including but not limited to integrated circuitry, power
electronics, and various laser systems. The research will be integrated into
both undergraduate and graduate courses. Graduate and undergraduate students
will be involved in the research. Existing K-12 outreach programs will be
leveraged while a new summer camp for high school teachers will be developed.
