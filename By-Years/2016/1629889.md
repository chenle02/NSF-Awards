The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the
identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full
participation and advancement of women faculty in academic institutions.
Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy,
practice, culture, and organizational climate. The ADVANCE Institutional
Transformation (ADVANCE-IT) track supports the development of innovative
organizational change strategies within an institution of higher education to
enhance gender equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Florida International University (FIU) is the
4th largest public university in the U.S. and the 2nd largest in Florida, with
over 54,000 students with over 80% from underrepresented groups. FIU's goal for
this ADVANCE-IT project is to develop institutional structures, processes, and
climate that builds an affirming and fair workplace. There are four objectives
within this project: (1) Address issues that impede the recruitment, retention,
and promotion of women STEM faculty, particularly women of color, to better
reflect the demographics of the FIU student body; (2) Educate faculty about
biases and "microclimates" (the local social climates that positively or
negatively impact the work experience of faculty within the institution); (3)
Develop strategies and tools to help move faculty from insight to action to
promote gender equity; (4) Develop the Advance Florida Network comprised of the
Florida metropolitan research universities (FIU, University of Central Florida,
and University of South Florida). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FIU project includes
two social science research studies that will add to our knowledge of equity in
STEM academics and strategies to foster equity. The first study will increase
our understanding of "microclimates" and the role of the majority faculty in
setting the climate of a department. The second study will investigate the long-
term impact on the behavior of participants in the Deep Change Program
intervention which includes training on inequity and using strategies to
intervene.
