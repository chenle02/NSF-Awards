This grant is to model the influence of the Indonesian throughflow on the life
cycle of El Nino - Southern Oscillation events. The Pacific discharges a net
flow (of still undetermined amount) of warm, low salinity water into the Indian
Ocean. Superimposed on this flow there is an annual flux and reflux of water
driven by the seasonal monsoons. Every few years, the warm water accumulating in
the Western Pacific sloshes back into the eastern equatorial region producing an
El Nino. This work will elucidate the role of the semi-permeable boundary formed
by the Indonesian Archipelago in maintaining the balance of water in and out of
the Western Equatorial Pacific.
