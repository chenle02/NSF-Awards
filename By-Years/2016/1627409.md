The proposing team is developing a linked series of 3-dimensional hydrodynamic
models for the impact, plume blowout, and plume flight/splash phases of the
Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) and 2009 Jupiter impact events. With previous NSF
support, they have focused on impact and plume development modeling. In this
project, they will model the plume blowout and waves generated in the Jovian
atmosphere. The models will test theories for the expanding rings seen by the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Each theory is sensitive to different fundamental
Jovian atmospheric parameters; successful match of a mechanism to data will
yield one or more parameter measurements. The composite model will distinguish
among the competing theories by replicating each one's essential physics and
determining whether it is consistent with the impact energy and HST images. The
proposers will adjust the viscosity in the splash model until the outer part of
the plume re-entry shock matches the expanding infrared rings; this will place a
tight constraint on Jovian eddy viscosity. The project will test the hypothesis
that the plumes had a strong density enhancement at their maximum velocity that
produced the observed infrared ring and infrared light curves. The work will
produce the first observationally-constrained 3D radiative-hydrodynamic-chemical
model of all phases of a cometary impact. The project will, in addition, support
the work and training of one graduate student, and the proposing team will
produce video animations from their simulations that will be useful for public
outreach.
