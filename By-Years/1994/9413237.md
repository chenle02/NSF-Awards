9413237 Eichele This award will support a training program for undergraduate and
graduate students that focuses on the use of invertebrate model systems to
inform investigation of vertebrate development, and vice versa. The relatively
recent and surprising discovery that a series of genes that control development
in drosophila have homologues with similar structure, function and organization
in vertebrates has set the stage for this type of approach. The 18 faculty
associated with the program have basic research programs that study the
development of a variety of vertebrates and invertebrates, including drosophila,
nematode, slime mold, mouse, chicken and ferret; the group includes a few
individuals at nearby institutions whose participation is expected to broaden
the impact of the program. The training will include existing, expanded and new
course offerings, as well as lab rotations aimed at helping students become
conversant with principles of vertebrate and invertebrate studies. An annual
two-day retreat will help build the program. Students will be encouraged to
undertake research that includes study of two organisms, one vertebrate and the
other invertebrate. This project represents a modern approach to training in one
of the most exciting areas of modern biology. ***
