A very powerful laser can be used to accelerate electrons to high energies by
interacting with a state of matter known as a plasma, an ionized gas of charged
particles. The laser achieves this by creating waves in the plasma, like a boat
pushing through water, on which the electrons can surf and be accelerated to
high energies. In this project, electrons accelerated with lasers will be used
to image and, in turn, better understand the behavior of the plasma itself. The
techniques and understanding obtained in this study will further help the
development of compact particle accelerators, which can impact everything from
cancer therapy to imaging stresses in aircraft wings.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electron beams produced by laser driven plasma waves are
especially brief in duration and tightly focused, so they may be used for
imaging of very rapidly changing phenomena. In this project, one of the most
powerful lasers in the world, the NSF funded HERCULES laser at the University of
Michigan, will be used to create electron beams to probe electromagnetic field
structures that are produced when lasers interact with solid materials. In
particular, these include surface magnetic fields, reconnecting magnetic fields
and Weibel instability filaments. An intense electron beam will also be used to
heat and produce high energy density plasmas which can be used to better
understand astrophysically relevant phenomena in a laboratory
setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
