This four year program will enrich the mathematical content and pedagogical
knowledge of a group of 24 elementary teachers in Missouri. The project includes
elements of teacher enhancement, curriculum development, teachers as
researchers, and research on teacher development. Over the course of the project
teachers will collaborate closely amongst themselves, and with experts in
mathematics education, to design, test, refine, and disseminate instructional
materials in the areas of geometry, problem solving, estimation, measurement,
and statistics. Pedagogical emphasis will be on the use of small groups and
activity-based approaches. Enhancement activities will occur both at the
University of Missouri, and in site-based meetings of the staff with the teacher
participants. Cost sharing from schools, the university, and individual
contributions amounts to 20% of the NSF award.
