This proposal requests two year support for the participation of graduate
students in the parallel circus meetings which are held twice a year. It is
anticipated that 10 graduate students will attend each meeting and that the
attendees will be chosen by a committee based on the quality of their research.
This will give many graduate students the opportunity to have their research
scrutinized by experts in the field at an early stage of their career. This in
turn could have a positive impact on research in parallel processing.
