The mathematical core of the project is the study of approximate equilibriums
for stochastic differential games with a large number of players. The first
challenge is to initiate the probabilistic approach to the mean-field game
paradigm originally advocated by Lasry and Lions. As a natural extension, the
investigator develops the theoretical and practical tools needed for the optimal
control of stochastic differential equations of McKean-Vlasov type, a problem
that has not been studied despite the importance of its applications to the
understanding of the behavior of large populations. The investigator develops a
form of the Pontryagin maximum principle appropriate for these mean-field
dynamics, derives the systems of mean-field Forward-Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations arising from specifically crafted adjoint processes, and
provides existence results for these new types of equations.

The project is motivated by the dramatic societal impacts of changes in the
production and prices of commodities observed in the last few years. The
increase in the number of institutions investing in commodities has changed the
behavior of the prices of these commodities, and their relationships among
themselves and with equity prices. Moreover, the use of market mechanisms to
curb emissions of greenhouse gases in the hope of controlling climate change has
also affected some of these markets. The investigator focuses on new theoretical
problems motivated by the energy and emissions markets, and aims at the
development of tools to help risk managers, regulators, and policy makers handle
the challenges of these new markets.
