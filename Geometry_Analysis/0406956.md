Rybnikov will study geometric and combinatorial properties of polytopes,
surfaces, graphs, and point lattices. In particular, he will address connections
between local and global convexity and convexity verification, topological
approaches to Voronoi's conjecture on parallelohedra, rigidity and flexibility
of large graphs, and perfect Delaunay polytopes in lattices and arithmetic of
inhomogeneous quadratic forms. The educational activity will include supervision
of undergraduate and Masters students, which will help them not only improve
their mathematical skills, but also get involved in active research.

Graphs, polytopes, and lattices are studied and used not only in mathematics,
but also in applications such as operations research, computational molecular
biology, cryptography, CAD, etc. Rybnikov's research will be motivated, among
other things, by problems in software reliability, computational molecular
biology, and cryptology. For example, convexity verification is an important
issue, which is addressed not only in academic papers, but also in widely used
software, such as e.g. LEDA; most of PI's research on rigidity and flexibility
of graphs is motivated by problems in protein structure analysis and prediction;
point lattices and quadratic forms in higher dimensions are important to the
computational complexity theory and cryptology.
