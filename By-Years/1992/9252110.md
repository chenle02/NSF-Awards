The goal of this project is to restructure the General Experimental Psychology
(GEP) course (60 percent non-majors; 60% female enrollment) to give all students
a more comprehensive, research-intensive view of psychology. To accomplish this
objective, five modules (each containing menus of projects that share common
equipment and protocol) are designed to permit a greater number of projects and
more individualized instruction. Students will select projects from each module
which are presented in a developmentally-oriented progression. The initial
modules offer group projects that are more prescriptive, obliging each student
to practice skills that are necessary in later, more independent projects
available in subsequent modules. Computerizing and networking the laboratory
will serve to increase the menu of available research projects and is the basis
for a complete reorganization of this course into the core of a program designed
to produce independent researchers. It will enable students to design, conduct,
analyze, write-up, and print research projects using the same equipment, often
within the time limits of class sessions. By presenting their projects during
discussion sessions, all will benefit from a diverse view of each area of
research.
