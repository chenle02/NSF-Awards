9417377 Gordon This proposal is for continued analysis of aeromagnetics data
collected in the central Indian Ocean in 1990. The investigators will extend
their analysis of magnetic anomalies 5 and 6 to additional anomalies. New
estimates of India-Africa motion will be used to improve determinations of
India-Eurasia motion and the India-Eurasia collision. ***
