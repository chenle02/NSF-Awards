The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of quantum-
engineered interband cascade (IC) structures and to develop high-performance
long-wavelength infrared photodetectors (7-10 ?√ùm). These quantum-engineered
interband-cascade infrared photodetectors (ICIPs) will operate at elevated
temperatures accessible by thermoelectric coolers (&gt;200 K) with high
detectivity D* (~109 Jones or better). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual
merit is the integration of the discrete absorber architecture within a quantum
engineered structure to form a detector based on new principles that combine the
advantages of very fast intersubband relaxation, interband tunneling for carrier
transport, and relatively slow interband transitions. With the discrete absorber
architecture, ICIPs circumvent diffusion-length limitations and are feasible for
high-speed operation without compromising their absorption quantum efficiency.
Also, doping is unnecessary in ICIPs, but can be used as a means to manipulate
carrier concentrations and transport without forming a conventional depletion
region. By eliminating this depletion region, the Shockley-Read-Hall generation
current is suppressed in ICIPs. Hence, this project will provide opportunities
to investigate new phenomena associated with the underlying physics of quantum-
engineered structures and devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are
the generation of cutting-edge knowledge in the design and understanding of
quantum-engineered semiconductor structures and devices; and the realization of
high-performance and low-noise photodetectors in the long-wavelength infrared
spectrum for many industrial, earth science, space exploration, and defense and
homeland security applications. This project will offer students unique
opportunities to pursue education, training and research in multidisciplinary
topics. This project will promote the participation of faculty and students in
statewide educational outreach activities.
