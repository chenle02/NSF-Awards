ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0221259&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oxygen transport
into sediments in natural marine environments is mediated by the turbulent
transport scales of motion of the bulk overlying solution, molecular diffusion
being orders of magnitude slower and a virtually insignificant term. The oxygen
consumption by sediments, conventionally quantified by either laboratory
measurements on recovered cores or by the artifice of an in-situ enclosure
experiment, is a key parameter in assessing organic matter decomposition rates
and also controls the oxidation of sediment reductants such as NH4+, Mn2+, Fe2+,
HS-, FeS etc produced during anaerobic respiration. Ventilation and irrigation
of sedimentary layers either by wave induced pumping or bioturbation activity
are also processes that could potentially be quantified by more reliable
measurements of sediment O2 uptake.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will extend and
explore a recently suggested approach being jointly developed by the PI together
with colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology (Bremen).
The technique involves correlating the time varying concentration of dissolved
oxygen, measured by fast response microelectrodes, in the sediment boundary
layer within a few cm of that surface with locally sensed vertical velocity
components also sampled at high frequency by acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV).
An eddy correlation approach has direct analogues with similar techniques that
are used by atmospheric scientists measuring scalar (e.g. heat, moisture
(momentum) and trace gas) fluxes in the planetary boundary layer. Theoretical
and practical considerations for the adaptation of the basic approach into
aquatic systems are discussed and will be explored at shallow coastal field
sites in Denmark (Aarhus Bay).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
