Since its introduction by Reiter in 1980 default logic has been widely studied
for its potential as a knowledge representation mechanism. Recent results
indicate that default logic not only can serve as a declarative knowledge
representation tool but also has the potential to evolve into a practical high-
level computational environment. This project develops fast systems for
automated default reasoning including implementations for parallel and
distributed environments. A systematic methodology of computing with default
logic is also under development. Usefulness of default logic as a computational
tool is demonstrated through a comprehensive experimentation with default
theories describing combinatorial optimization problems. To support this
experimentation effort, a tool to automatically generate large families of
default theories, logic programs and propositional theories is implemented. Due
to the declarative nature of default logic, this new programming tool, based on
default logic, will be easy to use, will allow for fast prototyping and will be
effective in a wide range of artificial intelligence applications. The testing
system will become a standard benchmarking tool for automated reasoning based on
default logic and related formalisms.
