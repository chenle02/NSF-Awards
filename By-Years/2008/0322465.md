0322465&lt;br/&gt;Goddard&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Pan-American Advanced
Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
of Energy (DOE), will take place in Pasadena, California on the topic of
computational nanotechnology and molecular engineering. Organized by Dr. William
Goddard of the California Institute of Technology, the institute will involve
approximately 40 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from the U.S.
and Latin America. The proposers intend to organize the PASI around the two
topics above, with special attention to computer modeling and simulation of
molecular based components and devices for applications to nanotechnology.
Topics will be linked by the use of common methodologies in computational
chemistry. Among the broader impacts, it is expected that the meeting will
contribute to future research collaborations and applications to industrial
robotics, enhanced oil recovery, and refinery downstream operations. In
addition, the organizers will develop a web site at
http://www.wag.Caltech.edu/PASI that will be of assistance in recruitment and
dissemination efforts.&lt;br/&gt;
