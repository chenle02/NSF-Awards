9321367 Nordhaus A better understanding of the impacts of global environmental
changes and of the strategies to control them has emerged as a central concern
of domestic and international economic policy over recent years. This research
will continue work that will contribute to a better understanding of the
underlying economic impacts and policies concerning global environmental
problems. The investigators have already developed an aggregate, dynamic
integrated climate and economic model to determine the efficient strategies for
controlling green house gases. A major objective of this project is to
disaggregate the model and extent it to encompass a multi-regional framework.
This will enable the authors to investigate efficient green-house-gases control
strategies at the regional level and to analyze economic losses arising from
noncooperative behavior among regions. The second objective is to develop a
better methodology for estimating the impact of global warming on U.S.
agriculture using the results of general circulation climate models. ***
