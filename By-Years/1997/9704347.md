This project is finding ways to improve I/O performance by predicting future
accesses based on those that have occurred in the past. The results can be
applied all the way from the disk controller cache to the file system to the
world wide web. It has been demonstrated that accesses to files, for example,
are not random. There are patterns that can be detected and exploited. By
exploiting these patterns, files can be prefetched so that the files will be
present in the cache when the request occurs. Preliminary results using file
system traces indicate that significant performance gains will occur. This
project will (1) develop a method for tracking I/O access patterns that is
efficient in terms of both space and time, (2) investigate the use of predictive
cache prefetching at three levels: disk controller, file system and the world-
wide web, and (3) implement a predictive cache in one or more of these areas.
