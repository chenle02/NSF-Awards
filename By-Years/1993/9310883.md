9310883 Wentworth The Department of Electrical Engineering at Auburn University
will purchase Vector Network Analysis equipment which will be dedicated to
support research in engineering. The network analysis system is capable of
precise, low noise measurement of electrical parameters at frequencies up to 50
gigahertz. The system is composed of a synthesized sweeper, a test set, and a
network analyzer. The sweeper provides a pure, stable signal over the frequency
range from 45 megahertz to 50 gigahertz. The test set connects to the device
under test, and acts as a signal separation device to resolve incident,
reflected and transmitted signals. The network analyzer contains both an
extremely sensitive receiving apparatus as well as a control and display
interface. The proposed equipment is also expected to make an impact on
education, by exposing students to the state-of-the-art in microwave testing.
