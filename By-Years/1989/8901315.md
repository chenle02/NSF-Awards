A workshop on the magnetopause and boundary layer physics is planned for the
definition phase of the GEM program. This workshop will bring together
theoreticians and experimentalists to review their knowledge of boundary layer
physics and to recommend the future direction of research. Small working groups
will be formed to define the theory campaign and its interaction with
observational research. The research topics of this workshop are important in
understanding microscale processes in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere-
mesosphere coupling on a global scale.
