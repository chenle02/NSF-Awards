The objective of this research is to build a high-level synthesis system which
maps behavioral descriptions into register-transfer level designs with
guaranteed performance. The approach is to examine subtasks of the high-level
synthesis problem using theoretical tools necessary to understand the synthesis
problem. Synthesis subtasks in the areas of scheduling and datapath allocation
are being examined. Scheduling problems being investigated include: finding good
heuristics to bound the search space so that good quality schedules for large
size designs can be found in a timely way; use an integer programming
formulation to solve the module selection problem; and develop a powerful,
integer programming based, algorithm to optimally group functions into hardware
modules. Register allocation problems include: devising a register allocation
algorithm which will minimize both the number of registers and register
transfers in the presence of loops and conditionals while accounting for
interconnect cost; formulate the module allocation problem along the same lines
as the register allocation; and investigate a good ordering of the allocation
subtasks so that interconnects play a major role in the design process.
