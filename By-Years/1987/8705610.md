Professors R. Lavine and A. Nachman plan to continue their joint work on some
of the analytical problems still standing in the way of a complete theory of
exact inversion in potential scattering. They propose to determine a general
class of potentials and corresponding scattering amplitudes for which one can
implement the Nachman-Ablowitz inversion method. The first objective of this
research is to be able to characterize among all functions of energy and
incoming and outgoing angles, those which are scattering amplitudes for local
potentials. Further objectives are to find a reconstruction procedure for noisy
data, study the stability of the inversion, and the possibility of
reconstruction from partial knowledge of the data. Extensions to analogous
problems with time-dependent scatterers will also be considered. Research of
this type is aimed at solving the long standing problem of reconstructing the
shape of an obstacle from measurements of reflected and scattered acoustic or
electromagnetic waves.
