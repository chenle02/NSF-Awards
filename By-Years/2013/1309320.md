Using energetics to understand the organization of stable mixed-species
societies

Mixed-species animal societies are ubiquitous in many communities, and range
from fluid groups to ecologically stable associations with high fidelity by
individual group members. In some societies, certain species eavesdrop on alarm
calls of other species, yet it is unclear what the overall costs and benefits
are for each species and thus the nature of species interactions. In
rainforests, mixed species bird groups take on the most extreme form of
stability known, and attract other species on a facultative basis. The
permanence of such stable animal societies sets the stage for the evolution of
complex communication in which species eavesdrop on alarm calls of other species
and where some species potentially deceive others with false alarm calls. This
project uses measurements of metabolic costs of flock members in and out of
flocks to evaluate alternative hypotheses of how alarm calling and non-alarm
calling bird species benefit from these associations.

Multi-species flocks are crucial to the high diversity of tropical bird
communities and are vulnerable to habitat degradation. This project uses an
integrative approach to ecology, incorporating physiology with behavior to
evaluate the costs and benefits that drive the organization of stable mixed-
species vertebrate societies. It will also broaden the participation of
underrepresented groups in science through the extension of inquiry-based
science initiatives with rural Peruvian students and teachers, training
opportunities for undergraduates, and the continuation of an inquiry-based field
research design course for undergraduates from Latin America.
