This project is to understand the role of dynamic pressure in controlling the
size of the magnetosphere and disturbances in the magnetosphere and its role
relative to that of the geomagnetic field. Three specific topics will be
persued. First, the flux content and shape of the geomagnetic tail. Second, the
relationship between bursty flows, seen in the magnetotail and classified by
Vassilis Angelopoulos, with ground based activity in the auroral oval. Third,
the quantification of geomagnetic activity as exemplified in the substorm wedge.
