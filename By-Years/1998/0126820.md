Lay Abstract of Proposed Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:
Scott Kitchener Sakaluk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Title: Cryptic sexual
conflict in gift-giving insects: chasing the "chase-
away"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional models for the coevolution of
exaggerated male sexual ornaments and female mating preferences posit that
females derive material benefits or indirect genetic benefits by preferentially
mating with the most conspicuous males. The chase-away sexual selection model,
however, suggests that elaborate male sexual displays can arise because they
exploit pre-existing biases in females' sensory systems, inducing females to
mate in a sub-optimal manner. An essential element of this hypothesis is that
such manipulation should quickly lead to female resistance or decreased
attraction to male display traits. Although anecdotal evidence in certain taxa
appears to provide support for the evolution of female resistance, the
hypothesis has not been directly tested. Nuptial food gifts, an integral feature
of the mating systems of a wide variety of insects, may be a frequent conduit by
which males attempt to influence the mating behavior of females against females'
own reproductive interests. Recent work in my laboratory suggests that the food
gifts offered by male decorated crickets contain substances that at one time
inhibited the sexual receptivity of females, but that females have evolved
resistance to these substances. The proposed research seeks to establish the
receptivity-inhibiting properties of these food gifts by offering them to
females of several non-gift-giving species, and measuring their effect on female
fitness. These studies may lead to the identification of male-derived hormonal
substances that inhibit female mating behavior, which ultimately could furnish a
safe, but effective means of biological control of insect pest
species.&lt;br/&gt;
