Accurate calculations for a number of heavy elements in various stages of
ionization considering collisional excitation, radiative transitions,
photoionization and recombination will be performed using the R-matrix method.
The focus will be primarily on the Iron period elements in order to resolve the
apparent overabundance of Ni relative to Iron in astronomical objects.
Relativistic effects heretofore not considered will be incorporated into the
calculations, an atomic database constructed and some astrophysical modelling
performed. Close collaboration with the Opacity project is intended. The
calculations will be performed on the Cray YMP at Ohio State at no cost to the
NSF.
