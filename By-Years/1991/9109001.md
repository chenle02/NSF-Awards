A series of projects involving novel and topical materials including the new
high temperature superconductors, heavy Fermion materials (including the exotic
heavy fermion superconductors), and the transition metals and their compounds is
proposed. Specifically, a new speculative model proposed to explain the
anomalous superconductivity which occurs in the high temperature superconductors
and some heavy fermion materials and the effect of magnetic/kondo impurities on
disorder-induced weak localization will be parameterized, tested, and used to
calculate the phase diagrams of transition metals from first principles. The
basic problem is to accurately calculate various physical properties of these
materials. However, the electronic correlations in these materials make this
difficult. To overcome these problems novel combinations of established
techniques like quantum Monte Carlo, the local density approximation, and self-
consistent perturbation theories, as well as generating new techniques will be
used. These techniques are computationally intense, and implementation is only
now possible due to recent advances in computer technology.
