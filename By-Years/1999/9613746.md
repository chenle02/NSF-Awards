9613746 Chang Under this award, Drs. Chang and Chen will carry out an
observational study of the spatial and temporal variability of the East Asian
monsoon, focusing on its interannual-scale interactions with the South Asian
monsoon and the relationship to the tropical biennial oscillation. The principal
approach will be to use statistical methods, including composite and principal
component techniques and a technique developed by the principal investigators
called multiple-set canonical correlation analysis, to analyze long-term data
sets (reanalysis products, climate rainfall data, and out-going longwave
radiation data sets, among others). The monsoon systems will be described in
terms of their rainfall characteristics as well as their wind and pressure
patterns. The Asian monsoon system(s) is a major signal in the general
circulation and the global climate. Better understanding of its role in the
global system is essential to improving both weather and climate prediction,
even in remote regions such as over the United States. The Large-scale Dynamic
Meteorology and Climate Dynamics Programs will share in the support of this
project. ***
