*** 9761203 Hu Nanomaterials Research Corp. will develop a novel varistor, from
nanostructured ferroelectric materials. The innovation is based on a unique
varistor behaviour observed in ultrafine-grained ferroelectric thin films. These
varistors are expected to yield a new range of electronic applications based on
the function of current regulation. ***
