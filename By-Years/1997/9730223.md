The central role of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) in the ocean carbon cycle
and the influence of DOM on numerous physical, chemical, and biological
processes are widely recognized, but fundamental questions about the sources,
reactivity, and cycling of DOM remain to be answered. Many of the answers to
these questions lie hidden within the chemical structures of DOM, but
characterization of DOM is challenging because concentrations are low and salts
are abundant in seawater. Novel approaches to the isolation and chemical
characterization of DOM are beginning transformations of this major carbon
reservoir. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration has emerged as a powerful approach
for the isolation of different size classes of marine organic matter. Recent
efforts in the characterization of ultrafiltered material have provided a wealth
of new information about marine DOM. Over the next three years research will
focus on the characterization of seawater DOM and build upon major findings of
the past three years of research on the characterization of ultrafiltered DOM.
The major objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to investigate
relationships among size, composition, and microbial reactivity of marine
organic matter, and 2) to characterize the distribution and cycling of
terrigenous DOM in the ocean.
