9415434 Metzger This award to the National Academy of Sciences will provide
partial support for two pilot workshops in California and Colorado,
respectively, directed at widening the dialog for the future environment of the
Physical and Mathematical Sciences. The meetings will provide a forum for
researchers from universities, industry and national laboratories and government
officials to discuss the impact of societal change on the mathematical and
physical sciences communities. About forty regional participants will
participate in the two day meetings. A summary report will be prepared
summarizing conclusions and recommendations, including whether such meetings are
of value and should be pursued. Town Hall meetings of this type serve a useful
purpose in opening lines of communication between government, industry and
university scientists and policy makers. A better apppreciation of the views of
each is anticipated, ultimately leading to a community better able to function
in a changing environment.
