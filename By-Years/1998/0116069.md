0116069&lt;br/&gt;Sanudo-Wilhelmy&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation
award to State University of New York at Stony Brook will provide support for
acquisition of a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
with laser ablation and chromatography systems for a multi-disciplinary group of
researchers in several academic departments and the Marine Sciences Research
Center. Ongoing research programs can take immediate advantage of the new
instrumentation, and it is expected to significantly enhance research
capabilities for faculty and students. SUNY Stony Brook will contribute cost-
sharing of 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
