With developments in modern information technology, massive datasets with
complicated structures have been collected in many scientific fields such as
astronomy, biology, climatology, etc. In this project, the investigator plans to
explore the connections between the data sampling distribution and spectrum of
the distribution dependent operators and to develop a theoretical foundation for
analyzing commonly used spectral techniques based on pairwise
distance/dissimilarity measures. Based on the theoretical analysis, a new class
of statistical inference tools will be proposed for robust estimation, dimension
reduction, clustering and data summarization. Computationally effective
algorithms will be designed and their software implementations will be
disseminated. Besides theoretical development in statistical methodology, the
proposed inference tools will be applied to climate change studies using
satellite data and climate model outputs.

The proposed research is motivated by real world scientific problems that
require statistical inference from massive datasets. The proposed method is
designed to extract useful information and knowledge from those massive datasets
with complicated structures. The novel algorithms to be developed in this
project have the potential to not only help geoscientists and climate modelers
in analyzing climate records and calibrating climate models, but also provide
statistical tools for scientific investigations for researchers in a wide
spectrum of disciplines.
