INTERDISCIPLINARY (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Physics and Chemistry Education
Technology (PhET) Project is developing an extensive suite of online, highly-
interactive simulations, with supporting materials and activities for improving
both the teaching and learning of physics and chemistry. There are currently
over 70 simulations and over 250 associated activities available for use from
the PhET website (http://phet.colorado.edu). These web-based resources are
impacting large number of students. Per year, there are currently over 4 million
PhET simulations run online and thousands of full website downloads for offline
use of the simulations. The goal is that this widespread use of PhET's research-
based tools and resources will improve the education of students in physics and
chemistry at colleges and high schools throughout the U.S. and around the world.
This PhET project combines a unique set of features. First, the simulation
designs and goals are based on educational research. Second, using a team of
professional programmers, disciplinary experts, and education research
specialists enables the development of simulations involving technically-
sophisticated software, graphics, and interfaces that are highly effective.
Third, the simulations embody the predictive visual models of expert scientists,
allowing many interesting advanced concepts to become widely accessible and
revealing their relevance to the real world. And finally, the project is
actively involved in research to better understand how the design and use of
simulations impacts their effectiveness - e.g. investigating questions such as
"How can these new technologies promote student understanding of complex
scientific phenomena?" and "What factors inhibit or enhance their use and
effectiveness?".
