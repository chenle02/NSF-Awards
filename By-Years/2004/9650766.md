This institution, a small 4-year, historically Black institution, is enhancing
its biology laboratories. Although the State of Missouri approved an expanded
mission and additional degree programs in 1993, years of underfunding have left
this college lacking the equipment necessary for effective undergraduate
teaching. This is particularly true of the laboratory experience. The addition
of an approved biology specialization area in the new secondary education
program has meant that, while enrollment in upper-level biology laboratory
courses has increased, the college has been unable to provide students with the
hands-on laboratory experiences essential to preservice teachers. The conceptual
foundation and thorough understanding gained through advanced laboratory
experiments greatly enhances the entering teachers' ability to teach secondary-
school science. The use of current technology in molecular biology and
biotechnology, including differential centrifugation, ultraviolet
spectrophotometric DNA analysis, and gel electrophoresis is a necessary
practice, not a luxury. The preservice teacher has a particularly important role
in the education of underrepresented groups. With a student enrollment that is
75 percent African American, this college has a long record of service to the
nontraditional, first-generation college student from an economically
disadvantaged background. Most participants are minority women themselves and,
upon graduation, are likely to teach in predominantly minority, urban schools,
mainly in the City of St. Louis. The long-range impact may be that a new
generation of well-prepared teachers are making their own students ready for the
challenges of the 21st century.
