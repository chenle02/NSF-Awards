Development of hypersonic aircraft requires a high degree of system
integration. Design tools are needed that can provide rapid, accurate
calculations of complex fluid flow patterns. Existing methods, while reasonably
accurate, are much too efficient design. This project addresses that need. The
application of neural networks will be used to model coolant flow patterns.
First, the ability of neural networks to model coolant flow will be demonstrated
at the component level. A single heat exchanger component will be modeled by a
neural network and trained using data generated by the existing flow equations.
Then multiple components in series within a flow leg will be modeled using a
series of neural networks. Next these legs will be joined in parallel to form a
heat exchanger panel. Finally, various combinations of panels in series and
parallel will be molded using hierarchical neural networks. A combination of
neural network software and computational hardware will be proposed for a
potential Phase II effort in which this computational capability will be made
user friendly and accessible to design engineers with minimal neural network
background.
