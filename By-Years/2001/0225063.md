Two years of support are being requested if at all possible. The reason for this
is &lt;br/&gt;because it is necessary to complete several key steps before
submission as a regular &lt;br/&gt;proposal. The first summer is to prepare
papers for presentation and/or appearance in &lt;br/&gt;conferences and/or
journals. During the ensuing academic year, the intellectual content
&lt;br/&gt;of this potentially controversial material will be circulated for
comment, both publicly in &lt;br/&gt;talks and privately among colleagues. Based
on the feedback received, the ideas put forth &lt;br/&gt;will be modified and
corrected. Only then does it make sense to use the following &lt;br/&gt;summer
to involve an undergraduate student in implementing the salient features of the
&lt;br/&gt;proposed work for both a greater depth of understanding and
demonstration purposes. &lt;br/&gt; By this point in time, that would mean there
should be preliminary results &lt;br/&gt;appearing in print, with supporting
documentation on the web explaining this material. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, more
capable assistive computing technology will be available by then (to
&lt;br/&gt;help me overcome my hand disability), so that I might be able to more
actively &lt;br/&gt;participate in the implementation details of that work. When
all of this is readily in place, &lt;br/&gt;then it will be possible to submit a
competitive regular proposal.
