New seafloor is created at a global network of mid-ocean ridges, where seawater
circulating through the newly-formed crust causes hydrothermal alteration. Most
of the world?s copper deposits formed in this way; indeed copper mined from
hydrothermal deposits on the island of Cyprus fueled the advancement of western
civilization. Hence, understanding hydrothermal circulation at mid-ocean ridges
has fundamental scientific importance. Fluid flow is controlled principally by
permeability, a property that is difficult to measure. However, it has been
observed that, because they affect fluid pressures in the sea floor, tides
trigger small earthquakes. It can be reasonably argued that the relationship
between tides and the occurrence of these earthquakes depends on the
permeability. This project is an innovative attempt to infer the permeability of
new seafloor from tides and earthquake data from the East Pacific Rise. Funding
this effort will improve our understanding of the working of the Earth, and
support a promising young investigator.
