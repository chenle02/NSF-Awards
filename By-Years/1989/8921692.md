There are more than 30,000 known species of spiders in the world, and they are
important constituents of terrestrial communities and food chains. Dr. Norman
Platnick proposes compilation and publication of "Advances in Spider Taxonomy",
in which taxonomic names, their status, species descriptions and illustrations
will be presented. This volume will update and supplement earlier catalogs of
spider biodiversity. The proposed comprehensive catalog of spider taxonomic
names has implications for a wide audience. Access to complete and accurate
sources of information concerning spiders is critical to research in many areas
of ecology, biogeography, behavioral studies, and evolutionary biology. This
catalog will also expedite construction of a computer database of spider
taxonomy.
