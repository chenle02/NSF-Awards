This two-year college emphasizes laboratory based learning and use of high
technology equipment. This project upgrades their ability to expose students to
the principles of biology and the use of laboratory data to explore these
principles. Through the acquisition of a fluorescent microscope with phase
contrast options, a high resolution video camera, a video pointer, two TV
monitors and a VCR, they can produce edited videotapes of specimens and ongoing
processes that could otherwise be seen by a limited number of students. The
equipment allows increased use of fluorescent antibody procedures and increased
viewing of microscopic events by students. They can also use the videotapes in a
number of additional courses, and make them available to other campuses. The
institution is contributing 102% of the NSF award.
