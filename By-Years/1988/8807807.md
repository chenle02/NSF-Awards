This project involves a micro-empirical study of job changes and unemployment
and the effects of taxes on labor supply. Existing theories cannot adequately
explain the operation of labor markets over the business cycle, nor the impact
of tax policy on aggregate employment. The first part of this study involves the
development of a detailed model of the labor market, based on empirical findings
concerning the role of wage differentials. This model will be used to explain
the changes in worker quit rates and job turnover rates over the business cycle.
The second part of the study will analyze the effects of the income tax on wages
and unemployment. A simple structural model of the U.S. economy will be
constructed and used to analyze the impact of tax changes. The analysis of tax
changes is important because the macro economic response to a tax increase may
be a significant increase in unemployment, inflation, or both. This analysis is
particularly timely because of the budget deficit reductions mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation which could result in significant tax
increases. The work focusing on modeling the labor market should provide
important new insights into the dynamics of unemployment and job turnover over
the business cycle.
