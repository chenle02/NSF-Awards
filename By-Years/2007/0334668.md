The investigators will use a new technique to evaluate the global-scale
distribution of Poynting flux directly from the cross product of the electric
field, E, with the magnetic perturbation intensity, b. The principal means by
which energy is transported from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere is by
Poynting flux and particle precipitation in the high latitude polar regions.
Although the Poynting flux accounts for more energy, it is the least well
characterized. Except for long-term statistical studies, evaluations of the
global distribution of electromagnetic energy deposition in the high latitude
ionosphere depend on statistical models of ionospheric conductivity. The
magnetic perturbations in this study are derived from Iridium engineering
magnetometer data and the electric field is derived from coherent ionospheric
scatter radars of the SuperDARN system. By this method, the investigators will
evaluate the global scale Poynting flux directly on time scales of about one
hour with a resolution of 2 in latitude and two hours in longitude. The
overarching scientific goal of this work is to characterize the role of high
latitude Poynting flux in large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Results
to date indicate that the regions of Poynting flux vary dramatically from case
to case, possibly reflecting the influence of imposed solar wind conditions. The
most intense Poynting flux is often concentrated in zones at auroral latitudes.
In addition, the net Poynting flux over the polar cap accounts for roughly one
third of the total. These results pose several issues that will be addressed. To
accomplish this, the investigators will (1) Determine the partitioning of energy
flux between electromagnetic and particle energy flux; (2) Identify
thermospheric responses to regions of intense Poynting flux; (3) Compare the
global distributions of Poynting flux with in-situ satellite determinations and
incoherent scatter radar results; and (4) Investigate the influence of the
neutral wind dynamo. The study will involve collaborative studies with other
researchers. Comparison with results on IT dynamics obtained using other assets,
particularly incoherent scatter radars is an integral component of the research.
Another important element is the inter-comparison of products derived with the
Iridium/SuperDARN data with other techniques including in-situ estimates of
Poynting flux from DMSP satellites and smaller scale estimates of thermospheric
properties and thermosphere/ionosphere response from other resources including
incoherent scatter radars.
