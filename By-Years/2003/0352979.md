0352979/Jacoby, WIYN Consortium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a prelude to a very
large 32Kx32K optical imager, an 8Kx8K camera will be built to demonstrate
several advanced concepts in CCD technology that: double detector yield by using
a subarray structure that isolates bad regions of large detectors; reduce read-
out time by factors of 10 - 20; enable high-speed photometry; and improve
delivered image quality over an arbitrarily large field of view by performing
electronic "tip/tilt" corrections. The instrument will have wide use through the
Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-National Optical Astronomy Observatory consortium, and
will help bring patented Orthogonal Transfer technology to commercial markets.
