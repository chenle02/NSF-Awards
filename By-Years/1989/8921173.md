We know that spiral density waves are not responsible for triggering star
formation in irregular galaxies, but a physical model appropriate to these
galaxies does not yet exist. This project will explore the factors affecting the
cloud/star formation process in Magellanic and amorphous irregular galaxies by
probing the distribution of atomic and molecular gas and its relationship to the
global and local star formation activity.
