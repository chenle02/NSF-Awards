The "Engineering is Elementary: Engineering and Technology Lessons for Children"
project is developing lessons to engage students in grades 1-5 in engineering
activities integrated with their science lessons. The project addresses the need
to develop a broad understanding of what engineers do and the uses and
implications of the technologies they create. At the heart of engineering is an
understanding of the engineering design process -- a flexible method of solving
problems that is parallel to the inquiry process in science.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to increase the level of
technological literacy of the students and to increase the understanding of
technology and engineering of elementary teachers in order to enable them to
teach these subjects to their students. The project is developing 16 units, each
of which includes an illustrated storybook, teacher background materials,
teachers guide, assessment tools, student duplication masters, quick cards,
references and resources. The instructional effort is strengthened by the
project website, posters, teacher professional development materials and
overviews for administrators and other stakeholders. By creating and testing
lessons that are closely integrated with elementary science topics and linked to
popular and effective science programs, the project strengthens the science
program while introducing key engineering concepts and fostering positive
attitudes toward engineering in ways that include girls and boys from a wide
variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The project seeks to expand
children's images of engineering and to broaden their interests and expectations
for the future.&lt;br/&gt;
