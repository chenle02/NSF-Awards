Vision and robotics equipment will be provided for researchers at the University
of Wyoming for research in the Department of Computer Science. This equipment is
provided under the Instrumentation Grants for Research in Computer and
Information Science and Engineering program. The research for which the
equipment is to be used will be in the areas of design principles for computer
vision based spatial reasoning in structured environments, Medical image
processing for analyzing drug induced defects in embryos, image processing
methods for determining velocity fields for fluid flow and for modeling of
electron distribution in the plasma of laser-induced breakdown of gases for hi-
voltage switching, and the decomposition of two and three-dimensional patterns
using computational geometry methods.
