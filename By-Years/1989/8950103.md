Two one week workshops are being held for undergraduate mathematics faculty to
use and develop computer software with symbolic representation of mathematical
concepts in core mathematics courses. The first workshop using ISETL (public
domain software) is aimed at the typical mathematician who would like to
incorporate the use of computer software in teaching discrete mathematics. It is
also providing the participant the opportunity to develop course material useful
in abstract algebra, discrete structures, calculus, combinatorics, and number
theory. The second workshop CAL is enabling faculty to create "interactive
mathematical lessons" which can be used by students to explore mathematical
ideas. The scripts direct student exploration of topics ranging from high school
algebra to linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and differential equations.
The participant's institutions are contributing the costs of their travel to the
workshop.
