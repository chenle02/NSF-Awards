The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program at the
National Science Foundation supports the research of Professor Alexander Li and
his group at Washington State University to develop new molecular tools for
measuring forces between molecules. This research investigates the use of
folded, yet stretchable oligomers/polymers as force sensors for revealing
molecular forces that play important roles in biological systems.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of a molecular force sensor that can sense
force applied over a defined distance (in nanometer scale) would provide a
useful tool for studying chemical and biological systems and would advance our
knowledge of structure and dynamics of self-assembled systems. This project
provides interdisciplinary research training to students. Science workshops will
be offered to arouse the interest of middle and high school students (including
students from socio-economically disadvantaged families) in science.
