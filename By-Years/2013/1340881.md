This grant supports travel for students to attend the Empirical Software
Engineering International Week, which will take place in Baltimore in October
2013. The week includes a number of co-located conferences that are the main
meetings for the international community doing empirical research in the field
of Software Engineering. More information can be found at
http://umbc.edu/eseiw2013/. Empirical Software Engineering has the potential to
be an increasingly productive and transformative part of the Software
Engineering research landscape, because the quantity of usable/analyzable data
has increased dramatically just over the last few years. Repositories and
community development sites are become more common and larger. Tools for mining
and analyzing Software Engineering data are appearing and accelerating the pace
of research. NSF's support of student travel will increase intellectual advances
in the field and create broader impacts including improvements in software
engineering and global experiences for the future workforce.
