This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).

This award supports the purchase of a new laser to replace the current laser in
the lidar at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. The installation of the new laser will
improve instrument reliability and data quality of an observing system that has
been operating as part of the Arctic Observing Network since July 2005. The
"Intellectual Merit" of this project is that the Eureka lidar data are providing
much needed information on the occurrence and microphysics of arctic clouds and
aerosols. Such data are needed to reduce uncertainty in computer model
representation of clouds and to improve predictions of the rate of Arctic
warming. The "Broader Impacts" of this project include the availability of the
data via an innovative Web site (http://lidar.ssec.wisc.edu/cgi-
bin/processeddata/retrievedata.cgi?site=3) where customized data products can be
ordered. In addition, 3-minute averages of backscatter cross-section and
depolarization will be archived for the long-term at the Cooperative Arctic Data
and Information Service (CADIS). The lidar is co-located with a suite of other
atmospheric sounding instruments that are contributing to IASOA (International
Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere). Continued acquisition of the lidar
data will be a valuable contribution to the Observing Change component of SEARCH
(Study of Arctic Environmental Change).
