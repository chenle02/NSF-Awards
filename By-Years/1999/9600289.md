9600289 Kirkpatrick The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research
abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions
abroad. This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral research visit
by Dr. R. Craig Kirkpatrick to work with Professor Ren Renmei at Beijing
University. Dr. Kirkpatrick and Dr. Renmei will investigate changes in the group
size of a Sichuan snub-nosed monkey, (Rhinopithecus roxellana), in relation to
seasonal use of food resources. They will document these changes by systematic,
direct observation. Data from vegetation transects, phenology plots, and
nutritional assays will be combined to estimate food patch size and quality
across food species. These data will provide direct tests of hypotheses derived
from ecological theory that relates group size to food characters. An advantage
of this study is that the same animals will be used in different environments,
with seasonal change providing a natural experiment. ***
