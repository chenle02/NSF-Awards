The detailed examination of the electrical characteristics exhibited by
semiconductor (or solid-state) devices, and the extraction of basic "inside-the-
device" information from those characteristics, are referred to as semiconductor
measurements. Equipment in the undergraduate laboratory where semiconductor
measurements are performed is enhanced and the associated experiments revised.
Specifically, modern test equipment is to be acquired to perform current-
voltage, capacitance-voltage, transient response, low- temperature, and a
limited number of advanced characterization measurements. The instrumentation is
to be grouped so as to form permanent stations of a functional nature. In this
way the laboratory will simultaneously provide ready equipment access for
interrogating devices (fabricated by students in a separate teaching laboratory)
and for performing undergraduate student projects.
