The Purdue University plant genetics faculty proposes to establish an
interdepartmental graduate training program. This proposal has a currently
interactive core staff of 18 faculty representing classical, biochemical,
physiological, and molecular genetics and genetic engineering. The proposed NSF
Training Grant Program in Plant Genetics will emphasize graduate training in
fundamental concepts of modern genetics, and the integrated application of
genetics across the range of steps from the gene to the whole organism. The
participants in the program have productive genetic research programs directed
toward basic biological questions that are unique to and /or particularly
tractable in plant systems; plant disease resistance, plant growth and
development, plant genome analysis, and plant genetic engineering. Future
graduates of the proposed program will possess not only a broad range of
molecular skills, but will also be thoroughly indoctrinated in questions in the
major areas of plant biology.
