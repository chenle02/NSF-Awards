Hauschildt, Peter AST-9720704 In a collaborative effort, Dr. Hauschildt of the
University of Georgia and Dr. Baron of the Univesity of Oklahoma will continue
their work of modeling the transport of radiation through a variety of
astrophysical plasmas, with particular attention to supernovae. Their work
focuses on applying the results of their modeling to supernovae and comparing
theoretical predictions with observed data, as well as making continued
improvements to their radiative transport code. Among the goals of their
analysis are improving understanding of the connection between specific classes
of supernovae and stellar evolution models of the progenitor star, and studying
the effects of stellar parameters, such as the metallicity of the progenitor, on
the observed spectrum and light curve and the use of all types of supernovae as
distance indicators.
