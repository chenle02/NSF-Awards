Dr. Alan Stone, Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering, Johns
Hopkins University, is supported through the Chemistry Division and through the
Earth Sciences Division by the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry
program to support young scientist participation in the 1996 Environmental
Sciences Water Gordon Conference entitled `Interaction of Chemical and
Biological Processes` on June 23-28, 1996 in New Hampton, New Hampshire. The
objective of this conference is to highlight important new findings stemming
from collaborative efforts among chemists, biologists, physical scientists, and
engineers collaborating on studies of environmental processes involving nutrient
uptake and elemental cycling, pollutant effects and transformations, and
biochemical and physiological responses to environmental change. This conference
will provide an opportunity for young scientists working in an important area of
environmental science to share their results and experiences in the field. It is
a multidisciplinary conference with participants from a broad range of
scientific and engineering disciplines, and it will likely foster new
collaborations and the development of integrated, multidisciplinary approaches
to critical environmental issues.
