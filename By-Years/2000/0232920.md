This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes a
powerful new approach to GIS data-mining for large image databases. The current
inefficiencies in extracting information from these databases are primarily
caused by the limited ability to extract baseline geographic information (such
as road networks) from images. The proposed system addresses this need by
combining feature extraction efficiencies with the ability to refine queries
efficiently. The feature extraction system reduces the labor required for
extracting information from imagery and the query refinement system incorporates
user-driven and data-driven strategies to focus on interesting and relevant
discoveries. The proposed system will also provide solutions for multi-media
applications containing imagery, web-based applications, medical image
repositories, and other applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geo-spatial
information technology is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of scientific research,
environmental modeling, local government planning, and federal government
security programs. The proposed system also has commercial potential for other
application domains such as medical imaging.&lt;br/&gt;
