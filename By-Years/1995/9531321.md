9531321 Wiedenbeck, Susan University of Nebraska-Lincoln Research Experiences
for Undergraduates: Research in Human-Computer Interaction and Multimedia
Interface Design This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will
support ten students per year in programs carried out during the Summers, for
three years. Students will be recruited from institutions across the nation,
particularly from predominantly undergraduate institutions and with a maximum of
three students per year from the University of Nebraska. The research topics
will be drawn from the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) and multimedia
interface design. The program will involve seminars, research projects, and
academic year follow-up. The central activity will be the students' research
projects during which they will conceptualize a specific problem within HCI,
design a study to address the problem, instrument the study and run pilot tests.
During the follow-up academic year, students will be encouraged to continue with
data collection and analysis, with the help of the PI. Students are expected to
leave the REU project with an understanding of the research process and the job
of a researcher, an appreciation of creativity in science, and a sense of the
excitement of scientific discovery.
