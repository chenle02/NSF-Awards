Drs. Joseph Scott and Sharon Broadwater of the College of William and Mary are
studying the details of cell division in groups of red algae (Rhodophyta) using
scanning and transmisson electron microscopy. The number, kinds, and
orientations of subcellular structures combine to create patterns of cell
division that appear to be characteristic for major groups of red algae at the
ordinal or subclass taxonomic level. Research is continuing on cell division
patterns in groups of Corallinales and Batrachospermales, which at present are
poorly known. The investigators are also conducting a search in red algae for
the recently described protein centrin, which is a contractile protein thought
to be present in all eukaryotic cells and involved in chromosome movement. In
addition, the enigmatic unicellular organism Glaucosphaera vacuolata is being
studied through electron microscopy and molecular and immunocytochemical
methods. One of the unique characters of Rhodophyta, alone among the world's
algae, is the lack of a flagellar apparatus, yet Drs. Scott and Broadwater have
preliminary data indicating that G. vacuolata possesses a non-emergent flagellum
located within a red-algal cytoplasm. Molecular and immunocytochemical tests are
being made with the help of collaborators, to confirm the presence of centrin
and of a reduced flagellum. The results will provide new insights into
phylogenetic relationships within the red algae and with other groups of
primitive organisms.
