The P.I. proposes to initiate a systematic study of chemical scavenging
processes, with a focus on the relationship between 231Pa/230Th and 10Be/230Th
ratios found in sediments and the composition and flux of particles settling
through the overlying water column. They will take advantage of the sampling
opportunity provided by the US.JGOFS Equatorial Pacific process study to derive
empirical relationships between the nuclide ratios and the flux and composition
of particulate matter. These relationships will then be applied to nuclide
ratios measured in the sediments deposited at these sites from the present
through the last glacial maximum, and possibly earlier. The objective is to
evaluate changes in particle flux (and thus, indirectly, primary production)
that have accompanied, or responded to, past changes in climate.
