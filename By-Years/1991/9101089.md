The project is concerned with three related objectives: Objective 1. Develop
data structures and efficient algorithms for the exact symbolic computation of
approximate solutions of differential equations. Objective 2. Apply these
algorithms to develop mixed symbolic- numeric integration schemes to integrate
trajectories of nonlinear systems. Objective 3. Apply these algorithms and
schemes to problems in bifurcation theory, normal forms, and nonlinear
realization theory. In the long term, new algorithms in this area will impact
technology by leading to the design of better robots, aircraft and satellites.
