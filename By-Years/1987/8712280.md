The Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) will be an NSF sponsored Research
Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site for the summer of 1987. The WIRO
summer program offers undergraduate students a research opportunity in
observational astrophysics projects, image processing and instrumentation. The
principal goals of the program are: first, to introduce the undergraduate to a
fulfilling experience in infrared astrophysics research, including an
introduction to photometric and spectral data analysis, image processing, and
observational techniques; second, to expose the undergraduate to several of the
diverse research fields in modern astrophysics; third, to offer an opportunity
to work directly with active professionals; and fourth, to relate the importance
of this research experience to the student's formal education. Participants will
come from colleges and universities throughout the nation. A concurrent academic
course will help the students place this experience in a wider academic context
and provide a general direction of the program. The Wyoming REU program is a
highly regarded component of the NSF's effort to directly involve undergraduates
at the nation's colleges and universities with professional basic research in
science and engineering.
