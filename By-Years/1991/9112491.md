This collaborative research (with Janda 9112357) investigates the dynamics of
political party change. It examines the mechanisms that produce changes in
goals, issue positions, activities, and organization of parties. Time-series
data will be collected on 19 political parties in four countries for the period
1950-1990. These data will be used both to assess the nature and extent of party
change and to explain those changes in terms of environmental changes, the
parties' performance in elections and in government, and leadership decisions.
Although focused on individual parties, this research also will be important for
understanding change in party systems. An understanding of individual parties is
necessary to understand changes in larger systems. Moreover, both types of
change are central theoretically to understanding the dynamic of government.
When completed this data intensive research will increase our understanding of
the dynamics of political party change. Moreover, the data collected will be of
lasting value to other scholars interested in political parties.
