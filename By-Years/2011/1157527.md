This RAPID project will study storm surge sediments deposited by Hurricane Irene
in coastal marshes along the east coast of the United States. Questions to be
addressed by the study are:&lt;br/&gt;1. What is the magnitude and regional
distribution of Hurricane Irene storm surge sedimentation?&lt;br/&gt;2. How does
the orientation of the hurricane track in relation to the coastline affect storm
surge&lt;br/&gt;sedimentation?&lt;br/&gt;3. What is the contribution of
Hurricane Irene to long-term sedimentation in coastal marshes?&lt;br/&gt;4. Are
the storm surge deposits preserved in marshes?&lt;br/&gt;Methods to be used
include field surveys of the thickness, inland penetration, volume, mass,
spatial distribution and structures of Hurricane Irene?s storm surge deposit. In
addition, samples will be collected to determine background sedimentation rates
against which to compare the hurricane sedimentation and thus its overall role
in coastal marsh evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve
our understanding of how hurricanes contribute to the formation of coastal
marshes. The relative importance of such high-magnitude events in the overall
evolution of these coastal landscape features remains the subject of debate. The
project will also contribute to the field of paleotempestology, which provides
assessments of the recurrence interval of hurricane strikes and associated
hurricane risk. By providing information on the characteristics of a fresh
hurricane deposit, the project will help constrain interpretations of past
events that are preserved in the geologic record.
