A new hollow cylinder apparatus for laboratory testing of rock joints will be
used to measure the water pressure in the joints during the undrained testing of
saturated rock joints. The testing program will contribute to the overall
understanding of rock discontinuity behavior, particularly the role of joint
water pressure and the interaction between the hydraulic properties of the joint
and the mechanical response. Since the stability of rock excavations and
underground structures is largely dependent upon the properties of the rock
joints, applications of this research include tunnels, power plants,
subterranean storage facilities, and waste depositories.
