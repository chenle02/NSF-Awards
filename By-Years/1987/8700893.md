This research uses field and laboratory studies to evaluate the following
hypotheses concerning the evolution and maintenance of satellite behavior in an
anuran population: (1) calling and satellite behavior are alternatives that
yield equal fitnesses; (2) an inability to acquire suitable calling sites forces
adoption of satellite behavior; (3) individuals who are less preferred as
callers are often more successful as satellites; (4) satellite behavior is a
tactic adopted when energy reserves are too low to support sustained calling;
and (5) satellite behavior is a size or age specific tactic adopted to conserve
energy for higher growth rates. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and
research will focus on how a complex suite of environmental, social, and
physiological variable interact. The proposed research will contribute
significantly to our understanding of intraspecific behavioral variation.
Alternative behaviors have recently received a great deal of theoretical
interest, yet few studies have gathered the data requisite for a thorough
understanding of the theory. The proposed research will allow a rigorous and
simultaneous evaluation of the major hypotheses in this field.
