This is a five-day conference to be held June 2-6, 1988 at the University of
Utah. The purpose is to discuss the application of some differential geometric
and analytic methods to the study of discrete groups. The main theme will be
mappings between locally symmetric spaces. The conference is under the direction
of Domingo Toledo at the University of Utah. While there have been in recent
years many significant developments in this field, there has been no meeting
devoted to it. The timing is now ripe for a meeting bringing together experts
from the various areas involved.
