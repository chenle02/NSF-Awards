This Engineering Faculty Internship focuses on tolerance inspection of aluminum
extrusions used in the space-frames of a new automobile body structure. The
objectives of the project are (1) to develop procedures and algorithms for
determination of geometric errors in dimensions and forms of the extrusions and
(2) to characterize the manufacturing process variation in order to determine
the process capability. The result of this collaborative project is expected to
significantly improve the capability of quality assurance for the new automobile
structure technology. A graduate student is also involved in the project.
