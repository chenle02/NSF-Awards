North America has the largest archaeomagnetic directional data set in the
world, about 5,000 results, but the exact number is difficult to estimate
because the data have been published in a wide variety of (sometimes obscure)
publications. In this project, the North American archaeomagnetic directional
and paleointensity data will be collated, and incorporated into a modern,
microcomputer-based, relational data base management system. This database will
be made available to investigators in paleomagnetism, archaeomagnetism,
geomagnetism, and archaeology.
