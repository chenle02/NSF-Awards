9411702 Schemske Invasions of exotic plant species represent a major concern of
those charged with maintaining and protecting native communities. Particular
exotics have produced major ecological perturbations, and in some areas the
sheer numbers of introduced plant species swamp out native floras. Once an
exotic pest becomes established in an area, ecologists and resource managers
would like to know where it is likely to spread and when it will get there. The
factors influencing rates of invasion are important objects of study both to
understand the dynamics of range expansion in general and to begin to address
urgent questions of exotics management and control. The proposed research
focusses on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom), a serious pest plant on the West
Coast of North America. Observational and experimental approaches will
characterize the seed dispersal distribution of this plant as contributed by the
explosive opening of fruits and by secondary ant dispersal. The population
consequences of relatively long-distance jumps will be evaluated in a whole
field experiment manipulating the distribution of adult plants.
