The University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UWP)proposes to increase the number of
students, particularly women, entering the College of Engineering, Mathematics
and Science(EMS) and retain them through graduation. The plan is to offer 140
scholarships over a five-year period to academically talented but economically
disadvantaged students, who are seriously interested in Electrical, Civil, and
Environmental Engineering, Mathematics and Science careers. The Engineering
programs all received the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology
(ABET) accreditation. A Program Leadership Team (PLT) consisting of Principal
and co-Principal Investigators (PIs and co-PIs) is to oversee all aspects of the
program. The UWP administration, student support services, and the College of
Engineering, Mathematics and Science are all committed to assisting with program
goals and objectives. Letters of commitment from all groups signed by each
individual are provided. In addition, the housing department is committed to
developing a living and learning environment, where STEM scholars are within
proximity of each other. &lt;br/&gt;The project is aligned with the mission of
the University of Wisconsin system. The University of Wisconsin-Platteville
(UWP) is one of thirteen, four-year comprehensive campuses supporting the
University of Wisconsin System's Growth Agenda for Wisconsin 2009. As a STEM
focused campus UWP is leading the system-wide initiative and is to play a key
role in meeting this growth agenda for Wisconsin.
