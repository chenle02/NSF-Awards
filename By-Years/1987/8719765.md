Dr. Weirich is refining a common method of explaining group behavior that
appeals to the course of action that a group would agree upon if conditions were
ideal for reaching an agreement. In particular, he is specifying the course of
action that a group would agree upon in ideal conditions. Dr. Weirich's
approach, in contrast to other game theorists looking at this question, is what
he calls weighted utilitarianism which uses more properties of a group than
standard proposals use to determine the action that the group would agree upon
in ideal conditions. Specifically, it uses interpersonal utilities and power
structures. It is like utilitarianism except that it weighs utilities according
to the social power of individuals before adding utilities. Dr. Weirich's
earlier formulations of weighted utilitarianism imposed a restriction to
bargaining problems in which there are no incentives for the formation of
factions or coalitions that would splinter the group of bargainers. He has now
removed this restriction. For this purpose, he has introduced a new conception
of a stable agreement. According to it, being a stable agreement is similar to
being an agreement that is in what others have called the bargaining set. He
incorporates some refinements that come out of the recent literature on decision
stability. In accomplishing this work, this project puts one of the most
fruitful methods of explaining group behavior on a sound foundation.
