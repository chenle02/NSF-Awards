along the margin of Virginia, concentrating on tying previously-studied marine
data to a corresponding dataset on land. This will produce new images of the
transition between continental and ocean crust, permitting better constraints on
the processes that occur during continental breakup. A surprising finding from
the existing data is the presence of very thick igneous units, suggesting far
