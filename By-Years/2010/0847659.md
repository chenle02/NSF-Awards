The goal of the SGER project is to develop new tools to understand the
principles of gene network operation and to use these principles as the basis
for a new kind of geno-mimetic network architecture. Gene networks display
multiple (degenerate) ways of giving a common output. The project identifies
what principles these degenerate networks have in common and incorporate such
common principles into network and circuit architectures for non-biological
computational devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project constitutes a new
approach to the question of whether there are common underlying principles to
biological network operation. The project also presents the potential to
introduce an entirely new class of network architecture based on the functional
configurations of gene networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
