9423212 Sholkovitz The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake an
ocean sciences instrumentation development project to design, build and test an
aerosol collector that would be deployable on buoys. The purpose of this new
instrument is to help derive a better understanding of the temporal and
qualitative coupling between atmospheric deposition of particulates and upper
ocean chemistry and biology. The sampler will feature battery driven air pumps,
mass flow meters to monitor filter rate, sequencing sample collectors, and an
interface with IMET (Improved Meteorological Marine Measurements) systems. The
aerosol collector will be designed for both discreet time-series and time-
integrated samples. This will provide a mass balance check on time series
sampling. Additionally, filters of varying types will be tested for collecting
samples of different chemical types. The system will calibrated with
conventional aerosol sampling systems on the AEROCE tower on Bermuda. This will
allow direct comparison with the aerosols collected by the AEROCE high-volume
sampler.
