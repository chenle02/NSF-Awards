This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates a
Computer Aided Failure Analysis System (CAFES) for rapid diagnosis of yield loss
for digital VLSI circuits. Such a system is needed to accelerate the yield
learning for semiconductor fabrication facilities. Traditional approaches to
yield learning involve diagnosing the faulty component, and subsequently
determining the underlying contaminant through costly and time-consuming
physical failure analysis techniques. Turnaround time to obtain a statistically
meaningful sample of contaminants slows yield learning. The rapid failure
analysis research methodology of this Phase I combines traditional defect
localization with automatic defect classification techniques. These automatic
techniques directly relate circuit malfunctions to possible contaminants,
thereby alleviating the requirement for physical failure analysis methods. This
is accomplished through off-line characterization of the faulty device and
augmented cell library information which catalogs the possible faulty behaviors
of the device. The research will study required algorithms and write a prototype
code to establish the accuracy and resolution which this scheme can attain.
Reducing the time required to achieve profitable yields will increase
profitability. The cost benefits of CAFES are important in the face of mounting
costs of semiconductor fabrication facilities. Rapid yield learning is one of
the important options for enhancement of competitive advantage in the
semiconductor manufacturering industry.
