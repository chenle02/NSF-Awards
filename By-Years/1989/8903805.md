Studies of experimentally deformed calcite have produced a remarkably complete
data set that potentially apply to deforma- tion processes in marble mylonites.
However, few data are avail- able from natural marble shear zones, thus limiting
assessment of the importance of the laboratory data to natural systems. This
project is an integrated microstructural study of a well preserved marble
mylonite from the central metasedimentary Belt of the Ontario Grenville. The
study of this shear zone provides a natural laboratory to examine processes in a
variably deformed marble, ranging from protolith to ultra-mylonite. Results will
provide field evidence to allow a comparison of experimentally and naturally
produced textures as it applies to the extra- polation of experimentally-derived
flow laws to geological conditions.
