The primary goal of this project is to broaden opportunities for student
research in the following related fields of solid state physics: the optical
properties of metals, electronic transport through tunnel barriers and the
characterization of interface morphology. In particular, the phenomenon of light
emission from tunnel junctions is a suitable topic for undergraduate projects.
The acquisition of a monochromator, a rotating sample holder and a calibrated
light source allow the spectra of the emitted light to be measured. In addition,
students may compare their measured spectra with those calculated using models
for the electron tunnelling current and the microscopic features of the
interfaces.
