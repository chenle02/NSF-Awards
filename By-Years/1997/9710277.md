9710277 Silberberg This grant will develop a Model Verification Homepage that
will provide access to a suite of real-time analyses of error fields in weather
forecast models. The purpose of the web page and graphics of model error fields
is to provide new teaching tools for use in Synoptic Meteorology and Weather
Forecasting courses at Northern Illinois University. These tools will help
educators communicate and students learn about the strengths and weaknesses of
operational prediction models and statistical forecasts produced at forecasting
centers worldwide.
