How does culture influence decision making? Specifically, this research examines
the role that culture plays in whether and how people come to think of medical
problems as legal problems. Uncovering how media and the civic and legal social
climate influence what people think and what they do when it comes to law not
only helps explain the role of these types of culture in shaping people's
decisions, but also helps practitioners and activists understand how when the
media can encourage citizens to mobilize their rights. Additionally, the study
contributes to understanding how legal resources may be translated into health
advantages. One crucial resource that is often overlooked by medical
sociologists is legal assistance. Under what conditions do families turn to law
to help remedy a child's medical problems? Findings may encourage medical
sociologists to more routinely consider law as an additional kind of resource
that families mobilize for health.

In each of four cities selected to reflect distinctive characteristics, the PI
will interview 25 families of children who have experienced the same serious,
but often preventable , medical injury (Erb's Palsy, a brachial plexus birth
injury) about their decisions whether or not to pursue legal action against
their doctor. The four cities vary in terms of overall civic climate and extent
of exposure to recent media activities surrounding tort reform initiatives. The
possible influence of such media is unclear, especially because the messages
surrounding different interests in tort reform initiatives are in tension with
one another. A message that plaintiffs are "greedy" and "ruining the system for
everyone" could make people more reluctant to sue, while a message that
"plaintiffs usually win large amounts" may increase people's likelihood of
suing. Moreover, these messages may play out differently or have more or less
salience in cities with different social characteristics. The expectation is
that individuals' decisions are shaped by their social contexts and the unique
combinations of civic, legal, and media climates.
