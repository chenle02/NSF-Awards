PROGRAM: Academic Research Infrastructure Program Summary: The Academic
Research Infrastructure (ARI) program supports 1) acquisition or development of
major research instrumentation, and/or 2) repair, renovation, or in exceptional
cases, replacement of obsolete science and engineering research facilities. This
proposal from Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) requests funds to renovate
three old instruments (an electron probe, a X-ray diffractometer, and a scanning
transmission electron microscope) and to replace an X-ray fluorescence system.
The instruments will be maintained and operated as part of SIO's Analytical
Facility, which houses major instrumentation and makes it available to all of
the University's qualified staff and students. The instrumentation will improve
the University's research and teaching capabilities. Matching funds will be
provided by the University.
