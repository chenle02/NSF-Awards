This Leadership Activities Project will provide professional development for 30
outstanding chemistry teachers from northwest Ohio, southeast Michigan,
northeast Indiana and elsewhere. The workshop will run for two weeks in late
July and will be followed by five sessions throughout the school year. Skills in
chemistry teaching will be renewed and developed through extensive, hands-on
laboratory activities, provocative demonstrations and group discussion sessions.
Participants will have access to the use of shop facilities and consultation,
and they will make demonstration devices. They will also practice presenting
demonstrations under the guidance of leaders in chemistry education and will
critique the performance of one another. In addition, they will develop new
skills in computer programming and interfacing in chemistry education. During
the summer sessions and the academic year, consultants with special expertise in
chemistry education will meet with the participants to develop skills and
insights in a variety of special areas including problem solving, the
development of conceptual and logical structures, and chemistry curricula. We
anticipate that participants will rediscover the sense of excitement that
initially drew them into the field of chemistry. We also anticipate that they
will return to their classrooms not merely to talk about chemistry but to share
their excitement and interest.
