9528939 Picardal This is an award to support preliminary work on biological
processes for degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls. The investigator plans
on developing appropriate analytical procedures, isolating cultures of organisms
capable of biologically degrading these compounds and finally to conduct studies
on the anaerobic dehalogenation capacity of sludges derived from treatment of
domestic wastewater, sediments and soils. The proposal leading to this award was
submitted in response to NSF 94-147, Research Planning Grants and Career
Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists and Engineers. Results are expected
to provide information that can be used in determining the feasibility of the
process to be studied and the basis for a more comprehensive research project
that would determine conditions and engineering design parameters for a
biologically based process to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from contaminated
soils and sediments and from sludges derived from treatment of municipal and
industrial wastewater.
