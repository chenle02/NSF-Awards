The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of separating
companents of fly ash produced by combustion of coal into by useful materials by
use of nevel electrostatic process. Unburned carbon in the fly ash reduces its
ability to function adequately as an aggregate in production of concrete. The
carbon entrained in the fly ash has the potential for serving as a low-cost
treatment of water or wastewater. The research involves determination of the
extent to which carbon can be removed from fly ahs, concentrated by additional
processing, and its adsorptive properties which woul determine its usefullness
in water and wastewater treatment. The proposal leading to this project was
submitted in response to NSF 88-8, Program Solicitation for Small Business
Innovation Research. Many potential uses of fly ash are possible if its
properties can be properly controlled. This project offers a potential for
utilizing fly ash, a waste product in plentiful supply, as a source of useful
materials, reducing costs for disposal of the fly ash and avoiding the
environmental problems now associated with its management.
