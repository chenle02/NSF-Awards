This award supports a collaborative program in the organic chemistry of magnetic
semiconductors between the research groups of Fernando Galembeck (Campinas, Sao
Paulo, Brazil) and Janos H. Fendler (Syracuse, New York). Nanosized magnetic and
magnetic- semiconductor particles will be prepared by methodologies developed by
the Brazilian group and will be incorporated into bilayer lipid membranes and
Langmuir-Blodgett films currently in use in the U.S. group. They will be
characterized by absorption spectrophotometry, scanning tunneling microscopy,
and by measuring electrochemical, electro-optical, and magneto-optical
properties in the U.S. scientist's laboratory. Important and complementary
characterization by transmission electron microscopy, Mossbauer and
ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy will be carried out in the Brazilian
laboratories. The research will result in the development of novel, nanosized
magnetic and magnetic-semiconductor particles which will have potentially
important applications as electro-optical, magneto-optical, and magnetoelectro-
optical devices. The relevance of the proposed research to high-technology
applications will serve to motivate students, whose training will be an integral
component of the cooperation. Brazilian students will work in Syracuse and U.S.
students will do likewise in Brazil.
