The GLORIAD/InSight program is a global, open-source software development effort
to research and experimentally deploy advanced flow-level network measurement
technologies at various levels of the research and education (R&E) network eco-
system. The tools developed will enable far-reaching research towards better
understanding network utilization, identifying network application performance
issues while carefully attending to differing community concerns and
requirements regarding data privacy and security. Experimental deployments will
showcase actionable analytics and visualizations for network operations, new
methods and models of data sharing across the global R&E fabric, and thus a
better understood, more performant fabric.

Through a global, community-focused, open-source development effort, the project
extends the current beta version of InSight - the flow-level passive
measurement, analysis and visualization system in use on the GLORIAD network.
The InSight tools are based on passive network measurement and monitoring by
combining the rich detail of comprehensive, non-sampled, bi-directional, multi-
model, multi-layer Argus flow-data with modern big-data analytic and
visualization tools. A flexible stream-based method of enriching network flow
metadata enables broader, customer-defined analytics. Working closely with
interested large-network providers, the project works toward experimentally
deploying InSight on links up to 100 Gbps.
