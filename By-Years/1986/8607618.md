This project will describe the emergence of computer science as an academic
discipline. The PI, after investigation of ten or so academic departments of
computer science, will describe the major factors important in the different
institutional histories of these departments. Factors such as extramural funding
patterns, the strength of existing disciplinary departments, the various roles
played by organized research units, etc., will be investigated in order to
explain the present institutional structure of academic computer science in U.S.
universities. The project will provide basic data, both quantitative and
qualitative, on the emergence of a field of scientific research for use in
future S&EI reports. The work itself will serve as a model of how to describe a
rapidly-changing, interdisciplinary field as it establishes itself on the
nation's campuses.
