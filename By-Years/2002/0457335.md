Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Baik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The eigenvalues of large random
matrices are known to describe the&lt;br/&gt;limiting behaviors of various
objects in mathematics, statistics&lt;br/&gt;and physics such as random
permutations, zeros of Riemann-zeta&lt;br/&gt;function, sample covariance
matrices, non-intersecting paths and&lt;br/&gt;random growth models. The
investigator plans to study various&lt;br/&gt;intrinsic properties the limiting
distribution functions arising&lt;br/&gt;in random matrix theory, as well as to
apply the ideas and methods&lt;br/&gt;of random matrix theory to probability
models such as last passage&lt;br/&gt;percolation, queueing models, non-
intersecting paths and&lt;br/&gt;interacting particle systems. Built on the
investigator's and&lt;br/&gt;other researchers' earlier work, the long term goal
is to clarify&lt;br/&gt;the universality class of models which are describable
in terms of&lt;br/&gt;the eigenvalues of random matrices using ideas from
both&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems and
probability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
