9413025 Pritchard Taste is a critical sense for animal survival, determining
what is good and what is not good to eat. Yet compared with our understanding of
other sensory modalities like sight and hearing , we have only a rudimentary
knowledge of the gustatory system. Sight, hearing and touch are centrally
organized in a hierarchical fashion in the mammalian brain; in particular, the
thalamus is a major brain region above the brainstem which processes and
integrates sensory information before it gets to the level of the cortex. We
have little comparable information on central processing in taste pathways. This
project uses novel experiments with sophisticated behavioral tests to see what
particular processing occurs in the brainstem, without the contributions from
the thalamus. The unique approach will determine whether specific taste deficits
represent a sensory loss, a change in behavioral motivation, or a perceptual
deficit, each of which could influence taste- guided behavior. These results
will provide needed fundamental advances in our understanding of taste; results
will be important beyond chemosensory neuroscience, to cognitive and perceptual
issues of brain function, and to the food industry.
