This PFI:AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating optical
networking control and switching technology invented in the NSF ERC Center for
Integrated Access Networks (CIAN) to fill the need for fiber optical systems,
the plumbing of the Internet, to be more flexibly reconfigured with changing
service requirements. The resilient and programmable metro optical networking
system is important because it can enable data traffic bottlenecks to be rapidly
resolved and high bandwidth applications such as big data, telemedicine, and
video to be flexibly moved to high capacity express-ways. For example, large
volumes of data could be rapidly moved out of the path of natural disasters such
as hurricanes. With this innovation, following a disaster, available live fiber
connections can be flexibly managed to enable the highest available capacity and
connectivity. This project will result in a proof-of-concept reconfigurable
fiber system that has the unique capability to automatically switch the metro
fiber connections between different metro, access, and data center optical
transmission systems. These features provide a more efficient use of fiber
infrastructure, more cost effective and reliable fiber capacity for high
bandwidth services, and greater resilience to natural disasters.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses several technology gaps as it
translates from research discovery toward commercial application. This new
reconfigurable fiber system will enable optical networks to be reconfigured to
provide wavelength and fiber scale bandwidth on demand in metro networks. The
main concept involves using space switching in metro network nodes or central
offices to reconfigure the fiber connectivity across multiple communication
platforms including reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexing (ROADM) and
other access and distribution optical systems. Novel optical physical layer
control algorithms and software defined networking (SDN) based protocols will be
used to manage switching over optically amplified links on fast time scales.
Additional optical elements or accelerators are introduced based on the
switching requirements. In addition, graduate students and post-doctoral
researchers involved in this project will receive technology transfer and
entrepreneurship experiences through the proof-of-concept development and
evaluation, and the business and use case development together with industry and
government leaders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages the New York City
Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), Silicon
Harlem, and Calient Technologies in this technology translation effort from
research discovery toward commercial reality.
