Professor Feldman will continue his research in ergodic theory giving
particular attention to the following areas: (i) normal distributions with
respect to p,q multiplication, (ii) continuous products of probability spaces,
(iii) ergodic theory for actions of amenable (non-unimodular) groups, (iv)
smooth ergodic theory, and (v) subrelations of ergodic equivalence relations.
Research in ergodic theory involves trying to understand the average behavior of
systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be followed in
microscopic detail. Under the heading "dynamics" can be placed the modern theory
of how groups of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces. Another
important theme in ergodic theory is the classification of systems into broad
categories which are mathematically identical in an abstract sense. Professor
Feldman's research will make contact with these areas.
