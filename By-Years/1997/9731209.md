9731209 Fabien This award supports ten US participants in the US-South Africa
Workshop on Mechanical Engineering Design Education, which will be held in
Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 1998. The co-organizers are Professor Brian
Fabien, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, and
Professor Andrew Dickson, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University
of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The purpose of the workshop is to establish
a long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between university-level design
engineering educators in both countries. Participants will be drawn from
academia and industry and will include senior educators as well as postdoctoral
and/or junior investigators and graduate students. Through a series of
presentations and interactive sessions, the participants will discuss current
practices in graduate level teaching of engineering design and state of the art
use of multimedia in engineering education, including distance learning and
real-time computer usage in the classroom. This latter topic is especially
important for South Africa, where distance learning forms a large part of higher
education. Special emphasis will be placed on undergraduate teaching
methodologies and effectiveness measures, with the aim of presenting a variety
of innovative current approaches to design education. Site visits to academic
institutions and local industry will take place during the workshop, and
industry representatives will give their perspectives on hiring requirements for
design engineering graduates. The workshop is being supported jointly by the
Division of Design, Manufacture, and Industrial Innovation (DMII), the Design of
Engineering Education and Centers (EEC), and the Division of International
Programs (INT). ***
