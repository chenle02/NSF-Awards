Current microprocessor systems are based on semiconductor logic gates, which
employ electronic input and output signals and power supplies. Each type of
logic gates has a specific input?output signal correlation pattern. Voltages can
be simply high or low: digital 1 or 0, respectively. A critical feature, which
contributes to the success of modern computers, is input-output signal
uniformity: the same voltage value emerging as output of one gate can be
admitted as input of another gate. Very large scale integration is a crucial
component of modern silicon processors. The development of even more powerful
processors depends on continued progress in miniaturizing their components.
However, if current trends continue, conventional silicon chips will soon reach
their physical limits. By then, their transistors will be so small that current
leakage will become an insurmountable problem. It is believed that constructing
computers in which computations are performed by individual molecules is the
inevitable wave of the future (P. Ball, Nature 2000, 406, 118-120).
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal of this project is the development of a
first DNA-based nanocomputer, a biocompatible and smaller counterpart of the
modern silicon-based processor. This project aims at the solution of the two
major problems of molecular computation: the universal large scale connectivity
of molecular logic gates and precise localization of logic gates in a nanoscale
environment. A basic set of connectable DNA logic gates (NOT, AND OR) will be
created. The DNA gates will be organized in a network that corresponds to an EX-
OR logic function both in solution and on a two-dimensional DNA platform.
Accomplishing the project will deliver the first connectable nanoscale logic
units, a basis for the future DNA nanoprocessor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This
research will be integrated with education by introducing research topics into
undergraduate teaching, students, research training at undergraduate and
graduate levels, postdoctoral training.
