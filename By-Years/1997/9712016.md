Steven L. Namikas University of Southern California The doctoral dissertation
research will involve a comprehensive field investigation of the saltation
process and its influence on aeolian transport rates. A two phase field project
will be undertaken at Pismo Beach State Park, CA to allow data collection under
a range of wind conditions. Simultaneous high frequency measurements of all key
saltation parameters will be collected. These will be used to investigate the
interaction between the sub-processes of saltation and examine their influence
on short term variability in aeolian transport. The overall research objective
is to incorporate understanding of short term variations in transport gained in
this research into existing models of aeolian transport and thereby improve our
predictive modeling capabilities and our ability to deal with the environmental
and geomorphic consequences of wind blown sand.
