0339107&lt;br/&gt;Franca&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Leopoldo Franca and
students from the University of Colorado-Denver in a collaboration with Lutz
Tobiska of the Institute of Analysis and Numerics at the Technical University of
Magdeburg, Germany. The collaboration will focus on the development of novel
finite-element methods for simulating multi-scale phenomena. Particular
attention will be paid to problems that involve features that are finer than the
computation mesh. Multiscale phenomena are present in many applications, and the
current project focuses on turbulent flows, where small features influence the
large features of the flow. The outcome of the research will lead to improved
simulations of large-scale problems involving various scales. The methods of
analysis to be developed will contribute to the understanding and the
foundations of future computational methods. Furthermore, the methods are
constructed so that they can take full advantage of parallel machines, making
them attractive for large-scale computations.&lt;br/&gt;
