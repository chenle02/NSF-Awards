Wear of current collectors (electrical brushes) is a major cause of failure in
motors, further, resultant down time for repair has a serious impact on
productivity. The objective of this effort is to provide an improved theoretical
model of high current density brush physics that includes both dynamic and
thermoelastic effects. Specifically, the effects of bulk variables such as
current, rotor speed and geometry, contact force, and others on the formation of
slowly moving hot spots in the brush will be investigated. With better
understanding of brush physics, the model should lead to improved brushdesign.
