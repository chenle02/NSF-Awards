Over the past three decades, the oceanography community has seen an astounding
development in ocean color remote sensing capabilities. For the first time, a
climate quality data record can be compiled to demonstrate the strong link
between inter-seasonal climate variability and the marine biosphere during the
El Nino to La Nina transition on ocean basin scales. Ocean color data are now
used by a very broad user community from research to resource management
applications. Because the continuity of satellite ocean color data is presently
at significant risk for the U.S. ocean color community, performance of future
observing systems must be considered in the context of the full range of
research and operational/application user needs to determine options to meet
these needs on a sustained basis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study aims to
develop a consensus for the requirements that meet a broad range of user needs
and identify options to sustain long-term global ocean color radiance (OCR) from
space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will
further advance the public?s understanding of the value of satellite
observations by developing a consensus about the importance of synoptic
biological oceanographic observations for the stewardship of the marine
environment as well as for monitoring and predicting climate change. The study
will engage and communicate to a broad range of stakeholders in the user
community and policy makers, nationally and internationally.
