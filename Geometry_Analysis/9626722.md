9626722 Guan This project pursues geometric partial differential equations.
Analysis of many problems in differential geometry often leads to questions
concerning nonlinear partial differential equations. The investigator plans to
study Monge-Ampere type equations with an emphasis on the regularity of
solutions in the degenerate case; the Christoffel-Minkowski problems and related
Hessian equations; the Dirichlet problem for hypersurfaces of prescribed
curvatures; curvature evolution equations for hypersurfaces. Unlike linear
partial differential equations there is little general theory regarding
nonlinear partial differential equations. Yet many problems arising in various
geometric settings can only be formulated as nonlinear differential equations.
And the proposed research represents an attempt to pursue these equations from a
geometric perspective - the main advantage of the geometric approach seems to be
that one is able to make fairy strong, but geometrically meaningful, assumptions
thereby simplifying the equations.
