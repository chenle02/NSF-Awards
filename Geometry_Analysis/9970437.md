Abstract: This project involves the study of holomorphic G-bundles over an
elliptic curve, where G is a reductive algebraic group, together with various
generalizations. If G is the complexification of a compact group K, a closely
related question is the classification of two commuting elements in K up to
simultaneous conjugation. In joint work with J. Morgan and E. Witten, Friedman
has classified holomorphic G-bundles over an elliptic curve. The relative
situation for G-bundles over an elliptic fibration has also been studied. The
next stage of the project is to work out the relation between these
constructions, in the case where G is one of the exceptional groups E6, E7, E8,
and corresponding families of K3 or del Pezzo surfaces. In terms of families of
commuting elements in compact Lie groups, in joint work with A. Borel and J.
Morgan, Friedman has given normal forms for commuting pairs and triples, and the
method extends in principle to handle N mutually commuting elements.

Compact Lie groups are the symmetry groups of nature, and the possible such
groups have been classified and understood for one hundred years. Aside from
four infinite series of such groups, there are also a small number of
exceptional groups. Recently, such groups have become important in particle
physics, because the possible subatomic particles and their interactions seem to
be described by such symmetry groups. In particular string theory, which is an
attempt to unify quantum mechanics with gravity, has suggested that the universe
is 10-dimensional and that the symmetry group involved is one of the exceptional
groups. Moreover, in some versions of string theory, the missing 6 dimensions of
the universe are accounted for by a so-called elliptic fibration. Thus, the
project attempts to study a part of mathematics which is relevant to string
theory as well as being an interesting piece of mathematics in its own right.
