This is a core program in the Black Sea expedition. Honjo will collect and
analyze annual (12 to 14 months) particulate flux samples applying high
resolution sediment trap technology (at 15-day intervals) in the Black Sea. In
addition, there will be a short-term deployment for 3 months at 2 depths using
synchronized time-series traps during the spring bloom period with a sampling
interval of less than one week. Simultaneously, extensive box core sampling at
the trap site and along a W-E transect between the trap sites will establish the
annual particulate flux over the last 5,000 years as annual paleoflux. This
study will further be supported by a broad range of highly focused studies
pertaining (1) to the source of the terrigenous, biogenic, and chemogenic
particles, (2) to the transport mechanism of the particles, and (3) to the
chemical and microbiological alterations of the particles in the anerobic water
column and in the sediment.
