The objective of this research is to study experimentally the plasma
oscillations in the electron gas confined in wide, remotely-doped AlGaAs
heterostructure wells. This novel solid state plasma, with a spatially-tunable
density distribution and with sufficiently high elctron mobilities, presents the
opportunity to observe well-defined plasmas for temperatures below and well
above the degeneracy temperature (approximately 20 K). These systems have the
advantage that the potential that confines the electrons is smooth on the scale
of the Thomas-Fermi screening length, meaning results can be compared with
"jellium" theories that are not complicated by the strong, rapidly varying ionic
potentials in bulk semiconductors and metallic plasmas. The PI plans to use
visible-light scattering and far-infrared spectroscopy to probe the effects of
density gradients in the electron layer on the plasma modes.
