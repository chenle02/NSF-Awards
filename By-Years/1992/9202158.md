A broad range of theoretical issues dealing with multi-agent learning systems
will be investigated. Cooperation is the key to successfully completing a task
when more than one agent is involved. Attention will be restricted to learning
system where multiple agents cooperate in learning a concept (or function). The
ultimate goal is to devise templates for cooperating learning strategies which
hopefully can be applied to other practical problems. The goal will be
approached by investigating learners with differing convergence and/or
correctness criteria as well as other features such as totality of hypothesized
programs and resource boundedness. This wide spectrum of type of learners will
help in identifying the true nature and complexity of the cooperation one should
expect in multi-agent learning systems. In particular, an on-going investigation
of the structure of probabilistic and pluralistic hierarchy in FIN-type (and
subsequently in other types of)learning will be continued, which recently
revealed a new but very intimate cooperative strategy.
