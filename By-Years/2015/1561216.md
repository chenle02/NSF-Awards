Power dissipation and energy consumption are major cost considerations across
modern computer systems including data center design, enterprise level server
design, battery life management on a smart phone, and circuit layout on a
microprocessor. There are numerous approaches that address the hardware aspect
of the problem. However, software-behavior-driven power management is not well
addressed and understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPONGE, a fine-grained function
level software power prediction mechanism, is proposed to dynamically apply
proper power saving mechanisms to improve power efficiency and schedule suitable
workloads to heterogeneous cores. The PI is proposing a new metric, Power
Efficiency of Function (PEF), to evaluate the power efficiency of software at
fine granularity. Based on PEF, a software-behavior-driven power management
scheme is introduced to improve system power efficiency at runtime. The power
management scheme applies power saving mechanisms including thread mapping and
voltage and frequency scaling, driven by program characteristics based on the
software power prediction of the target platform. PEF enables a quantitative
measurement of the ratio of useful work done to resources utilized. By involving
software in the loop of power management, it is possible to provide a fine-
grained power management scheme with a seamless connection between software and
operating systems, especially for power-aware scheduling on heterogeneous
multicore architectures.
