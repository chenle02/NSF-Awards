Progesterone is a steroid hormone of fundamental importance in reproduction. To
generate probes for studying the mechanisms of progesterone action the
progesterone receptor has been purified from T47D, a human cell line which
provides a particularly rich source of the receptor. Three IgG monoclonal
antibodies have been raised against the progesterone receptor proteins. Though
only purified B- receptors (120,000 daltons) were the antigens, 1 of the 3
antibodies cross-reacts with A-receptors (94,000 daltons). In the continuation
of this research immunochemistry, photoaffinity labeling and autoradiography
will be applied to study how phosphorylation of the progesterone receptor
proteins affects their action. The first goal is, using whole cells, to assess
the effect of progestins, and intracellular A- and B-receptor localization on
the phosphorylation state of the receptors, to analyze phospho-amino acids and
peptides, and to study phosphorylation of receptor-associated proteins that do
not bind hormone. The second goal is to use reconstituted, cell-free systems to
characterize receptor kinases, particularly a putative nuclear kinase, and to
assess receptor autophosphorylation capacity. The third goal is to determine
whether the phosphorylation state of the receptor proteins varies with relevant
physiological stimuli, including known modualtors of progesterone receptors such
as estradiol. In sum, the overall goal is to understand how this covalent
modification of the progesterone receptor proteins affects their ability to bind
hormone, to acquire tight nuclear binding capacity, and to be down-regulated in
nuclei. The results of this research should further our understanding of the
mechanism of action of this important steroid hormone.
