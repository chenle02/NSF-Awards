As a result of the project, microcalorimetry is being integrated into chemistry
major laboratories. Calorimetry is among the most fundamental of physical
measurements with extensive applications to biological and materials chemistry.
Technological advances have so increased the sensitivity of calorimetric
measurements to the point where convenient studies of the energy changes
associated with living systems are possible for such phenomena as membrane
formation and phase segregation/aggregation even with very small sample sizes.
The initial experiments of the project allow students to grasp the nature and
importance of energy changes in biological systems by determining enthalpies of
micelle formation and the binding constants of proteins and suitable ligands.
Moreover, we students measure the heat capacity of the novel memory metal alloy
NiTi. The improved instrumentation also enhances carbon compounds and junior
year laboratory programs through the introduction of purity determination using
differential scanning calorimetry as well as the range of independent research
projects for senior students.
