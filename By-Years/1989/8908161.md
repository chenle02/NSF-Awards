It is proposed to use the coherence properties of a laser beam to control the
product distribution in the photodissociation of small molecules. The approach
relies on the theory of Shapiro and Brumer that product state distribution is
determined entirely by the phase of the degenerate superposition state excited
by the laser, so that controlling the phase controls the product branching
ratio. It is proposed to achieve phase control of the excited state by using two
optical paths to excite the same state, with a well defined phase difference
between the two optical pulses, corresponding to absorption of a single photo or
three photos. The approach will be applied to the competition between
autoionization and photo dissociation, and also to the photo dissociation of an
isotopically labelled molecule to produce isotopically distinguishable neutral
fragments. Oscillations is product branching ratios as the relative phases of
the two laser beams is scanned will provide proof of coherent laser control.
