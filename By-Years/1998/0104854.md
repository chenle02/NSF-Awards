This project explores the preparation, properties and chemistry of
dehydrobenzannulenes. These molecules are related to such substances as
buckminsterfullerenes in having an almost all-carbon composition. Unlike
fullerenes, dehydrobenzannulenes can vary in structure quite radically and
rationally designed structures are accessible by total synthesis. The aim of
this research project is to prepare and study dehydrobenzannulenes with novel
shapes in order to answer fundamental scientific questions as well as to explore
the materials propertied of the resultant macromolecules.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its
support for the research and educational activities of Professor Michael M.
Haley of the University of Oregon, Eugene. Professor Haley's research explores
the preparation and properties of macromolecular, carbon-rich
dehydrobenzannulenes. These novel macromolecules can be as large as several
nanometers in diameter and offer the prospect of novel properties including, but
not limted to nonlinear optical properties. In addition to his work with
doctoral and postdoctoral scientists, Professor Haley also includes
undergraduate students of chemistry in his research programs.
