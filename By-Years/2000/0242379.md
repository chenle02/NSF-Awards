This project involves statistical analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court's selection
of both paid and unpaid petitions for review. The goal of the study is to
determine whether, in what ways, and to what extent the Court's selection of
unpaid cases differs from its selection of paid cases. Numerous empirical
studies have considered which case characteristics increase the likelihood that
the Supreme Court will select a petition for review, and scholars have used the
results of those studies to reach conclusions about the Court's decision making
process and bases for decision in selecting cases for full review. Those
studies, however, have limited their analysis to paid petitions, to the
exclusion of those petitions filed by indigent litigants, the petitions in forma
pauperis or IFP petitions. Examining whether the same case characteristics have
the same influence on the probability of accepting unpaid petitions illuminates
the Court's decision making process and criteria for selection, and thus adds
significantly to the wealth of scholarship on the Supreme Court's agenda-setting
function. The study also explores the accessibility of the Court to the poor and
the Court's attention to issues affecting low- income people, issues with
important normative implications. In addition to expanding upon the scholarship
on political decision making, the Court's agenda-setting function, and equal
access to the Court, this study involves the creation of a dataset from primary
sources, containing information on the IFP docket.
