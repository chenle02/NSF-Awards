NGS: Collaborative Research: An OpenMP Environment for Wide-Area Network
Computing

The objective of this proposal is to develop a new programming system that will
close the gap that exists between programming SMPs and networked computer
clusters, by using the emerging standard (OpenMP) for SMPs and develop compiler
and runtime support that will enable using OpenMP on distributed platforms with
optimized performance. The proposed programming system will make it possible to
program the Grid and networked computer systems using OpenMP, the emerging
standard for shared-memory programming. The PI expects to attain high efficiency
in the execution of OpenMP programs for collection of Grid-connected computers.
Through static and dynamic compiler techniques, we expect to harness the
complexity and load fluctuations of the target environment.
