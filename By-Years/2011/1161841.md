This research award provides funding for the development of a set of tools for
designing high precision flexure mechanisms. Flexure mechanisms are the central
part of numerous precision machinery that are used in a wide range of science
and engineering applications. Since the current approaches are inadequate for
designing these kinds of machines, this project aims to develop kinematic and
mechanism theories and computational tools that analyze complex flexure
mechanisms and synthesize ones for prescribed design requirements. The valuable
practical design experience from engineers will be fully exploited via a digital
catalogue of commonly used flexure elements, joints and building blocks that
will be carefully designed and analyzed. These theories, tools and design
catalogue will be integrated into a dedicated computer-aided design program with
advanced human-computer-interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the new
design tools will significantly speed up the design process and shorten the
research and development cycle and lead to innovation of many more highly
precision devices such as nanopositioners, nanomanipulators, MEMS scanning
mirrors. These devices further enable scientists in a wide range of fields such
as biology, nanotechnology, astronomy explore the unknown world more
efficiently. By bringing the research results into undergraduate and graduate
curriculum, we hope to educate the next generation precision engineers with this
innovative design tool. To maximize the impact of this research, we will
disseminate the research results to industry, academia and general public by (1)
distributing flexure design software and the design catalogue, (2) interacting
with scientists in national labs, and (3) organizing workshops at national and
international conferences. We will also develop a summer camp and interactive
virtual reality demonstration programs to outreach k-12, pre-freshman and women
students.
