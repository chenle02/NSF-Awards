Larix, a deciduous conifer, is abundant in high montane, subalpine, and boreal
forests throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The widespread importance of larch
in cold-temperate montane and boreal forests and its similar canopy architecture
needle morphology and water conducting system to evergreen conifers makes larch
an ideal species to elucidate the influence of leaf habit (e.g., evergreen vs.
deciduous) on carbon balance and nutrient use. The principal investigators
propose to contrast the carbon and nutrient use of Larix occidentals and Pinus
contorta in high montane forests in Montana and Larix laricina and Picea mariana
in boreal forests in Wisconsin. The major hypotheses are: (1) aboveground net
primary production is equal or greater for larch than sympatric evergreen
conifers, (2) total (above-and belowground) net primary production is similar
for larch and sympatric evergreen conifers because (3) belowground net primary
production in larch is less than in evergreen conifers. Lastly, they speculate
(4) larch uses nitrogen more efficiently (leaf, canopy, and stand-level) than
evergreen conifers. These hypotheses lead to several corollary hypotheses
predicting the role of physiological and architectural traits that enable larch
to successfully complete with evergreen conifers.
