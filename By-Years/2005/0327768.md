AST 0327768 Abstract

The United States participates in preparatory activities for the next World
Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), convened by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), and scheduled to take place June 8-July 4, 2003
in Geneva, Switzerland within the Permanent Consultative Committee II (PTC II)
of the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL). CITEL PTC II
meetings are hosted by the participating Administrations, the host country being
responsible for supplying meeting facilities, secretarial support, translation
and other incidental expenses.

Participation of the NSF in CITEL PTC II meetings is advantageous to the U.S.
radio astronomy community, as the same has a large stake in the outcome of the
WRC. The present award covers the NSF share of the expenses of the February
CITEL PTC II meeting costs.
