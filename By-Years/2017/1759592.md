The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of
embedded machine listening as a low-cost, turnkey solution for early detection
of machinery malfunction and improve predictive maintenance. In manufacturing,
sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help
significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of
raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-
time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators,
boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those
services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially
providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability
to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise
level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and
building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of
animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement
in smart cities.

This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial
intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated
and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on
deep learning. Sound conveys critical information about the environment that
often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery
malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and
buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.
Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual
variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many
existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic
patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low
cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus
eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted.
