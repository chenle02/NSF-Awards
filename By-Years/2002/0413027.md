Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: A Combined Theoretical
and Experimental Study of Transport of Molecular Mixtures in Zeolite
Membranes&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CTS-0413027&lt;br/&gt;Principal
Investigator: David Sholl&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Carnegie Mellon
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on using
atomically-detailed simulations of diffusion in&lt;br/&gt;zeolites in close
connection with experimental studies to advance the understanding of macroscopic
diffusion in nanoporous materials. Three closely linked topics will be examined:
single-component diffusion of n-alkanes in silicalite, mixture diffusion of
n-alkanes in silicalite, and effects of pore size and shape on mixture
diffusion. Extensive atomistic simulations will be combined with membrane
permeation experiments and neutron scattering experiments to self-consistently
describe self and transport diffusion of n-alkanes in silicalite. Atomistic
simulations will be combined with membrane permeation and neutron scattering
experiments to assess the diffusion of multiple binary mixtures in silicalite.
An extensive set of atomistic simulations will be performed to examine binary
diffusion in a set of silica zeolites chosen to systematically vary pore size
and connectivities. Similar simulations will be performed for carbon nanotubes,
which are known to have very smooth pore walls, to probe the influence of pore
wall corrugation. These simulations will greatly expand the variety of binary
adsorbed mixtures for which data are available and provide stringent tests for
the predictive models of mixture diffusion. In terms of the broader impacts, the
proposed research will engage graduate students in an environment where they
will develop strong communication skills and where close collaboration between
theoretical and experimental participants is required. This work may lead to
industrial applications in zeolite-based membrane separations.&lt;br/&gt;
