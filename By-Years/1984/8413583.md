This project studies various aspects of voice recognition such as male/female
voice discrimination and dialect recognition. This will be accomplished by
simultaneously measuring the electroglottograph (EGG) and acoustic signals.
Features of the data which will be extracted and will be validated by
synthesizing speech using the parameters. The feature set will be used to
determine the subset which best discriminates male/female voices. The results of
the project will contribute to speech synthesis, speech/speaker recognition, and
speech aids for the disabled.
