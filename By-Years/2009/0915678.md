The Social Web, or Web 2.0, has changed the way people connect with each other
and use information. Sites such as Twitter, Flickr, and Digg allow people to
create content, annotate it with descriptive labels, and befriend others to
create communities. The collective knowledge and expertise of the community is
expressed through the links between people and information. The key to
extracting this knowledge is understanding the structure and dynamics of
networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study dynamics of information
spread on networks and how it relates to network structure and quality of
information. In previous work, investigator has developed a mathematical
framework to study the properties of static networks. She showed that a
centrality metric based on the number of paths connecting nodes can be used to
identify groups and important nodes within them. However, looking at static
structure ignores valuable temporal information that can be used to improve the
ability to identify influential nodes and hidden groups, as well as quickly and
reliably predict important trends and evaluate the quality of information. The
investigator will extend these metrics to dynamic networks and model information
spread on networks. The investigator will apply these methods to complex
networks that link different types of entities, namely, people, content, and
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considering network structure in the dynamics of
information spread will lead to more effective tools to leverage community's
knowledge to address a number of problems, including identifying important
trends, assessing information quality, and separating true information from
rumors.&lt;br/&gt;
