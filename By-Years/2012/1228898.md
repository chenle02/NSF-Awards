A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement
instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research
vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS) research fleet. The University of Hawaii (UH) supports two
research vessels that provide platforms for research in the fields of
oceanography, marine biology, geology and atmospheric science. They request
funds to purchase oceanographic instrumentation and equipment in support of the
multidisciplinary NSF/UNOLS projects to be undertaken on R/V Kilo Moana in 2012.
In order of priority, they propose to:

1) Rebuild UH CTD and Niskin bottle inventory $109,988 2) Purchase 12 kHz
acoustical pingers (2) $44,700 3) Purchase metered overboarding sheave $48,000
4) Purchase additional set of Niskin bottles $28,791 TOTAL $231,479

Broader Impacts: The principal impact of the present proposal is under
criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel
and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic
research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant
research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-
use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab
access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost
of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.
