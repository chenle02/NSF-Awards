The objective of this project is to develop a two-level performance model for
cellular manufacturing systems where the cells are connected via a material
handling system (MHS) and raw material and unfinished parts are stored in an
Automatic Storage/Retrieval System (AS/RS). Each cell by itself is a network of
workstations sharing a common finite storage space and a load/unload station.
These workstations are connected via a material handling unit. The model is such
that in one level the individual cells, the MHS and the AS/RS are each analyzed
separately. (The interdependency among these components is reflected in the
analysis.) The results from this level are then utilized in a second level in
order to define an aggregated network of stations each representing a cell, the
MHS, or the AS/RS. This network is then decomposed into subnetworks based on a
concept originally introduced by the Principal Investigator. The
interrelationship between the two levels requires an iterative numerical
technique in order to compute different performance measures. From a modeling
perspective, the model makes two significant contributions: (1) it explicitly
considers the MHS and the AS/RS, (2) it accounts for different scheduling
policies and, therefore, reflects the dynamic nature of the system to some
degree. From an application perspective, the model may be used in different
circumstances, ranging from the analysis of an individual cell to the analysis
of a large scale network type manufacturing system.
