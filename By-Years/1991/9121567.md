Fundamental research to elucidate phonon and electron-phonon properties of
limited dimension electronic/photonic materials structures, particularly quantum
well structures of compound semiconductors, and the recently discovered
superconducting fullerenes, K3C60 and Rb3C60 will be conducted. The research is
of particular interest for providing a sounder scientific basis for the
improvement of epitaxial growth and materials processing techniques, critical to
advanced electronics and photonics science and technology. %%% This research is
expected to provide deeper fundamental understanding of basic properties of
electronic/photonic materials. From an application point of view, understanding
these properties and their relationship to materials synthesis and processing is
beneficial to semiconductor device design and fabrication. The results will be
of importance in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed
integrated electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
