This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean scientists, particularly
those in the academic research community, to participate in the activities of
the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES). This organization was
established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in
order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and
atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource
usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in
the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea,
Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual
Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded
through this award.

Broader Impacts

The availability of travel funds not only provides influence on the scientific
planning for large scale international collaborations, but also provides the
opportunity to entrain colleagues and graduate students into research
collaborations, scientific sessions, and workshops. The scale of the North
Pacific Ocean demands broad collaboration, and the intellectual merits of
international collaboration leads to increased understanding of how diverse
scientists address their research. Entrainment of young scientists from both the
US and foreign countries into these collaborations represents one of the
capacity building strategies of PICES, and one which has a broader impact on US
science through appreciation of the diverse multicultural approaches to science.
Funds have been add sufficient funds to this project to provide full travel
support for young (<35 yr of age) academic scientists to the PICES annual
meeting. With matching funds from PICES this will allow participation by 3 young
academic scientists annually.
