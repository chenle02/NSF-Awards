Debugging is one of the most time consuming aspects of software development
costing the economy billions of dollars annually. Any automation that reduces
the manual effort involved in debugging can have a significant impact on
software productivity. An integral part of all debugging activities is the task
of fault localization. Once undesired behavior is spotted in a program, the
actual defect has to be identified before a fix can be developed. Most existing
fault localization techniques rely on the availability of high quality test
suites, which limits their applicability. One promising alternative is
techniques that statically analyze the faulty program fragment and do not rely
on testing. The goal of this project is to develop practical static fault
localization algorithms. If such algorithms were available, they would broaden
the scope of programs to which automated debugging tools can be applied and
enable the creation of novel tools that have the potential to change the way in
which software is developed and maintained.

The main research hypothesis of this project is that practical static fault
localization algorithms can be realized. To validate this hypothesis the PI will
explore abstractions that conservatively over-approximate the behavior of faulty
programs. The precision of these abstractions must be targeted so that the
error-relevant portions of the program are preserved and the defect is precisely
identified. The hypothesis that the construction of such targeted abstractions
can be automated is supported by the observation that there exists a connection
between fault localization and formal verification. The proposed work will
explore new techniques and algorithms that leverage this connection. These
algorithms will be implemented and evaluated in a static fault localization tool
that will serve as a vehicle for studying advanced automated debugging
techniques.
