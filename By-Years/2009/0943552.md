The International Plant Molecular Biology Congress series was established in
1985 to reflect and foster the growing development of plant molecular biology.
Prior meetings have been held roughly every four years at a variety of excellent
venues and were well attended. The four year gap is designed so that the
meetings can be an elite venue in which to announce major discoveries in plant
molecular biology and with the full knowledge that such discoveries take time.
The purposes of the Congress are to (1) apprise the international scientific
community of the current status of plant molecular biology; (2) articulate in
theory and in practice how basic advances in plant molecular biology can be
translated into crop improvement in both the developed and developing worlds;
(3) identify and highlight new technical advances that can aid plant research;
(4) identify and highlight emerging areas of plant molecular research; and, (5)
facilitate collaboration among groups and individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The
9th International Congress of Plant Molecular Biology will be held October
25-30, 2009 in St. Louis, Missouri. The participation of graduate students,
postdoctoral and beginning investigators will be fostered through travel awards.
Funding provided by NSF will be used to broaden participation of young
scientists and those from underrepresented groups from the US scientific
community. The Congress website provides ready access to all meeting
information, including the meeting program, invited speakers, accommodation,
abstract submission and registration information (http://www.ipmb2009.org/).
