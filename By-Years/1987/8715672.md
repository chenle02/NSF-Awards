This grant supports cooperative research on crystal structure between Dr. David
Williams of Lehigh University and Professor K.H. Kuo of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Metals Research, Shenyang, China. The project will
involve use of expertise in high resolution electron microscopy and
quasicrystals at Shenyang and expertise in analytical electron microscopy at
Lehigh to investigate the atomic symmetry of intermetallic phases, focussing on
recently reported phases exhibiting five-fold symmetry. This cooperative effort
is supported by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the US-China
Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences, which was established to promote
opportunities for cooperation in basic science between US and Chinese
scientists.
