This proposal from the University of Oregon requests funds to enhance the
planning of a Science and Technology Research Center in Soft X-Ray Science. This
multiinstitutional and multidisciplinary center will include participants with
expertise in physical, chemical, material, and biological sciences. The Center's
scientific focus will be on the microscopic characterization of heterogeneous
systems. The Center proposes to use bright new sources of synchrotron radiation
in the soft x-ray range to open new fields of research or to expand existing
ones to allow qualitatively different types of phenomena in heterogeneous
systems to be studied. Fields tentatively included are: spectroscopy and
microscopy, soft x-ray fluorescence, and time-resolved spectroscopy. These funds
will enable the institution to complete assimilation of a group of qualified
personnel, identify the most important scientific issues, plan the
administrative and scientific structure of the Center, and determine which
instrumentation will best serve the needs of the Center. The proposed center,
which will be at the frontier of a large and expanding interdisciplinary field
of research, will also serve users from universities, industry, and
international laboratories. The goal of the Center is to make a major
contribution in the area of soft x-ray science.
