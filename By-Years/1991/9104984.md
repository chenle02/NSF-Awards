The ability to perform fine phonetic distinctions is a fundamental unsolved
problem in computer speech recognition. Spoken letter recognition has practical
applications and requires discrimination of acoustically similar words. An
existing system will be improved in the following areas: (a) isolated letter
recognition, (b) multiple letter recognition (sequences separated by brief
pauses), and (c) continuous letter recognition (naturally spelled words). The
result of this research will be a highly accurate, speaker-independent system
that retrieves words from spellings. Strategies for improving isolated letter
recognition include improving the signal representation and the broad category
segmentation algorithm. Better letter segmentation strategies will be developed
for those cases when the speaker does not pause as requested. Two-level
classification will allow consideration of all possible letter sequences in
conjunction with discrimination of whole-letter classification as in isolated
letter recognition systems. Coarticulation models will be introduced to
recognize between phoneme transitions, including dynamically adjusted duration
models and boundary detection.
