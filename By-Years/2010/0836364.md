Magnetic reconnection is an important physical processes in many areas of plasma
physics. It is especially important in the solar corona, at Earth's
magnetopause, and in Earth's magnetotail. It is thought that anomalous
resistivity associated with plasma turbulence plays a significant and perhaps
critical role in the physical processes by which magnetic reconnection takes
place. Anomalous resisteivity has been examined many times in terms of quasi-
linear theory but a detailed non-linear theory has yet to be found. This project
will develop a fully non-linear theory of anomalous resistivity that arises from
the Buneman plasma instability. There is a significant risk of failure
associated with the research, but if successful a non-linear theory of anomalous
resistivity has the potential to be transformative.
