This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to design DNA-
aptamers that will be covalently linked to C1qrs and will subsequently induce an
immune response to the target organism. Specifically, this Phase I work has the
following key objectives: 1) recreating the aptamers against isolated surface
antigens for better specificity with 2'-fluorine or other chemical modifications
to make the aptamers nuclease-resistant, 2) cloning and sequencing the
successful aptamers, 3) devising new aptamer-C1qrs conjugation chemistry that
would be more amenable to future in vivo applications, and 4) verifying the
mechanism by transmission electron microscopy and other
techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is
in the area of infectious diseases. The proposed technology could have a very
far-reaching, positive impact on combating otherwise antibiotic-resistant
bacteria and parasitic diseases that are difficult to treat. New families of
aptamers could be made over time and coupled to the complement system in vivo to
combat emerging diseases and patient relapses due to organism mutations.
