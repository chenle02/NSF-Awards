This project is an innovative step toward a better understanding of sea-air
interaction, in particular gas fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere. The
investigators will initially modify in the laboratory a newly developed
Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer (APIMS) for shipboard
applications. After testing, the investigators will collaborate with a number of
other groups on ocean research cruises and use the APIMS system to measure
directly the sea-to-air flux of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an important biogenic
trace gas and natural secondary aerosol precursor. The broader impacts of this
research include developing a very powerful tool potentially of great importance
to the atmospheric community. The project results will provide important new
data on DMS fluxes useful for improving parameterizations of the sea-air
exchange process in global models, and provide a technical framework by which
other trace gases relevant to climate might be investigated in future studies.
Graduate students will also receive laboratory training and research experience
at sea under the project.
