Many highway bridges of steel girders are deteriorating because of environmental
effects, corrosion of steel components, and other damanages due to oversized
loads. To determine the safety and useful rating of the bridge, it is necessary
to analyze the effect of all the adverse conditions combined with the inherent
redundancy of the three-dimensional characteristics of the total bridge system.
This project will investiage the safety of the bridge by applying the latest
system reliability-based technology in conjunction with damage assessment
concepts to determine the following: develop a better undrstanding of the
effects of various damage conditions and redundances of the bridge; evaluate the
safty of the total bridge system; and develop guidelines to establish
classifications for different types of steel bridges.
