The project is a continuation of an earlier project which took 30 minority
teachers or teachers of minorities (classes are >50% minority) each year to
update their content knowledge in chemistry. They were given lectures and
laboratories over the course of two summers of work, each of four weeks
duration, at the University of California at Berkeley. They were also immersed
in examples and discussions about the different learning styles of culturally
diverse people including teaching skills. This program is specifically to
provide the second summer experience for those who have had only a single summer
experience. The cost share for this project is 3% of the grant.
