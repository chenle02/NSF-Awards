This award for dissertation research to Temple University will support an
anthropology graduate student studying how local `community based organizations`
provide social services to poor people in Philadelphia. Focusing on three
agencies, one dealing with low-income housing, one with health and educational
programs, and one with AIDS victims, the project will study how local poor
people are involved in the administration of the agencies and how their
dependence on these bureaucratically-provided services affects their local
political activities. The main hypothesis to be tested is that the more
bureaucratically organized the agency the less politically active the population
receiving services. Using methods of participant observation, in-depth
interviews of staff and clients, and a formal survey of both staff and clients,
the student will provide an in-depth picture of the way these agencies impact
the lives of the people they serve. This research is important because it will
provide a comparative, in-depth study of how poor people respond to political
and economic change as mediated through the social service system. In addition
by supporting the training of a professional social scientist the grant will add
to the nation's scientific capacity.
