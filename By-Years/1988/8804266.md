Collection and utilization of data from earthquakes is an important method to
learn lessons from the effects of seismic events. This research project uses
data from the October 1, 1987, Whittier-Narrows Earthquake. Five reinforced
concrete buildings that were instrumented with strong- ground motion equipment
are being studied by this research project. The strong-ground motion records are
being analyzed with a subsequent analysis of the theoretical response of the
buildings. The observed response is being compared with that determined by
computer methods thus allowing an evaluation of current design methodology
procedures and current seismic design code requirements.
