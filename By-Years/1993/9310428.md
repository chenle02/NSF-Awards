9310428 Dahl This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
Chemistry Program provides continued support for research on transition metal
carbonyl cluster compounds by Dr. Lawrence F. Dahl of the Chemistry Department,
University of Wisconsin-Madison. A major goal is to provide a unified
correlation between molecular geometries and electronic configuration for
various kinds of metal clusters, many of which gain or lose electrons without
rupture of their atomic frameworks. Research will be focused in two areas: 1)
isolation, structural determination, and physical-chemical characterization of
high nuclearity platinum, nickel, and mixed-metal carbonyl clusters; and 2)
synthesis, stereochemical-bonding analysis, and electrochemical reactivity of
small electron-rich metal clusters. Rational methods for preparing large
clusters and appropriate separation techniques to isolate and crystallize pure
species for characterization remain to be developed. In addition to determining
the structure of these complexes, their magnetic properties and modes of carbon
monoxide adsoption will be investigated. The reactivity of metal clusters with
main group reagents, which may be able to stabilize the species, will also be
studied. Attempts will be made to isolate metal phosphide and metal arsenic
clusters with novel bonding features. %%% Large metal clusters that can be
characterized using standard chemical methods may be useful models for
understanding the behavior of solid metal surfaces or lattice fragments, which
are often used in catalysis. Of particular interest are reactivity
characteristics and electronic features. The work may result in materials that
are effective as catalysts or in the improvement of reaction conditions or
surface preparation of catalytic materials currently in industrial use. ***
