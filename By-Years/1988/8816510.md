This is an investigation of pathways and processes of fine- grained sediment
dispersal in the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway of North America. The study
will focus on the Tununk Member of the Mancos Shale, exposed in central and
southern Utah. The specific objectives of this study are 1) to document the
location of river mouths along the coastline of the Tununk Sea, and the
orientation and areal extent of associated fine-grained- sediment dispersal
systems, and 2) to reconstruct processes of sediment transport on the ancient
shelf. Field observations and laboratory studies will involve analyses of time-
equivalent horizons in the Tununk Member, exposed at localities situated at
various positions perpendicular and parallel to the ancient shoreline.
Reconstructions of the ancient dispersal systems will employ concepts and
techniques derived from study of modern, muddy shelves, and will include
documentation of lateral trends in grain size, sedimentary macro- and
microfabric, and organic carbon isotopic ratios. Interpretations of processes on
the ancient shelf will rely on detailed field observations, as well as the use
of quantitative, sediment-transport models. The overall goals of this study are
to contribute to accurate paleogeographic, paleotectonic, and paleoceanographic
reconstruction of the Cretaceous Seaway, and to the development of techniques
for the reconstruction of other ancient environments of fine-grained sediment
deposition. Work will help to develop models used in exploration for energy
resources.
