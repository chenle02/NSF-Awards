Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Emerging demands on ubiquitous multimedia access continue to
push coding algorithms to ca-pitalize on content-based properties of images and
video. For example, by identifying and pre-serving regions-of-interest, or by
synthesizing textures at the decoder, it is possible to dramati-cally reduce
bandwidth requirements while preserving visual quality. These next-generation
coding strategies must be accompanied by next-generation quality assessment
algorithms that can handle the unique coding artifacts. Yet, determining quality
in a manner that agrees with human perception remains a grand research
challenge. Current quality assessment methods use a fixed analysis, whereas
human perception adapts to the image?s content. In order to meet increasing
demands on bandwidth, mobility, and IP streaming, there is a critical need to
push the state-of-the-art in quality assessment toward such a content-adaptive
approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the investigator conducts a
series of studies designed to examine the utility of content-adaptive models of
human vision for quality assessment of images/video containing degradation and
enhancement. The first study will collect a large set of subjective ratings for
enhanced and degraded images and video. This effort will provide ground-truth
data for training and validation. Using these data, the investigator will: (1)
Research new methods of quality as-sessment that can deal with images containing
enhancement. (2) Research and model the mul-tiple strategies employed by the
human visual system during quality assessment, including de-veloping content-
based neural models and image-adaptive techniques of strategy selection. (3)
Research the relationship between quality and regions-of-interest. This research
will lead to more accurate and robust methods of quality assessment, and it will
lay the groundwork for next-generation perceptual models that take into account
the adaptive nature of human vision.
