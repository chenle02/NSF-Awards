The ongoing revolution in next generation sequencing technologies and large-
scale structural genomics projects has led to dramatic increase in genomic
sequences and protein structures. This has brought biological research into a
data-driven era, where computational methods and facilities are needed for
handling and analyzing the huge volumes of data. In this project, the PIs
develop a cloud computing infrastructure called A Biology Cloud (ABC) to support
research in the areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. ABC is built
based on the OpenStack, which is supported by more than 180 large companies and
has quickly become the standard for cloud infrastructure. ABC will enable
researchers at North Dakota State University (NDSU) to conduct pioneering
research in their respective fields and promote and facilitate cross-
disciplinary collaborations among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project,
the PIs implement comprehensive educational plans to develop excellent academic
programs at NDSU and to provide new research and educational opportunities for
students. Through a variety of outreach activities, the PIs introduce modern
technologies to high school students and the public to enhance their interest in
STEM.&lt;br/&gt;
