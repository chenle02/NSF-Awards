The research addresses social networks of agents, where the agents learn about
the state of nature not only from private signals (i.e., signals only available
to the agents receiving them), but from neighboring agents too. The agents are
rational and cooperative, and in forming their beliefs about the state of
nature, they process all the information that is available to them. The research
aims at finding how information and misinformation can diffuse over networks of
agents. The objectives are to use the new theory to design better engineering
systems and to influence biological systems in ways so that beneficial outcomes
are attained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the research are to understand
the processes of belief evolution about the state of nature in time and/or space
in networks of agents and in a wide variety of settings. The knowledge of the
agents is expressed by their beliefs about the state of nature and is quantified
by posterior probability distributions. Unlike in the majority of known studies
where the agents want to get point estimates about the unknown state of nature,
the agents in the addressed problems strive for obtaining complete beliefs about
the unknown states as measured by posterior distributions. The state of nature
can be static or dynamic and the information acquired from neighbors about it
can be of continuous or discrete nature. For information processing, the agents
use the Bayes' rule. Endowed with Bayesian reasoning, the agents carry out
optimal information processing, and thereby it is expected that they beat the
performance of agents that use competing methodologies.
