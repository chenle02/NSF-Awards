This two-year project, which combines instruction in content and pedogogy with
exposure to diverse applications of mathematics. is designed to improve the
overall quality of middle school mathematics instruction in northern New Mexico.
Each year, 25 mathematics teachers from grades 6 through 8 will participate in a
four-week summer session that will strengthen their knowledge and understanding
of mathematics, enhance their teaching skills, and familiarize them with
curricular materials especially designed for Native American students. Through a
program of presentatations by employees of Los Alamos National Laboratory and
tours of its facilities, they will also learn about the applications of
mathematics in a wide variety of careers. Follow-up activities during the
academic year will reinforce the skills learned in the summer and monitor the
participants' activities in the classroom. During the first year, the project
will focus upon middle school teachers who are certified to teach elementary
school; the second year's activities will be targeted at middle school teachers
with secondary certification. This project provides a model for collaboration
among districts, universities, and scientific laboratories to improve
mathematics education. Los Alamos National Laboratory has made a substancial
commitment to the project, in the form of in-kind contributions.
