This research will develop parallel algorithms for machine vision, especially
for the interface between image processing and image understanding, with further
study of new and existing parallel architectures for efficient execution of
these algorithms. Architectures to be studied include fixed-size arrays,
reconfigurable meshes, reduced VLSI arrays, and arrays with hypercube
connections such as the Connection Machine. Data movement techniques will be
designed to support parallel solutions to image computations in mid-level and
high-level vision. Specific high-level problems to be studied are motion
analysis, image matching, and stereo matching, as well as several discrete
relaxation techniques. Neural-net approaches to vision will be supported by
design of routing techniques based on preprocessing of the underlying neural
graph and by mapping of such structures onto fine-grain parallel machines. A
Connection Machine at the USC Information Sciences Institute will be used to
evaluate data partitioning, data routing, and mapping techniques.
