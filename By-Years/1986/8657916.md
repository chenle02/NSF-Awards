The PI is a Presidential Young Investigator who describes his research as
follows: The goals of this research are to obtain increased understanding of the
detrimental random fluctuations in amplitude of frequency and polarization from
semiconductor laser diodes and to design lasers in which these dynamics can be
controlled. It is well known that light-matter interactions that involve intense
optical fields give rise to nonlinear mixing of optical waves and parametric
generation of new components in the optical spectrum. These same interactions
occur inside all laser cavities and crucially effect the dynamics of the laser
and the spectral properties of the light it emits. These nonlinear interactions
can cause the laser to be highly unstable. Small changes in feedback, pumping,
or temperature can trigger drastic changes in the spectral characteristics of
the light. Only over the last few years have detailed studies been made on the
physical origins of these instabilities in simple laser systems. Modeling has
been limited to dilute materials in which the optical gain results from an
ensemble of isolated individual atoms or molecules, such as in laser diodes. In
addition, we will be measuring and characterizing the spectral and noise
properties of laser diodes under various environmental and feedback conditions.
Semiconductor laser diodes are used in image scanning systems, fiber optic
communication links, optical radar, and optical disk read/write memories. All
these systems require a highly reliable source of coherent light. Unfortunately,
the light emitted from diode lasers is corrupted by seemingly random
fluctuations in amplitude, frequency, and polarization. The goals of this
research are to obtain increased understanding of these detrimental fluctuations
and to design lasers in which these dynamics can be controlled.
