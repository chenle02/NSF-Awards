9629775 Lynch There is genetic variation for almost every character in almost
every species. A leading species. Al leading explanation for this variation is
that there is a high mutation rate to mildly deleterious variations, and these
variants are slowly lost by natural selection. The study organism is the
microcrustacean Daphnia arenata; its short generation time, variation in
reproductive mode, and ease of handling in the laboratory and the field make it
easy to study these questions. These processes are general across all organisms,
so using a species that is easy to study allows general insights into how
mutation affects genetic variation. This project will estimate the mutation rate
for several life-history and morphological traits. The mean and variance of the
mutations' homozygous and dominance effects, and their interactions with other
genes will also be estimated; these values are necessary to understand how
selection acts on these mutations. These lab-derived estimates will be compared
with field populations to see how mutation affects genetic variation, inbreeding
depression, and genetic correlations among traits. This project is important for
estimating how much genetic variation in populations contributes to the
potential for response to changed conditions, such as new diseases or climate
change, and how much is simply deleterious and lowers the survival and fertility
of individuals. Estimates of the rate and effects of deleterious mutations
contribute to assessing the vulnerability to extinction in small populations of
endangered species.
