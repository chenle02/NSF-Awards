9314529 Norlander This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
research in materials theory between Peter A. J. Norlander at Rice University
and Jean-Pierre Gauyacq and Dominique Teillet- Billy at the University of Paris,
Orsay. The objective of their research is to increase understanding of the
dynamics of negative ion formation in atom-surface scattering. This
investigation will also include the study of effects such as the polarization of
the atom and the image force near a metal surface. The U.S. investigator brings
to this collaboration expertise in surface theory. This is complemented by the
French investigators' expertise in atomic and molecular physics. The project
also takes advantage of two complementary, yet contrasting methods for
calculating energy shifts and the lifetimes of atomic states which were
developed respectively by the U.S. and French groups. The development of a
theory on how atoms/molecules interact with surfaces is fundamental to our
understanding of processes such as catalysis and corrosion. This project will
advance that theory and the field of surface physics in general. ***
