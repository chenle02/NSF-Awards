The long-term objectives of this proposal include the elucidation of nephronal
heterogeneity of transport enzymes, the factors which regulate transport enzymes
in each nephron segment and the mechanism by which these factors regulate the
transport enzymmes, especially ATPases. An electroneutral H-K-Atpase has been
reported to be present in the stomach where it is responsible for H+ secretion.
Our preliminary observations indicate that an ATPase, is present in the distal
nephron where it may be responsible for K+ reabsorption and/or H+ secretion. The
specific aim of this project is to study the regulation of renal tubular K-
ATPase in the distal segments of the mammalian nephron by adrenocorticosteroids,
plasma K+ and extracellular volume (Na intake). This aim will be pursued by
determining K-ATPase activity in distal nephron segments of normal and
adrenalectomized rabbits by an ultramicroassay method developed in our
laboratory. The effects of different intakes of potassium and sodium and
administration of corticosteroids (aldosterone and dexamethasone) on K-ATPase
activity in the distal nephron segments will be studied. The relationships
between concentrations of K+ and cortocosteroids in the plasma and K-ATPase
activity in different nephron segments will then be determined. The kidney plays
an inportant role in maintaining the volume and composition of the body fluids.
Urine formation is corollary of the primary function of the kidney in regulating
the concentration of salts in the body fluids. There are two principal steps
involved in the formation of urine: 1) filtration of large amounts of nutrients
and salts, but not proteins and cells from blood, through specialized structures
called glomeruli, and 2) reabsorption of 100% of filtered nutrients (such as
glucose and amino acid) and approximately 99% of salts back into the blood
through microscopic structures called tubules which are connected to the
glomeruli. It is the second step which is regulated by several hormones
(specialized chemicals released into the blood by special organs of the body)
and the changes in salt composition of the blood due to a change in our diet. An
enzyme protein called Na-K-ATPase is present in the renal tubules and is
responsible for reabsorption of salt and nutrients from the filtered tubular
fluid back into the blood. Recently, we have discovered that another enzyme
called H-K-ATPase is also present in the distal parts of the renal tubule. Our
preliminary observations suggest that this H-K-ATPase may be responsible for
maintaining normal concentration of potassium in the blood during decreased
intake of potassium in our diet.
