Bats use echolocation to navigate without the aid of sight, using their nostrils
and ears as a sonar system to fly and hunt in a cluttered environment. No
current human-made sonar can reproduce this. Many bat species have been observed
to move their ears and noseleaf (a structure which sits atop the nostrils) as
they echolocate. This research will investigate how this motion effects how bats
interpret echo signals in the brain. The species to be studied, the greater
horseshoe bat, is native to China and has been shown to have a particularly
efficient "bio-sonar." This research will be conducted in collaboration with
Professor Hiroshi Riquimaroux at Shandong University in Jinan, China, who has
expertise in the study of physiology of hearing, particularly in bats.

The study will observe how motion in the pinna and noseleaf structures during
echolocation influences how the brain encodes auditory signals. A population of
Rhinolophus and Hipposiderus bats, two species native to China, will be tethered
while performing various sensing tasks. The local field potential responses will
be recorded to determine the overall effects of dynamics of anatomical
structures. The responses after a sensing task will be recorded to observe how
motion specifically effects signaling in the superior and inferior colliculi.
The study will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Hiroshi Riquimaroux at
Shandong University in Jinan, China. He is a neuroscientist with expertise in
the field of acoustics and the auditory system.
