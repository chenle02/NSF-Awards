are important to the national research and educational network effort, and U. S.
representation is appropriate. The PI will use FARNET, the organization of U. S.
academic and research network operators and providers, to publicize the
availability of assistance to prospective conference attendees, and to select
the persons to receive assistance. Only partial subsidies to approximately 34
attendees are planned.
