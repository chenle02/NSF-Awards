This is a study of gender inequalities across metropolitan labor markets.
Existing theory suggests that a principal cause promoting gender equality is the
growth of women's labor force participation. Participation rates are themselves
consequences of the demand for female labor, especially of the degree to which a
labor market has high concentrations of female-dominated occupations. A high
demand for female labor reduces other aspects of gender inequality through
market, normative, and political mechanisms. This research will test the
normative linkages by using survey data aggregated to the area level. The
political linkages will be tested with data from Equal Employment Opportunity
complaints and from other more general indicators of women's political
mobilization. Testing these ideas requires combining area and individual data
into three contextual analyses. First, area measures of labor demand, norms,
mobilization, and occupation will be related to the size of the gender
coefficient in a standard earnings function predicting hourly wages. Second, the
demand, normative, and political contexts will be related to the gender
composition of a worker's occupation. Third, a standard labor supply analysis
will be extended to include a measure of the occupational composition of the
area's labor force. A final analysis will summarize all the contextual
relationships within a single framework with areas rather than individuals as
the unit of analysis. %%% This research differs from earlier work on gender
differences in the rewards to human capital by emphasizing the role played by
the economic, social, and political environment in which women find themselves.
Only some of the progress towards gender equality that we have witnessed in
recent years can be understood as the result of the changing characteristics of
individual women. This project will systematically examine how differences in
labor markets, normative climate, and political mobilization might explain more
of the variation in gender equality than do studies based on individuals alone.
Thus it will strengthen our understanding of socio-political factors that shape
the rewards men and women receive for the human capital they possess.
