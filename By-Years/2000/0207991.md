This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
play important roles in training the future workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Role of
Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans in Synapse Formation." The project examines
the role of two chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in synaptogenesis: one
unnamed CSPG, recognized by monoclonal antibody Cat-315, which delineates
synaptic sites, and aggrecan, the main CSPG of cartilage. The unnamed CSPG is
being identified using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Once
identified, its function will be blocked to determine if it is essential to
synapse formation. To determine if aggrecan is involved in synaptogenesis, the
expression of synpatic markers is being studied in cultured cortices from
embryonic CMD mice, a naturally occurring aggrecan knockout mouse.
