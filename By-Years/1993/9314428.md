9314428 Grant From 25 June to 1 July 1994, the University of Colorado will host
on its Boulder campus a conference entitled: "Symposium on Diophantine Problems
in honor of Wolfgang Schmidt's 60th Birthday." Diophantine Problems are of three
types: 1)Diophantine equations, which ask how many and which whole numbers
satisfy given polynomials equations with whole number coefficients;
2)Diophantine approximation, which at its base asks how well real numbers can be
approximated by ratios of whole numbers; and 3)Diophantine geometry, which
studies the number of regularly spaced points within certain geometric objects.
Recently some remarkable results have been established in these fields, and it
seems an appropriate time to bring together the leading mathematicians in these
areas, so that they can interact with each other and disseminate ideas to young
researchers. It is a happy coincidence that this era of rapid progress coincides
with Schmidt's 60th birthday. ***
