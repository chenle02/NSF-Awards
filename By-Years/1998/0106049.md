provides a new, ruggedized computer system to update and expand the
oceanographic research data acquisition capabilities of the research vessel
Longhorn, a ship operated by the University of Texas Marine Science Institute as
part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
fleet. This improvement will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists
using the ship in their research during 2001 and future
years.&lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
