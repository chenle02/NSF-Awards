9713408 Seebaugh In this project, a high-volume low-turbulence aerosol inlet for
use on the NCAR C-130 aircraft will be designed, constructed, and its
performance demonstrated. This inlet will enable the sampling of supermicron
aerosols up to 10 micrometer aerodynamic diameter. A low turbulence inlet is
required to minimize particle losses to the inlet walls. Boundary layer suction
in the diffuser section of the inlet will be used as the turbulence mitigation
technique. The proposed inlet will have a flow rate of 200-400 liters per minute
to supply a high-volume cascade impactor system. This project will also make it
possible to design similar inlets for other more general aerosol sampling
applications since the target flow rate is higher than many other requirements.
A reference inlet (without boundary layer suction) will be built to provide a
baseline for evaluation of the turbulence reduction techniques. It will use a
conical diffuser of conventional design to produce a velocity reduction (ratio
of diffuser entrance to exit velocity) of a factor of 20. The reference inlet
will be tested over a range of conditions corresponding to the flight envelope
of the C-130 aircraft to determine the flow characteristics (time mean velocity
and turbulence intensity) at the diffuser exit. A low turbulence inlet (using
boundary layer suction) will be built as an enlarged version of the inlet
successfully demonstrated during prior NSF project. The diffuser section will be
manufactured from a cast and sintered porous plastic. About 60-80% of the inlet
flow will be removed by suction to achieve the desired velocity reduction of a
factor of 20. In the second year, the low turbulence inlet will be characterized
and optimized in the laboratory. A flight system for the C-130 aircraft will be
designed and constructed. By combining measurements of the flow characteristics
at the diffuser exit and computational fluid dynamics analysis of the flow
within and through the walls of the diffuser, the flow stre amlines inside the
inlet and the inertial enhancement for large particles will be determined. The
inertial enhancement will also be determined experimentally by measuring the
size distribution of particles outside the inlet and at the diffuser exit during
operation using either an optical particle counter or an aerodynamic particle
sizer for several selected test conditions. The objectives of the third year
effort are flight testing of the inlet and operational assistance for users of
the inlet system.
