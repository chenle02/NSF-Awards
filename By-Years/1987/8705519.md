This award will allow the PI to do two years of ethnographic fieldwork in
Highland New Guinea. The research will compare the roles of women and men in
ritual and in exchange and hostilities. The hypothesis to be tested is that
where women have more roles to play in exchange and ritual, their formal social
status is higher relative to the status of men. This research will measure
gender status variations in behavioral as well as ideological terms, as compared
with gender variations in the provisioning of exchange. The groups to be studied
are the southern Min peoples of Western Province, Papua New Guinea, an area
where many comparative studies exist for this research to build upon. The
importance of this research lies in the light it will shed on the sources of
gender inequality. In order to understand why women are treated differently than
men in our own society, we need to understand how, why, and when they are
trearted more and less equally in other societies.
