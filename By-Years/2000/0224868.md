ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SGER Sequence stratigraphy and paleocommunity
analysis of an Oligocene reef tract, Lares Limestone, Puerto Rico
(EAR-0224868)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Claudia Johnson&lt;br/&gt;Indiana
University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lares Limestone in Puerto Rico provides a
unique opportunity to study a 30 million year old Oligocene reef from its
initiation surface through its drowning, and from its seaword to landward
expression. The opportunity is short lived, for heavy tropical rainfall has
compromised the quality of this roadcut exposure. There is an urgency to
document and analyze this tropical carbonate platform and to address hypotheses
in the fields of paleobiology, sequence stratigraphy and paleoclimatology.
Research results will provide valuable information on evolution in a tropical
environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
