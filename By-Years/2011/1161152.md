The Mathematics Achievement as a STEP for STEM Success (MAS3) project at
Cleveland State University (CSU) is providing cohorts of students who place into
precalculus enrichment activities, including mandatory and high-quality
supplemental instruction. In addition, the MAS3 student cohorts are provided
with problem-based learning (PBL), research experiences, support services and
greater immersion into and utilization of existing campus and community assets
in an effort to increase the pipeline, persistence and graduation rates of these
students in STEM. Additionally, a PBL Seminar involves a collaboration among
science, mathematics, and engineering faculty and supplemental instructors that
provides structure and content to engage the cohort of students as well as other
students enrolled in other sections of precalculus and calculus. Moreover, the
project involves continuing and refining the Engineering Education Summer
Conference (EESC) as a tool to enhance MAS3 outreach and recruitment. The
conference brings together grades 7-12 educators and staff, university faculty,
and industry professionals for a critical conversation about implementing and
improving science and mathematics education in grades
7-12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project is laying the
groundwork for a long-term institutional transformation at CSU that will have
far-reaching impacts. MAS3 will provide a model of replication for other large,
public universities with a large segment of mathematically underprepared
students. In addition to providing a research-grounded support system to
maximize the students' success, the project is targeting at-risk students
accepted by CSU to study the effects of these interventions to various important
educational measures of their success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:
The project represents a well-documented model to increase the pass rates of a
major barrier to STEM and college success: precalculus and calculus courses.
Particularly because the project is focusing recruitment activities on student
populations where this barrier has been particularly problematic (e.g.,
underrepresented students including females, those with weak academic
preparation or low income). In addition, the project is serving as a model for
the educational efficacy of PBL seminars that bring together faculty
stakeholders in mathematics, science, and engineering. The summer institutes
also is serving as a model for other institutions to recruit STEM students and
to initiate dialogue at the K-12 level needed for students to be adequately
prepared to begin college-level science, mathematics, and engineering
coursework.
