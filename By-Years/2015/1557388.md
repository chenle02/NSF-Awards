With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher
Scholarship Program, Hofstra University will partner with Nassau Community
College (NCC) and four high-need school districts on Long Island, for this
Scholarships &amp; Stipends Phase II project, Noyce Scholars Program Phase II:
Expanding the Model. The project will support 22 juniors/seniors/post-
baccalaureate students who are majoring in mathematics or a science discipline
(or who have completed such a major) and who are preparing to teach secondary
mathematics or science in a high-need district. Each Scholar will receive 1 or 2
years of scholarship support. The new teachers will use vetted methods of
mathematics and science instruction, connecting concepts across disciplines and
engaging learners in collaborative problem solving related to real world
contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the Phase I project, this project
will offer an enhanced preparation and development program with seven components
specifically developed and refined based on Phase I project evaluation. Project
activities include: (a) an enhanced new recruitment program; (b) STEM
internships for freshman and sophomore students; (c) immersive early teaching
experiences: (d) coaching of cooperating teachers in high-need school districts;
(e) regular colloquia, conferences, and institutes; (f) leadership roles for
Phase I alumni; and (g) an induction initiative for new teachers. The project
will use quantitative and qualitative data to address research questions such
as: (1) What are the longitudinal outcomes of Phase 1 Scholars, including their
commitment to STEM teaching; service commitment years; perceptions of their
preparedness to teach in high-need schools, retainment/support activities; and
quality of teaching STEM in high-need schools? (2) To what extent does the
integration of cooperating teachers into teacher preparation activities
contribute to the preparedness and retention of Scholars?
