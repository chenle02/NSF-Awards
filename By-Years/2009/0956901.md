This collaborative research team will study plasma physics processes occuring in
the solar corona, and the investigators are motivated by the fact that the
corona provides physical regimes which are inaccessible to laboratory
experiments. The researchers will concentrate on making remote sensing
measurements of the corona and inner solar wind using the Very Large Array (VLA)
radiotelescope, as well as its upgrades (collectively called the Expanded Very
Large Array, or EVLA), and interpreting those observations in terms of coronal
plasma physics. The team's primary observational technique will be the
measurement of Faraday Rotation of background radio sources that are occulted by
the solar corona. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will make Faraday Rotation
measurements using the EVLA that will be deeper in the corona than previously
obtained, at altitudes of 2 to 5 solar radii. This approach will yield
information on the properties of the coronal magnetic field and
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in this inner region. The team will then
use MHD models of the corona to create synthetic Faraday Rotation measures for
the same line-of-sight paths measured with the VLA and EVLA, in order to compare
results and test of the accuracy of their models against actual
observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lead Principal Investigator (PI) in Iowa
will mentor University of Iowa undergraduate and graduate students participating
in this project, and the Co-PI in Boston will offer research experiences for
these students at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The lead PI
will also engage in public outreach through the Eastern Iowa Observatory and
Learning Center (EIOLC) and collaborations with amateur astronomy groups,
particularly the Cedar Amateur Astronomers of Cedar Rapids and the Astronomy
Club of the Quad Cities, both in Iowa.
