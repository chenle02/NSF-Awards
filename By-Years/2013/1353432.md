This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at developing
a comprehensive software suite for 3D imaging. 3D imaging is the capture of
physical shape and motion as digital data. The technology can be used to create
special effects, take measurements in engineering, and automatically check
product quality in factories. Current 3D imaging systems are often too
expensive, too slow, or too inaccurate to provide viable commercial solutions.
This project will develop new techniques for three areas within the broader
topic of 3D imaging: reconstruction, inspection, and motion capture. The
objective of the project is to develop fast software that can run on low-cost,
commercially available sensors and computing hardware. The software will be
designed to take advantage of new kinds of computer processors found in
computers and mobile phones: heterogeneous processors. To provide high-quality
results on this emerging computing platform, the project will develop new
mathematical and software approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader
impact/commercial potential of this project will result from the introduction of
low-cost, high performance 3D imaging tools to the marketplace. 3D printing is
an example of the way in which reducing cost and making a technology easier to
use can create entirely new applications and markets. The research objectives of
this project will lead to 3D imaging products that are cheaper and easier to use
than today's solutions. 3D imaging addresses large and growing markets in
engineering, inspection, manufacturing, surveying, and product development. It
can enhance these industries by reducing costs and saving time. Making the
technology easier to use will allow it to be adopted more widely, cultivating
new vocational skills and opportunities. An additional impact of this research
will be to make 3D imaging accessible to researchers and professionals in new
application areas such as medicine, consumer technology, and security systems.
