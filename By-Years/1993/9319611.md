9319611 ULEMAN ABSTRACT People often make "snap judgements" of others, and
these may be hard to ignore. Recent research shows that people sometimes make
these judgements without even realizing it, and despite their best intentions to
avoid them. These "spontaneous trait inferences" (STIs) can affect subsequent
judgements, without the judge's knowledge. Reaction time methods, and word-stem
completion measures, allow us to detect and study these unconscious STIs. STIs
can be abstract or concrete (e.g., "good" vs. "charitable"). What determines
their level of abstraction? The researcher will investigate their abstractness,
and the possibility that prior evaluations of the person affect STI's
generality. For example, if someone acts generously, that might be spontaneously
interpreted as "good" if you already feel positively about the person, but
merely as "charitable" (a less general influence) if you feel negatively.
Previous demonstrations of STIs have all been based on the target person's
behaviors. But we also form impressions from how others act toward the target
person. A second set of experiments will investigate whether we do this
spontaneously. Just as traits can be spontaneously inferred, perhaps goals
and/or behaviors are also spontaneously inferred. The third set of experiments
will explore this possibility. In addition, all these experiments seek
personality differences between those who readily make STIs and those who do
not. This basic research on impression formation has potential applications to
personnel assessments and diagnoses of psychopathology, as well as to
understanding stereotyping, daily social interaction patterns, and long-term
social relationships.
