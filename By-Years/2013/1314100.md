The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is part of an international effort
to develop and evaluate technologies needed for a muon-based neutrino source and
a future muon collider. MICE is located at the ISIS accelerator facility at the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. This award provides partial support to
the University of California Riverside and the Illinois Institute of Technology
to complete ongoing efforts in hardware and software development and
commissioning, prior to data taking. A broader impact of the program is to
engage graduate students and postdocs in forefront accelerator physics research.
