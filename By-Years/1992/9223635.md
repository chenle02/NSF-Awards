The objective of this interlaboratory testing program is to use twelve of the
most common ASTM geotechnical standards and involve an estimated twenty
voluntary laboratories distributed across the United States to develop four
standard reference soils. The test results will be used to develop reliable
precision statements for the selected standards which will be submitted for
consideration to the appropriate technical subcommittee for inclusion in each
standard. Four soils, which represent a wide range of typical deposits, will be
used for the program. Large quantities of each soil will be processed to provide
sufficient material for possible retesting and establish a stockpile for
commercial use. At the conclusion of the research, these stock piled soils will
be standard reference soils for the twelve standards. These soils will be
available through ASTM Institute of Standards Research (ISR) for quality
assurance and quality control programs, research applications and education and
training.
