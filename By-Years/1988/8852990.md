A quadropole mass spectrometer and associated computer hardware and software for
instrument control and data analysis is being acquired. The instrumentation is
being interfaced to an existing/packed column gas chromatograph, giving gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry and interactive data acquisition analysis
capabilities which were previously nonexistent in the department. Students (both
majors and non-majors) are using the apparatus in fulfilling laboratory
assignments in Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Physical Chemistry
courses. The equipment is also being used extensively by students in the
required senior research program. While the program had previously integrated
the chemistry subdisciplines within the laboratory program attached to
individual courses, especially Instrumental Analysis, this is the first the
vertical integration has been accomplished. The progressively challenging and
instructive hands-on exercises centered around the modern GC/MS is the
cornerstone of the program. The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal
sources.
