Some fundamental problems of meteorology, oceanography, and fluid mechanics will
be addressed. The areas to be covered include a) The open boundary conditions
for limited domains simulations, b) The study of balanced and unbalanced models
in atmosphere sciences, c) Statistical solutions of Navier-Stokes equations and
turbulence. These problems will be addressed by a robust combination of advanced
mathematical tools, and performant computational tools. This study is aimed at
improving, in the long range, the numerical simulations on computer of these
phenomena whose understanding is essential for many problems in environment and
energy. For instance problem a) is important for improving local weather
predictions with applications including e.g. agriculture and aviation. Problems
b) is important for understanding the large scale motion of the atmosphere;
however the techniques used (averaging of oscillations) are also needed in many
other fields, in particular biomathematics. Problems c) are more fundamental in
nature, they pertain to the understanding of turbulence, that is a serious
impediment in many studies on energy (and environment). By its nature the
proposal has a strong interdisciplinary component, with senior geophysicists
directly involved in topics a) and b). The proposal has also a strong
educational component (interdisciplinary training of graduate students and post
docs).
