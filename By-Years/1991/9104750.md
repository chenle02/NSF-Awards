This research involves the further development of a technique originally
developed for the purpose of locating disagreements between remotely located
large files using a minimum of communication. The technique has been found to be
quite effective for outer code decoding of concatenated codes for error control
over a noisy channel. The code rules are rather arbitrary, and yet correction of
almost cases of d-2 or fewer outer code symbol errors is possible with a
decoding complexity which increases no faster that as the cube of the block
length. Two areas are emphasized in this project. one area relates to the
implications and relative advantages of using the new technique in various error
control coding applications. The other area relates to the investigation of
applications to various problems of communication, maintenance, and verification
of the identity of replicated remote files in an efficient manner.
