This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Henry Kobulnicky will continue a
long-term observational program at the University of Wyoming to determine the
properties of close massive binary stars. He will lead a team of graduate
students, undergraduates, secondary school teachers and their students to
measure the frequencies, mass ratios, periods, and rotation rates in the
populous young Cygnus OB2 Association. Close massive binary systems are the
progenitors of energetic phenomena such as X-ray binaries and some classes of
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. Population synthesis models that predict the
frequency of these events require reliable estimates of the binary frequency,
mass ratios, and period distributions. Binary statistics also constrain models
for the formation of massive stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will
include the participation of students from several of Wyoming's community
colleges through on ongoing collaboration with faculty at Casper College and
Northwest College. It will also support the operation of Wyoming Astrocamp
through 2013. Astrocamp is a long-term education/research partnership between
Wyoming's science teachers, junior-high students, college students, and
organizations serving at-risk youth. Astrocamp will consist of a one-week summer
college experience for junior high students and a weekend camp for youth from
Wyoming's Boys and Girls Clubs. Astrocamp's goals are closely tied to
educational standards of the State of Wyoming.
