Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
available to the chemist for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It
is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of
atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential
to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This award from the
Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will help the Department of Chemistry
of Michigan State University to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer and to
upgrade an existing NMR spectrometer. The areas of chemical research that will
be enhanced by the acquisition include: 1) Structure and function of various
natural tetrapyrrolic macromolecules 2) Polycyclic aromatic compounds with
multi-rotational barriers 3) New cycloaddition photochemistry and photochemistry
of rotationally constrained compounds 4) Chemistry of low-valent metal clusters
with unconventional ligands 5) Photochemistry of binuclear (Ir, Rh) complexes
with fluorophosphine ligands 6) Lewis acid catalyzed organic rearrangements and
cyclyzations.
