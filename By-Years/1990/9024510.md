The investigators will sample the inquilines that are found in the nests of ants
and termites in three general areas of North Queensland, Australia. These areas
are the Iron Range, the top end of the York Peninsula, and the area around Cape
Tribulation. The inquilines (usually called myrmecophiles and termitophiles)
belong to a wide variety of taxonomic groups and exhibit a wide variety of
ecological relationships to the ants and termites ranging from parasites to
detritus feeders that clean up the kitchen middens of the nests. The
significance of this proposed expedition lies in the creation of collections of
specimens and data which will be used in future research by the investigators
and by many other taxonomic experts. Specific projects which will benefit
immediately are the revision of the Termitonannini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae),
the revision of the Dorylomimini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae), and the revision
of the Phoridae (Diptera). The project will increase the scientific resources of
the United States and Australia through the increase of our samples of insects
from hard to sample, and unique areas.
