This research is directed towards establishing the feasibility of using wave
energy to provide high-pressure seawater at remote coastal and island locations.
This has potential commercial value because of the many possible uses of high-
pressure seawater: it can be circulated in onshore aquaculture tanks, passed
through a reverse osmosis membrane to produce fresh water, or passed through an
impulse turbine to generate electric power. The entire project (Phases I through
III) is focused on the small-scale needs of rural areas in developing countries,
where even the provision of a few thousand liters of fresh water per day of a
few kilowatts of power would significantly improve basic living conditions and
facilitate economic growth. For example, the shoreside provision of ice
(requiring both fresh water and electricity) would enhance the cash-earning
power of local fisheries. In order to establish the feasibility of this concept,
fundamental research is needed on the hydrodynamic behavior of the wave energy
absorber, which is an inclined cylindrical pipe, entirely submerged beneath the
sea surface, with one end resting on the seafloor.
