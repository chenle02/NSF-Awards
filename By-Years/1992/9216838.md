The analysis and interpretation of an eXpendable Current Profiler (XCP) survey
and a Richardson Number (RiNo) float time series collected in a near-inertial
wave critical layer at the base of a warm core ring will be completed. The study
will determine what fraction of the trapped wave energy flux-divergence is lost
to turbulent dissipation (mixing).
