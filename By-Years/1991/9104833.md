The principal investigators will measure fractionation factors for oxygen
isotopes between vapor and silicate glasses, melts, and crystals. The results of
this project will be applicable to the interpretation of oxygen isotope
compositions of cogenetic igneous rocks in terms of petrogenetic processes and
to developing a more complete understanding of the compositional and structural
factors that influence the partitioning of oxygen isotopes among geological
materials.
