9360095 Keefe Drag due to turbulent skin friction substantially penalizes the
performance and economics of oil and gas pipelines. Using two new control ideas
originating from research in nonlinear dynamical systems, Nielsen Engineering
and Research (NEAR) has recently used numerical simulations to demonstrate the
possibility of 50-60% drag reductions at constant massflux in rectangular
channel flow, and proposes to apply these same ideas to drag reduction in
circular pipes. In rectangular channel flow a key ingredient for the successful
application of these controls has been the use of low-drag, nonlinear flow
states as goal dynamics. While these finite amplitude states in channels and
boundary layers have been know for a number of years, their existence in pipe
flow has not yet been demonstrated. In the proposed research Nielsen Engineering
intends to demonstrate the existence of nonlinear neutral states in pipe flow,
and calculate their form. One part of the research will make use of intriguing
new theoretical results that suggest some of these finite amplitude states may
not be spatially periodic. The other will use established linear and nonlinear
stability techniques on the related problem of elliptical pipe flow, with the
intent of demonstrating a connection between the nonlinear states of this flow
and pipe flow as ellipticity decreases.
