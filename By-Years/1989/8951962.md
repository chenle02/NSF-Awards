This project will improve the soil science curriculum at the University of
Minnesota, Waseca (UMW) through the use of analytical equipment. The new
equipment will greatly enhance instruction in the areas of soil testing and
plant analysis, soil fertility, and basic soil science. Upon graduation,
virtually all students in the various majors of agriculture and horticulture at
UMW will have to develop soil fertility programs that are economically viable
and environmentally sound. Students need a thorough understanding of the tests
used to evaluate the fertility status of soils and plant tissue. They also need
to understand the movement of nutrient ions through the soil and the potential
for contamination of surface and groundwater. Effective teaching of these
concepts must take place in a laboratory setting with appropriate
instrumentation. Instruments to be utilized in the project include an atomic
absorption spectrophotometer to analyze soil and plant extracts for K, Ca, Mg
and micronutrients; a fiber-optic colorimeter to measure phosphorous; a nitrate
electrode and pH/ISE meter to determine nitrate levels in soil and water
samples; and a microwave system for digestion and ashing of plant tissue. The
equipment will be used by students in regular classes and by high-ability
students conducting undergraduate research projects. The University will match
the award with an equal amount of funds.
