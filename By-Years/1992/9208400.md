This project deals with electronic and magnetic properties of semiconductor
heterostructures. These materials are being studied with far infrared (FIR) and
visible spectroscopy. The heterostructures are fabricated in-house. The project
has three components. First is FIR magnetospectroscopy of interfaces between
III-V semiconductors and II-VI based diluted magnetic semiconductors, in order
to determine how the two-dimensional electron gas on the III-V side of the
interface is affected by proximity to magnetic electron wave functions from a
DMS material. Second, the fundamental electronic and magentic properties of
digital alloys (ultra-short-period superlattices grown monolayer- by-monolayer)
are being studied by spectroscopy. Finally, the program concentrates on optical
studies of DMS materials in which band tuning can be achieved by Zeeman
adjustment of the band alignment at interfaces.
