9625919 Chan X-ray scattering provides an extremely powerful probe of the
microscopic properties of condensed materials systems. The proposed 3He
refrigeration system and associated electronics and gas handling components will
allow us to apply X-ray scattering techniques to materials systems at low
temperatures, in particular quantum liquids. Such capabilities are not available
at any synchrotron x-ray source in the world. Thus, this 3He refrigeration
system will provide a unique and valuable facility. The proposed refrigeration
system will be initially used for the study of disorder and impurities in helium
mixtures. This disorder can be introduced either through the introduction of
annealed impurities, such as 3He in 4He, or confinement in porous glasses, such
as vycor or aerogel, or both. The presence of disorder can have profound effects
on the critical behavior, transport properties and phase separation of 3He-4He
mixtures. It can also modify the microscopic structure, as reflected in the pair
correlation function of the atoms. The research studies will directly address
these microscopic issues using x-ray scattering. The research will make use of
either the National Synchrotron Light Source currently operating at Brookhaven
National Laboratory or the Advanced Photon source which is under construction at
Argonne National Laboratory. The proposed refrigeration system will be designed
with sufficient flexibility to allow it to be used on a variety of instruments
at either of these sources. %%% This project will have broad scientific impact
to the field of low temperature materials research and will provide unique
capability to the important area of x-ray scattering for the advancement of
characterization of materials of economic importance. ***
