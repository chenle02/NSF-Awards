This award will provide one-half of the funds required to purchase, ship and
upgrade a used electron microprobe that will be operated in the Department of
Earth Sciences at Iowa State University. The University is committed to
providing the remaining 50% of the funds required. The upgraded instrument will
be used in research projects in the Department of Earth Sciences as well as by
solid state chemists and materials scientists at Iowa State and the Ames
Laboratory. The microanalytical capabilities of the microprobe technique will be
applied to research in meteoritics, igneous petrology, ore deposits, and studies
of new oxides, nitrides and sulfides of transition metals.
