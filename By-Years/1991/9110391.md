This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Cunningham's research on a
novel IP3-dependent protein kinase which Dr. Cunningham has discovered in
erythrocyte membranes. This is the first report of a direct role for IP3 in
protein phosphorylation, and as such is potentially extremely important. Dr.
Cunningham has proposed a model which links IP3-dependent protein
phosphorylation with the known signal-transducing function of IP3, namely the
opening of calcium channels. If successful, the purification and
characterization of an IP3- dependent protein kinase is anticipated to have
significant impact on the field of signal transduction, as well as significantly
enhance Dr. Cunningham's career.
