As an engineering design evolves, there is a constant interplay of system
definition and performace analysis. A successful computer-aided design system
must, therefore, not only support tools for convenient interactive three-
dimensional geometry definition and modification, but also provide algorithms
and computational resources for rapid system simulation. These critical issues
of three-dimensional geometry definition and high speed computation are
addressed in a unified fashion by the Geometry-Defining Processor to be explored
under this research grant. Geometry-Defining Processors, or GPDs, are
microprocessors housed in physical geometric packages that can be manually
assembled or reconfigured. An individual GPD has information on its own
parameters, is able to communicate with neighboring GPDs, and is capable of
performing independent numerical computations. An assembly of GPDs is able to
define both a three-dimensional system geometry and, operating as an optimally
connected parallel processor, efficiently solve the associated continuum partial
differential equations needed for design evaluation. Combining simplicity-of-use
with powerful computational capabilities, the GPD design system should prove
useful in a broad range of engineering applications.
