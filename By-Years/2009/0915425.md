The Internet is now the world's dominant information infrastructure. Numerous
requests from Internet users and their applications compete for shared resources
in multiple ways. It is therefore critical to efficiently allocate limited
network resources in order to provide high quality services. Improving the
performance of the Internet in this manner has the potential to have extremely
broad impact.

Resource management becomes even more challenging when mobile devices connecting
to the Internet are considered. Designing efficient algorithms is difficult
mainly due to the following factors: (1) diverse and unpredictable resource
requests; (2) physical limitations on Internet links, on buffer space in network
switches, on capacity of wireless channels, and on battery power in mobile
devices.

This project aims to provide solutions for several fundamental algorithmic
problems in networked systems and applications. Robust and insightful online
algorithms will be developed for network switches forwarding prioritized packets
and energy management in mobile devices. The objective is to understand the
mathematical structure of these problems, to design elegant and easy-to
implement online algorithms, to provide rigorous analysis on their performance
bounds, and to integrate these algorithms into the real systems to achieve
better performance.
