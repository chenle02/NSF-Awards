Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is easy to perfectly tile a flat
surface with hexagons, as in parks and playgrounds and bathroom floors. But when
you try to tile a curved surface, the hexagonal tiling is frustrated and the
defects, for example pentagons, are essential for relieving the stresses and
strains. Witness the 12 pentagons required to close an otherwise hexagonally
tiled geodesic dome, or a soccer ball or a C60 molecule. The present study
introduces a unique system whereby particles bound to a surface of arbitrary
curvature solve the geometric problem and create a relaxed structure with
defects arranged optimally. The study involves colloidal particles, thirty times
smaller than a human hair, which arrange themselves on different shaped water
droplets a tenth of a millimeter in diameter. The particles are imaged
microscopically and added or moved with focused light, optical tweezers.
Students working on this project are trained in the latest optical techniques.
The video imaging of defects and their dynamics in crystals is a great
pedagogical tool for instructing students and researchers at all levels as to
the basic properties of liquids and solids. Since geometry is important for
structures at all length scales these results will be important for designing
new molecules, for assembling nano and colloidal particles and for engineering
new architectural structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical
Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology plays a crucial role in the geometry and
order of materials and topological defects, disclinations and dislocations,
determine many of the mechanical properties of crystals. Curvature tends to
frustrate periodic order, and here topological defects play an important role in
relieving the resulting stresses and strains. Witness the 12 pentagons required
to close an otherwise hexagonally tiled geodesic dome, or a soccer ball or a C60
molecule, curvature requires the introduction of topological defects, pentagons
- disclinations, which force reorientation. But within the past several years it
has been realized that although topology constrains the net number of defects it
is energetics that dictates the actual arrangements. The present study
introduces a system and a number of techniques to experimentally observe and
manipulate mobile colloidal particles which are bound to an arbitrarily curved
surface oil-water interface. Students involved will be trained in the latest
soft matter and optical techniques. The video images are great pedagogically for
students and researchers at all levels. These topological results will be
important for designing new molecules, for assembling nano and colloidal
particles and for engineering new architectural structures.
