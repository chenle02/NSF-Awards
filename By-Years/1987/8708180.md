The objective of this project is to explore the problem of dessication cracking
of clay liners used to cap hazardous waste landfills. The project will quantify
the soil stresses which accompany cracking, the resulting crack geometry and its
time variation, and the mechanics of flow through the cracked soil. The findings
will be incorporated in an existing numerical model of flow through clay liners.
The developments from this project are expected to significantly expand previous
research in the flow through clay liners, and provide a base for even more
sophisticated studies of the problem. The research is expected to impact
landfill designers, regulatory agencies, contaminant transport modeling, and
others involved in infiltration/percolation studies or the design of containment
systems.
