EAR-0125459&lt;br/&gt;T. Guy Masters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI
proposes to convene a symposium at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in
theoretical and computational seismology. As discussed in detail in the
proposal, the conference is being held to bring together experts in theoretical
seismology to address the explosion of observational data sets in seismology and
what is necessary to keep parallel advances in theory/computation. The issues
being addressed are central to understanding Earth dynanics, and will be crucial
for the optimization of the MRE-funded USAffay component of Earthscope. Funds
will be used to offset travel and accommodation expenses for participants
(especially students and post docs) and to pay for publication costs of a
symposium volume. The Pls requested $18,000 in support, but I asked for a
revised budget and have agreed to provide funds at the level of $15,000
