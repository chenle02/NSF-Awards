The main focus of this research will be on the relationship, via variously
defined trace maps, between K-theory and the free loop space. Several basic
problems in geometry, algebra and differential topology hinge on a better
understanding of this connection. These include the isomorphism conjecture of P.
Baum and A. Connes and those that it implies (e.g., the Novikov and Gromov-
Lawson-Rosenberg conjectures), the Bass conjecture on the image of the Hattori-
Stallings trace map for group rings, and the Milnor-Friedlander conjecture
concerning the K-theory of a Banach algebra with coefficients in a finite
abelian group. The free loop space also plays an important role in understanding
the homotopy-type of the space of stable pseudo-isotopies of a manifold, and
variants seem to be closely related to the integral relative K-theory of
nilpotent ideals. The planned work builds on progress in these areas; in
particular, the investigator's solution of the KABI and Karoubi conjectures
(with Weibel), new information on the integral relative K-theory of spaces, and
a formulation of the operator algebra K-theory of spaces (with P. Baum and A.
Connes). Among the algebraic theories which make it possible to compute answers
to topological questions about spaces are the various so-called K-theories. The
essence of this project is to establish relations among these K-theories and
between them and some other algebraic theories for dealing with topology.
