This Phase I SBIR program will investigate and develop a new process for
depositing catalysts on fuel cell membrane and electrode assemblies (MEAs). The
proposed process for producing reliable MEAs is conducive to high volume
manufacturing using fabrication tools familiar to industry. In addition to high
rate production capability, the proposed process optimizes the
electrode/catalyst structure allowing us to reduce the catalyst loading that
further reduces the MEA cost. This program will demonstrate the process in
operating fuel cell stacks and evaluate the economics of employing the process
on a larger scale. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell is a promising power
source for vehicles with residential, stationary, and portable power
applications.
