9505359 Beyette This award is under the International Junior Investigator and
Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables U.S. scientists and engineers to
conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards
provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary
facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad. This award will
support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Fred R. Beyette to work
with Dr. Graham John Rees at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom.
The proposed research involves the implementation of an NxN crossbar switch
using piezoelectric symmetric self electro- optic (S-SEED) devices. The main
objectives are to investigate the interface between device research and system
demonstration, to develop piezoelectric S-Seed device arrays for a NxN crossbar
switch, to utilize the crossbar switch as a test bed for evaluation of S-SEED
array uniformity, and to isolate barriers to the development of practical
systems based on these devices. ***
