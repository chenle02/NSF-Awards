Preliminary work by the PIs has shown that application-level information can be
exploited to greatly reduce the amount of redundancy required to deal with
transient failures, which are by far the most common type of failure. For
example, in a radar target-tracking application, our approach required only 15%
redundancy to provide complete fault-tolerance against transient faults. Another
use of ALFT is in providing a temporary patch in the event of a permanent
processor failure, allowing the system more time to execute a recovery
algorithm.

ALFT is orthogonal to other approaches to fault-tolerance, so that it can be
used either by itself or in combination with them. For example, a designer might
use ALFT to guard against transients, and make a small amount of hardware
redundancy available, in the form of line-replaceable spares, to deal with
permanent failures.

The objective of this project is to develop Application-Level Fault Tolerance
strategies and investigate their effectiveness for various classes of real-time
applications. The main focus will be to generalize our approach to include as
many different types of applications as possible, develop the most suitable
strategy for each application type and evaluate the efficiency of the developed
scheme.
