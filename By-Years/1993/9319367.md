9319367 Budnick Technical abstract: The microscopic origin of the increase of
magnetization and Curie temperature in gas insertion modified hard magnetic
systems (including A samarium iron alloy) will be studied with nuclear magnetic
resonance techniques. The improved magnetic properties can be achieved by the
introduction of C and/or N into interstitial sites. Results will be correlated
with conclusions drawn from neutron diffraction and Moessbauer studies. Non-
technical abstract: It has been recently established that the magnetic
properties of certain transition metal rich materials were significantly
improved with the addition of gases such as carbon and/or nitrogen. This, as yet
unexplained, discovery is of special interest to fundamental science but also to
the development of improved magnetic recording heads. The results will be
compared to previous measurements with other techniques, notably neutron
scattering and Moessbauer studies. ***
