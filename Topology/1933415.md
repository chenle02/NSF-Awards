This award provides support for participants of the "Current Developments in
Mathematics" conference to be held November 22-23, 2019 and annually thereafter
at the Harvard University Science Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The CDM
conference is jointly sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Prominent speakers are invited to report on recent
breakthroughs in various fields of mathematics. The conference is advertised
widely to students and early-career researchers, and provides an excellent
opportunity for them to interact with world-leading researchers and with the
Boston area mathematics community. More information can be found on the
conference website: http://www.math.harvard.edu/cdm/

The format of the conference aims to maximize the benefit for a wide range of
participants. The speakers are asked to divide their lectures into two parts,
one of which is intended to be accessible to a broader audience and giving a
general idea of the recent work, while the other part contains more details. The
conference can be thus regarded as an intensive two-day colloquium style
overview of various exciting developments, providing an opportunity for
mathematicians to learn about advances in fields other than their own area of
specialization. The results presented at the conference are collected in
manuscripts beforehand and are distributed to the participants during the
conference. The proceedings are later published.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
