9408218 Shore This research project involves a student of cultural anthropology
from Emory University studying the cultural models of interpersonal behavior
used by Cambodian peasants. The methods to be used include participant
observation, surveys of village inhabitants in a small community, observation of
children's activities and caretaking, analysis of records and other archives,
and video-taping and audiotaping of interactions. The student will describe and
analyze the cultural models which govern interpersonal behavior within the
family and community where peace generally reigns and in other social and
political contexts where violent acts are common. The hypothesis to be tested is
that Cambodians have well-formed cultural models governing rules of interaction
in different contexts which can be characterized as aggressive" or "peaceful",
and that individuals pick and choose the governing model depending upon the
social context. This research is important because violence is a subject of much
concern in today's world. If we are to further our understanding of such
phenomena, we must carefully examine the different contexts in which aggression
does or doe not arise. This research provides a theoretical framework and
methodology to analyze violence. By not typologizing people as "violent" or
"peaceful", this cultural models approach illustrates that people can switch
cognitive codes in different situations in order to control the amount of
violence that occurs. By examining the cultural models that inform Cambodian
behavior the student will be making a contribution to our understanding of
aggression in Southeast Asia and in comparable situations in general.
