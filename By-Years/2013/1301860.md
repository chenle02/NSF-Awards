This proposal will study the structure and representations of certain Hopf
algebras, especially those Hopf algebras constructed from finite groups. A major
topic concerns the Frobenius-Schur indicators of the representations. These
indicators are invariants of the tensor category of representations of the Hopf
algebra, and can be extended to more general objects. They should give
information not only on the representations of a Hopf algebra, but they also
serve as a tool in proving more general facts about Hopf algebras themselves.
The methods for many of the problems involve the theory of finite
groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopf algebras are special algebraic objects which
arose in topology and algebraic groups in the 1940's and 1950's. However since
then they have appeared in other parts of mathematics, such as geometry (knot
theory), and in several parts of mathematical physics (conformal field theory
and statistical mechanics). In many cases Hopf algebras can be used to give
invariants of these structures which help to understand and classify them. Thus
they are of general interest.
