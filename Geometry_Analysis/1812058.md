The 2018 Barrett Lectures will take place during May 29-June 1, 2018 at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This year's Lectures will take the format of
a workshop on recent developments in mean curvature flow, a mathematical model
for the deformation of surfaces (and higher-dimensional objects) that decreases
area most rapidly. The workshop is aimed at graduate students and early career
researchers, as well as researchers from related applied fields in which
processes like the mean curvature flow naturally arise. The workshop will
consist of a one-day introductory course on mean curvature flow, followed by a
series of longer form survey lectures from a selection of preeminent researchers
which will introduce participants to some of the most important recent
breakthroughs in the field. These lecture series will be supported by auxiliary
talks from further leading researchers and a series of short talks by graduate
students and early career researchers.

Geometric flows, such as the mean curvature flow, have proved to be a powerful
tool in the analysis of a large number of important problems in differential
geometry, image processing and mathematical physics, leading to a profound
impact on each of these fields. They also arise naturally in such diverse
physical contexts as thermomechanics, annealing metals, crystal growth, flame
propagation, wearing processes and conformal field theory, where they model
physical processes involving interfaces and surface energies. The mean curvature
flow is the prototypical geometric flow equation and, as such, tools developed
to understand its behavior often lead to insights into the behavior of other
flow-based models. The main themes to be explored at the workshop will be the
uniqueness, rigidity and genericity of cylindrical singularities, the
classification of ancient and soliton solutions, and recently developed entropy
and noncollapsing methods.
