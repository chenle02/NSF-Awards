Many animal species are capable of migrating or homing over great distances, but
understanding how they are able to find their way has been one of the biggest
unsolved mysteries in the fields of animal behavior and sensory perception. It
has been long suspected that homing pigeons, and possibly other animals, have a
map based on the earth's magnetic field that allows the to return to their loft
even from distant places where they have never been before. The researchers will
use a novel approach which combines behavioral, neuropysiological and molecular
techniques in the laboratory and the field to confirm the existence of a
magnetic map in homing pigeons and to determine how it functions. The
researchers will track the flight paths of pigeons with GPS units in the field
to determine how they respond to changes in the earth's magnetic field on the
way home to their loft. By disrupting the pigeons' magnetic sense, which is
located in the upper beak, the researchers will test and refine a model that
explains how the earth's magnetic field could provide latitude and longitude
coordinates for navigation. In the laboratory, the researchers will train
pigeons to navigate using a virtual magnetic map. With this new approach it will
be possible to study how the pigeons perceive the magnetic field and how such
information is processed in the brain during homing behavior. This project will
provide a better understanding of fundamental questions in animal navigation,
sensory perception, and animal learning. It also has direct relevance to other
fields such as conservation (effects of climate change on stop-over sites and
thus migration routes), human health (control of disease transmission by
migratory animals), and the development of a satellite-independent backup Global
Positioning System (GPS). The researchers will involve undergraduate students in
the experiments (especially from underrepresented groups as part of the NSF-
funded SetGo program) as well as provide summer research internships for
talented high school students in support of K-12 initiatives and a workshop for
local high school teachers.
