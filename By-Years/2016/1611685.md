This three-year project, a collaboration between The Iowa Children's Museum, the
University of Iowa and the University of Washington, will develop and conduct
research on a 3,000 square foot exhibit for a children's museum audience that
will provide hands-on experiences both about the science of motion (forces,
acceleration, friction, balance, etc.) and about how the science relates to
designing skateboard parks. Several integrated, physical and digital components
will comprise the exhibit, including a digital table-top module where users can
experiment virtually with different skateboard park design features. The
project's innovation centers on the team's exploring how to effectively
integrate the physical and digital experiences in ways that foster children's
engagement with science and with design. The interactive digital display will
also be available as a mobile version that can be used outside of the museum
setting. The project's primary goal is to increase children's interest in,
engagement in, and understanding of STEM through collaborative, playful
tinkering and modeling. The project partnership will build regional and national
communities of practice to advance and support early informal STEM education. It
will include: 1) a partnership with the Iowa STEM Regional Network Hubs to reach
over 275 informal learning practitioners that deliver STEM education to Iowa's
underserved rural and Latino communities; 2) sharing resources and expertise
that result from this project with the informal STEM learning community and a
network of small to mid-sized museums, zoos, libraries, and science centers; 3)
a downloadable app-based "sandbox play space" that enables youth to collaborate
with their peers, teachers, mentors, or family to prepare for or extend their
exhibit experience outside the walls of museum, and 4) outreach programs to
serve traditionally underserved youth from rural areas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;The initiative will integrate development, research, and evaluation
processes using a design-based research approach. The research will study
collaborative learning linkages between child-child and adult-child interactions
as well as the dynamics of mixed physical-digital collaborative play in informal
STEM learning environments. The exhibit design process will draw on research in
the learning sciences and game design, science inquiry and exhibit design, and
child development scholarship on engagement and interaction in adult-child
dyads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM
Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-
based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal
environments.
