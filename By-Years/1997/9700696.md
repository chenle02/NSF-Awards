9700696 ROOT The role of population differentiation in the evolution of species
interactions is not well documented. Selection can differ by population, leading
to coevolutionary interactions in some areas and non reciprocal evolution in
other areas. The pea aphid, a pest of legume crops, is attacked by the
parasitoid, Aphidius ervi. Pea aphids in New York which specialize on alfalfa
are two or three times more resistant to parasitism than pea aphids specialized
on clover. Resistance is genetically determined and physiologically based. It is
not a product of host-plant induced effects or either insect species on the two
crops. The proposed research focuses on three areas. 1) A survey of pea aphids
on both crops from two other geographical area, Maryland and France, will
indicate the generality of the observed pattern of relative resistance. 2)
Reciprocal transplant experiments in the lab will determine whether the insects
are locally adapted within their geographic region. 3) An experiment will be
performed to ascertain the relative magnitude of genetic variation for
resistance in pea aphids from clover and from alfalfa. This will indicate if
lower levels of genetic variation in clover could be slowing the evolution of
resistance despite strong selection in both crops. This research is important in
enhancing a basic understanding of the evolution of species interactions, and
will provide insight in the effects of the evolution of species interactions on
the efficacy of biological control programs.
