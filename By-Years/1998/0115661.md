This is a collaborative research project between three universities. The project
is a comprehensive, systemic research and development program addressing three
inter-related tiers of study: student learning and development; teacher beliefs,
knowledge, and practice; and professional development. The project is grounded
in both sound theory of how students develop algebraic reasoning and acquire
domain knowledge and skills and in the beliefs and existing practices of
teachers. In the student tier a detailed developmental model of students'
evolving algebraic reasoning and skill acquisition will be constructed
concentrating on the transition from arithmetic to algebraic reasoning. In the
teaching tier a promising pedagogical approach, Bridging Instruction, will be
tested. In the professional development tier a teacher professional development
prototype will be implemented. The prototypeT extends an existing technology
based approach. It enables the evaluation of a scalable model of teacher
professional development. Technology is a central aspect of this project. The
findings of this research will be implemented into a coherent educational
program for students and teachers using Algebra Cognitive Tutors and the STEP
web teacher professional development environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
