This engineering education research project seeks to explore whether college
admissions files can be structured to improve the decision making of admissions
officers. Psychological biases may hinder the ability of admissions officers to
make ideal decisions, which could lead to the rejection of well-qualified low-
income and minority students. This experimental study will examine whether
changing the information included with the application, along with the order in
which that information appears, will affect admissions officers' decisions about
which applications to accept. The interventions developed here have the
potential to be adopted within college admissions processes for engineering
majors and for all students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and
importance of this project arises through the potential for simultaneously
improving the quality and diversity of incoming engineering students. This
project may inform not only practices in engineering admissions offices, but
also the activities of important national entities such as the College Board and
Common Application. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goal for
performing as a model organization by helping colleges and universities attain
both excellence and inclusion. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society
is enabled by facilitating research that informs educational policies and
practices.
