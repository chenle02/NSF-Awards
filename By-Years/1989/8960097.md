A number of new tunable, and solid state lasers such as Ti:Sapphire, external
cavity diode laser, laser diode pumped Yag, YLF and a host of other lasers, have
created new laser configurations that would require high frequency mode locking
devices to produce picosecond mode locked laser pulses. The purpose of this
study is to propose selecting LiNbo3 as the most efficient high frequency
acousto-optic mode locking resonator for active mode locking of these new
lasers. Lithium Niobate crystals from Japan and China have improved qualities,
and may have more desirable optical and acoustic properties, and we are among
the first in the U.S. to obtain such crystals. We have further proposed a
unified theory on high Q acoustic resonators such that all interacting
parameters can be analyzed simultaneously, and calculate parameters such as the
instantaneous power, optimum resonator length, etc. in relation to the drive
power. Based on the analysis to be developed in this project, we will then
demonstrate a 500 MHz (for 1 GHz laser cavity) high Q liNbo3 acoustic standing
mode locking device with a closed loop phase detection to monitor the mode
locker resonant frequency by controlling the temperature of the mode locker.
