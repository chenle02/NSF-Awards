Title: Stress Analysis in Composite Structures.

ABSTRACT

The objective of this investigation is to develop a rigorous method for the
stress analysis of composite structures. It is anticipated that the results of
this project will provide the necessary link between failure criteria related to
stress fluctuations at the micro-scale and the averaged or macroscopic stress
and strain that can be measured using strain gauges placed on the boundary of a
composite structural component. The analysis will be carried out for periodic
microstructures, random microstructures, and microstructures associated with G
or H convergent sequences of solution operators to linear and nonlinear elliptic
boundary value problems. In this project a ladder of increasingly sophisticated
continuum models incorporating pre-stress and nonlinear elastic and elastic-
plastic behavior will be incorporated into the stress assessment methodology.
This is crucial as engineering and naturally occurring bio-composite structures
are pre-stressed and often exhibit nonlinear elastic behavior near regions of
high stress.

Composite materials are increasingly becoming the materials of choice for
structural applications that require materials with high specific strength and
stiffness. Modern design practice increasingly incorporates the use of load
bearing components made up of composite substructures that are connected through
bonded or bolted joints. This trend can be seen in the latest aircraft, ships
and automobiles. Examples include the Airbus A300-600R and the Boeing 777 that
feature a composite vertical tail. Components of the tail are bolted together
and secured to the fuselage through clevises. It is of central interest to be
able to understand and anticipate the modes of failure initiation in these
structures. This requires fundamental understanding of how the mechanical loads
are distributed across the hierarchy of scales seen in a typical composite
structure. In this project the investigator and his colleagues will work on new
rigorous and systematic methods for accurate stress assessment across length
scales. These methods will be employed in novel computational methods for the
design of hierarchical composite structures that hedge against failure. Here the
opportunity for failure will be minimized through optimal tailoring of the
composite microstructure.
