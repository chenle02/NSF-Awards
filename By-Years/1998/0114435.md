Proposal 0114435&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Bibliographical Studies and
Research, in partnership with the British Library, will&lt;br/&gt;digitize the
microfilm of the most important collection of 18th century English newspapers.
&lt;br/&gt;Newspapers are recognized as a vast source of information for the
historical dimension of virtually&lt;br/&gt;every discipline. This project will
provide online access for researchers throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;The
digitized medium will also provide new methods of access and allow experiments
in OCR, in&lt;br/&gt;interfaces and presentation, and in other technological
questions.&lt;br/&gt;
