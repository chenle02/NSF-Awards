The Monochromator system is being used to introduce Smith College undergraduate
physics students to an important area of contemporary experimental physics
currently underrepresented in the curriculum. In laboratory work in introductory
and intermediate courses, it provides an opportunity to make high precision
measurements as well as exposure to basic quantum phenomena. The students, all
women, especially need experience with high quality modern instruments to
enhance their experimental skills and encourage them to consider experimental
rather than theoretical physics as a career. This equipment also provides an
opportunity for senior theses on fundamental topics; the high-quality equipment
makes possible interesting and significant experiments.
