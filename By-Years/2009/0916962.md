High performance computing is used to run models of the real world. This is true
in both ultra high performance simulations used in scientific computing to study
Physics, Biology etc. as well in designing approximations of real world
involving applications such as gaming, social networks etc. Maximizing realism
of the world being modeled and mimicked is the key to get this right. This work
attacks the problem of realism on two fronts : first a framework is developed to
speed up sequential parts of the computation using a large number of available
cores based on a new concept of probabilistic speed-up. Secondly a runtime
solution is devised to maximize realism in immersive applications such as gaming
under the constraint of responsiveness. The frameworks involve development of
programming models, interfaces, APIs and run-time system to solve the above
problems by managing the underlying parallelism and computation. Apart from
research this effort involves developing a cross-cutting graduate level course
that spans between simulations, algorithms and programming languages.
