Condensation phenomena have long been recognized as having a major impact on the
design and operation of steam turbines. Early literature on this subject and
many studies over five or six decades have focused on the homogeneous
condensation as a mechanism for the initiation of nucleation and condensation in
the wet stages of steam turbines. A series of studies conducted in operating
turbines first suggested in 1978 the possibility that turbine condensation was
not originated by homogeneous condensation because wet steam was found to be
present at the point in the turbine where the saturation ratio is equal to or
somewhat less than unity. This discovery, which was made by surveys ofoperating
turbines with specially designed optical probes, has prompted the focus of
attention on other mechanisms of nucleation and, in particular, on the role of
heterogeneous nucleation as caused by low levels of impurities present in the
working fluid. This research effort will focus on these processes and will
explore a new range of potentially pertinent physical effects.
