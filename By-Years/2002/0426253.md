The Mid-Atlantic Center for Teaching and Learning Mathematics is renewed for an
additional five years. The Mid-Atlantic Center is a consortium led by members of
the mathematics and education faculties of three research universities and three
school-system partners: the University of Delaware, the University of Maryland,
the Pennsylvania State University, the Delaware State Department of Education,
Prince George's County (MD) Public Schools and the Pittsburgh (PA) Public
Schools. The University of Maryland is the designated grantee institution.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three central tasks of the Center are
to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Design and operate an innovative program of doctoral
and postdoctoral studies preparing leaders for mathematics education work on
teacher preparation and professional development, curriculum, policy and
research.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop and evaluate alternative models for mathematical
education of pre-service teachers and professional development of in-service
teachers in K-12 schools.&lt;br/&gt;3. Study the processes of teacher
preparation and professional development to determine critical factors in
successful programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of the renewal
effort is to gain a better understanding of the relationship between teacher
content knowledge (in mathematics) pedagogical knowledge and effective classroom
practice. The research agenda focuses on the three
questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the critical mechanisms through
which teachers develop mathematical and pedagogical knowledge from content and
methods courses and internship experiences?&lt;br/&gt;2. How do practicing
teachers draw on and continue to develop mathematical and pedagogical knowledge
in the course of their professional work?&lt;br/&gt;3. How does teacher
mathematical and pedagogical knowledge influence student achievement?&lt;br/&gt;
