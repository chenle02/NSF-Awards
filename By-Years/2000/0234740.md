Gender and seasonal differences in reproductive behaviors are often paralleled
by differences in the morphology of structures controlling them. Although such
dimorphisms are fundamental characteristics of numerous vertebrates, the
mechanisms involved appear to vary. Steroid hormones often mediate both anatomy
and function, but organisms differ in which hormone is important and critical
age and in which sex it acts. Some of these differences may reflect constraints
imposed by the animals or their environments, but others may reflect the type of
system (e.g., courtship or copulatory). The proposed experiments investigate two
neuromuscular systems required to coordinate a suite of masculine reproductive
behaviors in green anole lizards. Males extend a throat fan (dewlap) to court
females, and the motoneurons and muscles controlling this display have several
male-biased characteristics. The hypothesis that steroid hormones regulate
differentiation of these structures will be tested, and hormones specifically
involved will be identified, thus determining when and where they act. Males
also use one of two hemipenes during copulation, which are controlled by two
pairs of muscles. Adult females do not have these structures. Relevant spinal
motoneurons are larger and more numerous in males. Unlike the dewlap system,
which appears stable in adulthood, preliminary results suggest that at least the
copulatory muscles are plastic in adult males. Experiments will investigate
whether the copulatory muscles and motoneurons change morphologically between
the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and whether these changes can be induced
by testosterone. Then, as for the dewlap system, the role of gonadal hormones in
sexual differentiation of the copulatory neuromuscular structures will be
assessed. The courtship system differentiates in juveniles, whereas the
copulatory system is sexually dimorphic at hatching. This proposal will address
the important question, "Why do some systems loose their responsiveness to
gonadal hormones while others remain plastic during development and into
adulthood ?".The broader impacts of the proposed work involve advancing
scientific discovery by increasing the understanding of mechanisms involved in
sculpting the structure of the nervous system and muscles, both in developmental
organization and adult plasticity. At the same time teaching, training, and
learning will be promoted, the participation of underrepresented groups in lab
work will be encouraged, scientific result will be disseminated in a timely
fashion, and the infrastructure for neuroendocrine research at this university
will be enhanced
