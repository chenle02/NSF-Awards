ABSTRACT. The project concerns the computation and applications of topological
invariants in 3-dimensional topology, with an emphasis on the use of analytic
and differential geometric machinery. The areas to be studied include the
spectral flow of the Hessian of the Chern-Simons functional and related
3-manifold gauge theory invariants including the $SU(3)$ Casson invariant and
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho invariants. Also to be studied are twisted Alexander
invariants of knots, links, and strings and relations to Casson-Gordon
invariants and also applications of the Kirk-Livingston combinatorial knot and
link invariants.

Kirk's work in pure mathematics has as its goal the solution and clarification
of geometric problems in 3 dimensions. The setting of 3 dimensions on the one
hand is familiar to all of us since the universe we live in is 3-dimensional.
But geometric problems in this area turn out to be very difficult for the odd
reason that in such low dimensions there is "not enough room to move." This
tension between a vague familiarity and mathematical difficulty makes this area
a particularly interesting area for mathematicians to study. Kirk's approach to
the area is to combine traditional 3 dimensional techniques with methods from
other areas, especially methods that have made their way into Mathematics from
Physics.
