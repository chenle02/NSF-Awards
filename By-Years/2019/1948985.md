This proposal will estimate how much the global ocean has warmed over the past
half century and look at the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in ocean
heat content. The project will use a machine learning approach to combine
historical data such that errors and biases are minimized. An exciting aspect of
the project is that it will also estimate heat content for the deep, abyssal
ocean (deeper than 2000m). Ocean heat content is an important indicator for how
much excess heat the Earth system is accumulating and is thus important for
improving understanding and prediction of climate change. The project will
involve students, including providing internships for students from Historically
Black Colleges and Universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use
ensemble Artificial Neural Networks (EANN) to estimate the total ocean heat
content over the past fifty years. The use of EANN machine learning methods will
reduce systematic biases in the historical temperature data sets and yield an
improved historical data set with error estimates. The project will then also
look at spatial and temporal patterns of ocean warming. A novel aspect of the
project is that it will include estimates of OHC for the abyssal ocean deeper
than 2000m. The project has strong potential for broader impacts by providing a
state-of-the-art estimate of ocean warming which could be used to constrain
ocean climate models. The project also broadens the participation of
underrepresented minority students through
internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission
and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
