Students in an ongoing course are introduced to the full range of capabilities
of a modern scanning electron microscope and students in the minerology and
petrology courses learn of these capabilities through several laboratory
exercises. In a new course, students receive hands- on experience with state-of-
the-art equipment through extensive labortory work. Their level of background in
areas of transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
enable the students to present more favorable credentials to prospective
employers. Further, students have the technical capabilities that allow them to
pursue goals in either graduate school or medical school research. The grantee
provides funds for this project that more than match the NSF award.
