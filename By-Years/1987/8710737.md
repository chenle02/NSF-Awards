An automated rapid prototyping environment for software systems has three major
components: an (existing) prototyping language, a software base, and an
(existing) prototyping method. The research objectives of the project are to
enable the construction of a software base with capabilities for retrieving
reusable software based on formalized component specifications and to develop
implementation techniques for the prototyping language. The approach will be to
enhance the component specification aspect of the prototyping language to allow
reduction to a normal form, which will alleviate inexact match problems in
retrieving components from the software base. The use of generalization per
category for structuring the software base to aid component retrieval will also
be investigated. The relation between the specification language and the
software base operators will be established. Efficient interpretive techniques
for implementing the prototyping language will be sought, and evaluated with the
aid of an attribute grammar based translation tool. Justification and
Recommendation The research will enable automated prototyping based on reusable
software, which will make it practical to validate software requirements via
rapid prototyping.
