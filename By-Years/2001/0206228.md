The project proposes to target substantial numbers of African-American, low-
income youth to provide opportunities for academic and career advancement in
science, math, engineering and technology (SMET). The project has three phases:
Phase 1) meet at the science center each week while engaging in 5 learn and
teach project cycles involving the design and building of simple technological
devices; Phase 2) uses experienced science educators to help teens with
additional inquiry science investigations; Phase 3) teens will visit design
clubs at preselected after-school program sites. EDC will regularly develop
curriculum booklets for three levels: entry, coach and experienced teachers
level (abstract). SLSC will develop workplace competency materials to assist
other science centers in teaching career confidence and qualities to teens, etc.
A total of 240 participants will participant in the program.
