This project seeks to improve the performance of future data center compute
servers and networks, enabling a growing number of performance-sensitive
applications to co-exist on each server. To allow multiple applications on a
server to drive the Network Interface Card (NIC) at high speed, this research
aims to rethink the mechanisms employed in various layers of the server
networking stack, and create new interfaces and abstractions between the layers
and for applications. This research will lead to improved scalability,
utilization, and efficiency of cloud computing infrastructure, allowing
providers to support many more applications and tenants while maintaining their
current infrastructure footprint. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to
develop new algorithms and programming abstractions for server operating systems
and Network Interface Cards (NICs) to improve scheduling of outbound network
traffic. These algorithms will overcome current performance bottlenecks, and
will improve the ability for multiple applications to drive a NIC at high speed,
with the ambitious goal of sustaining line rates while meeting application
latency/throughput/fairness objectives as well as infrastructure-wide
utilization and efficiency objectives. The PIs plan to integrate the proposed
research into courses at UW-Madison. The PIs will organize various `network
programming bootcamps' aimed at network engineers, undergraduate students, and
high school students from under-represented groups.
