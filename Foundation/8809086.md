Scowcroft's work, in mathematical logic, will center on constructive real
algebra, the model theory of p-adic fields, and applications of proof theory to
algebra. Having found an effective test for the constructive truth of
propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical complexity, Scowcroft hopes
to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these constructively true
propositions. Given such axioms, he would like to prove theorems in constructive
real algebra by model- theoretic means. Scowcroft also wants to learn whether
first- order real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic analysis is
recursively undecidable. Recent work on subanalytic sets may allow Scowcroft to
extend his effective test for constructive truth to propositions involving
certain transcendental functions. In the model theory of p-adic fields,
Scowcroft plans to study the properties of definable equivalence relations, the
differences in expressive power between the first-order languages commonly used
to describe a p-adic field, and possible extensions of Kochen's theorem on
integral-definite rational functions. Scowcroft hopes to apply proof-theoretic
arguments to obtain primitive-recursive or elementary bounds for the size of the
identities given by Kochen's theorem.
