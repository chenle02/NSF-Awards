This award supports the continuation of the Research Experience for
Undergraduates (REU) site in physics at Cornell University. The students will
work on a range of projects that advance the Laboratory's scientific mission,
further their education and training, and heighten their interest in pursuing
careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.
Although the research scope of this REU program is focused on understanding the
fundamental physics of beams and accelerators and the uses of the radiation they
produce, the techniques and technologies utilized are applicable to a much wider
range of scientific careers. Each student is asked to participate in one of the
outreach programs at the Laboratory, teaching them to communicate the scientific
ideas with the general public and exposing them to the outreach prospects at
their home institutions, through the Student Physical Society (SPS) chapters and
other outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cornell Laboratory has an international
reputation for research, with a unique constellation of programs including
accelerator physics, synchrotron radiation research, and microwave
superconductivity. The student participants have full access to the resources of
the Laboratory and University, and will work closely with Laboratory experienced
researchers. The students will participate in joint activities that include
lectures of wide topics in the accelerator physics and X-ray science; take part
with a bigger body of REU groups on campus in fun-talks and hands-on activities
that introduce various frontiers of physics research; and attend events
addressing the social and ethical issues in scientific research and conduct.
These joint activities provide an excellent environment for networking of the
future scientists.
