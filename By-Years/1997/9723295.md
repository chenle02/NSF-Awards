Lay Abstract PI: Fanselow, Michael S. Proposal Number: IBN-9723295 When
information is first learned, the brain stores this new memory in a form that is
very susceptible to disruption. Over time, one particular part of the brain, the
hippocampus, acts to consolidate these memories into a more indelible form. If
the hippocampus is damaged or disrupted before consolidation of a particular
experience is complete, there is an amnesia for that experience. While it is
known that this memory consolidation goes on for a very long time, very little
is known about what causes consolidation to occur or what factors control the
duration of this process. This project provides crucial information about how
memory consolidation is accomplished. There are two lines of investigation. The
first examines several environmental manipulations that prevent this amnesia or
shorten or extend the period of consolidation. These experiments provide
information on the mental processes that cause the brain to consolidate its
experiences. The second line of research determines how the various parts of the
hippocampus are involved in the consolidation process. Together the two parts of
this project provide information about how the brain operates on our experiences
to create permanent memories.
