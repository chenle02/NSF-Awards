This research focuses on one of the most critical and difficult issues in the
field of high temperature superconductors; the role of grain boundaries as
current limiting structures in bulk and thin film materials. This research will
provide a detailed study of weak links, grain boundary structure and composition
as well as surface properties of high temperature superconductors. The weak link
investigations focus on single grain boundaries in polycrystalline bulk
materials, and will employ thinned samples for which the critical current can be
probed locally and the grain boundaries to their structure and composition.
Complementary surface characterization work using synchrotron radiation
techniques will also be carried out. This research is potentially of great
strategic importance and could provide enabling technology for commercial
applications of bulk high temperature superconducting materials.
