The ACM SIGMETRICS / IFIP PERFORMANCE 2016 conference will be held at Congress
Center, Antibes Juan-les-Pins, France, June 14-18, 2016. SIGMETRICS brings
together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has
become a premier forum for discussing the development and application of state-
of-the-art, broadly applicable analytic, simulation, and measurement-based
performance evaluation techniques. The SIGMETRICS conference presents
innovative, exciting work related to all aspects of performance, including speed
and scalability as well as reliability, availability, and manageability of
systems. Highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground breaking results
are expected and this year offers a poster session for the presentation of
promising preliminary work

Travel support will make possible the participation of students who would
otherwise be unable to attend. Particular attention is paid to directing support
towards under-represented groups. The support will provide students who attend
with the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of mentors and peers.
