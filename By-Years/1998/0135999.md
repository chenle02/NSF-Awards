Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is hosting a team of
undergraduate students from WPI to research the state-of-the-art in how
laboratory teaching experiences are delivered using web-based information
technologies. The team of students are completing 7 weeks of foundational
research at WPI, then will work on-site at NSF in the Division of Undergraduate
Education for another 7 weeks to complete their project. The project is
ascertaining how the critical laboratory components of science and engineering
courses and how advanced web-mediated learning technologies are being used to
complement, supplement, or otherwise "convey" laboratory experiences in the
undergraduate science and engineering curriculum. The WPI students are receiving
academic credit in fulfillment of a requisite for the Bachelor of Science
degree. Regular WPI faculty, who are resident in Washington with the students,
are guiding their work with consultation with NSF program directors. The
students will deliver a final report to the NSF that will contain, in addition
to their revised literature review and methodology, presentation of their data
and analysis, along with conclusions and recommendations.
