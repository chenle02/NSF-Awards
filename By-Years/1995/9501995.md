This research is on design techniques for circuits with a power supply voltage
of 0.5V. Innovations in technology, circuits, and architecture are being
explored. Issues being pursued in the design of low-threshold devices are: when
to shut down and efficient shutdown. Leakage currents are a major power drain in
using low-threshold devices. Thus, techniques to efficiently detect and power
down idling hardware are being devised. The potential of using adaptive supply
voltages to exploit time-varying computational requirements is being
investigated. Studies of the fundamental limits of reducing energy per
computation are being developed into a general theory of DSP algorithms which
can use dynamic power supply voltages. Such algorithms change computational
complexity dynamically, thus saving power. Circuits which operate at supply
voltages less than 0.5V are being fabricated.
