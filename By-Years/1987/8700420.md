Drs. Crosby and Allen, with help from colleagues in Costa Rica and Panama, will
study the mosses of Central America in order to compile an illustrated
identification guide to the estimated 1100 species of mosses in this tropical
region. The moss flora will include descriptions of all known species, reliable
keys for their identification, illustrations of diagnostic morphological
features, and notes on their geographical ranges and habitats. The materials for
this study comprise herbarium specimens collected in the past as well as new
collections from poorly sampled areas in Central America, collected with the
support of other funding sources. Computer facilities will be used in all
aspects of the production of the resulting manual. Although individually, mosses
are small, seemingly insignificant plants, they are important in retarding soil
erosion, in providing seed-beds and habitats for soil invertebrates, and in
other aspects of ecosystem processing of materials. They also are subjects of
study into mechanisms of drought resistance and of pollution effects. Provision
of a reliable manual for the identification of Central American mosses will
facilitate such studies for tropical regions of the world. As well, such a
manual will help stabilize the scientific nomenclature of these plants and
provide data for assessing their historical biogeography.
