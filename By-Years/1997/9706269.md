9706269 Burbank Folds are fundamental structures of contractional orogens, but
because timing and increments of folding are parameters that commonly are not
possible to determine unambiguously, the kinematic history of fold development
in a orogen is difficult to establish. This information is needed to make
reliable reconstructions of how orogens develop. This project will attack this
problem by using a set of folds in NE Spain where deposition caused strata to be
deposited during fold amplification, such that each growth strata recorded
different amounts of folding. By step-wise unfolding keyed to the growth strata,
and obtaining age control by various means. The sequential development of these
folds can be constructed, successful results should help understand the role of
folds in developing orogens.
