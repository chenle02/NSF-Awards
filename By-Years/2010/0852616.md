Ocean on the Edge Workshop

The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, CA is organizing a workshop, The
National Ocean on the Edge Workshop, which is convening more than fifty leading
scientists, exhibit designers, film makers, informal science educators, and
communicators for two and one-half days, May 12-14, 2009, along with follow-up
activities. The participants are taking four of the booklets in the National
Academy of Sciences Ocean Science Series as the point of departure for
developing concrete exhibit and program ideas to exchange, entertain, educate,
and empower the public. The four themes are: Coastal Hazards, Ocean Pollution,
Marine Ecosystems and Fisheries, and Oceans and Human Health.

Workshop participants are exploring and evaluating several modes of
communicating with the public and preparing a tool kit for each theme. Each tool
kit will include: a revised booklet based upon the NAS document;a set of
references suitable for the general public; a set of recommended films and
exhibits on the topic that have worked for general audiences; and concrete ideas
for connecting with the public. In addition to traditional modes of
communicating with the public, a variety of social networking techniques are
being explored.
