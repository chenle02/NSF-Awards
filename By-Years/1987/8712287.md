Morphology and Dynamics of a Major Anastomosing Channel System Riverine Plain,
Australia The Murray River is of hydrologic, geomorphic and sedimentologic
interest because as it approaches the Cadell Fault it bifurcates, and a major
anastomosing-stream develops on the alluvial Riverine Plain of southeastern
Australia. In this area it will be possible to study the characteristics of and
reason for the deveolpment of anastomosing channel network and to determine if
active tectonics is actively causing increased frequency of overband flooding
and the problems of channel stability. The study will determine how the
morphological and sedimentary character of anastomosing system differs in
channels as well as factor in the local and regional tectonic effects.
