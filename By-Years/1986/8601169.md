Urban water distribution systems have been losing water through leaks and pipe
breaks which have aggravated the water supply crisis in many parts of the
country. This project will examine the use of reliability theories to manage a
program of maintaining the physical integrity of an urban water distribution
system. The objective is to determine which parts of the system need more
inspection, repairs, or replacements before a major failure occurs. The project
has a twofold objective: preventive maintenance and an overall management tool.
