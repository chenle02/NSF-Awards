This research program will explore quantum dynamical processes for individual
atoms strongly coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The research will
include the investigation of the quantization of atomic center-of-mass motion
within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Particular emphasis will
be given to the dynamics of localized atomic wavepackets, both from the
perspective of cooling and trapping single atoms with intracavity photon number
of order unity and within the context of continuous quantum measurement. Results
of this work have potential impact in the broad area of quantum computation, and
partial support is provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
