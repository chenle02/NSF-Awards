The University of Cincinnati Robert Noyce Scholarship Initiative to Increase
Math/Science Teachers in Urban Schools is recruiting, encouraging and supporting
talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors and
professionals to become K-12 mathematics or science teachers in a high-need
urban school district. The University of Cincinnati/Cincinnati Public Schools
(UC/CPS) Initiative provides two avenues for developing teachers: one for recent
college graduates and mid-career professionals transitioning into teaching
careers in science or math; and another for students with interests in math or
science enrolling in the Cincinnati Initiative for Teacher Education and
studying to become teachers. Twenty students are being recruited and supported
annually throughout the program. In collaboration with Arts &amp; Sciences and
the College of Engineering, candidates are being recruited from among displaced
corporate employees, active community members, and minority students at
Cincinnati State Technical and Community College and the regional Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (Wilberforce and Central State Universities).
Participants are benefiting professionally through interaction with UC and CPS
faculty, mentors, and evaluation specialists in a partnership that is linking
research, theory and practice to develop strong teachers who are effective in
urban settings. This initiative, grounded in strong community connections, is
implementing innovative practices tailored to produce teachers who can reach
urban youth.
