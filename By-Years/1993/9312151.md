9312151 Booton This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
continuing award for the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program and
support of the evaluator at the University of Colorado, Boulder
Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Microwave and Millimeter
Wave Computer-Aided Design. The Center continues to meet the renewal criteria
requirements of the I/UCRC Program. Additional funding is provided for a woman
undergraduate student to aid the Center in its ongoing research activities.
Funding is also provided by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to obtain a
membership in the Center and to augment ongoing research. The Department of
Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office is providing
funding to obtain a non-voting membership in the Center. The Program Manager
recommends the University of Colorado, Boulder be awarded: $57,242 for the first
year of a three-year continuing award; $5,000 for one year with funds provided
by the Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program;
$50,000 for one year with funds provided by the CIA; and $10,000 for one year
with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy. Near the end of each
12-month period, the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the
Engineering Education Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on
a number of renewal criteria, including the following: 1) the extent to which
the university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the
support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program
is developing. If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend
support for the next period of this continuing award.
