0116643&lt;br/&gt;Cayan&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award to
University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography will
provide support for acquisition of a cluster computer system for use by the new
Center for Observations, Modeling, and Prediction at Scripps (COMPAS). Research
use of the system will emphasize regional to global scale ocean/atmosphere
modeling, fine-scale modeling of coastal and wave processes, process-oriented
ocean modeling and ocean state estimation, and graduate education, to which 25%
of the computational time will be allocated. The system will be housed at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography; technical support and archival storage will
be provided by the San Diego Supercomputer Center. UCSD will contribute 30% of
the cost of this project from non-federal funds. &lt;br/&gt;***&lt;br/&gt;
