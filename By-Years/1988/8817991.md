Members of the family Euphorbiaceae comprise a diverse and economically
important group of tropical plants (including the rubber tree plant). Drs.
Michael Huft and Grady Webster have organized an international gathering of
specialists on the group in order to work toward a consensus of the family's
classification. This three-day conference at the Missouri Botanical Garden will
include many younger investigators from Central and South America, Europe, and
Asia. This will be their first opportunity to gather to discuss their own
research, and the research priorities of the family. Dr. Webster's 1975
classification of the family will be analyzed from the different perspectives of
the participants (secondary chemistry, cytology, pollination biology, and
morphology). The proposed symposium will set the stage for a generation of
collaborative international research on an economically important group of
tropical plants. The classification that will emerge will be of value to a
diverse array of ecologists, conservation biologists, and economic botanists.
