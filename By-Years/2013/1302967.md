Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their
extent is increasing in the U.S. The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to
urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where
neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of
roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features. Funds are
provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological
structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with
continental scale implications. The research will provide a framework for
understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental
scales. The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to
regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL,
Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how
household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management
practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and
continental scales. This research will transform scientific understanding of an
important and increasingly common ecosystem type (?suburbia?) and the
consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In
addition, it will advance understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage
their surroundings. The award will leverage an extensive, multi-scale program of
education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects.
Activities include K-12 education and outreach to community groups,
city/regional planners, natural history museums, state and local agencies and
non-governmental organizations. Graduate students will participate in a
Distributed Graduate Seminar in Sustainability Science (DGSS) initiated by NCEAS
and the University of Minnesota Institute on Environment.
