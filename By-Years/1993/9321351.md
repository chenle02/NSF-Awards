9321351 Drukier The goal of the proposed research is to develop low cost desktop
and portable systems with very high computational capabilities for both
scientific and applied engineering applications. In Phase I we developed a
transputer-based hardware platform coupled with a very powerful analytical tool,
the wavelet transform. We demonstrated that with appropriate coding the wavelet
algorithm allows almost perfect parallelization, i.e. the computational speed is
practically proportional to the number of transputers used. The Phase I results
demonstrate that the hardware/software system we developed is scalable over two
orders of magnitude in speed and memory. The Phase II effort will consist of
software development for two-dimensional wavelet transforms and its
implementation on next-generation HTRAM transputers. The 2D algorithms will be
optimized for high efficiency (25:1 or better) real time image compression as
well as for a number of other applications. These include analysis of
destructive wave propagation in complex mechanical structures, properties of
nonlinear dynamical systems, and the properties of stochastic webs and
percolation clusters. These analyses have important applications in turbulent
diffusion, transport properties in plasma physics, hydrodynamics, and magnetic
field generation. ***
