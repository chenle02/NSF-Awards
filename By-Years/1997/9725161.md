9725161 Salmun The funding is for a partial support for Hopkins Conference in
Environmental Fluid Mechanics to be held on April 2-4, 1998 at Johns Hopkins
University. The intent of the conference is to assess the present state and
future development in physical oceanography and many other related fields.
Anticipated subject areas include general fluid mechanics, physical
oceanography, waves, dynamics of the upper ocean, the atmospheric boundary
layer, turbulence and stratified flows. The conference will also serve as an
occasion to honor Professor Owen Phillips for his lifelong contributions to
fluid mechanics in general and to oceanography in particular.
