As the use of mobile, wireless computing devices continues to grow, so does
concern with assuring that communications within these wireless networks is not
vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) was
developed as a means for improving communication in wireless networks. This
project will conduct exploratory research to determine whether and how the use
of PNC can be exploited to detect attacks. The work is organized into three
tasks. The first task will identify capabilities to detect attacks and design
corresponding mechanisms for differing network infrastructures and attacker
models. Signal strength attacks, Sybil attacks, and wormhole attacks will be the
initial targets of study. The second task will study the detection accuracy of
the proposed mechanisms and explore more complex network scenarios. The third
task will develop simulations to model the attack detection mechanisms.
