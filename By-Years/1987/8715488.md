Georgia State University will host a conference in Atlanta, Georgia on "Active
Galactic Nuclei" 28-30 October, 1987. The conference will involve approximately
100 participants primarily from institutions in North America. This conference
will provide a forum for discussions of recent developments and the current
status of our understanding of active galactic nuclei from both an observational
and a theoretical perspective. The conference will be centered around a number
of invited review papers. A limited number of oral contributed papers will also
be scheduled in addition to several poster sessions. The grant will provided for
the partial reimbursement of travel expenses for invited speakers and a limited
number of young investigators.
