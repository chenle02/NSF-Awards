The Science/Math Resource Center at Montana State University will initiate a
three-week, residential Young Scholars project in multidisciplinary science
activities for 15 students entering grades 8 and 9. This project will connect
high-ability/high-potential junior high students with a science/engineering
university for science-related career exploration activities. The schedule
includes a three-week summer residential program of lab and field experiences
followed by a structured computer-network set of activities designed to connect
participants in their local setting with each other as well as with university
scientists and career counselors throughout the academic year. Two other weekend
meetings are held during the academic year to expose these Young Scholars to the
two other science/math/ engineering universities in the state.
