This research will enhance our understanding of the underlying issues affecting
the differential participation and success rates of community college students
from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The guiding questions for this
study are: (1) What MESA Community College Program (MCCP) activities are
especially helpful in improving self-efficacy or motivation in STEM for
underrepresented students and, (2) How are students' perceptions of STEM
disciplines influenced by their participation in MCCP activities? This project
will ascertain the value of the MESA model as a method to develop local STEM
talent and learning communities among underrepresented populations in varied
settings (rural/urban).
