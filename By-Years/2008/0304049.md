This Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) program entitled, "Nanoscale
Issues in Manufacturing," at Texas A&amp;M University, under the direction of
Dr. Jeffrey E. Froyd is being funded by the Directorate for Engineering (ENG),
Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC). The objective of this
diverse, interdisciplinary project is to develop a nanotechnology curriculum
that: 1) integrates well with the existing curriculum, 2) uses innovative
teaching and learning approaches, with a special emphasis on active learning,
visualization, and technology-enhanced learning, and 3) brings the latest
research into the classroom. This curricular change has four components which
will introduce elements of nanotechnology throughout the undergraduate
curriculum. Components 1 and 2 include curricular changes in the form of modules
integrated into required engineering courses for first and second-year
engineering students that will focus on introducing nanotechnology and
nanomanufacturing concepts as well as on communicating the excitement and future
potential of nanotechnology. The third component is a module that will be
integrated into a junior-level course offered by the Mechanical Engineering
department which will cover issues related to nanomanufacturing in more detail.
The fourth component will be a new course available to all engineering and
science students who have completed the prerequisite courses and will include
manufacturing of nanoscale components and integration of nanoscale components
into micro and macro-scale devices and bulk materials.
