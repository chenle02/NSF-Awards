The proposed WSSU Computer Science and Technology Scholarship Program is going
to provide scholarship support to academically talented minority students who
demonstrate financial need. To fulfill the goal of increasing the number of
students who enter the high tech workforce or higher education programs, this
program provides scholarships to junior and senior level undergraduates,
associate degree transfer students pursuing a degree in computer science; as
well as to graduate students pursuing a MS degree in computer science and
information technology. The program is going to attract, enroll, mentor, and
enhance the academic performance of CSTSP scholars, thereby increasing the
graduation rate of minority and women students in the fields of computer science
and information technology. The program is going to provide 27 scholarships of
$3,125 per year per student during the first year, and 27 scholarships per year
during years two to four.

Three primary objectives of the program are to: 1) increase the number of
minority and women who enroll in computer science; 2) increase the number of
minority and women who graduate with a BS or MS in computer science and/or
computer science and information technology; 3) increase the pool of students
who are prepared to enter the computer technology workforce or pursue high
education in the field. Additional benefits of the program include: 1)
enhancement of the undergraduate computer science curriculum; 2) increased
collaboration with business and industry; 3) development of collaborations with
the growing body of bio-medical and high tech industries in the city of Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, as well as state and national employers; 4) strengthen
collaborations with the departments of mathematics, life sciences, physical
sciences, and health sciences; 5) enhance the professional development of
faculty resulting from mentoring scholars engaged in research.
