This project is investigating applications of dihedral sequence comparison
(DISCO) to protein structure comparison and protein folding problems. DISCO
transforms atomic coordinates into one-dimensional dihedral sequences, then
applies the BioSCAN sequence alignment computer to find segments with similar
three-dimensional folds. The goals of the DISCO project include: (1) exploring
new algorithms and representations of the three-dimensional structures of folded
proteins by one-dimensional sequences; (2) exploring the use of the BioSCAN
system to compare these sequences; (3) developing statistically-based scores for
measuring the structural similarity of folded protein segments by comparing
their dihedral sequences; (4) developing a robust computational system based on
BioSCAN for protein structure analysis; and (5) making the DISCO system
available over the Internet to the scientific community.
