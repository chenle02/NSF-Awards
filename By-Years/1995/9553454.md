GER-9553454 Gittell We propose a graduate research training program in the area
of Human Capital in Urban Communities which will take an interdisciplinary
approach, and draw upon faculty in political science, sociology, environmental
psychology, social/personality psychology, urban studies and cultural
anthropology already conducting Human Capital related research. The program is
oriented toward African-American and Hispanic doctoral students, and will
involve an initial cohort of five trainees. Our doctoral programs have
successfully recruited and graduated substantial numbers of minority doctoral
students in the social sciences for two decades. We will use existing
recruitment bridges to outstanding minority students in the senior colleges of
the City University of New York, as well as national searches. Seven of the
training program faculty will be minority scholars. The program involves a
sequence of courses on research methodologies, theoretical approaches to
understanding human capital, and institutional studies on families,
neighborhoods, schools, work places and labor markets. It includes student
apprenticeships in existing faculty research projects.
