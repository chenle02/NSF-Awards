biotechnicians, (2) incorporating math-centered learning modules into existing
high school and community college science curricula, (3) providing professional
development in biotechnology to area high school teachers and community college
faculty, and (4) increasing the number of underserved students in science,
mathematics, and biotechnology disciplines.
