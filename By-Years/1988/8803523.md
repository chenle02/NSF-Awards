This proposal seeks funding to study the faulting processes of six large
earthquakes with magnitudes between 6.5 and 7.9 that have occurred with the
Baikal rift zone between 1950 and 1967. This will be accomplished through
waveform modeling of regional and teleseismic body waves and surface wave
analysis. Additional constraints on fault geometry and the rupture process will
be obtained from available geological and geophysical studies of the rift. The
earthquakes of interest occurred in regions of the rift that are
contemporaneously in different stages of evolution, ranging from the well
established central rift graben to incipient rifting at 121 degrees E, where no
extensional features appear at the surface. Study of the faulting processes
within each region of the rift will lead to a better understanding of how
faulting in a rift evolves and will allow comparison of these regions with other
continental rifts that are in different stages of evolution. In addition,
analysis of the 1957 M=7.9 Muya, Siberia earthquake, one of the largest
earthquakes to have occurred in an intraplate setting since 1900, will provide
important information for seismic hazard assessment in other regions of
continental rifting.
