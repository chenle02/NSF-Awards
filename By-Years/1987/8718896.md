The Andean mountain chain is the classic example of orogenesis due to
subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath continental crust. Paleomagnetic
studies have detected a systematic pattern of block rotations in the Andes and
Coast Range of Chile and Peru, with counterclockwise rotations in Peru and
clockwise ones in Chile, that affect rocks as young as latest cretaceous. This
research will collect new paleomagnetic data in central Chile that will help
determine the cause of the rotations and distinguish between several current
hypotheses. Results will not only be important in understanding Andean
tectonics, but will be of interest in understanding Andean-type tectonic
responses elsewhere.
