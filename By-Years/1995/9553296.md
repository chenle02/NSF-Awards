Earth 2010-Your Future: Population Growth and Environmental Impact is a four-
week residential camp designed for 50 seventh and eight grade minority students
from Missouri. The purpose of the camp is to increase participant awareness and
knowledge of environmental issues and how science, technology, and mathematics
are involved. In addition, the camp will provide career guidance and motivation
for students to remain in school and continue the study of science and
mathematics. Earth 2010 will involve a detailed environmental study of Stone,
Taney, and Greene Counties in Missouri. Stone and Taney Counties are rural,
forested counties which are host to millions of tourists each year. Greene
County is also experiencing an increase in population which is related to this
tourist industry. This influx of people has caused a variety of environmental
problems (e.g., increases in energy consumption, waste production, and
construction). Students will be provided with the background knowledge necessary
to identify, examine, and propose solutions to selected problems. Lecture,
discussion, extensive hands-on experiential learning, and small group research
will be the primary tools used to examine these topics. Social issues and
political ramifications associated with these problems will also be examined.
The issues in these counties will be related to issues in the students' home
areas and the world. A multidisciplinary approach will be used with six academic
departments from Southwest Missouri State University being involved. Earth 2010
participants will have science and mathematics knowledge and experience to
become active members of their community in environmental issues. ***
