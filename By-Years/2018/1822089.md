This proposal requests funding to assist 12 US-based graduate students for
attending the 36-th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium with the intention of exposing them
to the discipline and to encourage them to pursue careers in microelectronics.
Participation in this symposium is considered an important part of the graduate
school experience of students in the field of VLSI design, providing the
opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading
edge work in the field. The support will enable dissemination of scientific
knowledge to students who would otherwise not have the experience. This student
travel support will also facilitate the development of promising graduate
students, and will thus indirectly also help train the workforce of the future
in the important area of microelectronics. Women and underrepresented groups
will be given due consideration for receiving support through this grant.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS) for the past
34 years has been the premier academic forum where emerging trends and novel
concepts in testing, debug and repair of microelectronic circuits and systems
are explored. The 36-th edition of this symposium will addresses key trends and
challenges in the semiconductor design and manufacturing industries through a
program that includes Keynote and Plenary Talks, Technical Paper Sessions,
Embedded Tutorials, Panels, Hot Topic Sessions, Half-day Tutorials, and the
Innovative Practices Track. The conference committee has set up an adequate
evaluation criteria to select the qualified students from a pool of applicants
formed via open advertisement. The committee also plans to consider a small
number of undergraduate applicants in order to better reach a diverse population
of potential researchers in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects
NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
