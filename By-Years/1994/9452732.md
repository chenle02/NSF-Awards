9452732 Ober Ball State University will initiate a four week, residential, Young
Scholars project in physics and engineering (focus on introductory electronics)
which emphasizes the use of electronics. Through instructional and research
activities, the program will introduce 24 high school students entering grades
11 and 12 to the use of electronic instrumentation, integrated circuits, and
signal transducers. The program emphasizes the use of electronics as a tool in
the completion of an on-campus research project and a follow-up academic-year
research project.
