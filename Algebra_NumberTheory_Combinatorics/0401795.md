DMS-0401795 Valery Alexeev

The project builds on PI's work towards generalizations of stable n-pointed
curves to higher dimensions: stable pairs of dimension two and stable pairs with
group action: toric, abelian, semiabelian and reductive. He will investigate
several new applications of stable pairs and their moduli, including toric
Torelli map; characterization of non-regular periodic polyhedral tilings; toric
degenerations of reductive varieties with applications to mirror symmetry.

The main subject of algebraic geometry - the primary field of the investigator's
work - is to describe solutions of polynomial equations that are of fundamental
importance to mathematics and its applications to science and engineering.
Stable curves, whose higher-dimensional generalizations the investigator will
continue to study, have seen exciting applications in number theory and in
string theory in physics.
