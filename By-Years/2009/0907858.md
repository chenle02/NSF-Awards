(Public Law 111-5).

Dr. Lubin will use a multi-object spectrograph on the 10-meter Keck telescope to
measure redshifts (speed of motion away from the observer) for galaxies in and
around 20 distant galaxy clusters. Optical and near-infrared images will be used
to map out the distribution of galaxies on scales exceeding 30 million light
years. Both the colors of the galaxies and the details of their spectra will be
used to probe their star-forming history, and to examine how the pace of
starbirth is related to their surroundings. Radio and X-ray observations will
reveal which galaxies have active nuclei. The aim is to probe connections
between properties of the galaxies themselves, the galaxy clusters, and the
surrounding large-scale structure over this period between 6 billion and 9
billion years ago, when galaxies like our Milky Way were very actively forming
their stars.

Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through their involvement in
the research. Dr. Lubin has a good record of working with women students and
those from under-represented groups. The large databases assembled during the
research should be very useful to other workers, and will form the basis for
interactive tutorials for upper-division astrophysics courses.
