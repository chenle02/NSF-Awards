9628142 Stolper Oxygen isotope ratios can provide important constraint on the
origins of chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in the mantle sources of basaltic
lavas. Conventional measurements of whole-rock specimens and glasses are
typically significantly influenced by the effect of sample alteration and
isotopic fractionation during magmatic processes. The P.I.s propose to use laser
fluorination techniques to undertake a comprehensive survey of oxygen isotope
variations in phenocrysts (primarily olivine) from arc-related lavas. Results
thus far indicate that laser fluorination technique provides an accurate and
precise means of analyzing 18O/16O ratios in olivine and other phenocrysts. The
work will involve a survey of arc-related lavas, emphasizing basaltic back-arc
lavas that can provide information on the mantle "wedge" above subduction zones.
