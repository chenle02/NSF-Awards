With software becoming more and more complex, ensuring its total correctness, in
the absence of full formal and rigorous specifications, has become a highly
nontrivial task. Lightweight program analysis techniques which go beyond type
checking and detect semantic bugs are thus becoming increasing relevant. This is
especially so given that bugs such as buffer overflows can be exploited to cause
havoc, bringing organizations to a stand-still and causing considerable
financial loss. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore geometric
heuristics for quantifier elimination to automatically derive a restricted class
of invariant properties of programs, with the goal of developing scalable highly
efficient algorithms for program analysis. Particular attention will be paid to
properties expressed using numerical relational constraints on program
variables; industrial experience suggests that automatically deriving such
properties from unannotated and unspecified programs is extremely useful in
finding bugs in industrial software. Recent advances made in satisfiability
modulo theories (SMT) solvers and automated reasoning techniques as well as
already built tools for quantifier elimination will be exploited to achieve
this. This project will build a repertoire of techniques to be used in tools
analyzing programs including optimizing compilers, debuggers, and verifiers as
well as those for identifying security violations in computer networks.
