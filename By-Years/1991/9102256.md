Dr. David Jonas has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in
Chemistry. Dr. Jonas' doctoral degree was from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology under the supervision of Professor Robert Field. Dr. Jonas intends to
continue research at the University of Chicago under the supervision of
Professor Graham Fleming. Dr. Jonas' postdoctoral research will deal with phase
coherence and quantum interference effects in liquids. Longer term, he plans to
study coherence and optical activity of chiral molecules. %%% The Postdoctoral
Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as an important infrastructural
program designed to broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and
attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and
teaching.
