9527556 Ko This is an extension to the VELACS (Verification of Liquefaction
Analysis by Centrifuge Studies) project, the purpose of which was to evaluate
the relevance and effectiveness of the existing numerical and constitutive
models used in the analysis of soil liquefaction. The motivation is to resolve
the difficulties encountered in the Class A predictions of VELACS, and to
isolate the main cause of these difficulties. VELACS revealed that the current
procedures used for the analysis of geotechnical structures are not suitable, in
general, for predicting the consequences of soil liquefaction. Some of the most
promising procedures available for the analysis of soil liquefaction and its
consequences will be identified in this project. A series of carefully-performed
triaxial and torsional tests are to be conducted and carefully examined, so as
to provide a small but reliable data base. These data will be used for the
calibration of constitutive models, which in turn will be used for a Class A
prediction exercise of two centrifuge model experiments. The predictions will be
compared with the experimental results, and reasons for potential discrepancies
will be discussed. Multiple checks for reliability will be conducted in an
effort to isolate reasons for the lack of reliable predictions of the
experiments already considered in the VELACS project. ***
