Several basic unsolved questions concerning the spin glass problem, such as the
nature of the ordered phase and reentrant behavior, will be investigated.
Studies of faster simulation algorithms for these problems will be undertaken.
The behavior of neural networks for learning and computation will be analyzed
from a statistical mechanics perspective, and algorithms for producing better
networks will be investigated. Numerical simulations of alternative models of
superconductivity will be undertaken with the goal of understanding the
mechanism responsible for the recently discovered high temperature
superconductors. Correlation exponents in multifractals will be used to measure
the spectrum of dimensions that characterize such systems, and questions
concerning the amount of information contained in the scaling dimensions will be
investigated. The statistical properties of systems involving ring polymers will
be analyzed using a new and efficient algorithm for their generation. The
dynamics of DNA molecules will be studied in the context of pulsed field
electrophoresis, which is a new technique of great importance in bioengineering.
Fundamental questions regarding the role of chaos in quantum mechanics that have
been stimulated by recent experiments on hydrogen atoms in strong magnetic
fields will be examined. The quantum mechanics of hard spheres, such as a
Lorentz gas, will be studied in high dimension, to explore the validity of the
Gibbs distribution in closed quantum systems, and to provide an alternative
model of energy dissipation involving a finite number of degrees of freedom.
