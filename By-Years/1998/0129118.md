0129118 Wilhelm Cyanobacteria in freshwater environments respond to a variety of
well-studied physical factors as well as changes in the chemistry of their
environment. Overlying this is the influence of cyanophages, which persist in
thousands per mL and regulate cyanobacterial production, proliferation and
diversity. As blooms of toxin-producing species are increasing on a global
scale, and evidence is emerging that suggests chronic, low-level exposures to
cyanotoxins may be tumorogenic or carcinogenic, it has become critical to
develop a basic understanding of the ecological relationship between freshwater
cyanobacteria and the viruses that infect them. This project is a coordinated,
interdisciplinary lab and field study designed to examine the ecology and
diversity of lytic freshwater cyanophages at research sites in the Tennessee
River and in one of its tributaries. Augmented by a cruise of opportunity in the
western basin of Lake Erie, this study will provide a fundamental insight on the
cyanophage-host relationship in freshwaters as well as provide new insight on
the role of viruses in the release of cyanotoxins in both lab and natural
systems. The laboratory component will further this work by providing insight on
the diversity of the lytic cyanophages from these systems. This program of
research contains a significant educational component that will train both
graduate and undergraduate students (including those from underrepresented
groups) in the interdisciplinary aspects of microbial ecology, limnology and
molecular biology. The final scientific product of this study will be
information that will enhance our understanding of cyanobacterial proliferation
and cyanophage dynamics in freshwater systems. It will provide a critical
insight on the role of viruses in the flux of toxins into the dissolved phase of
potable water supplies. It will also serve to provide broader information for
those interested in water management for both consumable and recreational
activities.
