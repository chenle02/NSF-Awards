EIA-0218447&lt;br/&gt;Andrew D. Ellington&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at
Austin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ribozymes as Molecular Logic
Gates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological macromolecules have the potential to
perform computations. 'DNA computers' such as those pioneered by Adleman and his
co-workers have already been shown to be able to perform simple calculations.
However, these computers have for the most part been based on 'hybridization
logic' involving base-pairing interactions between digitally encoded strands.
The emphasis on 'hybridization logic' limits the utility and applicability of
nucleic acid computation because there are very few ways to read in
environmental conditions or read out answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucleic acid
enzymes (ribozymes) may prove to be the equivalent of the transistors or logic
gates that underlie silicon computation, and could potentially increase the
ultimate applicability of nucleic acid computation by interfacing directly with
the environment and generating easily read answers. Ribozyme logic gates will be
developed and integrated with mesoscale shape elements (known as MUFFINS) for
the logical evaluation of sets of analytes in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;
