9401389 Lin The principal investigator will study further relations between
quantum groups and the representations of algebraic groups in characteristic p.
The first part of the research is to study various intertwining homomorphisms
over an integral domain for quantum groups. This will provide a new class of
homomorphisms for Weyl modules. The second part of the research is to study the
contravariant bilinear forms on a quantum Weyl module over an integral domain by
using the Joseph inductions to explore the relations between the Jantzen
filtrations for both quantum groups and algebraic groups. The last problem is to
explore the Andersen-Jantzen-Soergel localization technique in the comparison
hyperalgebras. Quantum groups are a new area of research for both mathematicians
and physicists. On the mathematical side, it combines three of the oldest areas
of "pure" mathematics, algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great
interest to physicists working on conformal quantum field theory.
