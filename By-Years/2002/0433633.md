This collaborative Industry/University Cooperative Research Center will perform
research in three critical, overlapping areas. Cooperative Communications and
Networking research will examine wireless networks build out of nodes that
cooperate at the physical and network layers. Cooperative networks offer
enhanced capacity, reliability and efficiency relative to infrastructure and ad
hoc networks. The second area of research focuses on extending the battery life
of portable terminals thereby removing a major enhancing the convenience and
value of wireless terminals and sensors. The third research area is Wireless
Applications and associated Information Delivery mechanisms. Wireless
Applications under investigation include content distribution, applications that
leverage the ubiquity of wireless infrastructure with location awareness, and
applications that adapt to the capacity limitations of the wireless vis-a'-vis
the wired network. Each project focuses on a specific mode of wireless
connectivity of the Internet to portable mobile information devices. In addition
to developing and evaluating protocols and applications, Information Delivery
research addresses security and robustness. &lt;br/&gt;
