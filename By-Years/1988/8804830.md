This is an award resulting from a submission in response to Program
Announcement NSF 87-63, Research Experience for Undergraduates, 1987. Under this
award The University of Alabama will provide ten undergraduate students with
training and support while they participate in ongoing research projects in the
University's Computer Science Department. The award recognizes the importance of
hands-on experience in active research for training undergraduates for careers
in mathematics, science and engineering, and that too few such experiences are
now available. The University recruited some of the students from other
institutions, in order to broaden the base for attracting students to scientific
careers.
