Digital transmission of images implemented by VLSI is considered a very
important area because of the possible reduction in the transmitted information
rate subject to an acceptable level of error. Much of the research to the
present time has been devoted to still-picture, or intraframe coding. Other work
has been directed towards the interframe coding, or motion coding, task. In this
investigation, both intraframe (still) image coding and intraframe (motion)
image coding, with an objective of further bit rate reduction below presently
known techniques, is pursued. This research involves vector quantization
principles which are to be extended to color imagery and to temporal coding. The
goal is to make the objective bit rate substantially lower than present levels.
The first topic involves extending recent work in intraframe coding to color
imagery and to lower bit rates. Coding of motion imagery by vector quantizing of
the frame difference signals is also proposed, along with a simple
classification scheme to process color imagery at rates of approximately one-
third of the rate that now exists for standard videoconferencing coders.
