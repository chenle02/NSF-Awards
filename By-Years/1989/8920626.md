This award will support collaborative research in "New Foundations of Computer
Science" between Professor John McCarthy, Stanford University, and Professor
Masahiko Sato, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, and several of their colleagues
in the United States and Japan. The purpose of the collaboration is to advance
the understanding of mathematical foundations of computer science. There is need
to bring together mathematical tools that have been developed in basic research
in computer science, to obtain a better understanding of these tools, and to
develop new tools for studying foundational issues. Fundamental issues such as
abstract and special purpose logics, mechanized reasoning systems, and abstract
descriptions of programming constructs are among the topics where progress can
be expected from the cooperative effort. Progress in these areas of basic
research can have important consequences in areas such as computer
architectures, languages, and systems, as well as in artificial intelligence and
logic. The study of logics for computation, mechanized reasoning systems, and
theory of programming languages is a very rapidly growing field. The U.S. and
Japanese researchers taking part in this joint effort have substantial expertise
in the areas of logic, formal reasoning, and mathematics as well as experience
in the application of this expertise to a wide range of basic problems in
computer science. Previous interaction among several of the scientists has been
productive. This current cooperative endeavor will provide an opportunity to
discover new foundational methods and to apply existing methods to current
problems of artificial intelligence and programming language theory.
