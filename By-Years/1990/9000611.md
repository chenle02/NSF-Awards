Stochastic models for NP-complete problems attempt to describe the average case
of these problems rather than their worst case. The study of these models is a
considerable challenge to the probabilists. The project concentrates on problems
where connections with other areas of mathematics can be found. The emphasis is
on considering the problems at the greatest possible level of generality (which
often makes them look much simpler) and on the use of abstract tools rather than
adhoc methods. In the past, progress has been made using empirical processes,
martingale inequalities, and the Hahn-Banach theorem. Specific problems to be
studied include bin packing heuristics, scheduling problems and the traveling
salesman problem.
