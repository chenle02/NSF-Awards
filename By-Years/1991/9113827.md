The objective of this internship project is to evaluate the implementation of
concurrent engineering in a major communications manufacturing facility. In
concurrent engineering, design, specifications, materials, and manufacturing
processes are considered simultaneously in contrast to the present approach
where these functions are sequential and compartmentalized. Specifically, this
project will analyze the present system by examining the history of a set of
selected new products. The problems that delayed the products and the
manufacturing problems that are associated with the products will be assessed.
Measures to move in the direction of concurrent design will be explored.
Extension and implications for other manufacturing organizations will also be
documented.
