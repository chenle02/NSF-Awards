"Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference."

The Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Conference will be held in
Columbus, OH on May 28-29, 2003. This is a small student-centered conference
emphasizing presentations by graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and young
faculty working in all areas of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.
Funding will reimburse graduate students and postdocs for travel and
registration costs associated with the meeting. Funds for other aspects of
running this meeting have been arranged from other sources, primarily donations
from the Ohio State University. NSF-CTS has provided student travel funds for
this meeting several times in the past, and this action has been important in
making attendance at this meeting widely accessible to graduate students.
Intellectual merit: During the two-day conference, various topics from
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics will be discussed. We expect about 65
to 70 attendees, which is small compared to typical national conferences. This
allows avoidance of parallel sessions, encouraging in-depth discussion and
exchange of ideas among attendees.

Broader impact: The conference proceeds in a collegial atmosphere, which is an
ideal way of building a community of researchers who might continue interacting
with each other at various levels even long after the conference. About two
thirds of the attendees are graduate students and postdocs. For them, the
conference can serve as an introduction to the thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics community. For faculty, the conference affords an opportunity to meet
and evaluate potential faculty candidates in an informal yet intellectually
stimulating environment.
