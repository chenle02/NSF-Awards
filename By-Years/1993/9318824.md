This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
provides continued support for research on vanadium phosphates by Dr. Jon
Zubieta of the Chemistry Department, Syracuse University. A variety of synthetic
techniques will be used to produce novel structures containing vanadium oxide
and phosphate. Hydrothermal methods will be used to produce large polyhedral
arrays of these components, and attempts will be made to incorporate other
metals such as Ti, Zr, Mn, Fe, and Mo into the arrays. Arrays with different
arrangments will be prepared from vanadoarsenates and vanado-organoarsonates.
Polyfunctional ligands will be used to connect clusters together into nanometer-
scale structures. All types of arrays will be structurally and magnetically
characterized, and tested for their ability to incorporate organic cations. The
long-term goal of this research is to develop rational sythetic procedures for
microporous materials based on transition metal/oxoanion frameworks. The
synthetic conditions needed for sythesis of these materials are not well known,
but molecular arrays with a great variety of structural features have been
prepared. Because these compounds are thermally stable, they are attractive
candidates for cataysts and catalyst supports, whose variety of structural forms
could produce catalysts of various selectivities and reactivities.
