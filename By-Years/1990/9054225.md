This workshop is addressed to undergraduate college faculty who teach courses in
historical geology, paleontology, petrology, or related fields, and who have had
little or no experience in modern carbonates. The purpose of the workshop is to
expand the participant's understanding of modern carbonate sediments, precursors
of ancient carbonates, and post depositional changes that affect them. Specific
topics to be examined include carbonate-secreting organisms, sediments,
environments of deposition, carbonate diagenesis, soil formation and
interpretation of Pleistocene analogues. This workshop will also provide the
participant with an opportunity to acquire photographs of specific carbonate
environments and to collect samples which may be used to enhance instruction at
his/her home institution. A guidebook, approximately 100 pages in length, will
be prepared and provided for each participant. Sets of slides of features
requiring special equipment will be provided to each participant including such
material as underwater photographs and photomicrographs. The program involves
daily field work, labs and lectures and will be held at the Bahamian Field
Station, San Salvador, Bahamas. As much of the field work will involve
snorkeling, participants must be able to swim.//
