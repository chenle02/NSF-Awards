Dr. Kleppa plans to continue a program of research on high temperature
calorimetry of refractory systems. The planned research includes activity in
four related areas of high temperature reaction calorimetry: (1) Studies of
Alloys Involving Transition Metals (2) Thermochemistry of Sulfide Systems (3)
Calorimetry Above 1400 K (4) New Applications Emphasis will be placed on
continued work on the thermochemistry of liquid alloys of noble metals and
transition metals, for studies of intermetallic compounds, and for new research
on the thermochemistry of sulfides and sulfosalts. This work is important not
only for chemistry but also for ceramics, mineralogy, and geology. It is
important for the fabrication of new materials and will provide input data for
theoreticians seeking explanations at a molecular level.
