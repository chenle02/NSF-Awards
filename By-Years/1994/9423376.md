9423376 HANSELL This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment
for the research vessel WEATHERBIRD II, operated by the Bermuda Biological
Station for Research, Inc, and dedicated to use in support of ocean science
research. The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for
ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science
research. This Program provides support for such items as deck equipment
including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific
instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth
qatellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites, communication
equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and
scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats
for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites. The Project
Director, Dennis A. Hansell is fully qualified to direct this project having had
considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of
shipboard equipment. This project will allow the institution to replace an
undersized crane, obtain a spare CTD winch drum, rehabilitate a hydro winch,
replace an old radar and refrigerator and install an oily water separator, an
MSD and a navtex receiver. ***
