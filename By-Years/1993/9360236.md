9360236 McElroy Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is an important worldwide food
legume, capable of growing with minimal rainfall and capable of fixing nitrogen.
The crop is often grown in rotation with grains on nitrogen deficient soils. For
the plant to reach maximum sustainable yields without supplemental nitrogen, it
must be inoculated with a Rhizobium and planted during winter seasons. Planting
under cool wet conditions, however, subjects the crop to Pythium caused damping-
off resulting in serious crop loss. Seed treatment with chemical fungicides is
effective but kills the Rhizobium. Thus, an alternative method to prevent
Pythium caused damping-off is desirable. This project will examine the
feasibility of using biological disease control agents (BDCAs) in combination
with Rhizobium to prevent Pythium disease and maximize the sustainable yield of
chickpea. Greenhouse Phase I studies will test five BDCAs with special chickpea
Rhizobium in four different agricultural soils. If successful, this unique
method of preventing Pythium disease could be used in other sustainable food
legume crops in the U.S. and worldwide, and therefore, is directly related to
U.S. technical and economic competitiveness in agricultural biotechnology.
