The principal cause of the severe limitations of paleointensity data sets is
the extreme difficulty of obtaining reliable results. Not only are the
measurements time consuming, but the success rate is relatively low, despite
great care in sample selection. One requires, a material possessing a thermal
remanence, that has not altered since its acquisition and does not alter during
the experiments. Furthermore, the material should have cooled at a rate
reproducible in the laboratory, and should be datable with a relative precision
of a few percent. Basaltic glass has been recovered from hundreds of Deep Sea
Drilling Program holes from anomalies of known age. Glass is quenched at
formation and the rate of cooling can be well approximated in the laboratory. It
can be inspected for alteration and shown that it does not readily alter during
the Thellier experiment. Finally, basaltic glass derived from MORB appears to
contain single domain low-Ti magnetite. Shards can be found that have sufficient
moments to be readily measured with our equipment; such shards obtained from 0
and 2640 year eruptions of the East Pacific Rise have yielded excellent
paleointensity data and similar quality data can be obtained from other basaltic
glass regardless of age. The PI will carry out a paleointensity study of
basaltic glasses.
