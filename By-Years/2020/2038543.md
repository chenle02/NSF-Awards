This SBIR Phase II project will develop breakthrough polymeric membranes to
purify water by reverse osmosis. It will address the recognized global need for
clean drinking water driven by increasing population and urbanization that
affect billions of people living in water-stressed lands. The impurities in
water from different geographical locations and different types of water (e.g.,
seawater, industrial wastewater, tap water reuse) differ, and separation
membranes that can selectively remove different combinations of impurities will
be critical to addressing this world challenge. The technology provides a means
to greatly eliminate costly cleaning operations and minimize plant downtime in
this ~$5 billion market. Industrial and Enhanced energy and operating efficiency
will be achieved through reduced required pretreatment and enhanced fouling
resistance, leading to extended use cycles and improved water flux over the
lifetime of the membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase II project will
produce thin film composite reverse osmosis (RO) membranes comprised of
precisely sulfonated polysulfone polymers in the ~100-nm thick range on a porous
support. These novel membranes will provide a long sought after revolution in
water purification membranes with their high resistance to chlorine for
disinfection and ability to prevent biofouling. For the first time, they will
also efficiently remove monovalent salts that contaminate seawater and brackish
water from their mixed salt compositions. Sulfonated polysulfones have been
considered previously for RO membranes due to their inherent chemical
resistance, but they failed due to low salt rejection at high ionic strengths
and their inferiority in salt rejections in mixed salt feedwater. Municipal
water requirements are high and their process water is often contaminated with
toxic products (boron and arsenic moieties, hydrocarbons, perfluorinated
surfactants, biofilms), making reuse difficult to impossible technically and
economically. This project advances material synthesis and material processing
through precisely sulfonated polymers. Phase II will take advantage of these
advances to optimize the membrane coating process, scale it to pilot quantities,
and measure resistance to a range of impurities found in tap water reuse,
industrial water purification, as well as in purification of brackish surface
and groundwater and highly saline seawater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award
reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
criteria.
