PI: Wei, Jianjun Proposal: 1511194

The goal is to develop a novel platform that incorporates an optical
transmission sensing scheme with an automated size-dependent sample delivery
system in a single nanoscale unit. The results will lead to a chip-based, point-
of-care (POC) technology for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

This project will investigate a plasmonic nano-optofluidic (PNOF) platform to
demonstrate its utility and versatility of in-situ cell separation and delivery
of small molecules to the sensing area, and discriminative, sensitive
quantitation of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Unique metal film structures
will be used as plasmonic waveguides to tune the spectrum that enables
ultrasensitive and high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio detection. The array will be
utilized to integrate with a microfluidic network to realize in-situ separation
of cells and size-exclusive delivery biomarkers. The researchers will then adopt
the immunoassay format and demonstrate delivery and discrimination of selected
biomarkers in human blood.
