95-28256 McCray Dr. McCray will continue to develop theoretical tools for
analyzing the spectra of supernovae. This analysis is particularly valuable
during the nebular phase, a few months after the initial outburst, when the
supernova debris has thinned enough to observe all the newly-synthesized
elements created in the explosion. The spectrum is decoded using a theoretical
model of spectrum formation. This project will concentrate on two specific
projects. The first is to complete the development of comprehensive models to
describe the evolution of the spectrum of SN1987A, especially the transfer and
fluorescence of the ultraviolet radiation. The second is to develop theoretical
models for the nebular spectra of Type Ia supernovae. There are indications that
this might be a reliable method for calibrating the true luminosity of such
sources, thus providing standard candles with which distances to galaxies can be
determined. ***
