ABSTRACT

Enhancing Diversity in Buffalo, New York, Area Geoscience Programs

A consortium of three State University of New York Institutions, led by the
University at Buffalo, is developing a comprehensive program for the attraction
of underrepresented groups to their geoscience programs and for the retention of
these students. The program begins with the offering of new earth science
courses at Erie Community College (ECC), and then leads either to the earth
science education program (BSEd/MSEd) at Buffalo State College (BSC) or to the
geology BA/BS program at the University at Buffalo (UB). ECC's City Campus
serves a student population that includes over 50% underrepresented groups. It
is the most common destination of students from the Buffalo Public Schools,
whose student body is comprised of over 70% individuals from underrepresented
groups.

The UB program includes: a continuing research program in which every student
participates in ongoing research in one of the laboratories in the department; a
research development seminar in which preparation of proposals and presentation
of results is emphasized; a weekly seminar which includes attending professional
talks, plus attendance at selected professional meetings, and discussion of the
talks; a summer course in field techniques, including soil and hydrologic
methods used in the consulting industry; a program of regular mentoring and
tutoring for all participants; and participation in geology department/club
activities on a regular basis. The program is designed to prepare the student to
continue on for a Master's degree and potentially for a Ph.D. At BSC the program
includes participation in ongoing research in the department plus a summer
transition program and a field experience in a secondary education course.
Students in the program may also continue graduate work at UB. The program is
fully integrated with the extensive existing programs for students from
underrepresented groups at each institution.
