This project seeks to understand the signaling mechanisms that control cellular
activities such as cell division, cell growth, and cell differentiation. Errors
in cellular signaling cause diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes.
Accurate models of cellular signalling are thus necessary for rational drug
design and other applications central to national health. This project focuses
on inferring models from experimental data. Specifically, it is interested in
models of protein signalling because proteins control and mediate the vast
majority of biological processes in a living cell. The project follows of the
approach of executable biology: models of cell signalling are computer programs,
which allows executing the models on the computer and comparing the model
behavior against the behavior of the living cell observed in the lab setting.
Most importantly for this project, viewing models as programs will allow the
team to harness the recent advances in automatic synthesis of computer programs
for synthesis of models from experimental measurements of cells.

The goal of the project is to provide biologists with a tool that synthesizes a
variety of executable models from varied types of experimental data. To
facilitate synthesis of mechanistic models from experimental data, the project
will develop a family of modeling languages that will capture complex behaviors
of biological systems, such as time and concurrency. The languages will be
instances of the more general Boolean-Networks language. The team will
investigate how to adjust the modeling abstraction based on the nature of
available experimental data; the abstractions will be instantiated as suitably
chosen languages from their language family. The modeling framework will be
built by leveraging techniques from programming languages and formal methods
such as meta-programming and constraint solving.
