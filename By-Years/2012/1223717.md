This project studies Internet censorship as practiced by some of today's nation-
states. The effort emphasizes analyzing the techncial measures used by censors
to perform censorship, the extent to which their operations inflict collateral
damage (unintended blocking, or blocking of activity wholly outside the
censoring nation), and vulnerabilities due to the specifics of how censorship
operates. Regarding this latter, we analyze flaws in either how the censorship
monitoring detects particular network traffic to suppress, or in how the monitor
then attempts to block or disrupt the target traffic. This facet of the research
focuses on forms of monitoring that eavesdrop on network links, analyze copies
of transmitted traffic, and then inject forged traffic, seemingly sent from one
of the communication endpoints to the other, instructing the other party to
cease communication. Such "on-path" monitoring is subject to a number of
potential manipulations and evasions due to the inexact view the monitor has of
the comunication as actually seen by the communicating parties. We in particular
then work towards developing tools and changes to Internet technology that can
resist these forms of disruption and thus enable users to access the Internet
freely.
