This project proposes to create an interactive computer program and database
titled Datascope that will be a storehouse of environmental information. The
most comprehensive data now available on natural resource and environmental
issues in 146 countries of the world will be used as a source of information for
this program. Students will be able to manipulate this database, add their own
data and seek solutions to environmental problems with the aid of developed
support materials and an education software program. The project is well
designed and would make a valuable environmental database available in an
interactive format that students could use in solving real problems. Students
could gain experience in data manipulation, mapping, analysis, data use and
understanding. Portions of the program could be used in the social sciences
equally well. Methods have been outlined where WRI will work with TERC and the
Canadian Space Agency to develop a student and teacher guide to data analysis
and interpretation.
