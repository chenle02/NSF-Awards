Interactions between adatoms on metal surfaces will be examined using the field
ion microscope to investigate chemical and structural factors in pair
interactions, many-atom interactions and overlayer stability, and interactions
and surface diffusion. The dependence of pair energetics upon the chemical
identity of the adatoms will be explored with pairs of palladium and gold atoms
on tungsten. Measurements of cluster dissociation for iridium and palladium on
tungsten will be combined with data on pair interactions to determine the role
of many-atom effects in cohesion. Diffusion in a surface layer containing many
adatoms will be studied by measuring the time correlation of concentration
flucturations to establish the effects of interaction on the diffusivity.
