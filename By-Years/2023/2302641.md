This project aims to explore interactions between analysis, dynamics, number
theory, and group theory. A quintessential example of such occurs in the study
of arithmetic properties of circle and sphere packings, a fertile area of
research where techniques can be developed that then apply to much broader
contexts. Integrated with the research components of this project are a number
of educational and outreach endeavors. The PI is engaged in organizing seminars,
workshops, and conferences around the world, collaborating with the National
Museum of Mathematics, and reaching broader audiences with YouTube videos on
high-level but accessible mathematics topics. In years 2 and 3 of this project,
the PI will bring to Rutgers the MathCorps summer program for middle and high
school students from the New Brunswick area.

A major component of the PI's research program is the study of local-global
principles in thin groups and their myriad applications to seemingly unrelated
problems in distant branches of mathematics. Consequences include a better
understanding of the asymptotic properties of closed geodesic lengths on
infinite-volume hyperbolic surfaces, billiard trajectories on flat surfaces, and
the sets of radii of circles and spheres in packings generated by group actions.
The PI will also work to (1) classify which convex polyhedra, when geometrized
to finite covolume 3-folds, are arithmetic, (2) attack a number of problems in
homogeneous dynamics and Diophantine approximation, and (3) contribute to the
Lean Interactive Theorem Prover's mathlib library.
