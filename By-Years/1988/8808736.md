Attachment theory, formulated by John Bowlby in an influential three-volume
study, currently provides one of the best explanations of emotional bonding
between young children and their parents. It also explains what happens when
emotional bonds are disrupted or severed (for example, through separation or
death). Bowlby intended the theory to apply, in his words, "from the cradle to
the grave" (that is, to serve as a lifespan theory of attachments), but until
recently few researchers had attempted to study adult love from an attachment-
theoretical perspective. In several exploratory studies considerable support has
been obtained for predictions derived from the theory--predictions concerning
the way love is experienced by people with different attachment styles (secure,
avoidant, anxious/ambivalent), the differential divorce rates of people with
different attachment histories, the proneness of adults with insecure attachment
styles to chronic loneliness, and so on. This research will extend the line of
work in several ways: (1) improving preliminary measures of adult attachment
style, attachment history, and attachment-related phenomena (such as emotional
experiences at work, patterns of sexual motivation and sexual problems, and
ability to offer empathic, sensitive care to a relationship partner); (2)
examining connections between attachment style, attachment history, and
behavioral assessments of relationship quality (such as marital conflict and
communication coded from laboratory videotapes); (3) examining longitudinally
the early phases of adult love relationships to see how attachment variables
influence the course of relationship development (including break-up, in cases
where that occurs); and (4) probing, through intensive interviews, the life
histories (particularly the relationship histories) of people whose attachment
styles have changed over time from insecure to secure. The research should
deepen the theoretical foundation of the emerging close relationship field,
tying it to existing work in ethology and developmental psychology. It should
help integrate important social psychological findings.
