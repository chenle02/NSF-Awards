9418219 McNutt This project will support a post-doctoral investigator to
complete an existing database ion volcanic tremor from more thal 160 volcanoes
around the world. The most important parameter to be investigated is the
amplitude of tremor which is normalized to reduced displacement. This problem is
as fundamental as the determination of earthquake magnitudes. Preliminary
results show that tremor reduced displacements during eruptions are proportional
to the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), which is proportional to the tephra
volume. We propose to test the hypothesis that the energy of volcanic tremor is
directly proportional to the volume of magma and its contained volatiles. We
will measure the seismic efficiencies of tremor, and we show preliminary data
that suggest there are different efficiencies for different eruptive mechanisms.
This project is complementary to many theoretical studies. It is broad and wide
ranging because it includes data from all known seismically monitored volcanoes
worldwide. Although the chief value of the project is scientific, several
components, especially reduced displacement versus VEI, also have a direct
bearing on volcanic hazards assessment and forecasting.
