Despite abundant pathological evidence indicating that the striatum, a brain
structure (caudate-putamen) is an important component of the motor system,
little is known about the physiology of the striatum during normal behavior.
This is true for several reasons. First, the use of anesthesia in physiological
experiments, while allowing progress in understanding other regions of the brain
has obscured our understanding of the striatum due to its drastic reduction in
neuronal activity in this system. Furthermore, anesthetics have been shown to
alter measures of dopaminergic function in the striatum (as compared with awake
animals). Second, unit recordings from single striatal neurons in awake animals
have seldom shown the clear, consistent correlations with motor and sensory
events typical of neurons in primary motor and sensory areas. Instead responses,
when present, are conditional and the details regarding the necessary conditions
remain unknown. Third, single unit recordings during conscious behavior have
been restricted almost entirely to the primate during head restraint. The
involvement of the striatum in movement could, however, encompass a broader
integration of whole body sensorimotor processing. Coordinated active movement
is achieved both by causing rotational and translational movement of joints
(primary movement), and by stabilizing other body parts and shifting the center
of gravity so that the primary movement can occur. It is possible that
conditions allowing unrestrained movement and the accompanying sensory feedback
may be required for full manifestation of striatal participation in such
processes. If so, electrophysiological recordings in freely moving animals, may
reveal previously unobserved features elucidating the unique contribution of the
striatum and basal ganglia to behavior. Dr. Mark West will study the role of the
behavior of the striatum in awake, intact, unanesthetized animals.
