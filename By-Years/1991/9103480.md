Professor Thomas will work on problems related to Wagner's conjecture and
Hadwiger's conjecture. He will also investigate whether there is a theory of
directed graph minors as well as working in the theory of quasi-ordered sets.
Graph Theory goes back perhaps two hundred years, but only in the last half-
century has the field become an active, fertile, and flourishing branch of
mathematics. A graph is a network of lines ("edges") joining points
("vertices"), thus the language of graphs becomes a natural way of describing
interrelationships among separated objects. Graph Theory figures most
prominently as an essential tool in Communications Theory and Computer Science.
