"Research in Atmospheric Dynamics" Under this award, the principal investigator
will pursue studies in two areas of atmospheric dynamics. The first involves a
theoretical study of the formation of storms or cyclones in the lee of mountain
ranges, or lee cyclogenesis. Two aspects of cyclogenesis will be examined in
detail: (1) the interaction between the incipient disturbance and the mountain
barrier and (2) the role of jet streaks as the impetus for the developing storm.
This study represents an extension of some of Dr. Bannon's previous work. The
second research area involves a reexamination of one aspect of a major
conceptual model of atmospheric dynamics, the quasi-geostrophic theory. This
theory employs certain approximations to the equations of motion which are
applicable to large-scale atmospheric motion. The principal investigator plans
to test the validity of a new form of the equations which better represents
conditions at the lower boundary of numerical models. Both of these studies are
important for improving our understanding of large-scale atmospheric motion.
