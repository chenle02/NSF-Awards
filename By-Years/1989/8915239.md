This research will relate experimentally floc density and permeability to floc
size and to the hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions prevailing during
formation. Floc strength will be determined on a relative basis by measuring the
fluid velocity necessary to disrupt a floc supported on a screen through which
water is forced. Fractal dimensions of the contours of individual flocs will be
determined to give some information on the mechanisms of floc growth. Floc size,
density, permeability, and strength are important in such areas as minerals
separation, water treatment, ceramics processing, and environmental engineering.
It is important to develop techniques for measuring these floc characteristics
and to relate them to the hydrodynamic and physicochemical conditions prevailing
during floc formation.
