9320648 Marks NSF support is provided from funds allocated by Federal agency
members of the interagency CEES Sub-Committee on Global Change Research, for
shared international funding of the centralized costs of planning for the
International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Planning and development of
a series of core research projects of the IGBP will be undertaken. The IGBP and
these core projects will support development of a global observing system; will
contribute to international assessments of global change sci- ence, in
particular to those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC);
will improve and facilitate the flow of data and information in support of IGBP
research; and will assist scientists and scientific institutions in developing
countries to participate more fully in and support such research. Results of the
IGBP will provide input to the analysis, modelling, and interpretation of global
change. To achieve these objectives, meetings of international scientific
committees and scientific steeering groups for the core projects will be
convened. Scientific and technological reports which result from IGBP activities
will be prepared and distributed. The IGBP Secretariat will support these
activities.
