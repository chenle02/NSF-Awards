9301220 Hoyt The technique of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is used to
investigate the kinetics of subcritical nuclei formation in the aluminum-zinc
binary alloy system. In-situ SAXS experiments are conducted at the 10 meter
facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The unique feature of the ORNL
area detector and the inherent anisotropic scattering in aluminum-zinc is used
to define temperatures at which only nuclei of near critical size are forming.
The change in intensity with time is compared to the recently formulated Shi-
Seinfeld analytic solution to the problem of transient nucleation rates. In
addition a study of the order- disorder reaction in AgAuCd2 is planned. The
experiment represents a novel application of the technique of neutron resonant
scattering and will measure for the first time partial ordering in a ternary
alloy. This study is performed using the Glass, Liquid and Amorphous
Diffractometer (GLAD) at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source. %%% This project
examines the formation of structure in metallic materials and leads to an
improved understanding of materials processing to develop the appropriate
properties in materials. ***
