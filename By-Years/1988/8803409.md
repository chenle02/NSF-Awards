applications of the recent developments in the Logic of Knowledge, in
Distributed Computing, Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In particular
knowledge revision, the problem of logical omniscience, formalization of
probabilistic knowledge, and other areas where the notion of knowledge can be
expected to play an important role will be investigated.
