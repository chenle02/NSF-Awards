Differential geometry of curves and surfaces has an important role in
solidifying the standard courses in beginning calculus and linear algebra. The
topic provides the tools for visualization of geometric phenomena and for
applications to physics, engineering, computer science, and other areas of
mathematics. The subject is particularly well-suited to interactive computer
graphics. In this project, a complete set of transportable, interactive computer
graphics laboratory modules is being developed. The materials can be used to
supplement standard courses in calculus and linear algebra, or to supplement a
standard textbook in elementary differential geometry. The materials can also
provide the foundation on which to build a laboratory intensive differential
geometry course. Innovations include the use of new "hypertext" tools for
interaction and response, and the use of computer graphics to enhance the
visualization experience. Each module presents a single topic or related topics,
illustrated by examples that can be modified by students in response to
questions and suggestions. The modules are written in a demonstration-
investigative mode, well suited for cooperative and collaborative activities.
The target student audience includes students considering concentrations in
mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.
