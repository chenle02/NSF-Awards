97-06432 Axen One of the larger outstanding issues in plate tectonics concerns
the initiation and evolution of continental rifting. A second important problem
relates to the understanding of the evolution of transform faulting to strongly
oblique rifting. The Gulf of Baja is the obvious natural laboratory for studying
these problems because it is in the early stages of its evolution, it is well
exposed, and it is accessible. Axen's study will contribute to our knowledge by
providing an integrative data set including geological mapping, structural
geology, and sedimentology, all supported by geochronologic work. By studying
both the volcanic and the sedimentary rocks, as well as their structures and
temporal relations, Axen's data will bear directly on the detailed geologic
history of the evolution of the northern part of the Gulf of Baja.
