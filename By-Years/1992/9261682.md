Next-generation intelligent systems and robots will require the power of
parallel computer, yet most novel parallel languages are geared primarily for
numerical calculation--e.g., signal processing--in which the data values are
elementary numerical samples. These models of computation fail miserably for
calculations involving the highly-structured symbolic data required for
artificial intelligence application. A "linear" language provides an elegant and
intuitive "mechanical" model of parallel computation in which structured values
are transmitted as simply as elementary values. These "linear" data structures
retain the ability to transmit highly structured information, yet avoid the
problems of aliasing and sharing. The efficiency of existing linear language
promising new implementation techniques. In Phase I, we will investigate the
ability of our novel implementation approach to provide most of the efficiency
of nonlinear shared data structures while preserving the elegant linear data
model. If successful, our Phase II implementation of a parallel linear language
will provide efficient execution, together with an elegant and intuitive
programming model. This combination should increase the productivity of software
development for intelligent applications utilizing MIMD parallel computers.//
