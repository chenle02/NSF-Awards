9403521 Tossell Although gold adsorption onto sulfide mineral surfaces has been
extensively studied experimentally, the microscopic mechanism is still poorly
known. We propose to calculate the structures, energetics and spectral
properties of gold bisulfide and gold complexes bonded to metal sulfide species
in solution, such as the arsenic and antimony sulfides, and to the surfaces of
sulfide minerals, particularly the arsenic and antimony sulfides. Our goal is to
understand why such gold complexes are preferentially absorbed onto these
sulfide mineral surfaces and to determine the microscopic structures of the
surface species formed. In the process of achieving this goal we expect to shed
light on a number of other questions of general geochemical interest, e.g. the
speciation of As and Sb in sulfidic waters, the scanning tunneling spectra of
sulfide surfaces, the structure and properties of the surface functional groups,
and the nature of the adsorption complexes formed between collector molecules
and sulfide mineral surfaces.
