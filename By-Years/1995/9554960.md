An integrated, interdisciplinary curriculum is proposed to actively engage
students in the scientific process. A three course sequence consisting of
"Mathematics and Inquiry", "Science and Inquiry", and "Undergraduate Research",
will be required of all non-science majors. The goals of this curriculum are to
foster an understanding of the process of science and to develop an awareness of
the interconnections between science disciplines and the natural world. Classes
will be team taught by physical and life scientists, using case-studies to
explore real world issues through open-ended laboratories and small group
projects. The undergraduate research course is the most challenging part of this
proposal, and will require all students to engage the scientific process through
participation in on-going research projects, or through design and
implementation of a research project. Teaching science by engaging all students
in the scientific process could revolutionize the way we educate non-science
majors, meeting the national goals of producing more scientifically literate
graduates, and empowering them to confront the complex social and scientific
problems of the 21st century.
