0072262 Neuhauser This research of Dr. Neuhauser covers three areas: (1)
community ecology, (2) evolutionary ecology, and (3) population genetics.
Mathematical tools will be developed to address questions of (i) the causes and
effects of spatial structure on plant communities, in particular the question of
how explicit space affects diversity and stability of plant communities; (ii)
the evolution of resistance to insecticide and the spread of resistant alleles,
in particular for a genetically engineered crop that expresses chemicals that
are toxic to its insect pests; (iii) how mating structure affects spatial
structuring in gynodioecious plants; and (iv) how temporal variability affects
genealogies. The spatial processes will be modeled using the framework of
interacting particle systems, which are continuous time Markov processes on the
infinite D dimensional lattice, characterized by local interactions between
sites. The genealogical processes will be investigated using the ancestral
selection graph as a modeling framework. The motivation for the proposed
research is to gain a better understanding of how spatial and temporal factors
affect the outcome of interactions in plant communities. Most of ecological and
agricultural modeling traditionally did not take into account effects of
explicit space due to the difficulties encountered in the analysis of such
models. More recently, tools have been developed that allow rigorous analysis of
spatial models. This research of Dr. Neuhauser is intended to shed light on how
space affects plant communities; this is important in understanding the
structure of both natural and managed (agricultural) communities. Her results
should help devise management strategies for maintaining biodiversity in natural
communities and for slowing the spread of resistance genes in crop systems of
genetically engineered crop.
