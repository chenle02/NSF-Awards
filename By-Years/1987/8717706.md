Railroad bridges are in a declining state of safety and require evaluation to
determine the current load capacities for safety limits, this project will
provide data to perform evaluation, rehabilitation and replacement
investigations of older railroad bridges. The Association of American Railroads
will be contributing funds and personnel to assist in the investigations.
