The proposed project approaches the problem of library development by a
fundamentally different approach -- one in which the knowledge abstractions at
an appropriate level are represented and then this knowledge is converted into
implementations optimized for different target platforms and circumstances. The
primary intellectual merit here is the automation of high quality numerical code
generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is that abstraction driven
automation for library developers can significantly cut down the "software gap"
-- delay between development of new architectures and new software that
maximizes its use. The impact of this will be broad across all disciplines that
use HPC.
