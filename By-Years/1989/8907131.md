This proposal includes both the purchase of an instrument and the development of
a new analytical capability for direct analysis of 15N gases. A primary group of
four investigators at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford
University Stanford proposes to acquire an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with
a direct combustion unit for automated analysis of 15N-and 13C-enriched
materials. The research projects in which the stable isotope analysis will be
used include terrestrial nutrient cycling, soil microbial ecology, plant
physiological ecology, trace gas interactions between soil and atmosphere, and
analysis of metabolic pathways. The immediate availability to these research
programs of this recently developed, high sample capacity, small sample size,
stable isotope/total N and C analysis system will provide a powerful analytical
capacity for routine application in a number of very active ecology and
physiology research programs in Northern California. The development of the mass
spectrometer for direct quantification of 15N N20, N2, and NO (separated by
capillary chromatographic methods) will facilitate major new research
investigations in the origin and control of trace nitrogen gases involved in
global ozone depletion and climatic change.
