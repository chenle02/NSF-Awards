9322073 Becker The existing REU Site in the Physics Department of San Jose State
University will be expanded to include the other active research areas in the
SJSU Physics Department. A proposed new and innovative component of this REU
Site will include support for students in industry-university collaborations.
Four teams will be formed, each consisting of a Physics faculty member, a
physicist from an industrial or government laboratory located close to the
campus, and an NSF-REU student participant. Although eleven of these projects
are still in the area of optics, the remaining two are in condensed matter and
computational physics. All these projects complement the Physics Department's
officially recognized "Concentration in Lasers and Optics", "Concentration in
Condensed Matter", and the "Concentration in Computational Physics". These three
areas represent the major scientific focus in the high-tech "Silicon Valley"
surrounding our University. These on-going research projects will provide both
experimental and theoretical research experience for undergraduates in Physics.
Undergraduate students will be placed in thirteen projects which range from
experimental diode laser spectroscopy of stable isotopes in carbon dioxide to
theoretical studies of electrical and optical properties of quantum well
semiconductors, to rare- earth spectroscopy, to temperature-induced refractive
index changes in oxide insulators, to neutron activation analysis of optical
materials. The proposed program's major goal is to involve undergraduate
students, especially minorities, in research who might not otherwise have the
opportunity. ***
