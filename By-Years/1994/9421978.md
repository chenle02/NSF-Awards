9421978 Singh This award is to purchase an ATM network which will be used for
several research projects: design of a platform for evaluating shared memories
and coherence protocols, networking research, image databases, and high
performance transaction processing. The proposed research on distributed shared
memories will extend an existing simulation and evaluation platform by providing
efficient interfaces, implementation of objects, fault tolerance, and simulation
using semantic information. The networking research will deal with a number of
critical issues in ATM network design, modeling, and applications: traffic
shaping, heterogeneous traffic modeling and measurement, the delivery of IP
traffic over ATM, and the design and construction of native-mode ATM protocol
stacks to support multimedia applications. The project on image databases will
explore efficient content-based image retrieval mechanisms with the help of
dynamic and adaptive index structures. The overall goal is to support efficient
similarity queries as well as to develop fast browsing techniques. Finally, the
proposed research on high performance transaction processing will implement and
study the performance of a shared nothing system using weak memories and data
partitioning techniques. ***
