relationships that exist between members of Congress and local media and their
effects on local media coverage. Content analysis of the stories pertaining to
Congress or its members in three types of local media across a variety of media
markets during election and nonelection years will show what is reported and how
it is framed. Interviews wil congressional press secretaries and local reporters
and editors will reveal the member-media interaction, which in conjunction with
news values and news gathering processes will be used to explain the content of
local media coverage of Congress. By allowing comparison of coverage across
media types and markets and between non election and election-year coverage,
this project is designed to fill major gaps in the literature on Congress and
the media. The findings will have significant implications for political
participation and political communication, showing whether or not local media
provide the kind of information that citizens need to hold their members of
Congress accountable and to participate effectively in democracy and the
circumstances in which local media are an effective means for members of
Congress to communicate with their constituents.
