This award will support collaborative research between Dr. David Loper of
Florida State University and Professor Ibrahim Eltayeb of Sultan Qaboos
University in Oman. By means of a series of working visits, Drs. Loper and
Eltayeb will undertake two projects in the broad areas of Applied Mathematics
and Fluid Dynamics. These projects involve analyzing the stability of certain
fluid motions that occur in a variety of natural settings including metallurgy
and geophysics. The proposed research projects are part of the fabric of current
scientific interest in the structure and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior,
and their successful completion will advance the state of our knowledge of the
Earth's core and mantle. An additional benefit of this project is that it will
help bolster scientific research in Oman, thereby strengthening the quality of
scientific and engineering education with the Sultanate. ***
