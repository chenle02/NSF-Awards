&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;--&lt;br/&gt;In this project, eight women will
be involved in field and laboratory research to determine the origin of glacial
deposits of Quaternary age in west-central Minnesota and late Paleozoic age in
western Sao Paulo state, Brazil. This research program will be founded upon a
long-running REU program based at UMM and a long-established collaborative
research effort between the University of Minnesota, Morris (UMM) and
Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP) faculty and students. In Minnesota, this
includes the continuation of closely related projects that have in common the
utilization of till analysis to determine the origin and glacial history of
problematic deposits including Tunnel Valley Eskers, a striated and faceted
Boulder Pavement and varied sediments of Glacial Lake Benson. In Brazil,
comparative analysis of Quaternary and Paleozoic sediments (diamictites and
varvites) and features (eskers, boulder pavements and wedge casts) allows
insight into the glacial history of paleoenvironments. &lt;br/&gt;
