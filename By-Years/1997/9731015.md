9731015 Winter This REU Site enables undergraduate students between their junior
and senior years to participate in biochemistry/molecular biology research.
Students are recruited nationwide with a good representation of diverse
geographical areas and minority students. They are assigned to mentors who are
active in research and are extramurally funded. Students also participate in a
series of classroom activities, including research talks by faculty and graduate
students and discussions of career choices, of ethical issues in science and
research, and of recent advances in the biological sciences. The overall goal is
to foster an understanding and appreciation of what biochemists and molecular
biologists do.
