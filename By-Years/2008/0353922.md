This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is supported by the
Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award
provides up to three-years of support for an REU Site at Drexel University. Ten
freshman and/or sophomore-level students will be recruited for a ten-week summer
experience in materials-related research. Students will have an opportunity to
do research in broad areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and advanced
materials. Student participants will collaborate as a member of a research team
and will have opportunity to participate in weekly research seminars by senior
investigators, weekly demonstrations of cutting-edge research equipment, and
field trips to nearby industrial and national research laboratories. It is
anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to
increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in
research-related careers. Students will specifically be recruited at an early
stage in their academic development as a way to motivate and propel them into
exciting careers in emerging fields of science and technology.
