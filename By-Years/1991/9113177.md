The use of geosynthetic materials in geotechnical engineering practice has
increased greatly during the past decade. Today, geosynthetic materials are used
for filtration, drainage, separation, soil reinforcement, seepage control, and
in many other applications. The primary objective of this research program is to
evaluate the dynamic interface shear properties of different geosynthetic soil
systems. The goals is to obtain needed information on the basic behavior and
performance of geosynthetic-soil systems, motivated by applications in
earthquake hazard mitigation, such as: base isolation from earthquake ground
shaking, earth slopes reinforced with geotextiles and geogrids, and geomembrane
lined canals, reservoirs, tunnels and hazardous waste containment landfills.
Attention is also addressed to the need for research and development of a
reliable testing procedure for dynamic interface properties.
