;DMS-0209504&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some impact of
topology on variational problems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we will
focus on variational problems involving vector- &lt;br/&gt;valued maps. In
particular, we will study upper and lower bounds of&lt;br/&gt;the energy
functional for maps with suitable topological information,&lt;br/&gt;the weak
sequential approximation of Sobolev maps by smooth maps and&lt;br/&gt;the
structure of singular sets for solutions of some variational&lt;br/&gt;problems.
Various tools from geometric measure theory and differential&lt;br/&gt;and
algebraic topology are used in handling these issues. On the
other&lt;br/&gt;hand, our approach to the problems sheds light on new relations
among&lt;br/&gt;these topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Variational problems
involving vector-valued maps appear naturally in &lt;br/&gt;analysis, geometry
and physics. Besides their mathematical interests and &lt;br/&gt;importance,
they are crucial to various models in mathematical physics. &lt;br/&gt;Typical
examples include models for superconductivity, magnetic material &lt;br/&gt;and
liquid crystals. The research in this area will lead to better
&lt;br/&gt;understanding of certain type of physics phenomenon as well as new
&lt;br/&gt;impetus in mathematics in this
direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
