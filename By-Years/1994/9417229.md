DePoy, Darren 94-17229 DePoy will determine the initial mass function for the
NGC 2024 star cluster by constructing a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the
cluster members and comparing their positions to pre-main sequence evolutionary
model tracks. Infrared spectra will be obtained and used to estimate
photospheric temperatures; infrared images will be obtained and used to estimate
luminosities. The study will include all stars in the cluster with masses
greater than about 0.4 solar masses, about 200-300 stars. ***
