Professor Phillips will investigate the concept of exponential rank in
C*-algebras. In particular he will (a) obtain a better understanding of the
exponential rank of algebras of matrix valued functions, and the possible
connections with real rank, (b) determine the exponential rank of stable
C*-algebras, and (c) further investigate the relation between real rank zero and
the property weak (FU). In addition Professor Phillips will investigate the
homotopy theory of inverse limits of C*-algebras. The notion of a C* algebra is
an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear transformations on a space.
These transformations can also be thought of as having values in the states of
the space, and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol *
is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in these states
are real numbers. The fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches
of mathematics and physics make them important to study.
