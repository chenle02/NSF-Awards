Oceanographic data collected in the lee of Hirase Seamount in Tokara Strait,
south of Japan, during 2021-2022 will be analyzed to investigate strong
nonlinear Kuroshio-seamount interactions and associated turbulence. The data
include highly resolved observations of temperature, salinity, velocity, and
turbulent dissipation measured from ship, moorings, and profiling float arrays.
The data will be used to identify the dominant nonlinear terms in the momentum
and buoyancy equations, quantify potential vorticity anomalies, and determine
the vertical and lateral instability mechanisms responsible for energetic
turbulence layers extending 20 km downstream of the seamount. Elucidating
turbulence generation mechanisms, especially in nonlinear wakes, is an essential
task to improve existing turbulent dissipation and mixing parameterizations, and
therefore has broad implication for the energy cascade, mass and nutrient
transports, and biogeochemical budgets in simulations and the ocean. This
project will provide support for early-career scientist Dr. Anda Vladoiu. All
APL-UW PIs are actively engaged in outreach at UW and local science centers and
Seattle K-12 classrooms. Lien also actively supports the summer program for UW
undergraduate students. Kunze is a Science Communication Fellow at the Pacific
Science Center in Seattle, which involves four volunteer Science Spotlight
activities per year, and participation in the annual Pacific Science Center-
Climate Curiosity Weekend, to introduce the general public to the meridional
overturning circulation and ocean turbulent mixing.

Strong interactions between the Kuroshio and Hirase Seamount produce a uniquely
nonlinear and turbulent regime that allows study outside the usual linear
internal-wave and balanced dynamics. Four-dimensional fine- and microstructure
surveys will be analyzed to investigate strong nonlinear Kuroshio-seamount
interactions and associated turbulence where Rossby numbers exceed 1 and
gradient Froude numbers are ùëÇ(1). Shipboard ADCP, underway CTD and underway VMP
radiator surveys, as well as four full-depth EM-APEX float box-arrays, provide
horizontal submesoscale (~ 1 km) and vertical finescale (~ 10 m) flow
structures. Two ADCP/CTD moorings provide 6-month time-series of the background
flow variability and shear- unstable layers. These data will be used to (i)
identify the dominant nonlinear terms in the momentum and buoyancy equations,
(ii) quantify potential vorticity (PV) anomalies and (iii) determine the
vertical and lateral instability mechanisms responsible for energetic turbulence
layers with diapycnal diffusivities ùêæ ‚àº 10‚àí2 m2 s‚àí1 extending 20 km downstream
of the seamount. The six-month long mooring time-series in the lee of the
seamount will allow the separation of subinertial and internal-wave fluctuations
to resolve possible time-space aliasing. These will generally improve
understanding of nonlinear flow-topography interactions in the ocean.
