This research proposal aims to develop theoretical and methodological tools to
improve error rate control and power for multiple hypothesis testing. The
centerpiece of the investigation is the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and its
important relative, the so-called positive FDR (pFDR). First, in order to
evaluate rejected nulls or discoveries more objectively, the PI will develop
methods to estimate the pFDR for multiple testing as well as methods to set
criteria for test statistics in order to make sure they have enough information
to attain desired pFDR control. Second, the PI will develop FDR control based on
multivariate statistics. Although using multivariate statistics for multiple
testing is widely seen in many areas, there has been little work on this topic
in the current literature on FDR control. The PI will develop different FDR
controlling procedures that incorporate multivariate statistics and investigate
how to combine the information in the statistics effectively in order to achieve
pFDR control with optimal power.

Multiple hypothesis testing provides a statistical foundation for massive data
analysis and knowledge finding in a wide range of areas of modern science and
technology, including neuroscience, brain imaging, genomics and imagery
processing. A fundamental challenge in these areas is to obtain true discoveries
while avoiding false discoveries. The project will generate various tools to
reach this goal. It will enable researchers to evaluate discoveries more
carefully and to avoid potential pitfalls in their data collection and analysis.
Moreover, it will provide researchers with a large collection of statistical
methods to find true discoveries more efficiently.
