9615647 Feenstra This project addresses fundamental research issues of atomic
geometry and electronic band structure of II-VI and III-nitride materials
configured as heterostructures with GaAs. The approach utilizes detailed
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements along with computer simulation
to model strain, strain relaxation, and electronic band structure. By coupling
strain and critical points of the electronic bands, the PI strives for
correlation and interpretation of STM images in terms of geometric
configurations and electronic properties with the capability to differentiate
between alloy constituents and band offsets of adjoining heterostructure layers.
%%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of
materials science having high technological relevance. The research will
contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important
aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry. Additionally,
the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected
to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices
and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing
and producing improved materials, and materials combinations. An important
feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the
training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
