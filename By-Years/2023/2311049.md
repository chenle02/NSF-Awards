This grant will make it possible for 13 graduate students and 6 early career
faculty to attend the 12th International Conference on Biomolecular Engineering
(ICBE) to be held in Santa Barbara, CA on January 8-11, 2023. Biomolecular
engineering utilizes powerful and versatile tools for advancing science and
engineering in applications ranging from the design of new biocatalysts to
directing microbiomes to identify and destroy viral and microbial pathogens. The
ICBE conference series was initiated in 2007 to foster interaction among
academic, national laboratory, and industrial molecular researchers developing
and applying molecular engineering methods. This conference will feature 24
plenary speakers, three keynote speakers, and a poster session. With no parallel
sessions, the meeting structure is designed to encourage interaction between
established and early career researchers and promote mentoring of the latter.
Also, the selection of invited speakers represents a high level of diversity.

The organizing theme of the conference is the question: How can biomolecular
engineering address grand challenges in healthcare, energy and the environment?
Biomolecular engineering provides the potential to revolutionize many different
industries and positively impact of society. For example, advances in
biomolecular engineering are aimed at developing more efficient and sustainable
methods of producing food, fuels, and chemicals. In the medical field,
biomolecular engineering has led to the development of new drugs, diagnostic
tests, and therapies that can help treat and cure diseases. Additionally,
biomolecular engineering has the potential to help address global challenges
such as climate change and the need for clean energy. The Division of Chemical,
Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (ENG/CBET), and the
Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (BIO/MCB) contributed funds to
this award.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader
impacts review criteria.
