This project is for the support of undergraduate student participation in
ongoing research programs in the Department of Physics. Currently, the
Department has programs in the areas of astrophysics, astronomy, atomic physics,
high energy and elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, solid state and
condensed matter physics, and theoretical physics. The project is including
promising undergraduate students from academic institutions within 300 miles of
South Bend. Available for the students, depending on the program selected, are
advanced computing facilities, machine shop services, library privileges, and
research equipment. This project is supported under the Program of Research
Experiences for Undergraduates to help ensure an adequated supply of scientists
for the future.
