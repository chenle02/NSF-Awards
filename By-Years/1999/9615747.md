Conceiving society as a complex nonlinear system of interacting individuals,
dynamic social impact theory explores how individual experience and social
influence lead to the regional differentiation and temporal evolution of all
forms of culture (including scientific knowledge). Changes in the attributes
(e.g. beliefs, practices, theories) of spatially-distributed individuals
resulting from the interactive, reciprocal, and recursive operation of social
influence processes can be modeled through computer simulation, using dynamic
social impact theory, a simple but very general model of social influence.
Surprisingly, several macro-level phenomena can be predicted to emerge from the
operation of these micro-level processes, including a consolidation with reduced
diversity, a clustering into spatially coherent subgroups, a correlation of
initially unrelated positions on different issues, and often, a continuing
diversity, as minority clusters protect each other from exposure to outside
influence. Empirical research with people interacting in electronic mail
networks, in lecture halls, and in dormitories will test these predictions and
extend them to new arenas. This research will contribute to understanding the
complex interaction between individual psychological processes and social
outcomes in groups ranging in size from families and other small groups to
organizations, communities, scientific disciplines, and even nations. Concepts
and procedures developed in this research should be applicable to understanding
the historical development of regional and disciplinary differences in customs,
values, and beliefs, both constructive and maladaptive, and such elusive
phenomena as fads, social movements, consumer confidence, national character,
and public opinion. The research will also have implications for predicting both
positive and negative consequences of the increasing use of electronic
communication in workgroups and society.
