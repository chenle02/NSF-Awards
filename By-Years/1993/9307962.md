9307962 Golin In yeast, mutations in about ten genes bring about either hyper-
resistance or hypersensitivity to a broad spectrum of drugs. Previous genetic
analysis has suggested that these phenotypes are due to alterations in a
putative trans-membrane protein pump and the gene products that regulate it. The
experiments in the present project have several goals. First, biochemical
studies are being carried out which should establish whether drug resistance in
mutants is indeed due to drug efflux. Second, genetic studies are being done
which will clarify whether there is a second pumping mechanism with different
drug specificites as implied by previous work. Finally, simple experiments which
might clarify whether these trans-membrane pumps have other roles in the cell
besides drug export are being conducted. %%% The research has implications for
clinical problems such as the rise of multiply-drug-resistant yeast and
tuberculosis infections. ***
