9625685 Salas In view of several recent severe weather events, such as the 1993
Mississippi River floods and the 1995 Rhine River floods, this project will re-
examine the design criteria of hydraulic structures for withstanding extreme
hydrologic episodes and will re-evaluate the capacity of these structures, such
as levees and spillways, for managing excesses or scarcity of water. The
research project will analyze the concepts and the computations used to
determine return periods and risk of failure for complex hydrological processes
involving time-dependence nd non- stationarity. Both extremes of floods and
droughts will be examined including uncertainties of estimates. The stochastic
models to be used will remove these constraints and actual data will be used in
the analytical and computer simulation work. Results from this research will
make a significant contribution to the management of flood risk and drought
episodes. ***
