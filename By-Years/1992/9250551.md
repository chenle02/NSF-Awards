RIT is establishing an automated observatory on the campus for use in
undergraduate instruction of non-science students, Physics majors, and Imaging
Science majors. The observatory is equipped for visual, photometric, and CCD
imaging use, and it can be operated manually or through real-time computer
control from various lecture and laboratory rooms located about campus. It will
also be capable of robotic control to maximize its use for projects associated
with the upper-division courses where there is a need for an additional student
research facility. The specific choice of an automated (versus conventional)
facility is a key to the "Herculean" task of bringing telescopic observations of
a sufficient variety to large numbers of undergraduates. The robotic
capabilities are also in concert with a nationwide effort to enhance science
education through astronomy.
