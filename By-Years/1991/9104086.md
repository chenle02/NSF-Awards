This project is concerned with the use of artificial nanostructures as a tool to
study the growth, interface structure and stability of amorphous and crystalline
semiconductors. The research will address structure, structural relaxation,
atomic diffusion and crystallization of tetrahedrally-based amorphous
semiconductor materials (amorphous silicon and related materials). In addition
the growth and properties of amorphous silicon and related thin films with
particular emphasis on the relationship between structure and electronic
properties. The techniques to be utilized include: 1) Raman scattering (useful
for the study of local bonding and order); 2) x-ray reflectivity (useful for the
study of density, interface roughness and interdiffusion); 3) optical absorption
and photoconductivity (sensitive to the electronic charge in the layers and
interfaces). The analysis of the data from these different techniques requires
different sets of assumptions about materials and their structure.
Nanostructured semiconductor-based materials are important technologically for
photoelectronic detectors and arrays, field effect display drivers, photovoltaic
devices, optical modulation and non-linear optical devices as well as catalysts
and catalyst supports for commercial reactions.
