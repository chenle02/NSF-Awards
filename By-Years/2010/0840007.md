Greenberg intends to photograph the IceCube Neutrino Observatory as part of a
larger project about high energy physics, supported by a grant from the Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation. For this project he already has photographed at CERN in
Switzerland, DESY in Germany, Triumf in Canada, and Fermilab, Brookhaven,
Stanford and LIGO in the United States. He also has worked in Japan and the
Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. Greenberg?s earlier projects?which
reached a large segment of the population through books, exhibitions, radio and
television?opened up a door to places normally inaccessible to the public at
large. As with his earlier projects, about urban infrastructure and construction
of contemporary architecture, Greenberg hopes to introduce readers and viewers
to something essential, but taken for granted. This particular project is about
how the universe works, or at the very least, about how scientists try to find
out about the universe. It is also about how science is done, and how
cooperative a venture it has become. Although Greenberg?s work does not usually
portray people, the text in the book and exhibition will fully describe the
workings of each experiment and include some writing about the community of
physicists. Greenberg also intends to include images of the South Pole Telescope
in this portfolio.
