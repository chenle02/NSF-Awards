This project continues collaborative research between astronomers and
statisticians with the objective of developing specifically useful statistical
procedures for the analysis of multivariate data sets that arise in
observational astronomy. It addresses the statistical problems of estimation of
a bivariate distribution function under random censoring, censored regression,
testing for multivariate normality under random censoring and a new analysis for
statistical independence. Statistical analysis can elucidate astrophysical
processes which are detectable only from data obtained from a sample of
celestial objects. Using modern statistical theory and methodology, some of the
obscuring distortions which are inevitable in such data can be "removed" to make
the most physically meaningful relations more apparent. For example, the
relations between luminosity, size, rotation and metallicity in elliptical
galaxies can be examined and described. This collaborative research focuses on
the development of new methods that carry the potential for major advances in
both statistics and astronomy.
