This research overlaps the areas of combinatorics, representation theory and
homological algebra. A fundamental aspect is the use of supercomputers.
Algorithms are designed that use a mix of algebraic and combinatorial methods.
The results of these computations give valuable insight into the solutions of
the ongoing research problems described now. The first problem is to compute the
Lie algebra cohomology of the tensor product of a finite dimensional complex Lie
algebra L with a certain polynomial quotient ring. If L is semisimple, a
solution to this problem would imply the Macdonald root-system conjectures.
Partial results and strong computer evidence points to a complete solution when
L is either semisimple or nilpotent. The second problem is to determine the
algebra structure of the symplectic and orthogonal centralizer algebras defined
by Richard Brauer. These algebras are fundamental to the representation theory
of the symplectic and orthogonal groups and are rich in combinatorial structure.
Again, strong computer evidence and partial results suggest that a complete
solution to this structure problem will have and elegant combinatorial
statement. This research investigates the combinatorial structure of algebraic
problems. Many of these questions can be described as determining certain
coefficients of certain polynomials which on the one hand are defined in a
complicated algebraic way but on the other hand have a simple combinatorial
interpretation. Hanlon has in his short career become one of the world's leading
authorities on this important subject. His use of the supercomputers to aid this
work is very innovative. His research will certainly have the most profound
affect.
