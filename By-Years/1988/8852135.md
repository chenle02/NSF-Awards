The mechanical engineering students at this institution need additional
exposure to computer-based engineering system and to the various stages of
design, analysis, drafting, and manufacturing. This project provides an
integrated computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software package,
precision graphics workstations, and a numerically-controlled vertical milling
machine. This instrumentation is used as part of the required design-oriented
mechanical engineering courses and associated electives. The students learn how
to realistically simulate product performance in the initial design stage before
committing to detailed drawings and manufacturing. This project creates a real-
life computer-oriented design environment for the mechanical engineering
students and make available a basic educational tool for general use in other
disciplines. This award is being matched by an equal sum from the grantee.
