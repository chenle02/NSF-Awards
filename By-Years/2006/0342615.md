Job Scheduling for Data Centers with Multi-Level Storage
Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many fields of
science, engineering, and medicine, data is being collected and generated at an
increasing rate, due to high-resolution measurements made possible by advanced
sensor technologies and large scale simulations enabled by inexpensive, high-
performance computing through commodity PC clusters. In order to support the
data management and processing requirements of data driven science, research
institutions and supercomputing centers will not only host, manage, and provide
access to computing resources but also will deploy high-end, Grid-enabled data
centers.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop the scheduling
technologies to provide efficient access to shared resources on large scale
storage systems with multi-level storage hierarchies. We plan to design,
implement and evaluate scheduling approaches for job schedulers that will
control the access to and sharing of resources and that will support high
throughput and interactive responses for many simultaneous data analysis and
computing jobs on large storage systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
