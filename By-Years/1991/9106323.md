Cyanobacteria that are not di-nitrogen "fixing" will be studied in terms of the
dynamics of nitrogen metabolism as related to the unique nitrogen storage
polymer, cyanophycin, during normal growth conditions as well as in conditions
where nitrogen limitation or repletion exist. NMR spectroscopy using N-15 and
P-31 will be a principal analytical tool to study N metabolism in vivo and to
monitor the metabolic state of cells during shifts from one environmental state
to another. The studies are expected to lead to a better understanding of gene
regulation in this group of environmentally significant procaryotes particularly
in terms of the interactions of metabolic controls and environmental
conditions.//
