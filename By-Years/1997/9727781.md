9727781 Edwards As part of A Change of Course evaluation, NFIE will document
successful innovations of individual and small groups of teachers who
participate in long term reform efforts. The NFIE team has constructed a four
phase model of the change process. These phases tend to be overlapping and
dynamic rather than linear. Phase I incubation-a period of time during which new
ideas are developing among a small group in the setting; Phase 2 Small scale
application-a time period during which a small group of people are trying out
the ideas in a fairly isolated situation; Phase 3 Transition to broad
application-a time where conditions are getting aligned to support movement from
a few isolated applications to widespread use; and Phase 4 Broad-baed
application-a time where the innovation is widely used and accepted. NFIE will
document and analyze Phase 3 experiences of sites engaged in the reform of
professional development. This study will investigate and document how teachers
have progressed through his process enabling the formation of a model of
innovation based around professional development. ***
