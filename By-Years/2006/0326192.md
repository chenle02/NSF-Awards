Intellectual Merit: This proposal seeks partial funding in support of a Joint
Society Conference on Diversity in the Earth and Space Sciences, to be convened
in June 2003. The American Geophysical Union has recently begun a new initiative
to work on increasing the participation of women and minorities in the Earth and
space sciences. The challenges associated with making progress on this problem
are large and varied, and thus it is essential that AGU's diversity-related
programs be fully coordinated with similar programs provided by other scientific
societies that support these fields. This conference will help to identify
existing programs, programmatic gaps, and allow an honest dialog about which
strategies are most effective. Further, AGU feels that a collaborative
"coalition" effort by the societies can have even greater impact than parallel
efforts of individual societies, and this conference offers an important first
step toward establishing this coalition.
