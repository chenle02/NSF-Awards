The prime goal of this research is to understand the performance characteristics
of fundamental algorithms that are likely to be broadly applicable.
Considerations include analytic techniques that can result in precise
performance predictions and essential characteristics of specific
implementations and their likely impact in practical applications. A goal is to
be able to make intelligent choices among existing algorithms for the same task
and to have a reasonable basis for developing new, better algorithms. Visual
presentations of information can be an important tool in the study of
algorithms. The emphasis in this project is on exploiting recent developments in
printing technology to enable the design of information-rich visual
representations that can effectively exhibit essential properties of algorithms,
and on using such representations as an integral part of an ongoing research
program in the design and analysis of combinatorial algorithms.//
