The project will explore seven explicit conjectures in three broad areas of
probabilistic analysis of algorithms, empirical processes and random graphs.
Several connections between these apparently different areas will be clarified
and used in the solutions of the conjectures. Karp's probabilistic polynomial
time algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, leads to considerations of
random graphs with special properties. Thus the central limit theorem and the
large deviation theory of the traveling salesman problem have connections with
quantities of interest in the random graph theory such as minimal spanning
trees, and minimal matchings. Some of the new techniques used include the theory
of Sobolov inequalities and the Efron-Stein inequality. Theory of random trees
is developed by putting specific probability distributions on the trees with n
vertices. It will be shown that the use of Harper's method leads to a richer
theory of random trees. Harper's method in turn leads to connections with the
empirical process of lines. The novelty of the research is its problem-driven
approach and the elucidation and exploitation of the interconnections of
seemingly divergent fields.
