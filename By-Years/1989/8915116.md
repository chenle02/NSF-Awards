The objective of the award is to provide partial financial support for the
International Conference on Modulation Spectroscopy to be held March 17-21,
1990, in San Diego, California. The funds from the National Science Foundation
will be used for travel expenses for both domestic and foreign scientists and
engineers to attend and participate in the conference. Topics to be emphasized
at the conference include: physics and properties of artificially produced
materials such as single and multiple quantum wells, delta-doped layers of
materials, heterojunctions and superlattices, physics of two- dimensional
electron gas, effects of pressure, temperature, electric and magnetic fields,
in-situ studies of materials processing, application to electronic devices, etc.
The goal of the conference is to assemble the top scientists and engineers in
the world having knowledge of modulation spectroscopy for the purposes of
exchange of results from research, and definition of future opportunities and
barriers to progress in research in the field.
