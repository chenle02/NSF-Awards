This proposal concerns a number of important topics in the fluid dynamics of
ocean waves revolving around the central concept of wave-wave and wave-solid
interactions. Specifically the proposer will study wave reflection on a sloping
beach, parametrically excited edge waves, axisymmetric cross-waves, resonant
interactions and Wilton's ripples, and the tidal equations of Laplace with
regard to the coupling between surface and internal tides. The study of ocean
waves has a long and venerable history, and it remains today a vitally important
area of research that includes the motion of ships through water, the diurnal
tidal motions, and structures. This proposal will involve looking into the
underlying mathematics and physics of these phenomena; the understanding gained
from this research will have genuine technological significance.
