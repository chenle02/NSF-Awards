The objective of Dr. Walsh's work is to understand how synthesis of the more
than 200 different proteins which make up the flagellar apparatus is regulated
during the differentiation of Naegleria gruberi amebae into flagellates. He has
been investigating this question using four classes of cDNA clones specific to
differentiating cells, the DS clones, which represent proteins of the flagellar
apparatus. The current proposal attempts to answer the question: how is
transcription of the DS genes regulated? The approach involves a comparison of
the DS genes and genes for mRNAs that are present in both amebae and flagellates
(NS genes). This analysis will begin with sequencing recently isolated genomic
clones for the four DS genes and 2 NS genes. The functional significance of the
resulting sequence information will then be evaluated using DNase
hypersensitivity to define regions of the DS chromatin which change during
changes in their transcription, followed by a nucleotide level analysis of
selected regions of the DS and NS genes using "photofootprinting". Dr. Walsh
also plans to develop a transfection system for Naegleria in order to test
hypotheses about gene regulation developed from the structural analysis. The
differentiation of the amebae of Naegleria gruberi into swimming flagellates is
a dramatic example of the structural changes that can occur in organisms in
response to environmental stimulae. As such it represents an excellent model
system in which to study the regulation of differentiation.
