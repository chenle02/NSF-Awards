California State University @ Los Angeles will initiate a 4.5-week, commuter
Young Scholars project in Mathematics for 50 students entering grades 10-12.
Participants will study group theory, number theory and computer applications of
these topics. In addition to attending lectures and presentations, students will
work on problem sets, engage in library preparation for the careers being
discussed, participate in field trips to local university and industry sites,
and write two essays on relevant philosophical/ethical and career-related
questions that have been raised.
