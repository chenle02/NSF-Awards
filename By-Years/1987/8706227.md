Research on distant radio galaxy samples will be continued. The primary research
objectives are to complete the morphologic, photometric, and spectroscopic
studies on the remaining faint radio galaxies in the third Cambridge Radio
Survey (3CR) samples and to approach that excellent level of completion for the
1 Jansky flux radio sources. These sources are 6 - 10 times weaker than
previously observed sources and are mainly galaxies. The large redshift range
covered is up to a redshift of z approximately 1.8. Further exploration of young
galaxies, which are luminous and "almost-pristine" narrow hydrogen Lyman-alpha
line emitters with redshift z greater than 1.5 will also be included. The
impetus for this research is the discoveries of the quasi-stellar object (QSO)
companion PKS1614+051B at a redshift z = 3.21, and 3C3326.1, a likely large
galaxy in formation, seen at a redshift of z = 1.825.
