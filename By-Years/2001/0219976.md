Title: Simulation-Based Operations Planning for Regional Transportation Systems

This grant will support the development and application of high performance
modeling and simulation techniques and tools to design and manage regional
transportation systems. Tools will be developed to integrate forecasted travel
demands with detail micro-level simulation of the transportation infrastucture;
the intention is to enable more reliable projections of transportation system
behavior. A reservation system will be developed to help manage traveler
demands, rather than simply responding to individual traveler's priorities.
